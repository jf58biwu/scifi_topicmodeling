 Senators , consider the opportunities for the Empire . At last the destinies of the planets Romulus and Remus will be united . Shinzon of Remus offers us a chance to make ourselves stronger than ever . It would be madness to reject it . I beg you not to let prejudice or politics interfere with this alliance . By joining Shinzon 's forces with ours , not even the Federation - will be able to stand in our way ... - Enough ! The decision is made . The military does not dictate policy on RomuIus . The Senate has considered Shinzon 's proposal and rejected it . He and his followers will be met with force and sent back to their black rock ! - Do I make myself clear ? - Yes , sir . Praetor , I have an appointment with the ThoIian ambassador . Of course . Senators , are there any others who wish to speak ? Then I call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with CeIes II . The Reman mines have not been filling their quotas . Consider the trade committee 's findings . As much as we don 't want ... Someone alert security ! Bring back Senator TaI 'Aura ! Duty . A starship captain 's life is filled with solemn duty . I have commanded in battle , negotiated peace between impIacabIe enemies . I have represented the Federation in first contact with 27 alien species . But none of this compares with my solemn duty today as best man . Now , on an occasion such as this , it is expected that I be gracious and fulsome in my praise on the wonders of this blessed union . But have the two of you considered what you are doing to me ? You 're happy , but what about my needs ? This is all a damned inconvenience . while you 're settling in on the Titan , I will be training my new first officer . You know him . He 's a tyrannical martinet who will never , ever allow me to go on away missions ! That is the regulation , sir . StarfIeet Code , section 1 2 ... - Data . - Sir ? - Shut up . - Yes , sir . 1 5 years I 've been waiting to say that . No , seriously , will , Deanna , there 's still time to reconsider . Yes ? - No . - No ? Very well , then . will Riker , you have been my trusted right arm for 1 5 years . You have kept my course true and steady . Deanna Troi , you have been my guide and my conscience . You have helped me recognise the better parts of myself . You are my family . In maritime tradition I wish you both clear horizons . My good friends , make it so . The bride and groom ! You ever think about marrying again ? No , 23 was my limit . Worf ? - Are you all right ? - RomuIan ale should be illegal . It is . - A lovely toast . - It was from the heart . Don 't worry . I 'II brief your new counsellor on everything she has to know . Like hell you are ! You already know too much about me . I take it there 'II be no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed ? No , no speeches and no clothes . Ladies and gentlemen and invited transgendered species , in Terran and Betazoid conjugaI rites , I 've discovered it is traditional to present the happy couple with a gift . Given Commander Riker 's affection for archaic musical forms , I have elected to present the following as my gift , in honour of their conjugation . Never saw the sun shining so bright Never saw things going so right Noticing the days hurrying by When you 're in love , my , how they fly ! - Blue skies , smiling at me - Irving berlin ! Nothing but blue skies do I see ... It 's tradition , Worf . - You should appreciate that . - I will not do it ! - Won 't do what , Mr Worf ? - Captain , I think it inappropriate for a starfleet officer to appear ... naked . Come , a strapping fellow like you ? What can you be afraid of ? I 'm picking up an odd electromagnetic signature from the KoIarin system . - What sort of signature ? - Positronic . It 's very faint but I 've isolated it to the third planet in the KoIarin system . - What do we know ? - Uncharted . - We 'II have to get closer for more detail . - Theories ? Positronic signatures are only known to emanate from androids . It is logical to theorise there is an android on KoIarus III . Just what I feared . Captain ? Diverting there takes us close to the romulan neutral Zone . It 's still well on our side . I think it 's worth a look . Don 't worry , Number One . - We 'II have you to Betazed in time . - Thank you , sir . Where we will all honour the Betazoid tradition . Now , if you 'II excuse me , I 'II be in the gym . Mr Branson , lay in a course for the KoIarin system , warp five . What do you think , Data ? A Iong-Iost relative ? I read six distinct positronic signatures , spread out over a few kilometres . - What about the population ? - isolated pockets of humanoids . It appears to be a pre-warp civilisation in early industrial development . I wouldn 't recommend the transporter . That ion storm doesn 't look neighbourIy . - It could head our way without warning . - Understood . - Data , Mr Worf , you 're with me . - I needn 't remind you ... I appreciate your concern , Number One , but I 've been itching to try the Argo . I 'II bet . Captain 's prerogative . There 's no foreseeable danger . And your wife wouldn 't forgive me if anything happened to you . You have the bridge ... Mr Troi . I am puzzled by the human predilection for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities . Over that rise , sir , half a kilometre . The electromagnetic field is disrupting my tricorder . - We 're within metres of the signal . - Fan out . Let 's search around . - It appears to be a robotic arm . - Very astute . Bring it to the vehicle . This doesn 't feel right . The final signature is 1 00 metres north . - It 's you . - The resemblance is striking . Fascinating . To the vehicle ! I think it 's time to try some unsafe velocities . Why do you have a shiny head ? - Conversation isn 't appropriate . - Why ? - The captain has to concentrate . - Why ? - Because ... - Data ! Sorry , sir . Have I said something wrong ? You know , all things considered , Data , I think you have nicer eyes . Our eyes are identical , Doctor . - So what have we got , Geordi ? - well his mechanics are like Data 's , with less positronic development . The neural pathways aren 't as sophisticated . I 'd say he 's a prototype . Something Dr Soong created prior to Data . - Do you have a name , sir ? - I am ... B-4 . B-4 ? Dr Soong 's penchant for whimsical names has no end . How did you come to be where we found you ? - I do not know . - Do you remember anything of your life ? No . Why does the tail man have a furry face ? Number One , keep me informed , and Geordi , reassemble him . - B-4 , do you know who I am ? - You are me . No . My name is Data . I am your brother . Tea , earl Grey , hot . An Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command for you , Captain . acknowledged . admiral Janeway , good to see you . Jean-Luc . How would you like a trip to Romulus ? - With or without the fleet ? - A diplomatic mission . We 're invited , believe it or not . There 's been an internal political shake up . The new Praetor , Shinzon , has requested a Federation envoy . - New Praetor ? - Here 's more . He 's Reman . Believe me , we don 't understand it either . You 're the closest ship . Go and hear what he has to say . Get the lay of the land . An unstable Empire could mean trouble for the quadrant . - Understood . - We 're sending you all our intelligence . But it 's not much. I don 't need to tell you to watch your back . - hardly . - The Son 'a , the Borg , the Romulans ... you get all the easy assignments . - Just lucky , admiral . - Let 's hope it holds . Janeway out . HeImsman , lay in a new course . Take us to RomuIus . Warp eight . Course laid in . - RomuIus ? - The opal Sea will have to wait . Engage . As you can see , one side of Remus always faces the sun . Due to the extreme temperatures on that half , the Remans live on the dark side . little is known of the Reman homeworId , although scans have revealed diIithium mining and heavy weapons construction . The Remans themselves are considered an undesirable caste in the Empire . They 're said to be formidable warriors . In the Dominion War , Reman troops were used as assault forces . - Cannon fodder . - How did a Reman get to be Praetor ? - I don 't get it . - RomuIan collaborators ? - Coup d 'Ã©tat ? - The Praetor 's power is their fleet . They must have been behind Shinzon . What have we learned about Shinzon ? only a part of his military record . He is young and a capable commander . He won 1 2 major engagements in the war . - Beyond that , we know nothing . - well , we 're sailing into the unknown . Keep at it . Give me anything you can . Dismissed . I still can 't believe the captain went along with a memory download . He agrees that the B-4 probably has the same seIf-actuaIisation parameters as myself . If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix , - he should have all my abilities . - He 'd have all your memories as well . - You feel comfortable with that ? - I feel nothing , Geordi . With my memory engrams , he will be able to be a more complete individual . - An individual more like you , you mean ? - Yes . Maybe he 's not supposed to be like you . Maybe he 's supposed to be as he is . That might be so , but he should have the opportunity to explore his potential . OK , we 're done . - B-4 , do you know where you are ? - I am in a room with lights . Remember our father ? - Our father ? - Yes , Dr Soong . - No . - Do you know the name of the captain ? No . Data , he 's assimiIating a Iot of programming . He 's a Iot less sophisticated than you . We don 't know if his matrix will be able to adapt . We need to give him time . Geordi , what purpose does this serve ? - What ? - This . A redundant memory port . Maybe the provisional storage is in case his neural pathways overload . Mind if I keep him here ? Run a few diagnostics ? I do not mind . - Data ! - No . Remain with Commander La Forge . He will try to help you . Captain 's log : Stardate 56844.9 . The Enterprise has arrived at Romulus and waits at the designated coordinates . All our hails have gone unanswered . We 've been waiting for 17 hours . - counsellor ? - They 're out there , sir . - Captain ! Recommend we raise shields . - Not yet , Mr Worf . With due respect to diplomatic protocol , the Federation council isn 't here . - We are . - Patience . diplomacy is very exacting . - We will wait . - Captain ... - shields ! - No ! - Captain ... - tactical ! 52 disruptor banks , 27 photon torpedo bays , primary and secondary shields . She 's a predator . We 're being hailed . On screen . Enterprise , we are the Reman warbird , Scimitar . - Praetor Shinzon , I 'm pleased to ... - l am not Shinzon . I am his viceroy . We are sending transport coordinates . - Not very chatty . - Away Team , transporter room four . I hope you 'll forgive the darkness . We are not comfortable in the light . - Praetor Shinzon ? - Captain Picard . Jean-Luc Picard . I 'd always imagined you taller . Isn 't that odd ? You may scan me without subterfuge , Commander Data . - You are not as we imagined you . - No ? You 're human . Why have you asked us to come here ? Praetor ? - I 've never met a human woman before . - I 'm only half human . Deanna Troi , of Betazed . Empathic and telepathic abilities , ship 's counsellor . AII this I knew . But I never knew you were so beautiful . You 're quite familiar with our personnel . I am , Commander Riker . May I touch your hair ? We came to RomuIus on a matter we were assured was of great importance . If you have anything to say to us as Federation representatives , do it now . Yes , I 'm sorry , Captain . There is so much we need to talk about . - I would be interested to know what . - Unity , Captain ! Tearing down the walls between us to recognise that we are one . I 'm talking of the thing that makes us the same . Peace . We want peace . You 're thinking this all sounds too good to be true , but that the chance for peace is too promising to ignore . I 'm right ? - Yes . - Perhaps it 's time to add illumination . Computer , raise the lighting four levels . When I was young I had an odd disease . I developed a hyper-sensitivity to sound . Even a whisper caused me agony . No one could do anything . finally I was taken to a doctor with experience of Terran illnesses . And he diagnosed ShaIaft 's Syndrome ... Do you know of it , Captain ? Yes . Then you know it 's a very rare syndrome . Genetic . apparently , all the male members of a family have it . eventually I was treated and now I can hear as well as you can , Captain . I can see as well as you can . I can feel everything you feel . In fact , I feel exactly what you feel . Don 't I , Jean-Luc ? Come to dinner tomorrow on RomuIus . Just the two of us . Or should I say , just the one of us ? I think you 'II be wanting this . until tomorrow then , Captain . We have much to discuss . Computer , return lighting to previous level . There 's no doubt . Right down to your strain of ShaIaft 's Syndrome . He 's a clone . They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell . - Why ? - I intend to find out , Number One . Inform StarfIeet of the situation . I need to know where the hell he came from . counsellor . We supported you , Shinzon , when you assassinated the Senate . You told us the timing was perfect to attack the Federation . Why the delay ? You don 't have to understand . Why bring the Enterprise here ? - I have a purpose . - Then enlighten us . silence , RomuIan ! You must learn patience , Commander . Spend 1 8 hours every day under the lash of a romulan guard and you 'II soon understand patience . Now go . Commander Donatra . Remain . There 's a word I want you to consider . allegiance . It 's something I demand from those who serve me . - Do I serve you ? - Yes ... And I think faithfully . Commander Suran , on the other hand , gives me pause . Here 's another word , Praetor . Trust . Do you trust me ? How far does that trust extend ? How deep does it go ? What must a commander do to prove herself faithful ? What must a woman do ? You are not a woman . You are a romulan . Serve me faithfully and you will be rewarded . Keep those lovely eyes on Commander Suran . And at the first sign of treachery ... Dispose of him . Then you will have proven yourself . Now go . Commander ! If you ever touch me again I 'II kill you . The RomuIans had gained possession of your DNA and created me . And when I was ready , they were going to replace you with me . Put a romulan agent at the heart of starfleet . It was a bold plan . - What happened ? - As happens frequently on RomuIus , a new government came to power and abandoned the plan . They were afraid I 'd be discovered and that it wouId lead to war . - Not quite the face you remember . - Not quite . A lifetime of violence will do that . They broke my nose , my jaw . But so much is the same . The eyes . - surely you recognise the eyes ? - Yes . Our eyes reflect our lives , don 't they ? And yours are so confident . - So I 'm not as tall as you expected ? - I 'd always hoped I might hit two metres . As had I. How did you end up on Remus ? They sent me there to die . How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines ? Not that it mattered , as I was no Ionger part of their plans against the Federation . In those terrible depths lived only the damned . along with the Reman slaves , I was condemned to unceasing labour and starvation under the brutal heel of the romulan guards . only the strongest had any hope of survival . I was only a child when they took me . I didn 't see the sun or the stars for ten years . The only thing the romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me . But one man took pity on me , the man that became my viceroy and protected me from the guards ' cruelty . He taught me how to survive . And in that dark place , where there was nothing of myself , I found my Reman brothers . They showed me the only kindness I 've ever known . - This is all to liberate the Remans ? - The single thought behind all I 've done . From secretly building the Scimitar to assembling my army . finally coming to RomuIus , in force . I knew they 'd never give us freedom . - I would have to take it ! - But how many RomuIans died for it ? Too many . But finally the Empire is realising that there is a better way . And that way is peace . - You don 't trust me . - I have no reason to . You have every reason . If you had lived my Iife , and experienced the suffering of my people , you 'd be standing where I am . If you 'd lived mine , you 'd understand my responsibility to the Federation . I cannot allow my personal feelings to unduly influence my decisions . AII I have are my personal feelings ! I want to know what being human means . The Remans gave me a future . - You can tell me about my past . - I can tell you about mine . - Were we Picards always warriors ? - I think of myself as an explorer . well , were we always explorers ? I was the first Picard to leave our system . It caused quite a stir in the family , but I 'd spent my youth ... Looking at the stars , dreaming about what was up there , about ... New worlds . I 'm trying to believe you . If there is one ideal the Federation holds most dear , it is that all men , all races , can be united . What better example ? A StarfIeet captain standing in the romulan Senate . Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friendship . In time . When trust has been earned . - Sir , the main computer was accessed . - Source ? It 'II take time to figure out . The data stream was re-routed all over the ship . - What was accessed ? - That 's what I can 't figure out . It 's mostly basic stellar cartography : star charts , protocols , colony upIinks . - It 's not even restricted material . - We must still learn the source . Captain , there 's something else . I was reviewing the sensor logs . Look ! When the Scimitar de-cIoaked , there was a spike in the tertiary EM band . You 're not going to believe this . It 's ThaIaron . - I thought ThaIaron radiation was theory . - That 's why initial scans missed it . He 's got it . Research was banned in the Federation because ThaIaron is biogenic . It can consume organic material at the subatomic level . I can 't overestimate the danger of ThaIaron radiation . A microscopic amount could kill all of us in seconds . Understood . I want to know what he has and how we can neutralise any threat . I need options . This was a mistake . We 're wasting time . My time . And I 'II spend it how I choose . Do not forget our mission , Shinzon . We must act . Now ! We 'II return to the Scimitar . I was merely curious about him . Come . Come in . Remember him ? - He was a bit cocky as I recall . - He was a damned fool . selfish . Ambitious . Very much in need of seasoning . He turned out all right . I really wanted to believe Shinzon . But this ThaIaron radiation just can 't be explained away . Whatever he 's after , it isn 't peace . Is he very much the way you were ? Oh , yes . - Data to Captain Picard . - Go ahead . We have identified the source of the unauthorised computer access . We have found a tactical advantage . On my way . will ? As ship 's counsellor , I recommend you get some sleep . Some honeymoon ! Come to bed . Imzadi . Imzadi . He can never know you as I can . He can never touch you as I can . - This isn 't real ! - feel my lips . I 'm with you , Imzadi . I 'II always be with you now . - This isn 't real ! - What is it ? - No ! - Deanna ? - Deanna ! - No ! The bond has been broken . Find her again . We 've received the transponder signal . It 's accelerating . You have no more time for games . Have the doctors prepare . Transport . Begin the download . Tea , hot . Aside from elevated levels of adrenalin and serotonin , you 're perfectly normal . Deanna , can you describe it ? It was ... It was a violation . Shinzon 's viceroy seems able to reach into my thoughts . I 'm a liability . I request to be relieved . Permission denied . If you can endure more of these assaults , I need you . Now more than ever . The Enterprise is far from Federation space ... shields up ! hello . Why am I here ? Why do this ? I was lonely . - What are you going to do ? - I need a blood sample . What is it your Borg friends say ? Resistance is futile . Oh , yes , the android . - The bait you couldn 't refuse . - AII of this to capture me ? Don 't be so vain . After we found it , we had to make a few modifications . An extra memory port , a hidden transponder . I 've now gained access to StarfIeet 's communications protocol . I now know the exact location of your entire fleet . - You may go . - Where ? Out of my sight . - What is all this about ? - It 's about destiny ! - About a Reman outcast ... - You 're not Reman ! And I 'm not quite human ! So what am I ? My life is meaningless as long as you 're still alive . What am I while you exist ? A shadow ? An echo ? If your issues are with me , then deal with me . This has nothing to do with my ship or the Federation ! But it does . We will no Ionger bow before anyone as slaves . Not the romulans and not your mighty Federation . We are a race bred for war . And conquest . You 're ready to plunge the quadrant into war to satisfy your personal demons ? It 's amazing how little you know yourself . - I 'm incapable of such an act ! - You are me ! The same noble Picard blood runs through our veins . Had you lived my Iife , you 'd be doing exactly as I am ! So look in the mirror . See yourself . Consider that , Captain . I can think of no greater torment for you . Shinzon ... I 'm a mirror for you as well . Not for long , Captain . I 'm afraid you won 't survive to witness the victory of the echo over the voice . His cloak is perfect . No tachyon emissions , no residual antiprotons . Keep at it , Geordi . Find a way in . Praetor Shinzon needs the prisoner . - About time , Data . - My mission succeeded . I have located the radiation source . This entire ship is a ThaIaron generator . The activation matrix is on the bridge . It 's a weapon , then ... And the download ? Shinzon believes he has our communication protocols . They 'II give him inaccurate locations for all StarfIeet vessels . - Good work . - Sir ... Geordi fitted the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit . Use this , sir , to return to the Enterprise . - It 'II only work for one of us . - Yes , sir . We 'II find a way off together . It is time for the procedure . Move , puny human animal ! A bit less florid , Data . kill him ! This way , sir . There is a shuttIebay 94 metres from our current position . - There it is , sir ! - Go ! It has encrypted security . AIacrity would be appreciated ! Reman is a complex language with pictographs as verb roots ... That 's fascinating , Data , but we really need that door open ! According to the ship 's manifest , they are Scorpion-cIass attack fIiers . - Data , what do you imagine this is ? - Port thruster . would you Iike me to drive , sir ? - Can you open the shuttlebay doors ? - Negative . A forcefieId is now in place . well , then ... only one way to go . - Is this wise , sir ? - We 're about to find out . - Power up the disruptors . - Ready , Captain . Fire ! Tractor beam ! Lock on transporter ! I have them . - This has gone far enough ! - l thought we 'd discussed patience . Mine is waning . We supported you as you promised action . Yet you delay . The Enterprise is immaterial . They won 't make it out of the neutral Zone . In two days , the Federation will be crippled beyond repair . Satisfied ? - For the moment . - And when I return you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect ! What 's happening to his face ? Commander , a moment . Are you prepared to have your hands drenched in blood ? He 's not planning to defeat Earth . He 's planning its annihilation . His sins will mark us all , for generations . The more I studied his DNA , the more confusing it got . I drew one conclusion . Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing so that his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly and skip 30 years of his life . But the sequencing wasn 't activated , so his cellular structure is decaying . - He 's dying . - Dying ? - Can anything be done for him ? - only a complete transfusion from the only donor with compatible DNA ... You . - How long does he have ? - I can 't say for sure . But the rate of decay is accelerating . Then he 'II come for me . - Brother , I cannot move . - No . I have only activated your cognitive and communications subroutines . - Why ? - Because you are dangerous . Why ? You were programmed to gather information to use against this ship . I do not understand . I know . Do you know anything about Shinzon 's plans against the Federation ? - No . - Or the tactical abilities of his ship ? No . Can I move now ? No . - What are you doing ? - I must deactivate you . - For how long ? - indefinitely . How long is that ? A long time , brother . It 's called a cascading biogenic pulse . ThaIaron 's properties allow the energy beam to expand almost without limit . Depending on its radiant intensity , it could encompass a ship . Or a planet . He 'd only have built such a weapon for one reason . He 's going after Earth . - How can you be certain ? - I know how he thinks . Destroy humanity , you cripple the Federation . - The RomuIans invade . - No way of penetrating his cloak ? No . He could be close to every StarfIeet ship and they 'd never know . We do have one advantage . He needs your blood to live . - He might come after you first . - I 'm counting on it . We 've been ordered to sector 1 0-45 to meet our fleet . - Strength in numbers . - So we hope . He must not be allowed to use that weapon . AII other concerns are secondary . Understand ? Yes , sir . AII hands , battle stations . Initiate the forcefield ! Captain 's personal log . We 're heading for Federation space at maximum warp . The crew has responded with the dedication I 've come to expect . Like a thousand other commanders on other battlefields , I wait for the dawn . How long ? A matter of hours ... We must begin the procedure now . How long until we reach the Rift ? Seven minutes . Data , what 's our current position ? How soon until we reach the fleet ? At our current velocity , we will arrive at sector 1 0-45 in 40 minutes . " For now we see but through a glass darkly . " - Sir ? - He said he 's a mirror . - Of you , sir ? - Yes . I do not agree . although you share the same genetic structure , your life has created an individual . If I had lived his life , is it possible that I would have rejected my humanity ? B-4 is identical to me , although his neural pathways are not as advanced . Even if they were , he would not be me . - How can you be sure ? - I aspire , sir . To be better than I am . B-4 does not . Nor does Shinzon . We are passing through the Bassen Rift . The projection will return . It 's interfering with our uplink ? The Rift affects all Iong-range ... Evasive manoeuvres ! Target weapons systems and shields . I don 't want the Enterprise destroyed . Can you learn to see in the dark ? - Report . - He 's cloaked . We can 't get a lock . He hit our warp drive . We 're on impulse . full phaser spread , zero elevation ! AII banks on my mark ! Scan for shield impacts ! Stand by torpedoes ! Fire ! You 're too slow , old man . Attack pattern Shinzon Theta . - We are losing dorsal shields ! - full to port ! Fire all ventral phasers ! minimal damage to the Scimitar . Defensive pattern Kirk epsilon . shields online . already on it . - counsellor Troi , report to the bridge . - Captain , we are being hailed . On screen . Captain Picard , will youjoin me in your ready room ? You can 't trace my holographic emitters , Captain . And you can 't contact StarfIeet . It 's just the two of us now , Jean-Luc . - As it should be . - Why are you here ? To accept your surrender . I can clearly destroy you at any time . Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship . And the Enterprise ? I have little interest in your quaint vessel , Captain . Look at me . Your heart , your hands , your eyes are the same as mine . The blood within you , the raw material is the same . - We have the same potential . - That 's the past ... It can be the future . Buried deep within you , beneath the years of pain and anger , there is something never nurtured : the potential to make yourself a better man . That is what it is to be human : to make yourself more than you are . Oh , yes , I know you . Once , you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be . childish dreams , Captain . Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus . I am what you see now . I see more . I see what you could be . The man who is Shinzon and Picard could never annihilate an entire planet ! - He 's better than that ! - He 's what his life has made him . And what will you do with that life ? Waste it in a blaze of hatred ? - There is a better way . - It 's too late ! Never ! Make the right choice now ! - I can 't fight what I am ! - Yes , you can ! I 'II show you my true nature . Our nature . And as Earth dies , remember I will always be Shinzon of Remus ! My voice shall echo through time long after yours has faded to a dim memory ! Two ships de-cIoaking , sir ! RomuIan ! Captain ! It gets worse . - We are being hailed . - On screen . Captain Picard , Commander Donatra of the warbird Valdore . Might we be of assistance ? Assistance ? This is a matter ofinternal security . We regret you 've become involved . When this is over , I owe you a drink . Romulan ale , Captain . Let 's get to work . You heard the lady . Let 's go to work ! Coordinate our attack with the VaIdore . - TrianguIate fire on shield impacts . - Aye . - Aft shields at 40 % . - Keep our bow on the Scimitar . - Power to forward shields . - Aye . Target the warbird . AII forward disruptor banks . - Forward shields at 1 0 % ! - Bring us about ! Drop cloak on aft port quadrant . Prepare for emergency stop . - What ? - You heard me ! He 's losing his cloak ! Stand by all forward disruptor banks ! - She 's almost on us ! - Not yet . - Praetor ! - full stop ! Fire ! Restore aft cloak . full about . That drink will have to wait . - You have life support ? - For the moment . - But we 're crippled . - Understood . Losing structural integrity on decks 1 2 to 1 7 , sections 4 to 1 0 . ForcefieIds holding . Evacuate those decks . Re-route power to shields . Captain , I may have a way to find them . Prepare for a lateral run . AII starboard disruptors . What is it ? She 's here ! He 's resisting me . - No ! - Remember me ? Now ! Fire ! Bring me Picard ! You ! Get the cloak back ! Target shield coordinates Beta-3 . AII disruptors . Fire ! ventral shielding lost on deck 29 ! Compensate ! - Intruder alert ! - Number One . - Let 's go ! - Security detail to deck 29 ! - The RomuIans fought with honour . - Yes , they did , Mr Worf . Cover me ! Medics ! Report ! We have no photon torpedoes . Phaser banks down to 4 % . If we targeted all phasers in a pattern ? Scimitar shields are still at 70 % . It would make no difference , Captain . What 's he doing ? He wants to look me in the eye . We 've got him ! He thinks he knows what I 'm going to do . Divert all power to the engines . Even from life support . Give me it all . - Ready , Captain . - We are being hailed . Deanna , stand by . Open a channel . - l hope you 're still alive , Jean-Luc . - Oh , yes , I am . Don 't you think it 's time to surrender ? Why should the rest ofyour crew die ? Shinzon , I don 't think I ever told you about my first Academy evaluation . In particular , I was thought to be extremely ... over-confident . As much as I enjoy listening to you talk , I really think ... On my mark , Deanna ! AII hands , brace for impact ! Engage !

Where a mob of teenagers have made a name for himself , when they assaulted two police officers in an illegal club . Both officers are in a critical condition . Parents blame a local band called Sonic War , for inciting violence . If Nostradamus is right on the involvement of aliens , might be about more than Rock 'n Roll .

I would like to do instead of Sonic War ... La Intruder . Have a box with them ? Do not give up on this band 's music . Are you sure ? Are authorized to launch new artists . Look ... I did overnight Sonic War , a feeling by using crowd here . If you sign now with a big house records ... Definitely will sell all tickets to concerts . We also have smaller houses records ... What might promote easier . Does Not . We create our new investors , own house records . This band is not interested in " Rock 'n Roll corporatist " Where have you met Kat ? La Roadsight Diner and Lancing . It is one of the most ... Mover artists I 've ever seen . She began singing in bars at the age of 15 years . Behind her starring ... On Vito Pivan the last 5 years .

Hey man , hat is not sharp but is voluminous . Let me listen . It 's my tape back . Hey man , here it is ... Here comes Kat . How many times must I tell you to leave here ? A coffee , please . Kat , you have a minute ? I saw the recording studio . You 're one of Preston 's boys ? Not really , not told you who I am ? Thank you . My name is Kenny Ganes , director Intruder Records . I am interested in Sonic War . I want to ask you some questions about the band . Let her go . How did you start ? Like others with six strings and a dream ... Lamentation and I are childhood friends , Billy came a few years ago . Where did you grow up ? In Northern Michigan . I grew up in a trailer park . Preston said you sang in bars before . The He saved me not to play through parking lots . And where is he ? I do not think I 've heard of it before . Really ? The ... It was DJ around the world . He worked with Fringe in London for 3 years . He takes care of synthesizers at our concerts , and nestăpânit . I heard that was rampant throughout the weekend . From I ... I do not want to talk about it , if you do not mind . It 's okay . Preston said you 're not interested to sign with a big house records . What did he say ? I requested a demo tape ... But it is a little uneasy about the whole thing . We have a show tonight ... The warehouse . Can I pass the name on the list . Can you hear us live . Thanks , I appreciate it . What are you doing ? I will surely come . Remember this ... You take me ... You take your life . Man threatening me ? Why the crazy kid ? How the hell should I know ? Because you were there . Who are you ? Detective Briers , Vice ... Better give me some answers or you go to the station . I have nothing to do with it , man . Your choice here or at the station . That kid wearing headphones . Listen , Sonic War ? Yes what ? You think that made him go crazy ? I do not know . What did you think ? Music is strange ... Defines strange . It is like a drug to make you break someone 's head . Why did not you tell me that came here from IR manager ? Record ... But afterwards ? You did not want to mention that the band Intruder interested ? If you lose time in the cafe will give several Ganes Kenny . Corporations are people . I just expected so Preston opportunity and I do not like the fact that I was not informed . Want to touch your music ? There is your music . Remember that , sweetheart . I want to make records with a label Preston , why I signed with you . Beastie Boys have taken the first step with their own label . We will do better . We will create their own record label and distribution network ... Not to mention that we have control over our music . Our music ? That is my band , Preston . And I like the way we try to control the music . Do you have gathered all the pain you had ... And you embedded it in music . Children responded with anger , just as you did when you wrote the lyrics . That 's just part of who I am , I want to show the other side . Anger makes us sell tickets . I do not care sales . Why pick on me ? Billy and others have turned your shitty music . He is everything you hate , Kat . That makes you rebel against me . Now I 'm on your side . East duşmanul . Sorry , Preston . I guess I 'm a little stressed . It 's okay . Relax . Go and have a coffee . Without caffeine . Intruder Records . Can I speak to Mr. Ganes , please ? I 'll connect you with his secretary . Mr. Ganes Office . Farewell , sucker . Hi , Foster ? Da . Preston did some checking . I used a voice modulator to cover us . I thought it would . You think it 's an alien ? I might . Maybe it 's just a concerned manager . The perfect plan aliens . Rock music steals innocent young minds . It is a cliché that goes back to Elvis . The deposit that is a drug , Eddie . I would not put a price on violence . I do not think there 's room for interpretation , Foster . Quatrain refers to a bitter song . Sonic War Rock sings angry . I think we have a team of aliens . I do not think . This naked ? I think it 's just instinct . What happens Foster , that wherever you go ... All persons who come into contact with have tentacles under the skin ? I 'm trying to get used to it . I am trying to get a box to analyze it . We start from there . Hi , Kenny Ganes , Kat passed me on the list . Yes , it is okay . Thank you . What is this ? It provided the police let us work this weekend . You take it back after the show . Without decks , because there are people who want to register on Sonic War . Hey look , it 's the guy from the record label . Guys ... Did you come . Why should I lose it ? Enjoy the show . Can we meet after the show . I doubt it . What Kat ? We are not interested Intruder . What ? Preston is right ... I will not sell a corporation . Why do you think you would benefit Preston . Said that 's exactly what you 'll say . Kat , let 's go . Excuse me . For those out there who want to know what is actually Sonic War ... This song is for you . You really ready for fun ? Hey , you gotta talk to you . Yes , let me out , man . Release me . Sorry , I thought you were someone else . Sorry . You are kindly man . He 's the man , it 's policeman . Hey hey , we have a policeman among us . Where to go ? Did you feel wild tonight ? Yes ... wild . This este Jeremy ? Certainly the crowd pursued is not one of ours . Serves him right , man . I go mad on these kids . We disconnected from the music , I felt it . You were bomb ... that I wanted to see . I kept this for you , honey . Kat , you 're cool . Thank you . Apart from the first song . It was pretty slow pace that was not it look right ? Da . Whatever , Preston . Remember . Anger sell us tickets . Da . What a clown . Man , so is he ... We take defense . No , but we should behave well with him ... He knows what will fans do ? We know , we do not have to shake our heads ... mixing . The words you used to write them , Kat . Dude . - What ? - What ? Well ... Do not get me wrong right ? The song that started ... E special is the album title ... but be serious . No ... What do you mean Billy ? Well , what I mean ? I say get on with what brought us here . Music that says is we fight the system . Those kids were crazy in the gym . Yes , it 's called ... fun . Maybe we should try sometime . I say give him his shoes Preston . It is not fair to us . Hold on . Tomorrow night is the last show , you should not sing here ? After that we will record a demo and then we go on tour . Come on , you should have some fun ... It has long wanted to compose music . Not for what happens on stage . Preston is right . He is our manager , we do what we say . Thank you . Kat ... I waited to call . You had time to study music ? Yes , I did some tests . Am analizat harmony Frequency rate dormant . I listened to the song and backwards ... What you get ? A headache . But something strange ... Demo tapes are mixed in an even number of entries , usually in August . This song was 9 entries . Kat said Preston is a master mixes ... And that add effects when playing live . That can explain . If sălbăticeşte music world ... You how come you crazy ? Had no effect on me ... Or on your ... Or on Preston . Affects children , Eddie . As if taking steroids . Am the idee . A question ... If music affects young ... How did not affect the band ? I do not know ... Can use earplugs . Enter the Internet , Eddie , trying to find out if ... Adolescent body produces hormones that cause anger . I did that before you tell me . During the growth process , the body tends to mature , so that produces large amounts of androgen . Hormoni male sex . Maybe aliens have found a way androgens stimulate the children . But how ? I do not know . But I think there is something hidden in music . I 'll call you when I know more . It was beautiful . I wrote last week in a strip club . I think choosing the worst places for inspiration . Kat , we need to talk . The ... So kids say you 're a cop . Eventually you 're ... Police officer or director ? None any other . I came here to investigate why your music makes children run wild . Work for Rolling Stone or something ? I 'll sound crazy ... But I think someone play with your music . To get violent fans . Who is playing ... I think Preston . You 're kidding , are not you ? I 'm afraid not . Have you ever thought that maybe my music has a power ? Do not get me wrong , but I 'm sure it does . I saw a kid listening to your music headphones and crazy , I think you know what I mean . Listen , Kat , please . I pray ? What you ask ? What do you want from me ? I need your help . I need your help to ensure that no will not be hurt because of your music . I do not know who you are , or what 's your goal . Stay away from me . It 's okay . Okay . Thank you . The ... Hey , guys . Dude , you start to get tired , you know ? I need your help . If you care about Kat , you listen . Look , man , I came here to drink coffee . Does Not . I want to hear what he meant . During the show last night ... Something in your music made the children turn against me . I would be killed . Yes , start again , blames Rock`n Roll , persecution never ends . Jeremy , you know that something is wrong , right ? Billy , I told you ... I have seen children react , how they react to our shows . When did this ? Since Preston coupled with Kat . He began to sound more and more change . He gave new equipment ? Amplifiers something ? No , not given us anything . Rather than Kat 's guitar . Yes the night they met , gave him his gift Kat Stratocaster . He said that he would change his career . Yeah , well , and it did . So what are you trying to prove with this ? I 'm not sure . But I tell you , when I do . Okay . Hi . Hi , I brought ... 2 preamps of the studio session from Sonic War . I knew it would be a session today . Preston asked me to mount . Okay , come on . Thank you . We record live demo tonight , 8-tracks . A mold live . I 'll send him to New York . Then it is your responsibility to disseminate aircraft stations . Once we allow the radio stations , We will not have problems . What are you doing ? Billy , what happens ? Who was that guy ? That I want to know myself . Preston ! I was discovered . The directory that from IR . He knows that something is happening . Relax Billy , what happened ? He entered the studio and started rummaging through to instruments . There are many singers doubts this business . Maybe he wanted to copy a cassette demo . Can not wait to work with him . No , Preston . I 'm telling you this guy is director of the label , right ? Do not interest him our music , more interested in the effect it has on people . I called the record label and I checked . Well , maybe you should check it out better . By the way , I told Jeremy that convinced the manager to give you shoes ? I say to postpone the show . Gua and call them to see what our next move . Does Not . Everything is ready for tonight . Preston , I worked hard to get into this band . It could take years if I have to start over . No start over . All you have to do , is to keep him away from Kenny Ganes warehouse . I will announce the guard at the door . You take the band . Read the quatrain . Where are forged iron chariots ... Sweet young will revolt ... Over a bitter song . Sorry poison infects the minds and souls ... Spread by air , worldwide . Spread through the air ? Infectious diseases are spread through the air . No , Eddie , using the air waves ... Preston talked about it . Will release a demo by radio stations . Children go crazy on the streets . You must stop recording tonight . Foster , you can not return the deposit . Drummer know you 're against them . I have no choice . What do you want , Preston ? I understand that there are great differences between band members . Big surprise . Kat ... Let 's move on now . Not to be on the Quincy Jones , visionary producer . I am a collaborator . No , we find a middle ground . What middle ? Do you want me to play my music . Know what sells Kat , I know how to sell . They just do not respond slower stuff , not talking anger . Jeremy thinks he should give you shoes . Jeremy certainly do not know the conditions of the contract that you signed . Because if you give me shoes , you must keep coming bonded until your songs will get " oldie but goldie " . Let 's not talk about things that will not happen . When you sign with me ... I promised path to the big day . Enjoy this ... Because I 'm sure that you , Kat . All your dreams will come true . All the work ... All rehearsals ... Will bear fruit now . I record a demo tonight . And I personally , I will pick the top ... Music markets across the country . I know it was hard for everyone ... And although we were not united . But that is tonight . Make it sound good . - Let 's do it . - Yes . Kat , you can not play the guitar tonight . Are you the one who follows me . Listen , let out what you think of me . The guitar is a lethal weapon . I think it sends a signal that will put fans against the police . You are crazy . And Billy is involved in this . I have to go up . Hello . We have seen how fans react to your music . Yours , not by Preston . Remember that , when you are there . We finished . What the hell are you doing ? Go to hell , Billy . Go ahead , man . No guitar is to blame . It 's time to join the crowd . - What happened ? - Where is it ? I checked with neighbors attached to the warehouse . It seems that Billy escaped . So say Billy ... it filtered into our band . Yes , work with Preston . And gift from Preston , guitar ? A simple guitar . How do you know that . I mean , you say you are aliens . Perhaps even had a power guitar . I have never sung better . In Chicago ... I used to have 2 boxes of discs with Robert Johnson . It was said that he sold his soul to the devil . It was a little weak to play blues guitar . When he died , a nurse said she had very long fingers . It may have something to do with ... Agreements that you can play hard . What do you mean ? Nobody can give you a gift that you already have . Take care of you , Kat . Yes and you . Somehow guitar and Kat received gift from the devil . The aliens gave him something he could not refuse . One way to success . But Kat learned that there are no shortcuts to success . It is a long journey , paid hard . I 'll remember her lesson until the end . Professional drummer , looking band in the Cincinnati area .

 For those who haven 't read the plaque , we 'll read the plaque . Here men from the planet Earth , first set foot upon the moon , July 1969 . We came in peace for all mankind . If this isn 't an insanely beautiful woman , I 'm hanging up . Sir . I ... I ... I think you should listen to this . Sir ? God damn it ! Damn ! Sir ? Damn . Come on , baby . Come on , baby . Come on , baby . Come on . This better not be another damn Russian spy job ! Boys from Air Traffic Res say the skies are clear . It 's the real thing . A radio signal from another world . Let . Let 's . Let 's not jump the gun here . Get online with Space Command . They 're gonna want to know about ... Jeez , what 's with the golf balls . You 're gonna kill me here . Wait. wait . This can 't be right . The calculated distance from source , is only 375,000km . It 's coming from the moon . Who else knows about this ? S.E.T.I. in New Mexico identified a signal . But ... they 're even more confused than we are , sir . Excuse me . Major ! Yes , sir . Radar reception has been impaired , but we were able to get these . We estimate that it has a diameter of over 550km and a mass roughly 1 / 4 the size of our moon . What the hell is it ? A meteor ? No , sir . No , definitely not . How do you know ? Well sir , it 's slowing down . It 's what ? It 's ... It 's slowing down , sir . Get me the Secretary of Defense . Then wake him ! Hello . Hi . It 's me . Hi . What time is it there ? It 's 2 : 45 in the morning . I know I didn 't wake you . As a matter of fact , you did . Liar . I have a confession to make . I 'm sleeping next to a beautiful , young brunette . You didn 't let her stay up all night watching TV ? Did you ? Of course not . You 're gonna come home right after the luncheon , right ? Yes , yes , yes , yes . Okay . Mommy ? Here 's your mother . Hi , honey ! Hi . I miss you . I know , I miss you too . President Whitmore 's approval ratings have slipped below 40 % . Even his crime bill failed to pass . He 's good . Are the salad days over for President Whitmore ? More talk . Leadership as a pilot in the Gulf War is completely different from leadership in politics . Daddy let me watch Letterman . Traitor . That 's the problem . They elected a warrior and they got a wimp . Good morning , George . Good morning , Mr. President . That game couldn 't have been pretty . Thank you , sir . Connie , you 're up awfully early this morning . They 're not attacking your policies , sir . They 're attacking your age . Whitmore seems less like the president and more like the orphan child Oliver asking . Please sir , I 'd like some more . That 's clever . Yeah , well , I 'm not laughing . Age was never an issue when you stuck to your guns . You were thought of as young , idealistic . Thanks . Now ... the message has gotten lost . It 's just too much politics , too much compromise . Isn 't it amazing how quickly everyone can turn against you ? It 's a fine line between standing behind a principle and hiding behind one . You can tolerate a little compromise , if you 're actually managing to get something accomplished . Well ... The Orange County Dispatch has voted you one of the ten sexiest men of the year . That 's ... That 's accomplishing something . Excuse me , Mr. President . It 's the Secretary of Defense . Yes . Could you say that again ? Station WXBY out here in Brooklyn . The temperature is 95 degrees in Central Park . What it is here in the borough , God only knows . Let 's go to Nick Jones . He 'll give us a traffic report to the beaches ... So what are you waiting ? My Social Security will expire , you 'll still be sitting there . I 'm thinking . Yeah , well , think already ! If you don 't move soon , I 'm gonna start to decompose . Listen David , I 've been meaning to talk with you . It 's nice that you see me so much now , but ... Don 't . Don 't start , Dad . I 'm only saying it 's been what ? Four years ? You 're still wearing a wedding band ? Three years . All right , three , four . You 're divorced . Come on . Move on . This is not healthy . No , this is not healthy . Smoking is not healthy . Checkmate . Wait a minute , wait a minute , wait a minute . Wait , wait , wait . This is not ... This is not checkmate . See you tomorrow , Pop . No , no , just hold on . This is not checkmate . Checkmate . Yes , we 've got everybody we have working on the problem . I love XFiles , too . I hope you get to see it . David ! David ! What 's the hell 's the point of having a beeper if you 're not gonna turn it on ? It was turned on , I was ignoring you . Hello . What 's the ... What 's the big emergency ? It started this morning . Every station 's making like it 's the 1950s . We got static . We got snow . All kinds of distortions . Nobody knows ... What are you doing ? There 's a reason we have bins labeled recycle . What the hell is going on ? My God in heaven . So sue me . David ! We got a problem . Did you , try to switch transponder channels ? Oh , please . You think I 'd be this panicked if it was something simple ? Ok . Let 's point the dish at another satellite . We tried that . It didn 't work . It 's almost as though they weren 't even there . All right . What 've we got here ? This is impossible . We created a race of robots . Their function ... Miguel , the signal 's all screwed up . Stop it . Just leave it alone . You 're gonna break it , all right ? It 's so fuzzy . Oh , no . Good morning , Lucas . You see these ? I got a whole god damn crop full of these . If your father 's not in the air in 20 minutes ... I 'm getting someone else . Hey Russell ! Hey , Miguel ! Russell ! What are you doing ? Just what in the hell do you think you 're doing ? It 's the wrong field , you idiot . Lucas ' farm is on the other side of town . Are you sure ? CNS is running a story that we 're covering up some type of nuclear testing experiment . So tell them to run with it if they want to embarrass themselves . NASA 's been on my butt all morning . They want to know our position . Our official position is we have no official position . Connie , what is going on here ? Come on guys , would I keep you out of the loop ? Yes , absolutely . In a second . So what ? I can 't hear you . At the moment our satellites are somewhat unreliable . Isn 't it possible that this thing may just pass us by ? What if it doesn 't pass us by ? Let 's retarget some ICBMs to blow it outta the sky . And risk turning one dangerous falling object into many ? We don 't yet know enough about what we 're dealing with to make any kind of intelligent judgments . Luckily , the press is making up their own story at this point . But that 's not gonna keep . We may need to upgrade to DEFCON 3 . Absolutely . General contact NORAD . You tell them we 've upgraded to DEFCON 3 . That 's not what the President said . Don 't you think that 's a little premature ? I don 't think so . We have over 50 % of the armed forces out on weekend leave . Not to mention the commanders and troops that are in town for the 4th of July parade . Go ahead , Commander . Our intelligence tells us the object has settled into a stationary orbit . Well , that 's good news . Not really , sir . Part of it has broken off into nearly three dozen other pieces , smaller than the whole , sir , yet over 15 miles in width themselves . Where are they heading ? They should be entering our atmosphere within the next 25 minutes . Take us to DEFCON 3 . Please tell me we 're getting somewhere . Oh , there 's good news and there 's bad news . All right . What 's the bad news ? The bad news is there 's no penalty for disturbing my lunch . And the good news is you 're not gonna charge me . No , the good news , is that I found the problem . It 's not our equipment . It 's some kind of weird signal embedded in the satellite feed . Wait , that 's the good news ? Yeah , ' cause this signal has a definite sequential pattern . So as soon as I find the exact binary sequence , then I can calculate the phase reversal with that analyser I bought for your birthday and apply it , we should be able to block it out completely . And then we 'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Oh , David ! That 's why I love you ! That 's not necessary . Yes ! Yes ! Too kind . This better be good . Captain on deck ! Sir , we 're looking at a total radar blackout over a 13 km area . Let 's do a diagnostic check ... Excuse me , sir . The radar may be malfunctioning , but the infrared is totally off the map . Jeez . Get me Atlantic Command on the line . Hang on , sir . Sir , we have visual range with incoming over Iraqi airspace . Second sighting ? Yes , sir . This just came in from the Persian Gulf . Correction , sir . We now have two confirmed visual contacts . That 's affirmative . Mr. President . They 're tracking another one off the California coastline . All right , go ahead . Put it on . General , you might want to watch this . Yes . Ladies and gentlemen . ladies and gentlemen , we are interrupting our regular broadcast to bring you extraordinary events taking place in the Russian Republic . This unexplained disturbance , and the hysteria that it 's causing are incredible . How would you describe , what you 're seeing ? It is clearing the mountains , moving too slowly to be a comet or meteor . Widespread panic has gripped the countryside as thousands have taken to the streets . It is confirmed . The unexplained phenomenon is headed for Moscow . Mr. President , we have an AWAC off the West Coast . ETA with contact point , three minutes . I don 't understand it , sir . Side radar doesn 't see it . I know . It 's blind , sir . Nothing is registering . Negative . We have zero visibility . Visibility is at zero . Command , this is Eagle Eye 370 . Captain , the president is listening . Repeat what you just told me . We still have zero visibility . Instrumentation is malfunctioning . We can 't get any kind of reading of what 's in front of us . Wait a minute . May be clearing . Pull up ! Pull up ! Line 's gone , sir . Two more have been spotted over the Atlantic . One 's moving toward New York , the other 's headed this direction . How much time do we have ? Less than 10 minutes . Alex , organize a military escort . Mr. President , I strongly recommend we move you to a secure location immediately . Connie , can we expect the same kind of panic we saw in Russia ? More than likely . Mister President . We can discuss this on the way . I 'm not leaving . We have to maintain a working government ... I want you to get the vice president , the whole cabinet and joint chiefs , and take them to a secured location . I 'm staying . I don 't want to add to a public hysteria that 's gonna cost lives . Connie . Yes , sir . We 'll initiate the Emergency Broadcast System . We 'll advise people , not to panic . The best idea right now , is to stay in their homes . Yes , sir . Roy . Dean . Alex , you contact the cabinet members . Have them rendezvous here . We 'll take them to NORAD . Mr. President , with your permission , I 'd like to remain at your side . I had a feeling you would . And what happens if they do become hostile ? Then God help us . There it is , the strange atmospheric phenomenon . It is apparently what has been causing all the distortions in our broadcasts . David , are you watching this ? Not to react in a manner of cold fear . We have no evidence that these phenomena are endangering anyone . Thus far reports of aggression , Marty , listen , listen to this . I got a lock on the pattern of that signal , so we can filter it out but ... if my calculations are right , it 's going to be gone in , like seven hours anyway . It 's reducing itself every time it recycles , so eventually it 's gonna disappear ... You listening ? Can you believe this . David , haven 't you been watching ? David ! General . General . Good afternoon . So far , the phenomenon has not caused any damage . We have to ask you to try to stay calm , and it 's important for everyone not to panic . We have a fix on three of the occurrences about to appear of ... It 's just unreal . Hey , Miguel , come here . One is headed towards Los Angeles . The other two are on our eastern seaboard headed towards New York and Washington D.C. Marty . Marty . Jamie says this building has an old bomb shelter . We 're heading down there now . All right , all right everybody , head down to the basement . Take it slow . Don 't run . Walk down to the basement . There 's no shame in hiding . Oh , I better call my mother . Well , look who we have here . Hey , Russ , I heard you had a little trouble this morning . Dusted the wrong field . Well I know you 're probably still a little confused from your hostage experience . Hostage experience . Did something happen to you , Russ ? Oh , yeah . Seems years back , our boy was kidnapped by aliens . Did all kind of experiments on him and such . Tell them about it , Russ . You get a couple of beers in him , and he 'll tell you all about it , crazy stuff . Won 't you , Russ ? Russ , when they took you up in their spaceship , did they do any ... sexual things , do you recall ? Do you recollect ? Oh , Russ ! Let 's get outta here . What 's going on ? What 's going on ? What 's that ? Let 's get outta here . Come on . Mommy ! Lookit ! It 's too early , baby . Is it a earthquake ? Not even a four pointer . Go back to sleep . Daddy ! What are you doing here ? You should be down in the shelter . What 's going on ? Aren 't you coming , David ? No . I gotta see this . That 's cool , man ! You jerk ! The signal . My God . Now what do we do ? Address the nation . There 's gonna be a lot of frightened people out there . Yeah . I 'm one of them . Come on . He 's just trying to impress you . If you want to impress me , you need to get a job , and stop slobbering all over my shoe . I don 't believe this . Jasmine . Neighbors moving out . Guess they finally got tired of all these quakes . A little shake and they running . Police and the fire departments are asking everyone to stay off the phone . Baby , there 's something on the news about the quake . The police are asking us not to call 911 . What 's up , man ? Hi daddy . What you been doing out there ? Shooting the aliens . Oh , you shooting aliens , right ? You think you tough ? What you got ? Turn around . Let me see what you got . Come on , Boomer . Let 's get you something to eat . Oh , no ... Watch out . Watch it now , baby . I 'll go grab the paper . All right . Dam ... Honey , let 's go ! Babe , you want some of this coffee ? Babe . Pentagon officials are reporting more ships have just arrived over the capitals of India , England and Germany , bringing estimates up to anywhere from 10 to 15 of these city-sized spacecraft . I know , Ma . Just try and stay calm . Tell her to pack up and leave town . Why ? What happened ? Just do it ! Oh , Ma . Ma , listen . Get your stuff together and head for Aunt Esther 's . Don 't argue with me . Just go ! David , why did I just send my mother to Atlanta ? David . David , talk to me . Did you hear me tell you that the signal hidden in the satellite feed is slowly recycling down to extinction ? Not really . It 's a countdown . A countdown ? Wait . A countdown to what , David ? It 's like in chess . First you strategically position your pieces , then when the timing 's right you strike . See ? They 're positioning themselves all over the world , using this one signal to synchronize their efforts . In approximately six hours , the signal 's going to disappear , and the countdown 's going to be over . And then what ? Checkmate . Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! I 've got to call my brother . I 'd better call my housekeeper . I gotta call my lawyer . Forget my lawyer . Ladies and gentlemen , the president of the United States . Good afternoon . My fellow Americans , a historic and unprecedented event has occurred . The question of whether or not we 're alone in the universe has been answered . Although it 's understandable that , many of us feel a sense of hesitation or even fear we must attempt to reserve judgment ... He says he 's your husband . Oh , God . What do you want ? You got to leave the White House . This is hardly the time nor the place to be having that same old discussion ! You don 't understand . You got to leave Washington . Well , in case you haven 't noticed , we are having a little crisis here . They 're communicating with a hidden signal . They 're going to attack . You are just being paranoid ! It 's not paranoia . The embedding 's very subtle . It 's probably been overlooked . Marty , what are you doing ? Get out of town as soon as you can . Please , my staff and I Ok . Ok . Will remain in the White House as we attempt to establish communication . If you feel compelled to leave these cities , please do so in an orderly fashion . Hey ! What 's going on ? Excuse me . Coming through . The arrival of the alien visitors has caused over 10,000 fender-benders in just a few seconds ' time , but this is just the beginning ... Come on now , you can 't go . You got to call them back . I 'm not going to do this with you , Jasmine . I 've got to report to El Toro . But you said you was on leave for the 4th . Yeah , well , they canceled it ! Look , why are you acting like this ? Why ? That 's why . Look . I really don 't think they flew 90 billion light years , to come down here and start a fight and get all rowdy . Look why don 't you just relax ? I 'm going to report to El Toro and find out what 's going on . What are you doing in there , man ? Nothing . I 'm just driving . Look . Here , I got these for you . Firecrackers . Now , you be careful . Steve , wait . I want to tell you something . What is it , Jasmine ? You take care of yourself , you hear ? Look . Why don 't you get some things packed , and you and Dylan come stay with me on the base . And you will see that there is nothing to be scared of . Really ? You don 't mind ? Well , I mean ... We 'll have to let all my other girlfriends know that they can 't come over , you know , and got to postpone a little freaky-deaky . There you go , there he goes , thinking you all that . But you are not as charming as you think you are , sir . Yes , I am . Them big old Dumbo ears . Look at you with them chicken legs . Come on Dylan , honey . Look out ! Look out ! What ? Hey ! The television said they started the looting already , heven 't they ? Vultures . You still have the Plymouth ? You want to borrow the car ? David , you don 't have a license . You 're driving . Yeah , I 'm driv ... I 'm driving ? Come on , come on . I really want you out of Los Angeles . You 're staying there to keep people calm . It 's the right thing to do . I 'm not going to let them criticize you for it . I appreciate it , your trying to help me . Liar . Stick to the truth it 's what you 're good at . All right . I 'll tell you the truth . I don 't want you in any one of those cities . I 'll leave as soon as the interviews are done . All right . There 's a helicopter waiting . They 're gonna take you to Nellis . And the munchkin ? She 's going to meet you there . All right . I love you . I love you . Bye . Bye . It 's the White House for grying out loud ! You can 't just drive up and ring a bell . Can 't this thing go any faster ? What , you think they don 't know what you know ? They know . Believe me , they know . She works for the president . They know everything . They don 't know this . You 're going to educate them ? Yeah so tell me something . You 're so smart . How come you spend eight years at M.I.T to become a cable repairman ? Dad ! No all I 'm saying is they got people who handle these things , David . They want HBO , they 'll call you . Look at these , look at these people . Look ? Vultures . They take , and then they go . They 're going , they 're going faster than we are . Look at this we 're in the fast lane . I can 't go faster . They 're cutting me off here . No one 's cutting you off . We 're going to get a ticket . They 're getting in front of me . I can 't go any faster . All right . All right . I don 't want to argue you . Let 's just get there , as quickly as possible . What 's the rush ? You think we 'll get to Washington , it won 't be there ? A local crop duster was arrested today as he papered city hall with leaflets from the air . Everybody 's leaving . Can you give us some of your time ? Do you want to make a statement ? We 've got to stop them ! I was kidnapped by space aliens 10 years ago . They did all kinds of experiments on me . They 've been studying us for years , finding out our weaknesses . We 've gotta stop them ! They 're gonna kill us all ! Some people attribute his eccentric behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome from his service as a pilot in Vietnam . Others , however , have a more unusual theory . How would you describe Mr. Casse ? Private . Keeps to himself . Real quiet . Quiet . When they took him up in the spaceship , the aliens abused him ... sexually . Mr. Casse is in the county lockup this evening ... Pack up . We 're leaving . Due to extenuating circumstances , he may be released later tonight . Miguel , what about Dad ? This could be our last night on Earth . You don 't want to die a virgin ... do you ? Come on , we 're going . No . I 'm not going anywhere . Miguel ! Stop it ! Thanks a lot , partner . You read my mind ! Stay here . We gotta get as far away from these things as we can ! They let you out ? You damn right ! They got bigger fish to fry now , believe you me ! Come on , boy ! We 're leaving without you . We 're going to live with Uncle Hector in Tucson . Hector ! Like hell you are . I 'm still your father . No , you 're not . You 're just the man who married my mother . You 're nothing to me ! Well , what about Troy ? Troy ? Yeah . For once in your life , why don 't you think about what 's best for him ? Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up ! Who ? Who ? You stop it right now ! I 'm not a baby anymore ! I don 't want your stupid medicine , because I 'm so sick of medicine ! Do you know what this stuff costs ? Do you wanna get sick again ? Do you ? Once again , the L.A.P.D. Is asking Los Angelenos not to fire their guns at the visitor spacecraft . You may inadvertently trigger an interstellar war . Think we can find something better to do with our time , gentlemen ? Where you been , Stevie ? Man , this is unbelievable . This is , like , huge . They . They 've recalled everybody . Well , looks like the mail 's still working . You got to do the honors for me , man . You 're a wuss . Yeah , whatever , shut up and read it . It says ... Captain Steven Hiller , loser . United States Marine Corps . We regret to inform you that , despite your excellent record of service ... I 'm sorry , man . You know what you need to do ? You need to , like , kiss some serious booty to get ahead in this world , man . That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . See , I like the one-knee approach because , it puts the booty , like right ... in front of the lips , what 's this ? That 's nothing . Hold on . Hold on , man . What is this ? Jasmine kind of has a thing for dolphins . I don 't know . Stevie , this is a wedding ring . I thought you said you were going to break the whole thing off . Yeah . Man , you know I really like Jasmine . You know that , right ? Man , you 're never going to get to fly the Space Shuttle if you marry a stripper . It could only happen in California file , here 's Wendy Walsh with a special report . Below us , we can see hundreds of UFO fanatics who have gathered on rooftops here in downtown Los Angeles to welcome the new arrivals . Oh , God ! I hope they bring back Elvis ! I just came in to get my check tonight , and I got talked into working . Oh , I must have been tripping . It 's being called the party event of the century , and everyone is invited , especially you know who . This is so cool . Girl , please . Oh , hey . I made it before I came in tonight . Check it out . Now I know you 're not thinking about joining those idiots . I am going over there as soon as I get off . Do you wanna come ? Tiffany , listen to me a second . I have got a really bad feeling about this . I don 't want you to go . Oh , like the really bad feeling you got when I went to Las Vegas ? Yeah . And I was right . You didn 't get the job and you lost all your money gambling . Yeah , but I wasn 't in L.A. for the earthquake . Tiff , I really don 't want you to go up there . Now promise me you won 't . Come on girl , promise me ! No , no , no . I promise . Ok . Look . I 'm going . I 'm out of town for a while . Later . Bye . Hey , there 's my angel . Come on . Come on , Boomer . Let 's go . Hey , come on . Talk to your boyfriend later . Hey ! What the hell 's the kid doing here ? Get out of here ! You try finding a sitter today . Hey ! Hey , where do you think you 're you going ? You leave , you 're fired . Nice working with you , Mario . Come on , Boomer . Everyone in the world is trying to get out of Washington . We 're the only schmucks trying to get in . What . What the hell is that ? Pops , this is every phone book in America . You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed ? She always keeps her portable phone listed for emergencies . Sometimes it 's her just first initial , sometimes it 's her nickname , sometimes just her ... Oy , my God ! Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Slow down ! Where are they going ? Please stop ! Tell them ! Tell them ! Slow down ! Off-ramp ! Slow down ! We made it ! We made it ! Good , good . Nice driving , Pops . Well ... So , not listed ? No , no . I just haven 't found it yet . I tried C. Spano , Connie Spano , Spunky Spano . Spunky ? College nickname . Cute . You tried Levinson ? No she didn 't take my name when we were married . Why would she ... What are you talking about ? Try it . Okay . Here . Look . So , what do I know ? So ... You want to ring the bell or should I ? Oh , perfect . She 's using it . Perfect . What 's perfect ? It 's busy . Yeah . I can use her signal , to triangulate her exact position in the White House . You can do that ? Yeah . All cable repairmen can , Pops . The visitors have arrived , but the president remains at the White House . Question . Are Mr. Whitmore 's actions A , ultra brave . Or B , foolhardy ? What ? Now , don 't hang up , sweetie . David . How did you get this number ? Do me a favor . Walk to the window . And I 'm looking for what ? You 'll see . Over here . See us ? How does he do that ? Reporting live from Andrews Air Force Base just outside Washington , D.C ... Yes , that 's right , Tom , an amazing moment . We 're reporting from Andrews Air Force Base ... Now in light of our apparent inability to communicate with the visitors , Pentagon officials have retrofit this skylift helicopter with a type of visual communications device . Mr. President . Gentlemen , be seated . This is not a military airgraft but as you can see , Where are we now ? They 're just commencing liftoff . And refitted with these enormous light panels that are attached to the hull and onto the sides . Echo One , Welcome Wagon is in the air . I repeat . Welcome Wagon is in the air . Roger , Welcome Wagon . Echo One right beside you . This is something I would never believe in my lifetime , that I would be in the White House . Look at this . If I knew I was going to meet the president , I would have worn a tie . Yeah I mean , look at me . I look like a schlemiel . You look fine , Pops . Oy , my God . David , I don 't know how happy he 's going to be to see you . Yeah , that 's right . I 'm telling you , we 're wasting time . Like he 's not going to listen to me . We should go ? Why wouldn 't he ? Why wouldn 't he listen ? Because last time I saw him we , we got into a fight . You walked in the room and punched him in the head . You punched the president ? He wasn 't the president then . I punched him , he fought back . We wrestled around . It was a fight . A fight that you started , because David thought that I was having an affair . With the president ? Which , of course , I wasn 't ... Hey , hey ! You know , either go get him , or we should head back to the car . All right . I 'll get him . You wait here , and don 't touch anything . You punched the president ? Mein Gott ! Nearing point of contact , Echo One . We 're closing in . Roger that . You 're a go to commence sequence when ready . This I like . Look at this ! You know what famous people have been here ? Yes , Dad . Politicians , actors ... Baseball players , singers ... And now me . Imagine that ! Look , a poor immigrant like me . It 's a dream ! David , please ! The three choppers are steadily approaching what has been unanimously agreed to be the front of these spaceships , a parabolic indentation 9 city blocks ... You 're leaving now ? Hey , see if they got those pens that they give away . Dad , what ? You 'd still think I have a choice of my company . I don 't have time for this . Two minutes , Tom . Connie ... Mr. President . Mr. President . Julius Levinson . David is my son . I told you he wouldn 't listen . Νο , you have to tell him now . Tell him . David , you have to tell him ! Hey Connie ! David , tell him ! I know why we have satellite disruption . All right . Go ahead . Ok . Let 's say that you want to coordinate with spaceships on different sides of the Earth . You couldn 't send a direct signal , right ? You 're talking about line of sight . Yeah , that 's right , that 's right . Exactly . The curve of the Earth prevents it . If you 'd need satellites to relay that signal in order to reach each ship . Well , I found a signal , hidden inside , our own satellite system . Excuse me , Mr. President . They 're starting . They 're using our own satellites against us ... and the clock is ticking . Bringing it in to hover . Welcome Wagon , Echo One . Approaching alien ship . Initiating communications sequence , Echo One . Welcome Wagon has commenced . General Grey , coordinate with the Atlantic Command . Tell them to evacuate as many people out of the cities as they can . Yes , sir . Get those helicopters away from the ship . Call them back immediately . What the hell 's going on ? We 're leaving . Kim , my daughter . There 's something happening here . They 're responding . Something 's opening . Something is happening . It looks like there 's some kind of activity here . This may be some type of response , Echo One . We see it , too . Can 't identify it . We are evacuating . I repeat . We are evacuating the White House . Load the rest of the staff in the second helicopter . Who should we pick ? Is my wife in the air ? She will be shortly . Nice . Very nice . Ok . Buckle up . Latch secure . Look , we have our own phone . Let 's move outta here ! The president 's ordered an evacuation . We have to leave now . And our prayers go out to the wives and children of those brave pilots . Indeed , God help us all . Come on . The visitors responded with terrifying ... Authorities have called for a complete evacuation of Los Angeles County . People are advised to avoid the highways wherever possible . Oh , yeah . Great . Now he tells me . This is the Los Angeles Police Department . Please vacate the premises immediately for your own safety . Take me ! Take me ! Can we move it along ? Dr. Katz 's office . Hello . Let me speak to ... Dr. Katz , Please . I 'm sorry . He 's not available . Listen , for $ 300 an hour , you can put me through to his house in the Hamptons ! This is the Los Angeles Police Department . Please vacate the premises immediately for your own safety . Mrs. Whitmore . You must leave now . First lady secured . We 're on the move . Look ! They 're opening up ! It 's so pretty . We gotta get the hell outta here ! Go ahead , pilot . We 're ready to take off right now . Can you get a blanket for Patricia ? Here . Over there ? Time 's up . Get down ! Oh , crap . Oh , my God . Come on , Dylan . We gotta go . Come on , Boomer . Boomer ! Boomer ! Reports are unclear as to the extent of the devastation , but from all accounts , Los Angeles , Washington , and New York have been left in ruins ... Good God ! I been saying it . I been saying it for 10 damn years . Ain 't I been saying it , Miguel ? I been saying it . Dad , I 'm sick . I don 't feel good . Pull it over , man . We 're going to be all right , Troy . Leave me alone , man I got it . Miguel . Look at all that . We could have evacuated the cities hours ago . That 's the advantage of being a fighter pilot . In the Gulf War , we knew what we had to do . It 's just ... not simple anymore . A lot of people died today . How many didn 't have to ? Any news on my wife yet ? The helicopter never made it to Nellis . No radio contact . Come on , Dylan . Stay close . Here it is . What happened , Mommy ? I don 't know , baby . You men will be the first wave in our counterattack . Our target is to the north , centered above what remains of down town Los Angeles . You scared , man ? No . You ? Nope . Hold me . Hey , pay attention . Something you want to add to this briefing , Captain Hiller ? No , sir . I 'm just a little anxious to get up there and whup E. T. ' s ass , that 's all . And you 'll get your chance . You 'll all get your chance . Good hunting . Dismissed . Let 's kick the tires and light the fires , big daddy . Let 's bring it home . Let 's bring that bad boy home , Captain . You loose ? Yes , sir . You got your victory dance ? Well , I got it right here . Don 't get premature on me , soldier . We don 't light up till the fat lady sings . I 'm all ears , brother . You the man ! All right , gentlemen , we 're on . General , it 's NORAD . General Grey here . Al ? All satellite , microwave and ground communications with the cities are down . All systems go . For intelligence , we believe we 're looking at a total loss . How about our boys ? Where are they ? ETA to target , four minutes . I shouldn 't have left her . Don 't worry about it , big man . I 'm sure she got out of here before it happened . Or , as the good reverend would say , Why we 're on this particular mission we 'll never know . But I do know , here today , that the Black Knights will emerge victorious once again . Amen , man . Amen , Reverend . Holy God . Lock and load . Roger that . Los Angeles Attack Squadron has Amraam missiles locked on target . Washington and New York squadrons reporting lock on . Fire at will . Fire at will . Fire at will . Knights we are red and free . Knight 1 , Fox 3 . Knight 3 , Fox 3 . Knight 7 , Fox 3 . Missiles have been fired . Are they not getting through ? No , sir . Not one . Command , Knight 1 . Command , Knight 1 . Switching to sidewinders . Moving in . Knight 3 , Love 50 . Notch reference 1-2-0 . Knight 7 . 1-2-0 . Knight 1 . Sweet luck . Echo , Fox 2 . Knight 7 , Fox 2 . Come on . Come on . They must have some kind of protective shield over their hull . Knights ! Pull up ! Pull up ! Knight 3 , pull up ! Controls are showing complete failure of the stats . Pull up ! Blow through ! Blow through ! There 's so many of them ! They got another one , sir . Oh , no . You did not shoot that green shit at me . I 've got you covered , big daddy . Damn . They got shields , too . Let 's go , Knights . Move , Knights , move ! Jesus . They got another one , sir . Two more just went down . They 're dropping like flies . We 're losing them . All right . Get them out of there . All right . Squadron leaders , retreat to fallback positions . Abort mission . Abort mission right away . Do you read me ? Do you copy ? We 're going to have to make a run for this one here . Let 's get low . Let 's get fast . I got you , big daddy . Let 's get them . Watch the deck . Do you read me , your postion ? Squadron Leader , do you read ? Abort ! This isn 't happening fast enough . Get them out of there ! What 's with the monitor ? Where 's the picture ? We 've lost the satellite . We got two R-6 , Jimmy . Check them . Roger . Come on , come on , come on , come on . Move , move , move ! He 's on me like white on rice , big daddy . All right , Jimmy . They ain 't got nothing for us . Let 's push it . We gotta go ! We gotta go ! I can 't shake them . I can 't shake them . Yes , you can . Just the way I showed you . Let 's go ! Check me out . Maybe I 'm going to try something . Don 't do nothing stupid over there . You know me . That 's what I 'm talking about . Jimmy ! Jimmy , what are you doing ? You can 't bank at that speed . Jimmy , he 's closing on you ! Put your mask back on ! That 's an order , Marine ! I can 't breathe ! Jimmy ! Jimmy ! Jimmy ! No ! That 's affirmative . We have incoming . Let me have it , son . You got it . Friendly ? Sergeant ? I don 't think so . Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Come on and get me ! Come and get me ! What are you shooting at ? Where you at , baby ? Come on ! Come on ! You can 't hit nothing ! Low bridge ! See if you can fly that thing undercover . Hope you got an air bag . Son of a bitch . That 's right ! That 's right ! Get off of me ! Get off of me ! That 's what you get ! Look at you ! Ship all banged up ! Who 's the man ? Who 's the man ? Wait until I get another plane ! I 'm lining all your friends up right beside you ! Where you at ? Where you at ? Welcome to Earth . Now , that 's what I call a close encounter . Baby , stay right here . Stay right here with Boomer . Keys . Come on . Keys . Yes ! Come on , baby . Come on . Come on . Rumor reports indicate that this battle has repeated itself all over the world with the exact same results . You 're just like your mother , you know that ? She was stubborn too . I had to twist her arm to get her to take her medicine . You 're gonna be all right . You 're gonna be fine . You see , Troy ? You 're feeling better already . I couldn 't find anything . Everyone 's packing up . They 're leaving . They said there 's a spaceship heading this way . We 'd better leave too , then . Penicillin . At least , it 'll help you keep his fever down . Thank you . It 's really nice of you to help us . I wish I could do more , but we 're moving out . I 'm going with you . Well , I just mean that we 're going too . Cool . Tell that punk to shut the door . We 're out of here . He can sniff around somewhere else . Bye . Bye . It 's Air Force One , for crying out loud . Still he gets sick . I don 't feel so good . Look at me ? Like a rock . Could be bad weather , could be good weather . Doesn 't matter . We could go up , we could go down . We could go back , we could go forwards , we could go side to side ... What did I say ? He still gets airsick ? Yeah . Julius , with all of this , I ... I didn 't get a chance to thank you two . All he could think of was getting to you . There 's still love there , I think . Love was never a problem . All you need is love . John Lennon . Smart man . Shot in the back , very sad . We 've moved as many of our forces away from our bases as possible . But we 've already sustained heavy losses . I spoke with the joint chiefs when they arrived at NORAD . They agree we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike . Over American soil ? You 're saying at this point we should sacrifice more innocent American civilians ? Is that right ? Sir , if we don 't strike soon , there may not be much of an America left to defend ! Sir ! They 've taken out NORAD ! What ? It 's gone , sir . My God ! The vice president ? The joint chiefs ? Mr. President . We must launch . A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities . No , no . You 're not gonna launch nuclear weapons ! You 're gonna kill them and us at the same time . If we fire nukes ... then everybody else who 's got them , is gonna fire them . Sir , may I remind you that you are a guest here ? You know what that means ? Fallout ! You ever hear of nuclear winter ? It 's the end of life as we know it . David , you can 't interfere with the conversation . Do you hear what they 're talking about ? I know , I know . Don 't even think about it ! Just go . I don 't have to go . You have to leave . It can 't be allowed ! Shut up ! Captain , get him out ! Hey , hey , don 't tell him to shut up ! You 'd all be dead now , if it wasn 't for my David ! None of you did anything to prevent this ! There was nothing we could do . We were totally unprepared for this . Don 't give me unprepared ! Come on , Julius . It was , what ? In the 19 , what ? 50s . Whatever , you had that spaceship . Dad , look , Dad ... Yeah , that thing that you found in New Mexico ! Dad ! Where was that ? No , not the spaceship . Roswell ! Roswell , New Mexico . Yeah ! Don 't do this . No , you had the spaceship and you had the bodies ! They were locked up in a bunker . Come on . Where was that ? David ? I don 't know . Area 51 ! Right ? Area 51 ! You knew then ! And you did nothing . Sir . Regardless of what you may have read in the tabloids , there have never been any spacecraft , recovered by our government . Take my word for it . There 's no Area 51 . And there 's no recovered spaceship . Excuse me , Mr. President . That 's not entirely accurate . What ? Which part ? Hold on , everybody ! Hold on ! Sorry . The end hath come ! He spaketh His word , and the end hath come ! Hop on ! We 're heading out to El Toro ! You cannot defy what hath come ! It is the end ! El Toro ? Can you give me a hand ? Yeah , sure . Oh , God ! Okay , okay , Let 's get this off . Here , let me help you . She 's hurt pretty badly . You know , this was supposed to be my weekend off . But , no ! You got me out here , dragging your heavy ass , through the burning desert , with your dreadlocks sticking out the back of my parachute . You gotta come down here with an attitude , acting all big and bad . And what the hell is that smell ? I could 've been at a barbecue ! But I ain 't mad . It 's all right . It 's all right . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Do you need a lift , soldier ? When I flew overhead , I saw a base not too far from here . It ain 't on the map . Trust me , it 's there . Ten hut ! Mr. President . General . Welcome to Area 51 . Please follow me . We 're now 24 floors beneath the surface , and , here 's our main research facility . Let 's see it . I 'm sorry , sir , it 's a clean room . It 's to keep it static free . If we 'd all get to decontamination ... Open the door . Yes , sir . My God ! Why the hell wasn 't I told about this place ? Two words , Mr. President . Plausible deniability . I don 't understand . Where does all this come from ? How do you get funding for something like this ? You don 't actually think they spend $ 20,000 on a hammer , $ 30,000 on a toilet seat , do you ? Mr. President , this is Dr. Okun . He 's been heading up the research department on this project for the last 15 years . How do you do ? Mr. President ! This ... What a pleasure ! As you can imagine , they ... They don 't let us out much . I can understand that . Well ... I guess you 'd like to see the big tamale ? Follow me . She 's a beaut , ain 't she ? As you can see from the repairs , we 've been trying to put her back together since the late 1960s . Don 't tell me you 've had this for 40 years and you don 't know anything about them . Oh , hell , no ! No , no , no , no , no ! We know tons about them . But the neatest stuff ... The neatest stuff has only happened in the last few days . See , we can 't duplicate their type of power , so we 've never been able to experiment . But since these guys started showing up , all the little gizmos inside turned on . The last 24 hours have been really exciting ! Exciting ? People are dying out there . I don 't think exciting is the word I 'd choose to describe it ! You guys are hoping to fly this thing ? You said you can repair their technology . Can you tell us anything useful about them ? Oh , yeah ! Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Well , I mean ... They 're not all that dissimilar from us . Breathes oxygen , comparable tolerances to heat , cold . Probably why they 're interested in our planet . Hey ! Hey ! You guys wanna see them ? This is ... This is the vault . Or , as some of us have come to call it ... the freak show . When we found them , they were wearing some sort , of biomechanical suits . Once we got them off , we learned a great deal about their anatomy . Eyes , ears , no vocal cords . We are assuming they communicate with each other through some other means . You 're obviously not thinking about hand signals and body language . It 's some kind of extrasensory perception , telepathy . So ... It 's an organic life form . Can they be killed ? Their bodies are just as frail as ours . And these two died in the crash . This one a few weeks later . You just ... You have to get through their technology , which is ... I 'm sorry to say , far more advanced . David , you unlocked part of their technology . You cracked the code . Oh , no , no . All I did was stumble onto their ... signal . I don 't know how ... helpful I can be . Why don 't you show him what you 've discovered so far ? Figure out what they haven 't thought of yet . We 'll see if you 're as smart as we all hope you are . What code ? Captain Steven Hiller , United States Marine Corps . I 'm sorry , captain . This is a restricted area . I can 't let you pass without clearance . Okay . Come here . You wanna see my clearance ? Maybe I 'll just leave this here with you . Let them pass . Let them pass ! Get the hell out of the way ! Did you see that ? Come on down . Look ! Watch your step . Alright . Well , obviously this cockpit was designed to seat three . Though how they sat on them , I don 't know . Gently . You see these gizmos flashing ? Yeah . We 've been working around the clock trying to get a fix on all this crap . Some stuff we figured out right away . This we 're pretty sure is the life support system for the cabin . And this doohickey is connected to ... Well , it was connected to the engine . Here , take that , will you ? These configurations ... Well , to be honest , we don 't know what the hell this crap is . But this is clearly what they use to guide and navigate their craft . Neat ? Could somebody grab my laptop there ? Doc can I just have the computer inside ? What ? See these patterns here ? They are repeating sequentially , just like their countdown signal . They 're using that frequency for computer communications . See ? That 's how they 're coordinating their ships . You know ... You 're really starting to make us look bad . They got one ! They got one alive ! They got one , alive ! Jesus ! Look . You 'll be okay by yourself , Dave ? Fine by it . Yeah . Don 't touch anything . Everybody 's always telling me not to touch anything . Here , here . It 's all wet . Right here . We got him in the back of the pickup . General , sir . Captain Steven Hiller , United States Marine Corps . Guess who 's coming to dinner ! I need a doctor . I need a doctor ! Oh , boy ! Oh , boy ! How long has he been unconscious ? About three hours . Let 's get him in containment , stat ! My son , he 's very sick . He needs immediate attention ! He 's drying out . I want him sprayed down with saline . He has a problem with his adrenal cortex . Please ! If you don 't do something about it right now , my son will die ! Okay , just help him ! Okay . O 'Haver , Miller , you come with us . You , take us to him , okay ? Let 's go . All right ! Move it , move it , move it ! As the former head of the CIA , you knew about this place . When were you planning on informing the rest of us ? It had been deemed classified . You should have told us about this when they first arrived ! You should have warned us before we launched a counterattack , that cost the lives of hundreds of American pilots ! There was no way that we could have known that our fighters would have been that ineffective against their attackers . Mr. President . The little bit of information we have comes directly into this room , Mr. President . Atlanta , Chicago and Philadelphia . Destroyed . We learned that NATO and Western Allied installations were the first to be taken out . Then we were hit . They knew exactly where and how to hit us . And our forces ? We 're down to 15 % . If you calculate the time it takes to destroy a city and move on , we 're looking at the worldwide destruction of every major city ... in the next 36 hours . We 're being exterminated . Mr. President . This is Captain Steven Hiller . Captain . Mr. President . Well done ! Where is it now ? We have it isolated down in the containment lab , sir . I 'd like to go see it . General , I 'm really anxious to get back to El Toro . Hasn 't anyone told you ? El Toro has been completely destroyed . We were lucky . Yeah ! Today was the first time I used the subway . Thank God for the Metro Rail . These should last us a while . Don 't move . I 'll get it for you . Stay still . He 's your son ? He 's my angel . Was his father stationed here ? No , he ... He wasn 't his father . But I was kind of hoping he wanted the job , though . So what do you do for a living ? I 'm a dancer . Ballet ! No . Exotic . Sorry . Don 't be . I 'm not . It 's good money . Besides ... My baby 's worth it . Dylan , come here . I want you to meet the First Lady . Hello . Hi . I didn 't know that you 'd recognized me . Well , I didn 't want to say nothing . I voted for the other guy . All right , life-support monitors recording . So if we screw up , it 's all on tape . Okay , come on , come on , come on . Let 's get this biomechanical suit off . Put the spreader right here , right along the ridge . Microprobe thingamajig goes right here . Pick there . Good . All right , now spread it very , very gently . Let me get in . Gentle , gentle , that 's it . Run this right in ... All right . Okay . Let 's proceed . Now comes the ... the really icky part . Oh , boy ! This is one smelly , disgusting ... Oh , look at it ! It doesn 't look alive , does it ? The arm is moving . Doctor ? Doctor ? Doctor ? Don 't move ! Don 't move ! Dr. Okun ? Release me . Open the door . Get him out of there ! No , wait . Release me now . Now ! I know there is much we can learn from each other , if we can negotiate a truce . We can find a way to coexist . Can there be a peace between us ? Peace ? No peace . What is it you want us to do ? Die . Die ! Mr. President . Is that glass bulletproof ? No , sir . Are you all right ? I saw ... his thoughts . I saw what they 're planning to do . They 're like locusts . They 're moving from planet to planet . Their whole civilization . After they 've consumed every natural resource , they move on . And we 're next . Nuke them . Let 's nuke the bastards . Just my luck . No ice . I take it you 've heard ? Hey , toast . To the end of the world . He didn 't come to this decision lightly . He didn 't have any other choice . Well , you still believe in him . Yeah . Well , he 's a good man . He 'd better be . You left me for him . Or , you know , for your career . You know , it wasn 't just my career . It was the biggest opportunity of my life . I wanted my life to make a difference . I wanted my life to mean something . Yeah . And ... I wasn 't ... ambitious enough for you ? David ! David , you could have done anything that you wanted . Research , development ... Oh , honey , I was happy where I was . Haven 't you ever wanted to be part of something special ? I was part of something special . Well , if it makes any difference , I never stopped loving you . But that wasn 't enough , was it ? Let 's pick it up , man . We 've got a tight schedule . Now , let 's go ! Let 's pick it up , man . We 're on a tight schedule . Let 's go ! Let 's go man ! Pick it up ! What the hell are you doing ? Get out of there ! Look , I got something I gotta handle . I 'm just borrowing it . No , you 're not , sir . Do you really wanna shoot me ? Just tell them I hit you . Command , this is Retal Op. Squadron is in the air . We are on station and awaiting instructions . Roger . Break formation . Head to targets . Sir ... They 're breaking formation . Mr. President , we 're initiating sequence code . Verification . Alpha . Zulu . Six . Eight . Niner . Which city will be reached first ? Houston , Texas . ETA , six minutes and counting down . Houston . The major cities have been deserted . Civilian casualties should be down to a minimum . Command , this is Neighborhood Watch . We are in position . Tracking monitors are locked on . We are going to visual recon . Roger that , NW . We have confirmation . Launch code confirmed . Alpha . Zulu . Six . Eight . Niner . Standing by . Laser targeting . Locked on . We 're locked on , sir . Do you wish to deploy ? Mr. President , if you wish to deploy , the time is now . Mr. President ? Deploy . That 's a go . Alpha . Zulu . Six . Eight . Niner . That 's correct . Deploy . Here we go . Bird 's away . We have visual confirmation of the missile . It 's on target . Approaching . May our children forgive us . Five seconds to impact . Three , two ... one . Oh , yeah ! It 's a hit ! Get down ! Get down ! Can we confirm that the target was destroyed ? Get the tank commander on line . I want confirmation that the target was destroyed . Yes , sir ! Red Arrow , Alpha 9723 . Can you read ? Repeat , Commander . You 're breaking up . We have lost visual . Roger that . We 're looking for confirmation . We got the bastards . Yeah ! Good job , everyone ! Congratulations ! Commander , do you have visual ? I repeat , we need visual confirmation . Has the target been destroyed ? Negative . Target remains . I repeat , target remains . Call the other planes back . Other bombers might have more luck . We shouldn 't just give up on this ! I said call them back ! Abort . Abort mission . Issue the abort codes right away . This is an abort , full abort . Do you read ? Abort mission right away . Jasmine ! You 're late ! You know I like to make an entrance . Where are we going ? Through there , sir . Mr. President , your wife is resting comfortably for the moment . Perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier ... Hey , there she is ! Go on ! She doesn 't look too good . Your wife is bleeding internally , Mr. President . Perhaps if we 'd gotten to her earlier ... Wait a minute . What are you saying ? We can 't stop the bleeding . If we 'd ... There 's nothing we can do for her . We were worried . We didn 't know where you were . You 've gotten bigger , I think . I did ? You just keep growing and growing . I can 't ... Hey . Can you wait outside for a little bit , so mom can get a rest ? Hey , come on , Munchkin . I 'm so sorry that I didn 't come home when you asked me to . It 's okay . The doctors ... think that you 're ... gonna be just fine . Liar . Is Mommy sleeping now ? Yeah . Mommy 's sleeping . Hey . David ! What the hell are you doing ? I 'm making a mess ! Yeah . This I can see . We gotta burn the rainforest with toxic waste , pollute the air and rip up the ozone layer ! Because maybe if we screw this planet up enough . They won 't want it anymore . Wait , wait , wait . David , David ! Don 't do this to yourself . Listen to me . Are you listening to me ? I 'm listening . Everyone loses faith at some point in their life . David ! Even myself . I haven 't spoken to God since your mother died . You see , sometimes ... we have to remember what we still have . Like what ? Well ... you still have your health . David , David , you need your rest . Come on ! Get off this freezing concrete floor before you catch a cold . Come on . What did you just say ? You mean about faith ? Well , you see , a man can live his life ... No , no , no . No , the other part . What ? What ? I don 't want you to catch cold . What is that ? What 's the matter with you ? Genius . Genius ? My dad . A total genius . Jerry ? Wake up . We got work to do . Get everybody down here right away . Look at that ! Does that thing really fly in outer space ? It most certainly does . Sure doesn 't look like it . Hey , they 're here . All right , Connie , what 's this all about ? I have no idea . Get everybody off . Right , everybody . Clear the platform . Let 's go . Come on . Come on . Major Mitchell ... Do you have a pistol ? What ? Have you got a gun ? Sergeant , your sidearm . See that Coke can on top of the alien craft ? Think you can shoot that thing off ? Do it . Shoot it . Sir ? Go ahead . What the hell are you doing ? I 'm sorry . My fault . My . My fault . See , that Coke can was protected by the craft 's shield . We can 't penetrate their defenses . We know that already . What 's your point ? Right . My point is , if we can 't beat their defenses , then we gotta get around them . Major , one more time ... Any time . How did you do that ? I gave it a cold . I gave it a virus . A computer virus . Are you telling us you can send out a signal that will disable all their shields ? That 's right . Just like they used our satellites against us . We can use their own signal , against them . If we plant a virus , into that mother ship , it 's gonna then filter down into all the corresponding ships below . I 'm sorry . I don 't understand . Just how exactly do we infect the mother ship with this virus ? We 're ... We 're gonna ... have to ... fly their alien craft out of our atmosphere and dock with it . We can enter here , as shown in these satellite photos . We then upload the virus . We then set off some kind of explosion , which will disable it . And that 'll disorient the smaller ships below . And that could buy you , I think at least , some time to ... to take them ... take them out , take them down . Do your ... Do your stuff . This is ridiculous ! How long would their shields be down ? I don 't know . A matter of minutes . You want us to coordinate a massive worldwide counterstrike with a window of only a few minutes ? With shields down , that might be possible . Please ! We don 't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign ! Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in this world is qualified to operate . I wouldn 't say that , sir . I 've seen these things in action . And I 'm well aware of their maneuvering capabilities . With your permission , general , I 'd like the opportunity to try . That thing is a wreck ! It crash-landed back in the ' 50s ! We don 't even know if it 's capable of flying ! Jim ... remove the clamps . Any questions ? Let 's do it . All right , you heard the president , let 's get this thing preped and ready to fly ! Good luck , pilot . Thank you , Mr. President . A virus ! Your idea . That 's right . Do you really think you can fly that thing ? Do you really think you can do all that bullshit you just said ? I understand you are upset over the death of your wife . But that 's no excuse for making another fatal mistake . No ! The only mistake I ever made was to appoint a sniveling little weasel like you as Secretary of Defense . I don 't think you understand ! However ! That is one mistake I am thankful to say that I don 't have to live with . Mr. President , please ! Mr. Nimziki ... You 're fired . Let 's organize every plane we can find and get us some goddamn pilots to fly them . Yes , sir . He can 't do that . Well , he just ... did . Command has attempted to compile a list of casualties and losses , but information is sketchy at best . Well , we know we 've lost the Belgian contingent in the Sina . There 's a strong possibility ther may be more reinforcements hiding in the Golan Straits . What the hell 's he saying ? It seems they 're getting a signal . Old Morse code . It 's from the Americans ! They want to organize a counter offensive ! It 's about bloody time ! What do they plan to do ? We have confirmed reports of combat-ready divisions in Europe , the Middle East , and Asia . That 's impressive . Considering it 's all being done with ... Morse code . The armed forces here ? We have sufficient aircraft for the battleplan , but ... But what ? Pilots are coming up short . Well , then , find them . Ham radio operators from New York to Japan trade rumors of military forces in hiding unwilling to reveal themselves for fear of annihilation . What we 're planning at this time is to launch a counter offensive . However , with our depleted manpower , we 're asking that anyone with any flight experience come forward . Military training is preferable , but anyone who can fly a plane would be useful . I can fly . I 'm a pilot . All right , guys , listen up ! All right , pay close attention . These F-18s are very different than the jets you piloted before . It 's kind of strong . You have to forgive the expression , but you 're about to get a crash course in modern avionics . Keep it coming . Keep it , keep it . Okay , you got it ! All right , listen up . Before we can begin , we 're gonna have to get a little background information on your flight experience . Let 's start with you . Who , me ? Well , I 'm Russell Casse , sir . And , after ' Nam , I got into crop-dusting . And ... been doing that ever since . On a personal note , sir , I 'd just like to add that ... ever since I was kidnapped by aliens 10 years ago , I have been dying for some payback . And I just want you to know that ... I won 't let you down . You have one tactical nuclear missile we 're loading into this launcher we 're installing under the right wing . This is the firing mechanism . It 'll be attached to the ship 's main console . Just like the Amraam launch pad on a Stealth . Except the nuke will not detonate at impact . You 'll have 30 seconds to get your asses out of there . Good luck , gentlemen . 30 seconds . Tell me , tell me . Well , it 's the strongest radio transmitter we could get . It 'll tell us when you 've uploaded the virus . 30 seconds . Don 't you think that 's cutting it a little too close ? We 're gonna be well on our way back home before we shoot that thing off . Why you ? David ! I don 't ... I don 't understand , why you can 't show someone else how to plant the virus . Someone who is trained . No . No , something may go wrong . I may have to think quickly , adjust the signal . Who knows ? Hey . You know how like I 'm always trying to save the planet ? Here 's my chance . Now he gets ambitious . It 's too tight . Well , I had to borrow it . Let me see . Okay . All right , I guess that 's good enough . So . How do I look ? Oh , thank you . You 're a lot of help . You 're late ! Well , you know me . I know . You like to make a big entrance . Listen . Before we do this , I just wanna say I 'm sorry . Sorry for what , babe ? I should have done this a long time ago . Do you have the ring ? Yes , sir . Here , make yourself useful . Witnesses ? We got hung up . Well , let 's get this show on the road . Dearly beloved , we 're gathered here in the sight of God , and in the presence of these witnesses , to join this man , and this woman in holy matrimony . Any person who can show good cause why these two should not wed , please speak now or forever hold your peace . Steve , will you take this woman to be your wedded wife to live together with her in the holy state of matrimony ? Will you love her , comfort her , honor and keep her in sickness and in health and forsaking all others , keep yourself only for her as long as you both shall live ? I will . Good morning .

 Hello ? Anybody here ? Neelix ? - Surprise ! - Surprise ! Happy birthday , my sweet . Happy birthday , Kes . Imagine . Two years old today . If you ask me , you don 't look a day over one . Why was everyone hiding ? Oh , it 's an old earth custom called a surprise party . Sorry if we startled you . No , I liked it . It was very exhilarating . Now , how about a glass of my special birthday punch ? Garçon ? On the rocks or straight up ? Doctor , I 'm so glad you 're here . My new bartender . Handsome , isn 't he ? I 'm here in an official capacity , of course ... in case of a medical emergency . Emergency ? Surprises have been known to cause acute hyperventilation , esophageal spasms and in extreme cases , even coronary arrest . One can never be too careful . No . I 've completed the sensor diagnostic , Lieutenant . All systems are fully operational . Very good , Ensign . And I 've recalibrated the accelerometer relays . Acknowledged . Is there anything else I can do for you , sir ? I presume this notable impatience is due to your desire to attend the festivities in Holodeck 2 . Yes , sir . May I remind you that your duty shift does not officially terminate for another 34 minutes . However , I believe the holodeck power conduits would benefit from a routine inspection . Yes , sir , I 'll get right on it . All stop . Mr. Kim . What is that ? Magnify . I 'm afraid that holodeck inspection will have to wait , Ensign . Wait till you taste this cake . Seven layers of Jimbalian fudge , and the icing is made from pureed I 'maki nuts ... Kes ' favorite . Now make a wish and blow out the candles . Well , what do I wish for ? Anything your petite coeur desires , ma chérie , and with a figure like hers , she 'll probably get it , too . Okay , I wish for ... Don 't tell us . The wish has to be a secret if it 's going to come true . Yay ! I hate to interrupt this tender little moment , Tommy boy , but don 't you think it 's about time we shot a rack ? In a minute . Birthday gifts are also an Earth tradition . Oh , thank you , Tom . You didn 't have to . Hey , who am I to fly in the face of tradition ? Tom , it 's beautiful . It must have cost you a week 's worth of replicator rations . Two weeks , actually , but who 's counting ? I 'm just glad you like it . May I ? Oh . It 's lovely . You see , it 's a locket . You put little photographs in here . It keeps the people you love close to your heart . Thank you . Did you see that ? See what ? He ... he ... he did a lovely wrapping job , don 't you think ? Bridge to Janeway . Go ahead , Lieutenant . Captain , we 've encountered an unusual phenomenon ... phenomenon ... phenomenon ... phenomenon ... phenomenon ... phenomenon ... phenomenon ... phenomenon ... phenomenon ... Phenomenon ... phenomenon ... What is going on , Lieutenant ? It might simply be a localized malfunction , but I 've never heard anything like it . My guess is ... It 's a problem with the com system itself . Janeway to Bridge . Get down to Engineering and run a diagnostic . I 'm afraid we 're going to have to cut your party short , Kes . Stations , everyone . Let 's move . But-but ... what about the Jimbalian fudge cake ? Save me a slice , won 't you ? These readings indicate the space ahead of us is literally changing shape . A best guess is it 's some type of spatial distortion wave . Is the anomaly responsible for the com system malfunction ? I think so . It 's generating intense pulses of EM radiation , and if we don 't it 's going to intercept us in less than ten minutes . Acknowledged . Full reverse , Ensign . Aye , sir . We can 't go backwards , either , Mr. Tuvok . The distortion has completely surrounded us , like a ring . If we cannot go around it , then we will have to go through it . There 's no telling what that would do to the ship . From what you have told me , Ensign , the distortion ring will make contact with us momentarily whether we attempt to pass through it or not . I prefer to minimize the amount of time that contact lasts . Shields at maximum . Warp 3 . Engage . The distortion ring has collapsed the warp field . Engines are off-line . Find the Captain and inform her of our status . Yes , sir . Ensign Kim , I 've been trying to report a problem in the gym , but the com system seems to be down . We 've encountered a spatial distortion . It 's knocked out several systems . Maybe that explains why the gym got so cold . Cold ? Well , I didn 't notice it at first , I was working out so hard . Then I realized it was under 10 degrees C. The environmental controls didn 't respond to my commands and neither did the com system . Engines are off-line , too . I 'm looking for the Captain to let her know what 's going on . Should I report to my duty station ? Might not be a bad idea . Until we find out exactly what 's going on , everybody should be on standby . I 'll round up my security team . The first thing I want to do when we get to the Bridge is establish a remote com link to Engineering . I want to know exactly what 's going on . Aye , Captain . Where are we ? Deck 4 . If the com system 's malfunctioning , the computer could be misreading our voice commands . That might explain why it took us here instead of the Bridge . We 'd better try setting the controls manually . Did you enjoy your first surprise party , sweeting ? It was wonderful . Thank you . I thought you 'd like it ... the cake , the presents . What was your favorite part ? I suppose what I liked best was that all my friends were there . Ah , that was nice , wasn 't it ? And don 't forget that beautiful necklace Tom Paris gave you . Do you really like it ? Oh , why wouldn 't I like it ? Paris obviously has excellent taste . I was afraid you might be a little jealous . Who , me ? Oh , don 't be silly . Are you sure ? You , my dearest , have seen the last of that green-eyed pus hog called jealousy . I 'm glad . Of course , Paris did replicate that locket , whereas I baked the Jimbalian fudge cake from scratch . These aren 't my quarters . Did we take a wrong turn somewhere ? I was just following you . Is everything all right , Lieutenant ? This isn 't Engineering . And have someone take a look at the turbolift voice receptors , Commander . Aye , Captain . This is Engineering . What 's going on here ? Looks like we 're dealing with more than just a com system malfunction . Computer , Bridge . Baxter , what are you doing here ? I wish I knew . I 'm trying to get to the cargo bay . And I 'm trying to get to Engineering . I can 't find the cargo bay , and I can 't find my security team . I 've been wandering around for about ten minutes . Well , at least I know I 'm not crazy ... unless we both are . No . Something very strange is going on . Ensign Kim said we had encountered a spatial distortion . Did he say what kind ? No , and he went to find the Captain . The Captain is on her way to the Bridge , but if she 's having the same trouble we are , - who knows if she can get there . - Yeah . I 'm going to keep trying to get to Engineering . Good luck . The holodeck again . Aha ! This is infuriating . Ah , stop playing games , mon chéri . I know why you keep coming back to work even though your bartending shift is over . It 's to see me , of course . How many times do I have to tell you , madam ? - Oh ! - I am a doctor , not a bartender . Of course , you are . Doc ? Ensign Kim . I was just , uh ... Playing doctor . Hi . Hi . The Captain and the others went to investigate the phenomenon Mr. Tuvok reported . So all of you heard his report before the com system failed ? Only a fraction of it . Well , I 'm sure Tuvok 's filled them in with the rest by now . What are you still doing on the holodeck , besides playing doctor , that is ? For your information , I have been attempting to transfer myself back to Sick Bay , but each time I try , I reappear here . That 's strange . Not to mention extremely irritating . I can 't seem to shut down Mr. Paris' holo-program either . Computer , end holodeck program Paris 3 . Computer , arch . Either the holo-emitters are malfunctioning , or the computer 's not accepting voice commands . I 'm sorry , Doctor , I don 't have time to help you right now . - Wait just a minute . - Hmm ? Where do you think you 're going ? I 've got to get back to the Bridge . We 're in the middle of a crisis . All the more reason I should be back in Sick Bay . I 'm sure that the Captain and the others will be able to do without you for a few more minutes . I guess you 're right . I 'll have a look at the holo-controls . Kyoto 's quarters . Nicoletti . Hargrove . Ayala . None of those are anywhere near my quarters . This is Deck 8 . That 's where your quarters are . But Hargrove and Ayala are on Deck 7 . Nicoletti is on 4 , and I think Kyoto is on 6 . How do you know where everyone 's quarters are ? I just remember . Remember from what ? Have you been in all their quarters ? Of course not . The point is , those quarters can 't all be on the same deck . Well , see for yourself . This can 't be . Perhaps , sweeting , your memory isn 't as reliable as you think . This is impossible . I know Hargrove is on 7 . Why Hargrove ? What ? Why are you so sure about Hargrove 's quarters ? What makes him ... so special ? He 's not special . I just remember where his quarters are . This way . It has to be this way . Harry . B 'Elanna , shouldn 't you be in Engineering ? What are you doing here ? Just answer one question , Starfleet . Where is here ? What ? ! Where am I ? Outside Holodeck 2 . Are you feeling okay ? I have been walking in circles for the past 20 minutes trying to get to Engineering . Kes , my sweet , you have many wonderful attributes . Your sense of direction is not one of them . I ... Oh , uh , Harry , B 'Elanna , maybe you can help us . I know you 'll find this hard to believe , but we can 't seem to find Kes ' quarters . I don 't suppose anyone here knows the way to the Bridge ? Let me get this straight ... this distortion ring has completely immobilized us . We have no means of communication with the Bridge or any other part of the ship , and no matter where any of us have tried to go ... the Bridge , Engineering , Kes ' quarters ... we 've all eventually ended up here . Right back at Deck 6 . The Bridge is on Deck 1 . Engineering is on Deck 1 1 . Deck 6 is halfway in between , right ? So ? So , if we 're being surrounded by this ring , maybe it 's pushing us all to the center of the ship . But it 's not just that we 're being led back here . I mean , rooms are in the wrong place . Is it possible that this distortion ring is somehow changing the layout of the ship ? There is another possibility . Exposure to some types of EM radiation has been known to cause hallucinations . Perhaps it 's not the ship that 's undergone changes but rather your perception of it . Unfortunately , without my medical equipment to analyze your optic nerves , there 's no way to tell . We 'll never figure it out sitting here . We need more information about this phenomenon ... sensor readings , computer analyses . We have to find a way back to the Bridge . If we can 't get back on foot or on the turbolift , maybe we can rig a site-to-site transport ... beam ourselves to the Bridge . We 'd have to get to a transporter room first . Or to Engineering . Wherever that is . When we tried to go to the Bridge , one of the places the turbolift took us was Engineering . Maybe if we repeat our steps , it 'll take us back there . It 's worth a shot . Lieutenant Paris , you 're with Torres . Maybe we can get to the Bridge through a Jefferies tube . If I remember my ship specs correctly , there should be an emergency access conduit which leads directly from this deck to Deck 1 , right behind the Bridge . I 'd like to keep trying to get to the Bridge on foot . If the ship has been reconfigured somehow , I can get a deck-by-deck picture of what it looks like as I go . What 's going to keep you from getting lost ? I 'll get a tricorder from the storage locker , rig it to emit a photoplasmic trail . Right . We should all get tricorders . Set them on active scan , gather as much information as we can about what 's happening to the ship . May I request that Kes be allowed to stay here with me ? Besides helping stave off the predatory advances of that ... woman , she may be able to help me find a way to transfer myself back to Sick Bay . And , uh , I 'll assist Commander Chakotay , Captain . As you may have heard , my tracking skills are legendary throughout the quadrant . That all right with you , Commander ? Mr. Kim , I 'm with you . Let 's do it . Be careful . Are you sure this is how you got there before ? Relax , will you ? So far , we 're right on schedule . The next stop should be Voila . Engineering . Finally . Let 's get to work . We 've got an emergency situation on board ship . I don 't have time to go into details , but you 're all to remain at your posts until otherwise notified , whether or not your duty shifts are over . Ensign , prepare to configure transporter systems for a site-to-site transport . I 've got to reset the pattern buffer controls . In the meantime , why don 't you check the targeting scanners ? Crewman ... there 's a-an emergency situation aboard ship . Just ... stay right where you are . That 's an order . I think you handled that very well , Lieutenant . Commander , I would imagine you 've had some experience with women . Some . Oh , come now ! Ha ! A ... a ... a handsome man like you . I bet women find you irresistible . Neelix , what 's this about ? Uh ... um ... uh ... have you ... uh ... have you ... ever been jealous ? Of course . You have ? I imagine most people who have been in love have been jealous at one time or another . I see ! l-lt 's a perfectly normal response . Then why ... why is it so unpleasant ? Jealousy 's about the fear of losing someone we love . There 's no pain greater than that . Neelix ... are you afraid you 're going to lose Kes to someone ? No . I mean , l-l-I don 't think so . At least , I certainly hope not . l-I ... I just can 't seem to stop these awful feelings . Nothing makes us more vulnerable than when we love someone . We can be hurt very easily . But I 've always believed that what you get when you love someone is greater than what you risk . Commander , am I ever glad to see you . Do you have any idea what 's going on ? Not exactly . Well , I feel like I 've been wandering around for hours . I can 't find the cargo bay . Have you seen anyone else ? Any more of the crew ? Some people roaming around like me . A couple of times I wound up in the Mess Hall . There were quite a few people there . I suggest you make your way back . Tell everyone you run into to come with you , and all of you stay put in the Mess Hall . When we figure out what 's going on , we 'll let you know . Aye , Commander . Gentlemen . Tuvok , what are you doing here ? That is an interesting question , Commander . I am not certain how I arrived at this location . You 're lost , too . Indeed . When I received no word from you or the Captain , I left Lieutenant Ayala in command and came to look for you myself . Can you lead us back to the Bridge ? I do not believe so . When I first realized I was lost , I attempted to retrace my steps , only to find myself here . None of us has been able to reach the Bridge . In fact , Neelix and I can 't seem to get off Deck 6 . Strange . I thought we were on Deck 3 . What was our status when you left the Bridge ? The ring has penetrated our shields and is now in direct contact with the hull . Then maybe it is possible the distortions are somehow reconfiguring the ship . As improbable as it sounds , that would appear to be the case . Neelix , let 's go . Neelix . I don 't understand it . We should have found the hatch to the Bridge ten minutes ago . I feel like we 're crawling in circles . But we haven 't ... at least not according to this tricorder . Odd ! What is it ? A very faint electromagnetic reading . Now it 's gone . There it is from another direction . Yeah , I 'm getting it , too . It comes and goes . Jumps from place to place . Could it be evidence of the ship 's reconfiguration ? Possibly . We 'll have to compare this data with readings the others get . Harry ? Yes , ma 'am ? I just want you to know ... you 've been one of the bright spots of this whole mission . You 've exceeded any expectations I might have had of you . Thank you , Captain . I ... I appreciate that . Wait a minute . Down there . I think that 's the conduit leading to the Bridge . Good work . Maybe now we 'll get some answers . That 's the hatch , Captain . This should let us out in the cargo hold directly behind the Bridge . It 's not working . We 'd better try it manually . It 's stuck . Oh ! Oh ... Captain ! I ... c-can 't ... get my arm out . Oh ! Oh ... Oh ... I think I 'm okay . I 'm reading an intense electromagnetic charge on the other side of that hatch . That must have been what was pulling you in . It 's as if everything on the other side is in a state of structural flux ... the walls , the atmosphere ... And the sequence of those fluctuations matches the readings from the distortion ring . This phenomenon isn 't just occurring in space . It 's definitely inside the ship as well . We 're going to have to regroup and come up with a plan for combating this thing . Captain , what 's wrong ? I don 't know . Oh ... Oh , my eyes ... Captain ? Captain ! Come on , pal , one lousy game . I 'll spot you six balls . I 'm not programmed to play games . If he won 't play pool with you , and he won 't make love to me , then as far as I 'm concerned , he can mop the floor . You see these hands ? These are surgeon 's hands , created by the most sophisticated computer imaging technology available . They do not play games , and they do not mop floors ! Then you are fired . I will find a new bartender . I really wish you would . Doctor ... Please tell me you 've had some success in reinitializing the holo-emitters . I did exactly what you told me , but it didn 't work . Of course not . I 'm starting to get worried about Neelix . What 's taking them so long ? Ah , trust me , chérie . You are better off without him . All men are alike . In the end , they always break your heart . Can I get some help here ? What happened to her ? She came into contact with the spatial distortions in the Jefferies tube . She seemed fine for a couple minutes , but then she started to fade in and out of consciousness . I believe we should go this way , Commander . Wh-What makes you say that ? If we are indeed trapped in some sort of labyrinth , then the logical course is to systematically eliminate all routes which do not lead us to our desired destination . The route that remains will be the correct one . Since we have been making a series of right turns , we should continue to do so until we are certain this path is not the proper one . There 's a flaw in your logic . How so , Commander ? You 're assuming there 's a logical pattern to this maze we 're caught in , but so far I haven 't seen any evidence of that . Even within chaotic systems , there is a pattern of limited predictability . By the time we figure that pattern out , these distortions may have completely overrun the ship . That is a possibility . The important thing is for at least one of us to make it back to the Bridge . So why don 't you go your way , and I 'll go mine . That way , we 'll increase the chances that one of us will be successful . As you wish , Commander . Tell me something , Tuvok . What does your logic tell you about navigating a maze that 's constantly changing shape ? Scanners check out . Then we 're ready to give it a try . Activate the auxiliary pattern buffers . Pattern buffers activated . Targeting the Bridge coordinates . Scanners locked . Energize . Would you mind moving your foot , Tommy boy ? It 's blocking my shot . Tell me you already made it to the Bridge , and you 've come back here to give us a status report . We locked on to the Bridge coordinates , but this is where we ended up . None of you had any luck either ? Not only has no one been able to reach the Bridge , but the Captain came into contact with the spatial distortion and is now unconscious . That 's not all . We lost Neelix , too . Lost him ? He turned a corner , and he was just gone . We think the spatial distortions are continuously changing the configuration of the corridors . Kes must be worried sick . And it isn 't just Neelix who 's missing . Where 's the rest of the crew ? It is likely that they , too , are trapped in other parts of the ship , cut off from communication and unable to find their way out . So , what do we do now ? This wave is obviously causing some kind of radical reconfiguration of the ship . We 've got to try to reverse it . If not , we may never be able to get to the Bridge . How are we supposed to reverse something we don 't understand ? No matter where we go , we end up here . Corridors are realigning , rooms are in the wrong place ... What 's the pattern ? We would certainly benefit from having an accurate picture of what the ship currently looks like . That way we would have a better chance of getting where we want to go . Maybe we could make a map . Ensign ? One good thing about all the wandering we 've been doing is that we 've been collecting a lot of tricorder data about the structural changes that have been taking place . And if we fed all that information into the central database , the computer might be able to extrapolate a schematic of the ship as it 's configured now . What are we waiting for ? The computer has analyzed all our tricorder data , so this ought to be pretty close to what it looks like now . It 's as if the entire ship is being compressed and twisted . My guess is , it 's more than just a distortion ring . It looks like some sort of spatial implosion that 's slowly crushing us . Look ... this part of the ship seems unaffected . That 's Deck 6 , where we are . Correct , Ensign . However , the area we are occupying will not remain unaffected indefinitely . How long ? Based on the rate of implosion thus far , I estimate the ring will crush Deck 6 in approximately 68 minutes . Is this implosion ring some kind of weapon ? Are we under attack ? Who 'd want to attack us and why ? There is no clear evidence of an intelligence behind the phenomenon . It is still possible we are dealing with a naturally occurring anomaly which does not conform to the known laws of physics . Don 't you think it 's a little late to be speculating on who or what this thing is ? The important thing now is that we find out some way of stopping it . B 'Elanna 's right . It seems to me we 've got two options : one , we find a way to get ourselves out of this implosion ring , or two , we find some way of reversing it . Invert the effect . Turn the implosion into an explosion . Exactly . If I can get back to Engineering , I may be able to generate a shock pulse strong enough to do just that . Of course I 'd have to raise the pressure in the warp core to near-critical . A shock pulse of that magnitude would create a subatomic particle shower all over the ship . Which could set off a chain reaction that would cause not only the ring to explode outward but Voyager along with it . Not if I can precisely tune the shock pulse to the distortion frequency of the ring . That will be exceptionally difficult . If we don 't give this a try , we 're going to get crushed anyway . Personally , I 'd rather go down fighting . I must remind you that with the com system down , we will have no effective means of alerting the rest of the crew to a potentially lethal particle shower . Do you have another suggestion , Mr. Tuvok ? I believe it would be safer to attempt to access the navigational array and from there engage thrusters to steer us out of the ring . Can 't we try both ? It 's much too dangerous to have someone working at the navigational array during a shock pulse . Besides , this ship is so contorted , there 's no reason to expect we 'd have any navigational control . All right , B 'Elanna , let 's give your plan a shot . You ... Commander Chakotay . Yes , Lieutenant ? I feel compelled to point out that in my many years of experience as Captain Janeway 's technical officer , she often demonstrated a tendency to follow ... In case you hadn 't noticed , Captain Janeway 's not in any condition to make decisions . I 'm in command . Is that understood ? Yes , sir . Good . B 'Elanna , you and Harry get down to Engineering . Evacuate whoever 's on duty . Then initiate the warp pulse . Move it . Dilithium matrix stable . Matter / antimatter reactor is at 80 percent of critical . Let 's keep it that way ! Warp core pressure is at 36 megapascals and rising . When it reaches 53 , it 'll trigger the shock pulse . We should get out of here by the time it hits 50 ! Acknowledged . Pressure at 41 megapascals and rising . I 'm reading a micro-fracture in the dilithium matrix . Attempting to compensate . Fracture sealed . 44 megapascals ! They 're heating up the warp core . They must be close to initiating the shock burst . Everybody , take cover . 47 , 48 , 49 ! Let 's move ! Well , in spite of Tuvok 's dire predictions , we haven 't blown the ship to pieces , have we ? No , and radiation levels are within acceptable tolerance . Good . Let 's get in there and see if we had any luck dispersing this implosion ring . - Hold it . - What ? I 'm reading a massive distortion behind the door . I don 't think it 's just behind the door . The ring 's completely engulfed Engineering . Can I talk to her ? I can 't guarantee she 'll hear you or be able to understand you if she does . Captain . Talk ... can 't . What 's wrong with her ? It 's possible the spatial distortions have damaged her speech center . But without my equipment , I can 't analyze her neural pathways . Chakotay , it didn 't work . Instead of forcing the implosion outward , the pulse is drawing it in at a faster rate . You 're saying it made things worse ? I don 't think we have more than a few minutes . Paris , we have to get to the navigational array and give Tuvok 's plan a try . I 'm afraid there 's no longer time for that . Why not ? We 're not going anywhere . Do you really think it 's possible to project a stable holographic force field ? We 've tried everything else . Ready ? Here we go . The distortion is unaffected by the force field . We 've got to figure out a way to generate a stable field . B 'Elanna , this ring has passed through the shields , crushed the hull , twisted the ship . We 'll never get enough power from the holo-emitters to stop it . What are you saying , we 're out of options ? Perhaps not . So far we have been unsuccessful in all our attempts to either explain or combat this phenomenon , and according to my calculations , the space we are currently occupying will implode in approximately three minutes , 17 seconds . You said there was another option . We do nothing . Excuse me ? Are you suggesting we just let it crush us ? Precisely . I can 't believe I 'm hearing this from you . I agree ... it sounds completely illogical . On the contrary . When every logical course of action is exhausted , the option that remains is inaction . So we 're just supposed to sit here and let this thing kill us ? ! I must point out that at least one attempt we made to reverse the effect ... the shock pulse ... only made our predicament worse . If we continue desperately improvising solutions , our own efforts may ultimately kill us . On the other hand , there is no definitive evidence to suggest that doing nothing will result in death . It 's ... talking ... to ... me ! Do nothing . Captain , please lie down . What about the Captain ? She 's dying . We do not know that . At the moment , she is merely delirious . Chakotay , you 're in charge here . Don 't you agree we 've got to keep trying ? Whatever this thing is , B 'Elanna , it 's bigger and more powerful than we are . Maybe ... maybe this is one bear we can 't wrestle to the ground . Maybe like Tuvok says , there 's nothing we can do but let it happen and hope for the best . Fine . Fine , Chakotay . Have it your way . Commander Chakotay . Yes , Mr. Tuvok ? I want to thank you for endorsing my recommendation . You know , Tuvok , I may not get another chance to say this . Sometimes I find you arrogant and irritating , but you 're a hell of an officer . Thank you , sir , and since we are speaking candidly , may I say , sir , that I have not always been particularly partial to your methods either . I suppose it must have been tough for you to accept my being elevated to First Officer over you . I have always respected Captain Janeway 's decisions . However , I suppose that particular decision did put me in a position I am unaccustomed to . If that ever caused me to make things more difficult for you , I must apologize . Can I ask you a question ? Fire away , Harry . Are you afraid ? I chose this life , and I guess I always knew it could come to this ... but , yeah , I 'm afraid . Me , too . I 'm so worried about Neelix . I should be with him . As much as he may ... annoy me at times , Mr. Neelix is one of the most resourceful and resilient individuals I know . If anyone can survive this calamity , he can . Hi . Hi . What are you doing ? I 'm trying to contact my spirit guide . Why ? Who knows what 's going to happen when that ring hits us ? We might be in for another long journey . I guess I could use a little spiritual guidance myself right now . You mind if I join you ? I thought you 'd never ask . Captain ? I 'm all right . You were delirious . It was ... some sort of message . What was ? The spatial distortion . It was ... trying to communicate with us . I want a full systems report , and Mr. Kim , Mr. Tuvok , I want every iota of information that was recorded regarding that phenomenon . The distortion ring is directly ahead , Captain . It 's moving away from us at 2,000 kph . We 've got a full crew complement , Captain . No injuries reported . No damage to the hull or ship 's systems . Incredible . You 're not going to believe this , Captain , but 20 million gigaquads of new information have been input into the ship 's computer . Where did it come from ? My guess is , it came from the distortion ring . Somebody 's definitely trying to tell us something . That 's not all , Captain . Our entire database has been copied and downloaded into somebody else 's system . I guess whoever they were , they want to know everything they can about us , too . Maybe it was their only way of communicating with us . Maybe ... they were just trying to say " hello . " Cake anyone ? Neelix , what happened to you ? Oh , it 's a long story . I 'll tell you all about it later . Right now , it 's time to finish your party . Neelix , I need a photograph of you . What for , sweetie ? From now on , even when we 're separated , I want to have you where I can keep an eye on you . Happy birthday , Kes .

 How much time ? Less than a minute . Let me just make this last-minute adjustment and then we can track Wade and Remmy 's photon trail back to Earth Prime . You 've been saying that for three months and ten different worlds . I don 't care about getting back to your home Earth , just get us out of here . Hey , somebody , open up ! Oh , no . Whoa ! Maybe we should explain to them again that it was your double on this world that burned down their casino at Little Bighorn . Or maybe not . Hey , hey ! Whoa ! This is it . Earth Prime . The coordinates match . Quinn , I still can 't breathe on your world . You 'd better get me to a hospital . Okay . Just hang on . Just hang on . What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? Quinn , slow up . You 're gonna shake me to death before you save my life . Just hang in there . We 'll get you some help . I 'm okay . Do you know if there 's a ... I 'm all right . Unless you like carrying me . Okay , okay , okay . You okay ? I 'm okay . Amazing . Your lungs must have adapted enough during all the slides to process our oxygen . Either that or the pollution index is a lot lower than it was before . The air in LA is better ? Right . Well , things definitely are weird here . I mean , this doesn 't look like home sweet home , unless you grew up in a war zone . Yeah . Where is everybody ? Let 's go by the Chandler and see if we can hook up with Wade and Remmy . Maybe the timer 's screwed up . Could be this is just another parallel world . Come on you guys ! Go ! Kromaggs . My God , what are those things ? My worst nightmare . And soon to be yours . Kromaggs are a warrior race from a parallel world . They 're sliders , but their technology is highly evolved . They capture and enslave every world they find . They captured us , but we barely got out . So , if this is your home Earth ... I 'm praying it 's not . This is where we always used to stay . There 's no sign that Wade and Remmy were even here . We need to find some food and water . Where 's the kitchen ? Hold it right there ! Get your hands up ! Take it easy , kid . Put that thing down before somebody gets hurt . We mean you no harm . You 're human ? Nothing gets by this kid . We 're looking for a couple of friends of ours . They might 've been staying here the last three months . Yeah ? What are their names ? Rembrandt Brown and Wade Wells . Your name Quinn ? Yeah . Quinn Mallory . They were here ? Yeah . Check this out . That 's Wade 's necklace . This is our Earth . Nothing gets by you , huh ? She waitressed here . Remmy played and sang in the bar . I was cook 's helper , till the Kromaggs came and overran us . Yeah , Wade said to give you that if you showed up . Where are they now ? Man , I don 't know . Maybe alive , maybe dead . Kromaggs must have got ' em . They raided us , but me and Marta hid below . By the time we got back up , everybody was gone . All right , we need a little more information , kid . You take us down below , wherever that is , introduce us to Marta . Maybe she knows something you don 't . All right . All right . Move and I 'll cut you to pieces ! Your friend here will break our fall . It 's okay , Marta . They 're the ones that Wade and Remmy told us about . Just chill . Damn it , Otis , I told you nobody gets down here ! He didn 't have a choice . I 'm getting real tired of people always pointing guns at me . Put it down . You first ! I 'm not gonna ask you again . Uh , if you guys are gonna shoot each other , why don 't you just let Otis and I get out of the way ? Are you Maggie ? Yeah . Yeah , Wade said you were a tough bitch . Yeah . I bet she did . Hi , I 'm , uh ... I 'm Do you know where our friends are ? Not for certain . The Kromaggs hit us hard and fast , some were killed . Your friends weren 't in the pile . You have to figure they were taken . All right . You two look pretty ragged , so why don 't you sit down ? Otis , go crack a jug of water . When did the Kromaggs invade ? Not long after your friends got here . They hit the big cities first . Casualties were awesome . San Francisco ? It fell right after LA . That 's where his mom lives . I 'm sorry to hear that . You 've never seen weapons like theirs . Freaking spaceships shooting lasers , the whole sci-fi enchilada . Within a few days they were in complete control . So we dug in here . There are other pockets of resistance , but ... About all we can do is just piss them off . So much for friendly extraterrestrials . They 're actually not aliens , they 're differently evolved human beings from a parallel world . Oh , yeah ? Well , I 've never seen a human that looks like them . How do you know so much about them ? We 've run into them before . If there 's a chance our friends are still alive , we 've got to try and find them and head to San Francisco . It 's a long shot . Chances are you 'll be captured or killed yourselves . Yeah , well , you can 't win if you don 't play . Just arm us up and point us in the right direction . All right . If they 're alive , they 're probably in the hole the Maggs call the Re-Education Center . One of our people 's a com-geek with an ear tuned to their mainframe . He can hack their database . Where do we find this guy ? You don 't . Not without me . Load their weapons . I 'll make the arrangements . We have to keep the faith , Quinn . We can 't last in a fight we don 't expect to win . Four years of sliding . More worlds than I can count , and I finally get them home . To this . When we find them , you ask them if they blame you . You know what the answer 's going to be . Listen . Manta ship . Let 's move it ! Oh , man , we can 't just leave him out there . He 's dead . You can 't be sure ! You want to join him ? We 've got to move . That Manta ship will have the Maggs on us any second . Are you just gonna leave him out there like a piece of meat ? That 's all he is now . I 've lost too many to cry over this one . She 'll do her crying later . When you see enough combat , you learn to pick your spots . M-1 to headquarters . House of Blues . Go . M - 1 incoming with two bogeys . Got ' em . Quite a little operation you 've got going here . Yeah , one on one , we can give the Maggs a run for their money . But once they bring in the heavy power , we 're just spit in the hail storm . I 'll take it from here . Roger . Mad Marta , patron saint of assault and battery . What news of the front and who are they ? Answer the last part first . Friends . Looking for friends grabbed by the Maggs . Ah . Well , you 're just in time for lunch . Their names are Rembrandt Brown and Wade Wells . I understand that you can hack into the computer mainframe . You are correct , sir . But first things first . An army travels on its stomach . May I present the latest and the greatest from the hacker 's cookbook ? Cheezenukes . Why not ? So , do the Kromaggs speak English or do you hack Magg ? No . They 've got humans doing all their squat work . Some of them have been indocked , others cooperate willingly . It 's just hot . Are you loving it or what ? And you know , every recipe from the book could be made without the butt leaving the chair . About our friends ... You should check out my chanish : Chili-filled Danish . Mmm , now that 'll get your heart pumping in the morning . Come on , bro , focus . Rembrandt Brown , Wade Wells . It 's the perfect survival food . It 's got the shelf life of a mop handle . It 'll out-survive the cockroach . Brown , Rembrandt . Currently , a guest at the Maggs Re-Ed Center . Brains washed . Fluff and fold at no extra charge . At least he 's still alive . What about Wade Wells ? Wells , Wade . No current listing . Well , they must 've taken her someplace else . Sure . They 've got camps all over the state . But our recon isn 't that sophisticated . Tracking her could be tough . If they haven 't killed her . No . They wouldn 't waste a Betty . Their parts are just like ours . Women are valuable as breeders . Hey , hey , hey . Alive is alive . She could be inside , just not in the active files . It 's gonna be tough getting through to them , though . The Maggs don 't exactly have visiting hours . All right . People break out of prison all the time . That 's old , that 's tired . Why don 't we try breaking in ? They have civilians working there . They come and go . We 'll join them . I don 't like going in blind . Do you know anybody that 's been inside ? Not that came back out . Feast your eyes . Blueprints of the complex . What you can 't get online these days ... Oh , God , you are amazing . I know . What , do you think I spend all my time in the porno chat rooms ? Give me an hour and I 'll do you up some civvy worker IDs . You have to get your own uniforms , though . Great . That 's our problem . Download this for us ? Yeah . Looks , brains and he cooks . Marry me . Be my love monkey . Why don 't you call me next week ? Come on . There you go . Thank you . Thanks , bro . We owe you big time . Live long and thump butt . I 'm here to relieve you . Hey ! Hey , what the hell 's going on here ? Finished ? You are now . Hurry up . Stop ! All right , everybody , just stay calm . Stay calm . That 's easy for you to say . You know , buddy , I really wouldn 't get too close . She 's real sick . Fever , chills , throwing up blood , sores all over . Let 's drag him around here . This should do it . According to Trevor 's readout , Remmy 's in the solitary cells on this block . Let 's go . I 'll mop up . Open sesame . The Maggs can really mess with your brain . Who knows what we 'll find ? Remmy ? Rembrandt ? Rembrandt Brown ? Remmy . It 's me . It 's Quinn . Leave me alone , you lying maggot . Rembrandt , we came to get you , buddy . The hell out ! Hey , man ! It 's okay . We 're here to get you , Remmy . Come on , man . Look at me , I 'm your man . It 's me , Quinn , Q-Ball . No ! I 'm hip to you . You eye-eating freaks ! All right . Listen to me . Listen to me , man . Listen to me . You and Wade slid out of the last world ahead of us . We were gonna follow your photon trail back here to Earth Prime . Now I know , no matter what they did to you , there is no way you would have ever divulged that information . So the only way I could know those details is if I was your man . It 's me , Remmy . It 's Q-Ball . Oh , God . Oh , my God . Quinn . Now , where 's Wade ? I don 't know . We were taken together , but after we got here they split us up . Then I heard that they ... They had taken her to another prison . Damn ! It 's okay , We 'll find her . We 'll bring her back . You have to believe that . Come on . If they find the body , we 're cooked . Marta . I couldn 't very well give you up to the Maggs . You still owe me 50 bucks . Come on . Okay . Come on . No , other way , other way . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! We have got to get to the basement . We can get to the old tunnels there ! The tunnel entrance should be behind those lockers . Come on ! Go ! Go ! Go ! If Q-Ball won that gun fight , he would 've been here by now . We 've got to go back . Quinn . Let 's do it . Trying to get back in there now will be suicide ! We 're not leaving him . Every Magg in that place is on full alert . You 've got no chance at all . Look , getting yourselves killed won 't do Quinn a damn bit of good . You expect us to turn our backs on him ? That 's not going to happen . Not as long as I 'm breathing . That 's right . I 've got friends on the outside that can help us . We 'll need to plan to pull this off . We 've got to go . If the Maggs find that tunnel entrance , we 'll be trapped . She 's right , Remmy . Maggie , I am not leaving him ! I know you love Quinn . So do I. But we 've got to love him enough to just walk away now , Remmy . We 're the only chance he 's got , and we need all the help we can get . Come on , Remmy . Come on . Let 's ... Let 's try this again , shall we ? The names of the rebels and the locations of their outposts . I don 't know . Well , we know that Rembrandt Brown was one of them . Is he your leader ? Is that why you risked certain death to save him ? Don 't go blacking out on me ! That won 't do . Certainly Brown is more important to the cause than his friend Wade Wells . You went directly to his cell . Wade . Ah . A familiar name . Maybe you went looking for her , couldn 't find her , and took Brown as a consolation prize . Is she alive ? Oh , yes . Very much so . Just not here . I 'm afraid your friend is a guest of the Dynasty on another world , in a breeding camp . You see , the Kromaggs are doing some interesting experimentation with cross-species replication . She 's no doubt enjoying herself . You know , I 've heard once a woman 's had a Magg , she can never go back . Be smart , kid . Deal with me while you can . Don 't make me turn you over to the Maggs . How does a human being sink low enough to become one of their lap dogs ? You 'll get your chance to find out . How long are we gonna have to wait ? You have no idea what they 're doing to him while we sit here on our butts . We can 't make our move until we 're ready , you know that . Don 't get crazy on me now . No , crazy was leaving him in that hellhole ! We should have fought our way back to him ! We 'd all be dead ! Doing it this way is worse than death . We should have tried , Maggie ! You want to eat yourself up with guilt , fine . But you leave me the hell out of it ! We did what we had to do . I 'm not apologizing for that . We didn 't run out on him . We 're going back ! The runner 's just brought word from Trevor . He intercepted Magg e-mail . They 're moving Quinn to a slave colony on another world . No way we 're gonna reach him in time . As long as he 's alive , we still have a chance . We have to make our move even if we 're shorthanded . How many of your people have you been able to reach ? Not too many . We 're spread pretty thin . But the word will get out . Look , it 's better to wait than gamble going in unprepared . I am done waiting . It 's probably already too late . Rembrandt ! You coming with me ? You bet . Just you and me against the whole Kromagg force . We don 't have a chance in hell , but we 'll go down in a blaze of glory . And now 's as good a time as any to die . I 'm not asking you to come . Now don 't put that on me . You are all I have . You and Quinn . I lost everything and everybody when that pulsar destroyed my world . But if you 're dead set on getting yourself killed , well , I 'm gonna ride that wave with you . Or , we give Marta one hour . One hour to get her people together . We go in there with a plan of attack , and maybe , if we 're lucky , we all come out alive . I couldn 't save Wade . I tried . But they clubbed me down and I couldn 't get to her . It 's all gone now . My mother , family . These Magg devils , they have destroyed our world . Maybe we can 't save your world , but we have a shot at saving Quinn . And we have to concentrate on that now . Maggie , there 's no easy way to say this . I 'm not sure if you can ... If you can trust me . Don 't lean too hard on me . What kind of trash are you talking ? I have put my life in your hands more than once . I was in that hole for three months , and they worked me over with their mind-control games and their torture . I 'm not sure myself if they got to me . I fought it as hard as I could . But they could have programmed me , could have messed with my head somehow . I 'm betting on you , same as always . I pray to God you 're right . Right in over here ! Get that door shut . Come on ! All right . Hurry up , guys . Move it ! Marta was counting on 25 , maybe more . The ranks look a little thin . Yeah , well , it only took three of you to spring me . Hell , we got ourselves an army . Remmy , go pop the hood . We 're gonna rig this puppy like the Fourth of July . Maggie , you 'll do the briefing . You got it . All right , everybody ! Come on , gather round ! I 'm gonna tell you a little bit about tonight 's festivities . Hey , man , leave her alone ! Eyes ahead , mouth shut , boy . Go for it ! Yeah ! Don 't do it ! They 'll break you ! The masters at the slave colony 'll get your mind right , boy . Now , you have a nice day . Hey . You 're fine now . They 're gone now . Here , let me help you . Ma ! My God , it 's you ! Quinn . I thought I 'd lost you forever . Oh , Quinn ! I 'd given up hope of ever seeing you again . Now you 've come back to me . I promised I 'd be back . It just took longer than I thought . This isn 't the homecoming we 'd dreamed about . Now I 'm sorry you came back . At least out there , sliding , you were free . Here . Oh , girl , you have enough explosives to level the whole place . Yeah . Well , they were running a special on C-4 down at the National Guard armory , and I never could pass up a good bargain . You 're a brave man , Remmy . You went toe-to-toe with the Maggs for three months and you didn 't break . That took real guts . Yeah , well . You could give me lessons in courage . I mean , with what you and your people are doing . There 's no way that we can ever pay you back . It 's not about payback . It 's about victory . Yeah . Where are your friends ? Are they with you ? Yeah . Remmy 's here . But Wade got shipped off to a parallel world by the Maggs . Just like we 're going to be . Oh , Quinn , I 'm so frightened . You 've got to be strong . We 'll get out of this . Remmy and Maggie are free , they will get us out of here . What chance could the two of them have against the Maggs ? It can be done . They 're working with this woman ... Quinn , what is it ? Why are you looking at me that way ? What is it , Son ? They 're watching us . Maybe meeting you here wasn 't such a coincidence . I don 't understand . How come you never asked about the fourth slider ? There were four of us . Yes , of course , the professor . What was his name ? Arturo . Maximillian Arturo . Quinn , please , I don 't understand . What was my dog 's name ? Bopper . Why are you quizzing me like this ? You 're scaring me . Because " you " may not be you at all . The Kromaggs are masters of mind manipulation . They can make me see what I want to see . Quinn . Look into my eyes , and listen to your heart . It 's me . Ask as many questions as you have to , but let 's not waste what little time we may have left . I have so much to tell you . Hey ! Hey , what ? M-1 , we 're a go . I told you , Ma . Didn 't I ? Quinn , I 've got to talk to you . You 've got to listen ! I can 't wait any longer . I have to tell you . Tell me what ? The truth . This is going to sound crazy , but I swear to you it 's true , no matter how fantastic it is . I promised your parents I 'd tell you when you came of age , but I was so afraid of losing you . My parents ? What are you talking about ? Listen to me ! I 'm not your birth mother . Your parents left you with Dad and me to raise when you were just a baby . They were our doubles , Quinn . From another Earth . So you 're saying that my birth parents are from a parallel world . Yeah . Ah , this is crazy ! This is some crazy Kromagg mind game ! No , it 's the truth . I swear it . They gave me this . Here . Press this to your forehead when you 're alone . They said your questions will be answered . Who are you ? Why are you doing this ? What 's with the lies , huh ? What 's with the lies , huh ? I couldn 't have loved you more if you were my own flesh , Quinn . Please forgive me if that love blinded me . Your parents came back to Earth to get you two years later , but your father and I hid you . We couldn 't bear to part with you . We loved you so much . Quinn Mallory , you 're first for transport . Now , move ! No . Quinn , please . No , no ! Quinn ! I love you ! No ! Quinn , hit the deck ! Let 's go ! Kromaggs ! Two o 'clock ! I got it ! My mom 's here . They 've got her , I can 't leave her . Hey , if we 're gonna get out of this alive , we have to leave now . It 's your call , Quinn . You guys go on . I 'm going after her . Hey , I understand how you feel . Let 's go ! No ! We 're gonna get you out of here . It 's too late for me . Come on , darling . We got to get through to those tunnels . Thank you , Marta . Come on , let 's go ! I 'll never forget your courage . Come on , Maggie ! The prisoner Quinn Mallory has escaped . Casualties ? Light . Three rebels killed . Hmm . Public executions tomorrow . A hundred humans . Retribution for the rebel attack . Yes , sir . The timer . Where 's the timer ? Got it right here . Doesn 't really matter , we 're at the end of our journey . My head is killing me . What hit me ? Me . I 'm sorry , Q-Ball , but I didn 't have time to convince you with common sense . My mom . We left her there . There was no other way . Besides , you can 't be sure who she was . That first time that the Maggs had us , they had me convinced that I was talking to my father , remember ? I mean , he was just as real as you are . Maybe she wasn 't your mother after all . She was my mother . She might not have given birth to me , but she raised me , she cared for me and she was there for me . You were adopted ? How come you never told me that ? Well , I didn 't know until last night . Whoa . Well , that must have rocked you . So , did she tell you who your real parents were ? Well , you 're probably gonna want to fit me for a straitjacket after I hit you with this , but the bottom line is , I 'm not from this world , Remmy . I 'm from a parallel Earth . My birth parents were sliders . Okay , Q-Ball , why don 't you just lay back and rest ? I think maybe that little tap I gave you scrambled something in your head . I don 't have all the details yet , but this micro-dot is supposed to fill me in on the blanks . Stay with me , man . Things might get a little weird . How much weirder can they get ? Wow ! Hello , our precious son . How we wish we could be with you , to help you understand all that we are about to tell you . And we hope that you can find it in your heart to understand , and to forgive us . There 's a great civil war raging in our world , and if our side should lose that war , it will mean the end of life for us as we know it . Our enemies are a separate race of higher primate called Kromaggs . We 've lived in peace with them for centuries , but now a bloody conflict has broken out . The Kromaggs now control more than half of our planet . The lands they 've conquered have been decimated , the peoples enslaved or killed . " Your father and I are working with other government scientists developing a weapon that will drive the Kromaggs from our world , but we fear they may overrun us before the weapon can be finished . Our race against the clock may already be lost . And we cannot bear the idea of losing you and your brother to the Kromaggs . And that 's why we 've made the painful decision to place you with our duplicates on parallel worlds as foster parents to ensure your safety . I have a brother ! A brother ? Since when ? If we triumph , the Kromaggs will be destroyed or driven away . But if you 're viewing this , you must assume the worst , for we have promised your foster parents to return for you should our side claim victory . They in turn have promised us to tell you the truth about yourself when you come of age and are able to accept it . Please know that giving up our children , even in order to save them , is the most difficult thing we 've ever had to do . Our hearts will break for you every day . We love you , Son . The numerical sequence you are about to receive contains the coordinates to your brother 's parallel Earth . We pray that you find him , Quinn . God bless and keep you both . Have a nice trip ? I just met my parents . Your parents are sliders ? Yes . Q - Ball is not of this world . Tell me something I don 't know . It 's a real deal , Maggie . I have a brother . He 's on another world , but I have the coordinates . Whoa . Have I fallen through the looking-glass here ? What are you talking about ? Sliding parents ? A brother from another world ? Quinn 's an alien ? Have you guys gone crazy and left me here ? I want some answers , okay ? I mean , there 's got to be some answers , right ? Well , the good news is I 'm not crazy . The bad news is it 's all true . There 's got to be another way in . Beside that tunnel , something we missed . We 've got to get my mom out of there . It 's too late . Trevor sent word that she was transported right after the raid . I 'm so sorry , Quinn . It 's too bad the looters got everything . I sure could use a drink . We all could . It 's gonna take more than a good buzz to get him through this . How much time until the gateway opens ? About three minutes and some change . After that this gizmo 's worth about as much as an eight-track tape player . I can 't take the pain away , but sharing it might make it easier to bear . I 'll find her , or die trying . I feel the same way . I 'm going to try to find my family . As long as we 've got some life in us , we 've still got some fight left . There might be a way to beat the Kromaggs , but we 're not gonna find it here . What 're you saying , Quinn ? Talk straight . My birth parents came back for me . Mom said that she and Dad hid me because they couldn 't bear to give me up . But they came back . That means they won . They drove the Kromaggs off my world . Yeah , yeah . But I 'm not following . My birth parents were working on a weapon that would defeat the Kromaggs . They must have been successful because they came back for me . Then your home world may have a secret that could beat the Maggs . And if it worked on your world , it 'll work here . If we find that weapon , we could come back here and drive these bastards right into the dust ! That 's right , man . We could literally save this world . But there are millions of parallel Earths . What are the odds of finding your home ? Better than the odds of beating the Kromaggs with a handful of resistance fighters . Look , I know it 's a long shot , but it 's the only shot we got . If we don 't slide when that vortex opens , any chances of beating the Maggs are gone . Now I can 't make decisions for you people , but I know what I 've got to do . Well , I 'm with you , Q-Ball , same as always . Kicking some Magg butt is about the only dream I 've got left . And I don 't trust the two of you out there sliding by yourselves . Who knows what kind of trouble you 'll get in without me ? So let 's go for it ! We 'll be back . You can count on it .

 All right , let 's shoot this , Marty . Hold it still . Hold it still , Sloan . I 'd like to see you hold it still . The sooner they pave over this swamp , the better . It 's not a swamp . You 're standing in a forest with indigenous plant and animal species you 're obviously too ignorant to appreciate . Mark it . Gimme another position . Shoot this one real carefully , Marty . This is where they 're gonna put the Blockbuster . You 're a real moron , Sloan , you know that ? Tree-hugger . You should be sad to see the demise of an ecosystem that 's lasted 1,000 years . We all should be . Gimme four feet to your left . - I can 't . - What do you mean , you can 't ? I mean I can 't , because it 's stuck . Then unstick it . This is weird . Sloan ! Sloan ! Louis , let Bo do the work . - How 's he know how to find a possum ? - Sh . Animals sense things that we can 't . That 's how they survive . So is that how Bo knows how to hunt ? Yep . Our ancestors were hunters , too . But most of us have lost those instincts . That 's why we need a little help . Dad , what 's that ? Surveyor 's equipment . Someone left his stuff out here . Stay close , Louis . What is it , Dad ? - Dad ? - Bo , come here . - What ... - Quiet ! Listen to me . I want you to take Bo , and I want you to run straight home . - What 's the matter ? - Run straight home . Don 't stop for anything . - Louis , you understand ? - I just ... Go . Come on , Bo . Bo , no ! Come on , Bo . Come on ! Last year was something of a personal revelation . We were doing an exercise called Team Builders , where we were given two minutes to build a tower out of ordinary office furniture . When I stood on Mike 's shoulders and I put that electric pencil sharpener on top of the pile ... We both knew we could never have done it alone . Kill me now . You ever been to one of these team seminars , Agent Scully ? I went to a constructive problem-solving course when I first joined the Bureau . Did you play that game where you can 't use any negative words ? I couldn 't believe how hard it was not to use the word " but . " I 'm having that same problem right now . - Have you ever been to a team seminar ? - No . Around this time of year I always develop a severe hemorrhoidal condition . Well , it builds muscles you didn 't even know you had . Communication . That 's the key . - Sorry , folks . It 'll be a few minutes . - What 's goin ' on , Officer ? Got a little situation is all . Thank you , Jesus . Where 's he going ? Excuse me . - Are you from Search and Rescue ? - No , I 'm just stretching my legs . They said they 'd have word for us about what happened to my husband . Slow down . I don 't know what you 're talking about . My husband Michael , he was teaching our son to shoot . He said the dog got spooked , then he heard gunshots . They 've found a jacket with blood on it , but they won 't tell me about my husband . - I 'll try to find out who 's in charge , all right ? - Thank you . Now where 's he going ? Hey , Stonecypher ! Take a look at this . This tree was here 20 years before Ponce de Leon landed . We 're gonna be late for the wine-and-cheese reception . - Officer Fazekas ? - Yes ? - Can I help you ? - My name is Fox Mulder . - I 'm an agent with the fbi . - fbi ? Who called you guys out ? Nobody . We got stopped at your roadblock . Sounds like you had a shooting . Shots were reported , but we have no evidence of anyone being shot . - Well , what do you have evidence of ? - A survey team didn 't report in last night . We found one man 's bloody jacket , pretty torn up . And this morning , a boy got separated from his father . Separated by what ? It looks maybe like some kind of animal attack . - What kind of animal ? - I 'm not sure yet . I followed good tracks for the two surveyors , but the trails became confused . There was a third set of tracks leading away I couldn 't identify . - Couldn 't identify as the surveyors ' ? - As man or animal . Mulder ? Hold on a second . - What about the boy 's father ? - I tracked him to where he fired the shots . The ground 's rocky , but from the depressions in the underlying soil I can tell that he entered the bushes over there , where I pick up another set of tracks , two different sets , that , from the way the ground 's upset , is probably where the man was attacked . But no other sign of him ? - Do you have panther in these woods ? - Panther . Bear . - But these tracks look like neither of those . - No , sir . You know of a good motel in the area ? Excuse me . I think we can handle this very well on our own . Thanks . Mulder , we 've got this conference . - They 're waiting . - Yeah . How do I say this without using any negative words , Scully ? You want me to tell them you 're not going to the seminar . You see ? We don 't need that conference . We have communication like that - unspoken . Look ! He 's all eaten away . How d 'you like that , eh ? He 's not coming back , is he ? - Why would you say that ? - Dad 's a good shot . If he hit what he was aiming at , he 'd be home by now . You gotta be brave , Louis . We both gotta be brave . We 'll find out more about it in the morning . You get some sleep now . It 's open . Who cut the cheese ? Since we won 't be making it to the conference ... Par-tay . However , I must remind you this goes against the Bureau 's policy of male and female agents consorting in the same motel room . Try any of that Tailhook crap on me , Scully , I 'll kick your ass . Pop quiz . What animal will attack the strongest , leaving the weakest to escape ? The answer is none . Not one of the over 4,000 species native to North America will attack the strongest when the weak is vulnerable . - What does that have to do with anything ? - We 're dealing with no ordinary predator . - I thought this was just a ploy . - I think what we 've stumbled upon here is more than local authorities realize . The scenario described by that boy ? - It sounds like a primitive culling technique . - Mulder , we 're in western Florida . The closest to primitive here is living in a beachfront retirement condo . Those woods are as old as anything in the South . There 's no telling what 's alive out there . - Where are you going ? - I gotta check something out . Some work on your communication skills wouldn 't be such a bad idea . I 'll be back soon , and we can build a tower of furniture . OK ? What is it , Bo ? - Mom ? - It 's all right , Louis . You go back to sleep . Bo ? Bo ? Bo , where 'd you get to ? Bo , is that you ? Come on , boy . Let 's go back in . All right , all right . You stay there the night . Louis . Louis ! Louis ! Louis ! Louis ! - Louis ! - Mom ! Louis ! - What is it , Louis ? - It 's in the house . - How 's the boy ? - Still freaked out . I might have some insight into this invisible creature he said was chasing him . The Invisible Man was invisible . - Right . - He said the creature had glowing red eyes . Let me show you something . Mrs Asekoff said she went outside with the dog , but when she came back , the door was locked from the inside . - And ? - Look at this . We got some tracks here . - Where ? - Here . And here . Dried mud against the tile . Tracked in from the outside . - That could have been brought in by the dog . - No . See the ball of a foot here ? - A large foot . And I count five toes . - I thought you said it wasn 't human . I 'm not saying it is . The weight distribution 's all wrong . People walk heel to toe . Whatever this thing is , it walks on the ball of its foot . You 're putting me on . No . My dad and I were Indian Guides . I know these things . So if it 's not man and it 's not animal , what the hell is it ? - Guess I 'm a little late to this dance . - I found some tracks . Right here . - Same as I saw before . - Where was that ? In the woods . The weight distribution 's strange . They appear to be human , but whoever left these uses the balls of his feet , like an animal . Whatever it is , it 's attacked three grown men , presumably in broad daylight , disposing of its prey without detection . And it wasn 't shy about coming out of the woods to try again . What we 've got is a predator with low visibility and a high degree of motivation . And it 's got one advantage we don 't have : the entire Apalachicola National Forest . - Then how do you stop it ? - By identifying it . Finding it before it finds somebody else . It 's called a FLlR , for Forward Looking lnfra-Red . It was developed for chopper pilots in Vietnam . Detects body heat at 300 yards . That 's pretty sophisticated for government issue . I see you 've met Jeff , our local tech-head . Some people prefer searching with dogs , I prefer an extra pair of hands if I get in trouble . Are we ready to go ? You can put away your cellphones . Communication is with shortwave radios . So stay close , maintain visual contact . If you get lost , initiate aural contact . That means holler . If nobody responds , sit down . I 'll find you . Don 't go looking for me . I know it sounds obvious , but folks still get lost . OK . I got you . Thank you . All right . The local PD has all their resources looking out for a transient , a drifter who 's wanted for a double homicide in Gadsden , Alabama . - They 're amused by what we 're doing . - I don 't think it 's a drifter . - We may be looking for two individuals . - Why do you say that ? That thing lured that woman out of the house to separate her from her son . - But for what purpose ? - Divide and conquer . If your enemy is greater in numbers , you divide and conquer to diminish them . What enemy would that be ? Encroaching development . That 's what I suspected when I went to check on Louis . This is about a housing tract ? That survey team was staking out a new 100,000-acre plot . Civilization is pushing very hard into these woods . Maybe something in these woods is pushing back . - Anything ? - No . Nothing at all . Not even wildlife . - lsn 't that a little strange ? - Yeah . This forest is usually alive with sound . I 'm not an expert , but I 've never seen it like this before . - It sure is beautiful , though . - That 's what happens . People get to looking around , something eats ' em . What killed those men ? Nature is full of creatures trying to kill something they need to survive , or trying to avoid being killed by something that needs them to survive . If we become blinded by the beauty of it , we may fail to see its cruelty and violence . - Walt Whitman ? - No . When Animals Attack on the Fox network . Wait . I 've got something . It 's about 20 yards ahead . - Where ? I don 't see it . - It 's just sitting there . It 's on the move ! It 's moving fast ! It 's going to the right ! Wait ! There 's two of them now . They 're moving in opposite directions . There , and there . Where is it ? About 40 yards ahead of you . I don 't see it . Now it 's gone . I don 't know where it went . - What is it ? - I don 't know . They 're trying to separate us , pull us away from the others . Let 's go back . Michele ? Michele ? Mulder , I need help ! Mulder ! - Scully ! - Over here ! - Scully ! - Over here ! - What happened ? - I don 't know . - Where 's Fazekas ? - She was walking ahead of me , right here , - and then she was just gone . - I 'm getting no reading . - What the hell 's happening here ? - They separated us . That was on purpose , so they could go after her . She was in the lead , presumably the strongest . They take them first . Take them where ? You can 't just disappear out here . - You 're right . We gotta find her . - How do we do that ? I don 't know . We 'll form a line and beat the bushes . Maybe you 'll pick up a signal . No , we need help . We need manpower . That 's not gonna work out here ! We need to get outta here . Listen to me ! The longer we wait , the less chance we have of finding her . This is nuts ! This is looney tune , man . We gotta get out of these woods before it gets dark . OK , you 're right . You go back . You leave me the FLlR , and you go back . - We gotta go together . - We have to find her . Yeah , but if we stay here , they may not find any of us . Mulder , he 's right . We weren 't prepared for this . We have no way of telling them where we are , we have no food , Michele had our only water . I 'd like to find her too , but I think the risks of that are way too foolish . All right . We all go , then . You lead the way . I don 't have that much faith that this device will do us any good . So far , all it 's done is split us up . Whatever it was we were chasing did show up on the screen . - What does that tell you ? - Nothing . Except that we 're going in the right direction . Maybe it can regulate its temperature . You don 't know of any animal that can ? Ticks . They can halt their metabolism for up to 18 years , going into suspended animation until something warm-blooded comes along . That 's interesting . Why is that interesting ? 30 years ago , the town of Point Pleasant , West Virginia , was terrorized for over a year by something , killing livestock , terrorizing the people . They were described as primitive-looking men with red , piercing eyes . Became known as the " moth men . " I got an X-File dating back to 1952 on it . What would that be filed next to ? " The cockroach that ate Cincinnati " ? No , " the cockroach " is in the C 's . " Moth men " is over in the M 's . - This isn 't the way . - What do you mean ? Michele always marks her route with white stones . This is the same path . This is the way we came . I haven 't seen a stone for 20 minutes . - You 've had your nose glued to that screen . - I 'm telling you , we 're on the wrong trail ! Somehow we got offtrack . Oh , man ! This is not happening . This is not happening . Everybody stand still . There 's something out there . - Where ? - About 40 or 50 yards out . Jeff ? - Nothing . - I saw it . The woods have gone silent again . - I got it ! I got it on my screen . - Where ? About 30 yards ahead . It 's just sitting there . - What is he doing ? - Talk to him . - This is not a good idea . - Talk to him , Jeff ! Go to your right . - It just disappeared . - Mulder , it 's not on the screen . Scully , I lost it ! I got it . - Did you hit it ? - I don 't know . - It just stopped . - Where 's Glaser ? - How many shots did you fire ? - Six , maybe seven . - Is that your only clip ? - Yep . Don 't fire unless you 're sure you 're gonna hit it . It may be trying to spend our advantage . - What the hell is it , Mulder ? - I don 't know . But whatever it is , it 's smarter than us . At least out here . Mulder ? Mulder ! Scully ! Mulder ! Scully ! You OK ? You were an Indian Guide . Help me out here . Indian Guide says maybe you should run to the store and get some matches . I would , but I left my wallet in the car . - What are you doing ? - Trying to open my gun . If I can separate the shell from the casing , maybe I can get the powder to ignite . And maybe it 'll start raining weenies and marshmallows . - Do I detect a hint of negativity ? - No ! Yes , actually . Yeah . Mulder , you need to keep warm . Your body 's still in shock . I was told the best way to regenerate body heat is to crawl naked into a sleeping bag with somebody else who 's already naked . Maybe if it rains sleeping bags , you 'll get lucky . Have you ever thought seriously about dying ? Yeah , once , when I was at the ice Capades . When I was fighting my cancer , I was angry at the injustice of it . Its meaninglessness . And then I realized that that was the struggle . To give it meaning . To make sense of it . It 's like life . I think nature is supremely indifferent to whether we live or die . If you 're lucky , you get 75 years . If you 're really lucky , you get 80 years . If you 're extraordinarily lucky , you have 50 of those years with a decent head of hair . I guess it 's like Las Vegas . The house always wins . Go , girl . Hey , who did you identify with when you were a kid , Wilma or Betty ? - I identified with Betty 's bustline . - Yes , I did , too . Could never have been married to Barney , though . Their kids were cute . Yeah . But where are they today ? Moth men ? Really ? Yeah . But there seem to be only two of them . I don 't wanna wrestle . Get over here . I 'm going to try and keep you warm . Sorry . One of us has got to stay awake , Scully . You sleep , Mulder . If you get tired , you wake me . I 'm not gonna get tired . - Why don 't you sing something ? - No , Mulder . If you sing something , I 'll know you 're awake . - Mulder , I can 't carry a tune . - It doesn 't matter . Just sing anything . Jeremiah was a bullfrog Was a good friend of mine Never understood a single word he said But I helped him drink his wine Chorus . Joy to the world All the boys and girls Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea Joy to you and me Scully ? Over here . - What are you doing ? - Looking for food . I found some wild berries . I wouldn 't go far . Mulder , you never left my sight . Scully ? Scully ? Scully ! Scully ! - Down here . - Where ? I fell down a hole . You all right ? Yeah . I landed on soft earth ... kinda . What 's down there ? I don 't know . It 's pretty dark . Scully , what 's going on ? Are you OK ? - I found Michele . - Is she alive ? Not for much longer . - Mulder , we have to get her out of here . - Is there a way out ? I don 't know . I 'm in some kind of a chamber . It 's like some kind of network . - Mulder . - Yeah ? I 'm not alone . I don 't have my weapon . - Mulder ! - Hold on . I 'm gonna drop my gun down . Jeez ! Mulder , are you OK ? Don 't mind me . Scully ! Mulder , look . There has to be a scientific explanation for this . Too bad we don 't have any office furniture . If they could see us now . Go , team . 20 more bodies and we 'll win the honey-baked ham . Agent Mulder ! - We 're down here ! - We 're down here ! What are you doing down there ? - We 've got injured people down here . - We need a ladder . Right away . Hey ! Over here ! Dad 's gonna be OK . He 's gonna be OK . He 's gonna be fine . I 'm just going to say goodbye . Well ! We just got all the thanks , when you did all the work . On the contrary , Agent Kinsley . We 'd never have got involved if not for you . - Really ? - Yeah . You see this ? Oh , yeah . I pointed that out to Agent Stonecypher . There was something in the cave that Scully fell into , an inscription . - Ad noctum . - That 's Latin . It means " into darkness . " The Spanish conquistadors used to carve it on the posts that they would lash the natives to , as a warning . So who are you saying wrote this ? Ponce de Leon came here 450 years ago , looking for the Fountain of Youth . You mean you think that these ... that that body , the one that Agent Scully shot ... ? No ! After 400 years , don 't you think they 'd have adapted to their environment ? - You 're just making this up . - Why do you say that ? Cos you work on the X-Files , and you just want to write off your motel . Search and Rescue are still unable to find Jeff Glaser , or the second predator you reported . I wouldn 't be surprised if they couldn 't find them . Agent Mulder , I 'm confused . Why would they come after the boy in the house that night ? These predators have been in these woods a long time . They would perceive any encroachment on their territory as an enemy , even a little kid . But that would mean that they 'd come after any one of us that had gone into the woods , wouldn 't it ? - Where 's Agent Scully ? - She got a lift back to the motel - to pack up both your things . - She did ? Excuse me . My jacket 's in that car . Scully ! Scully ! Mulder , what 's going on ? - Let 's get outta here . - OK . - Pack everything ? - Yeah . Visiontext Subtitles : Paul Murray US english

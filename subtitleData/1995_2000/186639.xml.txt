 [ Snarling ] [ Gasping ] [ Crickets chirping ] What is it ? [ Sighing ] L ... I keep having these recurring nightmares about that underground world . Those creatures . [ Sighs ] You know , you never told me what happened with you and the Professor on that world . Yeah , you never told me what happened with you and Quinn underground . Said you didn 't want to relive it . You know , if you talk about this , it might stop the dreams . [ Sighs ] Ah , he went to ground . We 'll never find him now . Let 's head back . Come on . [ Birds chirping ] [ Whooshing ] [ Rembrandt exclaims ] Damn ! You just gonna stand there and laugh , or are you gonna help me ? Sit still . I 'll give you a hand . Laugh . Laugh . [ Quinn and Wade laughing ] I must confess , you ... you do look like a float in the Rose Parade . [ Moans ] [ Exclaims ] Sharp little devils , aren 't they ? Yeah . [ Professor grunting ] Hey , guys , check that out . [ Birds chirping ] ( Quinn ) Those planets must be in syzygy with this earth and moon . Is that good news or bad news ? ( Professor ) Well , it depends . It could mean no more than abnormally high tides . Then we better look for higher ground , huh ? Well , we 've got 3 days here . You all right ? Yeah . I think the rose bush won . [ People chattering ] Did you hear that ? Sounds human . [ Chattering continues ] No guns . Maybe they haven 't discovered gunpowder . ( man ) There 's plenty for everybody . ( Wade ) But they have discovered barbecue . ( Professor ) I wonder if they could seat a party of four . Only one way to find out . ( Brock ) Who 's this ? Stay back . I 'll go . Maybe we should 've made a reservation . [ Rumbling ] [ Woman screams ] Earthquake . [ Screams ] Haley ! No , no ! [ Wade yells ] [ Rocks thudding ] Wade ! Wade , I 've got you ! Quinn ! Hang on ! Wade , hang on ! Quinn , help ! [ Yelling ] Wade ! Wade ! Wade ! ( Professor ) Hold on ! Hold on ! No , the ground is closing ! ( Quinn ) Wade ! ( Professor ) Hold on ! [ Professor grunts ] Get out of here ! Go on ! Go ! [ People chattering ] Come back here ! Help us ! ( Quinn ) What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year , and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? ( voice ) Sliders . Wade ! ( Professor ) Tell me exactly what you saw . I tried , but she slipped through my hand . It looked like there was an air pocket down below . We must assume that she 's still alive . This is not gonna cut it . We need tools . All right , I 'll go get some . Keep digging ! I don 't think you 're going to find much by way of machinery . But we could use the extra hands ! Okay . [ Quinn panting ] [ All chattering ] Get out ! Go , go , go , go ! Hurry ! Hey , I need your help ! I need tools , shovels , whatever you have to dig with . Who are you ? Where did you come from ? Out there ? My friend 's been buried alive . Help me dig her out . Nobody digs the earth ! She 'll die down there . Then that is her fate . ( Brock ) Isn 't this the law where you live ? No . It is the law here . Keegan , maybe we should help him . No ! The Janeers said don 't dig the earth . Don 't go beyond the valley . You 've been warned . [ Electronic buzzing ] [ Machines hissing ] Quinn ! [ Metallic clanking ] Anybody ! Hello ? [ Metallic clanging ] Where are you ? Hey ! Are you all right ? Answer me ! You think there 's any chance ? We keep digging till we find her ! Any luck ? They won 't help . What ? They warned me not to dig here . Look , if she 's not down too far , we can find her . Oh , we will . Look , we need some rope and something like a shovel . If they won 't give it to us , we 'll take it . Let 's go . Had an uncle who worked the coal mines in Tennessee . He used to tell us about being in a cave-in ... Trying to make me feel better , Remmy ? I 'm trying to make myself feel better . What kind of screwed-up world is this where they won 't help people ? Gentlemen ... ( man ) Go ! Go ! [ Exhaling ] Well , it 's not your typical suburb . Just as long as they 've got a hardware store and some rope . [ Exclaims ] [ Hissing ] [ Groans ] ( Quinn ) Do you think the Syzygy is causing the earthquakes ? ( Professor ) Most certainly . Like vast tidal movements inside the earth . Keegan , you 're wrong . Do not speak . ( Rembrandt ) So , what 's the plan ? Let 's go talk to him . [ Grunts ] Don 't ! You help us , or I 'm gonna hurt you . Understand ? If I take my hand off , you won 't yell for help ? You don 't have to hurt me . I 'll help you . Why will you , when the others won 't ? Because that 's my sister and her daughter down there , and I 'll do anything to save them . Let 's go . This way . I know where we can get some equipment . [ Bird cawing ] Will you return the way you came ? Uh , yeah , I guess we will . So there is land to the east ? I don 't know . Well , then how did you get here ? Well , the truth is ... Brock . The truth is , Brock , my friends and I , we came from another world . Did the Janeers make you a world , too ? Somebody did . Was your world perfect , too ? The longer I 'm away , the more it seems that way . Then why did you ever want to leave ? I wanted to see what was out there . Me , too . If we find my sister and her child , I 'm taking them with me when we leave this place . We go this way . Whoa , whoa ! The meadow 's straight ahead . It 'll take too long to dig . There 's another way to get to her . What 's that ? I don 't know , but it goes deep into the earth . [ Crow cawing ] What could be down there that would need a ventilation shaft ? [ Sighing ] It 's not locked down . Let 's remove it . Wade ! Wade ! Wade ! What are those marks on your arm ? And your neck ? Oh , it 's , uh , it 's hives . It 's some sort of allergic reaction to the plant that scratched me . It 's unimportant . Professor , tie this around the tree . ( Professor ) You got it . You 'll need these . What are they ? Sunstalk . They grow here . The Janeers made them . All right , I 'll go first . You guys got my back ? Oh , yeah . That ground starts shaking , we 're bringing you back up . That 's good ! You got another ? It 's a long way down . [ Grunts ] Here we go . Stop ! That 's enough . Wade ! Wade ! ( Quinn ) Wade ! We don 't open the earth . We don 't go below . No , you can 't do that ! Keegan ! Where is your respect for these old ones ? They wanna help me save Haley and her baby . Where is your respect for me and the law ? Those who disobey and travel to the Forbidden Zones will die ! You are not gonna believe what 's down here . We 're gonna need more rope . Pull me up ! No ! [ Grunts ] [ Baby cries ] [ Clanging ] Wade ! ( Rembrandt ) So , what do you think about this place ? Well , it must once have been a remarkable technological civilization . What do they call them ? Janeers ? Janeers . Obviously engineers . The people who built this place were engineers . It 's just that the word became corrupted with time . Damn this rash ! It 's driving me nuts ! And it 's spreading all over the darn place . How 's yours ? It 's fine . What do you suppose happened to them ? What , the Janeers ? Yeah . I should think probably long dead . Pity they didn 't leave some medicine behind for me before they went . [ Groaning ] Mr. Brown . What do you make of this ? It 's growing out of my skin . " Seismic Shock Column , Number 6860 . North Quadrant , operational July 7 , 1972 . " Guess that 's what 's holdin ' this place up . That is a long way to fall . Multiple skull fractures . Guess it wasn 't your day , was it , pal ? All right , Wade , you 're alive . You 're not walking like you 're hurt . Wade ! I 'm going this way . Read my tracks . I 'm not wandering , I 'm moving with purpose . Come find me . Find me before something else does . Wade ! Hey , out here , help us ! What the hell is the matter with you people ? We need help in here ! Save your breath , Mr. Brown . Oh , man . It 's got me . [ Door opening ] Hey ! Open up ! Open it up ! [ Banging on door ] ( Rembrandt ) You hear me ? Where do you think you 're goin ' ? How can you listen to them and not do anything ? You already have everybody angry with you for what you did . Maybe they can tell us what to do . No , the old ones deserted us . No , they didn 't ! They went to the edge of the world to try to stop the shaking . But they never came back . ( Rembrandt ) I hear you out there ! And now we don ' t need them . We don 't ? Then tell me , why does the ground shake more each year ? Why is there not as much to eat as before ? Listen , things will get better . We just have to wait . Everyone else in the valley is gone . If we leave here , we will die ! Why do you believe that everyone who left is dead ? Because 10 years have passed , and not one person who left came back . ( Rembrandt ) We need help in here ! Now , if they found something good , don 't you think they would 've come back for us ? ( Rembrandt ) Hey ! We are safe here . I don 't feel safe . Not anymore . Not after what happened to my sister and her baby . [ Banging on door ] ( Rembrandt ) Hey , out there . We need help in here ! Hey ! I am telling you to leave them alone . ( Rembrandt ) Hey , help us ! [ Banging continues ] [ Groans ] Do you hear me ? Will you stop it ? You 're ripping the skin off ! I don 't care , damn it ! It 's itching ! It 's driving me mad ! It 's just below the surface of the skin ! Leave me alone ! All right , that 's it . I 'm tying your hands . No . No . No . Look , you cannot fight it . Yes , I can ! It 's all right . It 's all ... You don 't have the willpower ! I have the willpower ! [ Groans ] Give me your hands . All right , tight , man , tight . Yes , still . Okay . [ Yelling ] Professor . Professor . Oh , this is no good ! You 've got to put me out ! Hit me , man ! Knock me out ! Hit you with what ? With your fist , you bonehead ! Ow . [ Creatures mumbling ] [ Creatures growling ] Who 's there ? I said , who 's there ? Do you have the baby ? Where 's the baby ? Hey ! [ Shrieks ] [ Door opening ] If they find me here , we 're all in trouble . Yeah , well , no more than we are now . Look , is there something you can do for us ? This will heal you . The Janeers gave us the water . We drink it , and we don 't get sick . If we 're injured , it makes us better . Here , put this where it hurts . [ Rembrandt sighing ] Well , I 'll be damned . What is this stuff , and how does it work ? Very well . You 're telling me . [ Creature moans ] [ Moaning continues ] [ Growling ] [ Growling ] [ Screams ] Wade ! Wade ! ( Wade ) Quinn ! Wade ! ( Wade ) Quinn ! In here ! [ Growling ] You all right ? ( Wade ) Yeah . She 's been feeding the baby . The one that fell below ? Where 's the mother ? She 's dead . What a weird world , huh ? I think this has something to do with the alignment of the planets . This happened once before . I guess they saw it coming and built a second level on those big shock absorbers . I guess not everyone made it topside . It seems that the ones that stayed behind adapted pretty well . And developed a taste for the upper class . They 've become scavengers . Do you think we 're the first live ones they 've seen this close up ? Except for the baby . I can 't help but noticing that we might be outnumbered . I can 't help noticing that we might be dinner . What about the baby ? [ Rumbling ] [ Creatures mumbling ] Let 's go ! [ Creatures grunting ] [ Yelling ] [ All shrieking ] Here , take it ! ( Rembrandt ) So who takes care of everything ? ( Brock ) Takes care ? Yeah , keeping the place up . It takes care of itself . How ? The old ones told us the Janeers made our world this way . That they relocated us here so that we could have a perfect life . It 's not too perfect . That plant could 've killed us . It never had that effect on any of us . Maybe because you 're not from here . What happened to the old ones ? The last ones left a few years ago . They went to the edge of the valley to see why the world started shaking but they never came back . Look , is he gonna be all right ? Yes . How are your marks ? They 're gone . I don 't know why it affected your friend more than you . Has he been ill lately ? Wade ! Wade ! [ Creature grunting ] You should eat something . Brock said it would help you heal faster . Where is he ? I 'm anxious to get after Quinn and Wade . He said he wouldn 't be long . It 's good . Tastes like apples . I really fancy a piece of steak myself . It is steak . This is extraordinary . Anything that you can think of , it tastes like . Try it . Cheeseburger . [ Laughs ] It does . How do they do that ? I don 't know . They must have been remarkable engineers . What ? What ? Brock was wondering why you got such a bad case so quickly and I didn 't . [ Sighing ] I 'm probably , uh , more prone to allergies than you are . He said there would have to be something seriously wrong for it to hit you that hard . Well , he 's wrong . Nothing wrong with me . I 'm as strong as a horse . Are you ? Been times on other worlds where you were not quite yourself . In San Francisco , when Quinn met himself as a boy , that was ... that was the first time I noticed that something was wrong . And then in the desert , when we were helping the girl get home . And now . You gotta level with me , man . If there 's something wrong , you owe it to us to tell . Why ? Why should I ? Aren 't I allowed any privacy ? Because while we 're on this journey together , we 're gonna have to depend on each other . I thought we were friends . Friends don 't keep secrets . [ Sighing ] Well ... Well , the good news is , I don 't think I 'm going to die today . Then you have something ? I went and saw a doctor in San Francisco . I have a terminal illness and there is nothing that anyone can do for me . [ Sighing ] Who else knows ? Quinn ? Wade ? Quinn . Because he could handle it , and I couldn 't ? No , not at all . He found out . Really nice to know where I stand with you . We must go quickly so they don 't find us . Yeah . Let 's just go . Mr. Brown . [ Sighs ] [ Rembrandt grunting ] One of us should wait here . All right , I 'll stay behind . I 'm not fully over my nettle rash yet . Take care , Mr. Brown . Make sure you get out . All right . [ Grunts ] Oh , yeah , this is a great idea . Going underground while the earth is still shaking . Okay , hold it . [ Brock grunting ] ( Rembrandt ) Man , this is one big freaking basement . Quinn ! Wade ! Quinn ! Wade ! Haley ! [ Metallic clanging ] Wade ! Q-Ball ! Haley ! Haley ! [ Yelling ] Quinn ! [ Grunting ] [ Screams ] Wade ! Remmy . Where 's Q-Ball ? Where 's my sister ? She 's dead . What ? I-I 'm sorry . She died in the fall . There was nothing I could do . We got to hurry . There 's some creatures after me . Who ? Those guys . What the hell are those things ? They live down here . We hunt them above for food . ( Wade ) Looks like we 're the hunted now . ( Rembrandt ) Not if I can help it . [ Grunts ] [ Creature grunting ] I was gonna say you guys wouldn 't believe what I 've been doing . But I think you 've got me beat . Where 's the Professor ? He 's up top , waiting for us . May I have the baby ? Thank you for saving her . How much time we got ? Uh ... [ creature growling ] ( Quinn ) Go ! Go ! ( Rembrandt ) Hey ! Get going ! [ Creatures grunting ] [ Baby crying ] ( Wade ) Shh . You have got to keep her quiet . Maybe she 's hungry . I can 't do anything about that . Let me see her . What do you know about babies ? I happened to be the highest grossing babysitter in my neighborhood . Let me see her . You changed diapers ? Nine seconds was my personal record . Give me the kid . Careful . Come on . [ Shushing ] [ Crying stops ] That 's a girl . Still got it . So how much did you get ? 75 cents for the first kid . 50 cents , each additional head . I give them a discount if I drop the kid . Good thing they bounce . You really like kids . Yeah . I wanna have a big family . I missed out on having a brother or a sister to play with . You need somebody to share things with when you 're growing up . Yeah , I know . That 's why I wanna have at least three . I wanna have five . Five ? I hope you like stretch marks . Why five ? Then I 'd have my own basketball squad . And how 's the great procreator gonna pay for college , huh ? I 'll just give them a timer when they graduate high school and tell them to go slide for four years . They 'd learn a lot more . Hey , guys , no sign of the creatures . We can go now . All right . We 've got an hour . Let 's go . [ Baby crying ] [ Creaking ] Easy now , gentlemen , easy . [ Baby crying ] Don 't remember inviting them to join us , do you ? Not me ! Go ! Twenty minutes . What are they doing ? Basic math ? I 'll take the big one . They 're all big . [ Creatures grunting ] Go ! Go ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Hurry . Hurry ! [ Creature yelling ] Move it ! Come on . [ All grunting ] [ Howling ] ( Keegan ) You wouldn 't listen to me , would you ? You came to the Forbidden Place . But you said this man was dead . I guess he was wrong . All of you who disobeyed will die ! And you 'll all die if you stay here . We will not leave this valley . You must leave this place . I don 't know what 's out there , but you can 't stay here . Look , there 's another city below you and one day this will all fall down . It 's true . I saw it with my own eyes . Those creatures you hunt , they live underground . I think they were like you once , but got trapped below when the Janeers relocated everyone . We must leave . And who will come with me ? Don 't you understand ? You will all die . [ Cooing ] I 'm telling you , there is nothing out there ! Quinn , will you come with us ? We 're going in a different direction . Come with us , Keegan . We do not go beyond . We do not open the earth . Those are the rules . Not anymore . Goodbye . You realize , your children will die if you stay here . We can 't save everyone . Then I guess we 'll just have to look out for each other . Mr. Brown , I want you to know that I count myself very fortunate having you as a friend . Oh , man . See , now I 'm gonna have to be nice to you . Oh , we don 't have to create a precedent . Wait here . [ Whooshing ] You never really dropped a baby , did you ? No . [ Whooshing ] It 's a good thing they bounce . [ Grunting ] [ Growling ] [ Creature continues growling ] [ Both grunting ]

 Oh , sign here . What ? No , no . I requested a vault and a pommel horse . I 'll kill myself on this . Dean Albright requested it . She did ? Mary ! Mary ! You 're coming back to me ! Uh , Dick , I 'm kind of busy . Of course . Busy resigning from your post as Dean ! Oh , Mary , now we 'll have time again . Time for us . Let 's go ! Dick , I 'm not resigning . But the desk in my office- - ouroffice . Oh , that . It 's for Dr. Ravelli , our new professor of comparative literature . She 's from Harvard . Harvard . How nice . I 'm sure I memoed you about it . So it 's come to that , has it ? I 'm now nothing more to you than a tiny " cc " at the bottom of a memo . Just another name on the distribution list , dictated but not read . Dick , you know that 's not true . Do I ? Oh , I 'm sorry . I 've been terribly busy . How about we spend some time together ? Tonight . Just the 2 of us . Really ? Absolutely . I 'll bring the wine . Say , uh , 6 : 00 ? You 've got the roundtable on tenure . 7 : 00 steering committee . 8 : 00 ? Well , you 're open , but I could make something up . 8 : 00 . 8 : 00 . I 'll see you at my place . Oh , and , uh , Lucy ... what are you doing at 8 : 00 ? Nothing . That 's right . Tommy , could you get me a bottle of bourbon from the back room ? Yeah , you got it . Hey , hey , hey , Harry . I don 't mind your underage nephew helping out around the bar here , but I 'm not paying him . Oh , no , that 's Ok . I work for beer . All right . So , Eric , uh , how long have you been working with Don ? Just a couple of weeks . I 'm--I 'm waiting to get into the k-9 unit . Oh , what 's the holdup ? Well , our--our dog ran away . But we 're putting up fliers . So , Eric , when do I get to meet your girlfriend ? Uh ... I don 't have one right now . You don 't have a girlfriend ? No . Why ? Is there something weird about you ? No . Sally , come on . Eric just hasn 't met the right girl , that 's all . Well , we 're gonna have to do something about that . Don : uh ... why ? I don 't know . I mean , we 're so happy together . I just want to see all our single friends to be just like us . Oh ... ah , I don 't think you want to do that , Sally . Yeah , I definitely do . Is there any way I can stop you ? I don 't think so . Oh ... look , I 'm really not looking- - you know , this isn 't about you . Hey , Harry , check this thing out . Ohh ! A hand truck . Good for you . Look what 's on the hand truck . What the hell is that ? Oh , that 's an old bar game . The " love tester . " It 's been busted for years . Well , can I fix it ? Knock yourself out . Well , what does it do ? Well , it tells you how good a lover you are . Oh , how ? You make love to it ? No , you--you just put your hand on it . Then after a couple of dates , you make love to it . No , you just put a nickel in it . Wow . A nickel for all that lovin ' . She 's 3 hours late ! Now , Dick , just calm down . It 's reprehensible ! She 's a very busy woman . It 's so insulting ! Dick , calm down . I can 't ! Now , don 't do this to yourself . You 're worth more than this . Mary : ♪ hello ♪ how dare you ! Oh , Dick , I 'm so sorry . The tenure committee bumped into the steering committee , and then the wheels came off . Oh . Well , thanks to you , I had to eat both our dinners , and I 'm uncomfortably full ! You know , it 's just as well . That new professor , Dr. Ravelli , just got into town , and I told her I 'd take her out for drinks . Oh , Ravelli ! It 's bad enough she 's taking over half my office . Now this ! She 's ruining everything . I want her to go away ! Oh , come on , Dick . She 's very nice . You 're going to like her . No , I won 't ! I want things to be like they used to be , Mary . Make love to me , right here on this table , like we always used to want to do . Oh , Dick , I 'd love to , but I 've got to run . How about tomorrow ... Ok . No , I 've got an 8 : 00 . Thursday 's no good . I 'll pencil you in for a week from Monday . Oh , good . A week from Monday , 8 : 30 . Good . Quarter of 9 : 00 . Good . 9-Ish . Bye . Good . Bye-bye . A week from Monday ! Well , at least she 's making an effort . Oh . I see you 're getting ready for the arrival of professor Mcbitch ! Her name is Ravelli . Oh , and my caustic joke on her name is " Mcbitch . " Hmm ... that 's clever . " Hello , I 'm professor Mcbitch . [ With Boston accent ] I come from Harvard . " How snooty ! She 's probably told all her Harvard cronies how she 's crowding out that Solomon bumpkin . Bumpkin- - how dare she call me that ! And this is your office . Oh , uh , Jennifer Ravelli , meet Dick Solomon . [ Very British ] Oh , helloo . Oh , what a delightfully eclectic sense of décor you have . Ah , the mockery begins . Oh , I love it ! How whimsical ! Ok , the potato man ... we don 't touch that . Ah , Jennifer , have you met your assistant Nina Campbell ? Uh , Dick , maybe you could take Jennifer on a tour of the campus later on . Oh , fine . But we 'll have to walk . [ Hillbilly accent ] My rusty old tater truck 's in the shop , and I plum forgot my mule . Ha ha ha . Play nice . So you teach literature , Dr. Ravelli ? The classics--Chaucer , Moliére , Cervantes ... so you read books for a living . And they pay me . Imagine ! [ Mocks her laugh ] Soooo-eeeee . Pig , pig , pig , pig . Nina ! Aah ! Sally ! Funny running into you here , huh ? Uh-huh . Hey ! It just occurred to me . I have the perfect guy for you . His name is Eric . He 's great . You gotta meet him . Really ? Well , what 's he like ? He 's like ... a guy . You gotta meet him . Well , how old is he ? I don 't know . Old enough , if that 's what you 're worried about . Well , is he black ? Uh , does it matter ? No , but it would be nice , though . Then he 's black ! Are you sure ? Uh ... yep , he 's black . Isn 't that great ? Great . Oh , great . Well , Harry , thanks to my selfless efforts , right about now , Nina and Eric are probably doing ' it . It 's only 7 : 00 . They 're probably still in the restaurant . Ooh . Hope they got a booth . All right . Ok , I think I fixed it . Let 's try it out . Machine : ♪ nyah nyah ♪ " cold fish " ? I thought I had it working . Here , let me try it . [ Bell dings ] " Hot stuff . " Looks like it 's working to me . Out of my way . ♪ Nyah nyah ♪ this doesn 't make any sense . Hmm . Well , don 't worry about it , Tommy . It probably just means that I 'm a lot sexier than you are . [ Bell dings ] Ladies . Good morning , Dr. Solomon . Good morning . I think perchance we picked a wrong foot off which to start . So allow me this olive branch , if you will , in the form of a cappuccino . Oh , thank you . I don 't know about you , but I like my " cappies " as I like my entendres- - [ Speaking French ] Double . And I like my " cappies " as I like my French farces- - scalding yet frothy . What are those ? Oh , just a few books from my collection . Some illuminated manuscripts I picked up in wales last summer and a first edition of pride and prejudice . Oh , impressive . Ah , that 's leather . Oh , I 'm sorry . That 's over 100 years old . I 'm sorry . That 's gilt ! Sorry . That , too ! And ... hand-stenciled ! Don Quixote . Yes , it 's very rare . " Sin su general y el Castillo sin su castellano ... " very good . But you don 't get the full impact unless you hear it in its true dialect . Castillian . Castillian ? Well , if I may ... [ Lisps ] " Sin su general y el Castillo " sin su castellano . Así como suele decirse ... " I thee . Nina ! Aah ! Sally ! You sure are around here a lot , aren 't you ? I work here . What are you doing here ? Great , yeah . I hear that- - by the way , uh ... how was your date with Eric ? Oh , it was fun . Did I not tell you he 's a great guy ? Yes , you did . Yes , I did ! All right , when are you going to see him again ? Oh , I don 't think I 'm going to , but thanks . He really is nice . What ? No , no . You-you 're talking crazy . We just didn 't spark . I 'm sorry , Sally . Not acceptable . And once again . [ Lisping ] " La mujer casada y moza sin su marido . " No , make the tongue heavier . [ Castillian ] Casada . Cathada . Sin su marido . Thin Thu marido . Roll the " R. " It starts in the back of the throat an slowly off the tongue and off the lips . Marrrrrido . Yes . I have a class . We 'll pick this up later . Oh , yes , please . You 're a very inspiring teacher . With very shiny hair . I 'll see you later . Oh , have a nice class . Bye-bye . Good luck . Have a nice class . So did you manage to go 5 minutes without biting Dr. Ravelli 's head off ? Oh , yes . In fact , she 's perfectly nice . Delightful woman . I love her . I love her ? ! What 's the matter with me ? What have I done wrong ? You haven 't done anything wrong . No , I have ! Earth 's not supposed to work this way . I know how it works . You love one person . For me , that 's Mary . That 's the one hard , solid fact I 've always been able to count on . And now there 's this Jennifer . What 's going on ? Aw , this planet 's screwy ! Oh , I mean , Nina and Eric are made for each other , but I can 't get them to see it . Well , you guys , maybe it 's time to give up . I don 't know the meaning of the words " give up . " Well , " give " is a verb meaning- - I know the meaning of the words ! I just don 't know what 's what anymore ! How can love work this way ? It 's totally random . It 's just electricity . You can 't control it . It doesn 't mean anything . You really think that 's true ? Of course it 's true . That 's just the way the machine works . " Cold fish . " Aah ! Well , Dick , maybe it 's the office , you know . Maybe you 're destined to fall in love with whoever you share the office with . That 's ridiculous . If loved worked that way , there 'd be office romances all over the place . Businessmen having affairs with their secretaries . Please ! I can 't let this happen . No matter how tempting Jennifer is , I must be strong ! I loosened it for you . Dick ? Dick ! [ Squeaks ] Dick ! [ Rings ] [ Whispers ] Hello . Yes . No , I can 't talk right now . I 'll have to call you back . Dick , you scamp ! [ Yelps ] What game is this , then ? I-I-I 'm sorry , Jennifer . I can 't really talk just now . I have a lot of work , as you can see . No , no . I see , yes . Back to the salt mines . Ha ha . That 's right . Why won 't you look at me ? Oh , I 'm not not looking at you . Yes , you are . No , I 'm not , and besides , I have excellent peripheral vision . You never really know what I 'm looking at . All right . What 's that I smell ? Oh , is that me ? I wore perfume today . Antonia 's flowers ... a scent of the hamptons . Is it too strong ? No , no . It 's quite nice . In fact , it 's ... delicately , delightfully , teasingly ... stinking ! It 's giving me a headache . Please go away . I 'm sorry , Dick . I 'm sorry . [ Laughing ] What 's so funny ? Oh , it 's Moliére . Oh , I--I never read him . Oh , you must . Listen . " Girl , you talk to much , and , I 'm afraid , you 're far too saucy for a lady 's maid . " Amusing , no ? No ! Well , then , why are you laughing ? Oh , I don 't know . You make me ... oh , I don 't know ... excuse me ! Mary ! Mary ! You 're got to move Jennifer out of my office . Dick , I don 't have time for this . Well , you 've got to make time . Ok . What 's she doing that 's so horrible ? Well ... Ok , well ... well , she wears this perfume . I--I try to work but I--there it is , wafting all the way over to my desk . Wafting ... uh-huh . Well , she--she--she has this laugh . It 's infectious . Like a disease ! Yeah ? Ok , uh , this might not sound like much , but she touches her hair a lot . And--and--and ... oh , never mind . Dick , you wanted her out before you even met her . If you just got to know her a little better- - no , Mary , please , help me , before our whole world comes crashing down around our heads . Dick , you 're an adult . If you have a problem with her , deal with it yourself . But , Mary , I can 't- - [ Telephone rings ] Oh . Hello ? Oh , thank you for calling back . Yes . It 's about the 3 : 00 meeting . I can 't possibly make it until 3 : 45 . Is that a problem ? Oh ... well , could you possibly coordinate with them and find out if they can make it at 3 : 45 ? Ok . Favorite foods . Nina ? Can you believe this ? Did she tell you there was a party ? She told me open sushi bar . Listen , guys , I had no idea that she was gonna do this . I can 't say that I 'm surprised , but I had no idea . Ok , come on , guys . Let 's focus here ! Ok , turnons , turnoffs . Sally , I have to warn you , I 'm about to scratch your eyeballs out ! Sally , can we powwow for a moment ? Aah ! Can you believe this ? Unreal . I mean , jeez , I already told her our date sucked . Isn 't that enough ? Excuse me . Sucked ? Sucked ? Did I say sucked ? Yeah , it sucked . Sally ! They 're not into each other . Just let it be . No , Don , I know what I 'm doing . I just want them to be as happy as we are . But we--we weren 't forced together , Sally . We came together naturally . I mean , you were this- - this ... huge boulder , and I was this tiny drop of water . And it took time , but I kept dripping- - drip , drip , drip- - until I wore you down . Yeah , you did . And now look at us . You 're still a boulder , but I 've worn a nice little crease in you . Oh , you 're right , Don . If Eric and Nina are gonna find love , they 're just gonna have to do it on their own . ♪ Nyah nyah ♪ hey ... why so blue , little buddy ? I 'm a cold fish . I 'm destined to live my life alone , unable to ignite the faintest flicker of lust in any woman . Oh , yeah , I know how you feel . [ Bell dings ] How can you know how I feel ? You 're hot stuff ! The world 's your freakin ' oyster , man ! Tommy ! Aah ! Oh ! Jennifer . Dick , you scared me well-Nigh to death . I 've been waiting for you . For me ? We have to nip this thing in the bud .

It 's basically a monopoly , and the service is pretty good . But I can 't ! I can 't ! And that 's going to have to be final ! I had no idea . Oh , Dick ! I 've never thought of you that way . You haven 't ? No . Oh , good . Until ... you said that . I would never have dared dream that I could ignite a passion in such a distinguished mind as yours . Distinguished ? Oh , yes ! I didn 't mean for this to happen . I didn 't mean for any of this to--to--to happen . " Hope is a lover 's staff . Walk hence with that and manage it against despairing thoughts .

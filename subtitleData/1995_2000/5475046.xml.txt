 What happened ? What did you do ? Dick , he touched it ! What the heck is going on here ? You almost made me spill my Joe . That noise , Don- - what is it ? All right , everyone , there 's no need to panic . This has been a test of the emergency broadcast system . - Why ? Is there an emergency ? - No . This has only been a test . Had this been an actual emergency , you would have been instructed on where to go in your area for shelter . - Shelter from what ? - Bombs . - To interrupt a program of this quality under the guise of national security is preposterous ! Ooh , look . It 's back on . Hmm , x-files . Never really got it . I know . It 's so inaccurate . Say , Sally , how 's about tomorrow night I buy you the biggest steak in town ? How 's about you throw in a baked potato ? How 's about you wear that red dress ? - How 's about you pick me up at 8 : 00 ? - How 's about I come early ? How 's about you let us watch our show ? Oh , look at this . I bet they break the genetic code and realize scully 's been implanted by the smokin ' guy . Oh , look at that ! The alien just put a probe in that guy 's ear . Everybody knows you can 't get a brain scan through the ear . You got to go through the butt . You know , I bet I could write a killer x-files . I could write one in my sleep . - I could write one hanging upside-down . - I could write one with crayon . I could write one if I lost both my arms and had to type with my feet . - I could write one- - - I want to watch one ! Why don 't you shut up and go write one ? Fine , then . We will . Come on , Harry . - Yeah , come on . - Good ! And when it 's on Tv , I 'll talk all through the damn thing , see how you like it ! Someone should take the probe out of his butt . So sad when a colleague leaves . You know , you really feel as though a part of yourself- - so , Sonja , it 's a shame we didn 't have time to get to know each other better . Uh , yes , 15 years goes by rather quickly , doesn 't it ? Yeah . So , uh ... why 'd you decide to take that job at Columbia ? Um , well , my mind was made up once I found out that they had the only unpublished collection of the early geometry writings of Nicolai Lobachevsky . That would be my major reason for relocating . - Can we take more than one ? - Oh , take as much as you want . Nobody 's gonna show up to this thing . You two should be ashamed of yourselves . Poor Sonja Umdahl has wasted years of her life in this stuffy , mildewed book mausoleum . The least you could do is wish her well . Yeah ! Shame on you ! Uh , good-bye , Sonja . Well , she doesn 't have many friends , does she ? No , she 's just shy and introverted , weird . Go introduce yourself . Oh , no , Mary ! Some of the students said that she has spiders in her hair ! Get over there ! Ah ! Morgan 's physical basis of heredity . It 's a quick read , although I did find the footnotes intrusive . - Me too . - Dick Solomon , physics department . Sonja Umdahl . I knew you two would get along ! Well , thanks for coming . And staying . - So , uh , let 's go . - No , no , no , no . I got an idea . Let 's do this right . Sonja , why don 't you come over to my house tonight , say , uh , 7 : 00 , and we 'll fix a going-away dinner for you . - I 'll bring dessert . - Great ! Well , um- - hi , uh , excuse me . I 'm looking for somebody , a big , strapping guy , handsome . - He 's a cop . - Hi . - Here I am . - Good for you . I 'm looking for somebody . Sally ? It 's me , Don . Don ? Did you shave your mustache ? I never had a mustache . Are you wearing contacts ? No , Sally , I 'm wearing my glasses . - Are they new ? - Not since eighth grade . - In strictly quantum terms . - Of course . And just like you can have quarks and anti-quarks- - and neutrinos and anti-neutrinos . Wait a minute . Isn 't a neutrino a breakfast bar ? You were saying ? You can actually have a particle that doesn 't have a counterpart- - but is an energy all to itself - which exist simultaneously as its own opposite . - Right . - Both : the photon ! - Yes ! Oh , Dr. Solomon ! - You are a fountain of knowledge . - And you ... are a puddle of smartness . Okay , that 's it . Party 's over . Drive her home . Mary , it 's so early . I wanted to hear Sonja 's thoughts on refraction . Well , I 'm sure it wouldn 't be that interesting . Oh , Sonja , I 'm sure it 's fascinating , but I 'd rather go to bed . So have a nice flight , drive , life , whatever . I 'm so glad we met . And I 'm so glad you don 't have spiders in your hair . Okay , Harry , the first scene is critical . We have to hook the viewers with something exciting . How about a picnic ? - Picnics aren 't exciting . - I 've been to some exciting picnics . We need something to get the juices flowing . Maybe we should just start with a fight . Ooh ! I bet that might just work . " Scully ... and Mulder ... at a picnic . " - Good morning . - Yes , isn 't it ? The air is crisp . Dew is on- - where the hell have you been ? I took Sonja home , and we were having so much fun that I spent the night . - Did you have sex with her ? - No ! I only do that with you ! And sometimes Farrah fawcett in my head . Mary , all we wanted to do was talk . A man and a woman cannot connect intellectually without eventually connecting with their connectors . Are you saying that just because Sonja and I share the same intellectual interests , we 're destined to share the same bed ? - Yes . - But that 's ridiculous ! Sonja 's far too intelligent to have sex with me . - Here you go . - Thank you . Nina , do you have many men friends ? - Oh , yeah , lots . - And they 're just friends ? You don 't ... you know . Then , no . I think Sonja Umdahl likes Dick . So ? A man would have to be a lunatic to be attracted to that woman . - Uh-oh . - Oh , no , Nina . I trust Dick , I really do , but ... there 's something about that woman that bothers me . - Want to know what I heard ? - What ? Sometimes if you peek through the library window - and she doesn 't know you 're looking , - Yeah ? You can catch her with snakes moving all over her head . Just moving all over her head . Snakes and mo- - oh , and then I rinse and then I repeat and then I rinse and then I 'm done . Oh , hello , Sonja . I thought you moved . Um , soon , soon . I 'm just tying up dead ends . Great . I , uh , understand you and Dick had an interesting conversation last night . - Oh , he told you ? - Dick tells me everything . Uh , what she needs to know is , are you after Dick Solomon , yes or no ? Oh , my god ! Is that what you think ? That I want your boyfriend ? Uh , yeah . Oh , I 'm so sorry . I never should have kept talking , boring him with my thoughts . Please forgive me . You 're the only friend I have . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . I 'm still your friend . - So 's Dick . - ' Kay . Do you want to go get a cup of coffee ? No , I 'll just stay here for a moment . I have to get my thoughts together . Oh , oh , okay , honey . I hope you 're happy ! You made her cry ! Hello , professor . Sonja , I thought you left . I couldn 't leave , Dr. Solomon . I couldn 't leave you . Oh , I 'll be all right . You can pretend all you want , professor , but Sonja sees through your little char-r-Ade . - Take me ! - Sonja , I can 't do this with you ! This is what Mary is for . Ah , come on ! Do you mean to tell me you always talk calculus with women you 're not attracted to ? Now , Sonja is itchy ! Scratch her ! Dick , I just want you to know I spoke with Sonja today . - You did ? I didn 't . - She considers us to be just good friends- - that 's all she wants . Then why did she try to do unspeakable things to me ? - What ? - Right here on this desk ! Things that only you do ! Not nearly often enough . - I can 't believe it ! - Believe it , Mary . She wants me ! And not just my mind . She wants my body , my beautiful body ! I can 't believe that woman stood in my office and lied to me ! But I resisted her , Mary . I told her I wasn 't interested in her that way . - I should hope so ! - I told her to get right out of our office . Good for you ! - And I promised to see her tonight . - What ? - It was the only way I could get rid of her . - The only way ? Did you try a fire hose ? No , but I did tell her to put her blouse back on . That was quick thinking , right ? You know , I 'm beginning to wonder if you 're as committed to this relationship as I am . Look , tonight I 'm gonna tell her I can 't see her anymore . Good , 'cause it 's either me ... or the spider woman . Oh ! I 'm the devil 's candy ! Sally ? Yeah ? I been thinking about what happened last night . Well , here 's what I 'm thinking . I 'm thinking I 'm a starving woman , and you 're the blue-plate special at the beef ' n ' griddle . You had me worried . I thought we took the midnight train to splits-ville . Well , we may have crossed signals at the last junction , but now we 're back on track . All aboard . Whoo , whoo . Okay , they run down the hallway- a government agent is waiting . - He shoots . - His hits the agent- - - But he 's wearing a bulletproof vest . - Mulder runs . - The agent follows . - He traps Mulder in the hallway . - Both : he kills Mulder ! - You 're brilliant . - Oh , thank you . And you 're a genius . - True , but you 're the best . - Back at you . And you are super . Both : we 're both great ! All right , let 's get that down . Okay , buddy . - What 'd we say ? - I don 't remember . Dr. Solomon , I knew you 'd come . Sonja , I-I- - I have something to tell you . You are a brilliant , beautiful , fascinating woman . - Let 's go to bed . - All right . No , no , no . What I mean is , I 'm sorry if I 've misled you in any way , but my heart , my mind , and Mr. Wiggly all belong to Mary Albright . Oh , really ? Then I have something to tell you , my darling , but my words would be hollow unless sung .

I found it tedious . Maybe that 's because I was with you . Oh , Don , this isn 't working . Yeah , I kinda got that vibe . I 'm sorry , Don . I 'm sorry too . Oh , look . The sun came out . Yeah , but not for us . Well , good bye , Sally . It was nice ... while it lasted . Good bye , Don . Hold on a minute there , big guy ! Maybe I 've , uh , been a little hasty . Freeze ! I may not have officially made detective yet , but I think I 've figured out what 's going on here . You 're not in love with me . You 're in love with the uniform . Could you be right ? Could my attraction to you be completely superficial ? I 'm afraid so . What does this mean for us , Don ? I 'll tell you what it means . It means you never see me out of uniform again . Hot dog ! And you know , I 've got a hat too . Wear it . - Oh , it 's you . - Hello , Sonja . I just spoke to Dick . I believe we have a problem . I don 't see your boyfriend wanting me as a problem . Let 's get down to business , shall we ? - No ! - Dick , I told you to wait in the car ! I can 't allow women to fight over me . Not even if they 're wearing bikinis in a big tub of mud ! Mmm . We 're not going to fight . Let 's just settle this once and for all , shall we ? Dick , are you interested in Sonja romantically ? Well , she 's very smart and very attractive- - - Dick ! - But no , Mary , I love you . There you have it . Game over . The game 's not over till I say it 's over . - Is the game over ? - No . Sonja , stay away from my man ! He 'll be mine soon . Not while I 'm still breathing . Then I 'll just have to stop you from breathing , won 't I ? Listen , um- - wait , wait- - hold it- can 't we please just be friends ? Someone use a fist ! I give ! I give ! Game over . Let 's go . Oh ! Oh , my god ! Mary ... I am so turned on ! Ah , my little tigress . Once again I must tell you how magnificent you were . I was pretty terrific , wasn 't I ? Dick , does Sonja have something I don 't have ? Oh , yes , a gargoyle door-Knocker . I mean , do I stimulate you enough intellectually ? Oh , Mary . - No . - What ? Nobody does . But that 's not what I want from you , Mary . I want to hear about your day , what you had for lunch , why you got so mad at the dry cleaners , your charmingly misguided theories on evolution . Your voice , Mary , I want to hear your beautiful voice . - Thank you . - Mary ? What ? You 're hurting my hand . Well , that 's it- - two and a half pounds of x-files gold . - Let 's send it off . - Pleasure working with you , my man . - Effortless . - Seamless . You know , it 's times like these it makes me proud to be an alien posing as a human being writer . Times like these I wish I 'd numbered the pages .

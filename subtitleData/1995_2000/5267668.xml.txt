 That 'll never be enough time to find your brother . Well , assuming this is the right world , he could be anywhere on it . No . The coordinates I programmed match the numbers I got in the encoded message I was left by my real parents . The denominator that I thought was so strange must be some kind of focused coordinate , like a tracking device for a sliding trace signature . You know , one of these days , we 're gonna slide into a world where all they speak is Greek . You 're gonna fit right in . It took me a while to figure it out , but when we slide from one dimension to another , we leave a trail , like , uh , quantum tire tracks . We 've got to assume that my brother is the only other person on this world with such a signature . Hey , guys , check this out . Whoa ! Hey ! Whoa ! Ow ! Hey , hey , hey , you all right ? Yeah , I am all right . That was a close one . Kill him ! Let 's get him ! We 've had enough of this ! Our children are frightened . Our cattle have torn down their fences ! My sheep are scattered over 10 acres ! Well , let 's just burn his wings ! No ! Let 's just shoot him and get it over with ! I don 't think so . Great . We 're gonna get beat up by the cast of " Witness . " Break it up ! All of you , get back to your farms . John , William , Abel ! Back to your farms ! You ought to be ashamed of yourselves ! Now ! Hey . Lucky for you I came along . Much obliged , Sheriff . I 've not seen you three before . We 're just passing through . We saw this man crash and we wanted to help him . What sort of clothing is that ? We 're from Canada . Well , one of these days , you 're gonna go too far , Colin Mallory . Now , clean up this mess and get back to town . Quietly . Thank you for your help . Not a problem . Look , uh , I really don 't know how to say this without it being a shock , but we 're a little short on time . I 'm your brother . What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? I know you must be sincere in your belief that we 're brothers , and I can see some resemblance , but I 'm afraid it 's impossible . Surely , my mother and father would have told me if I had a brother , if it were true . They did . You just haven 't gotten the message yet . Guys ! What you 're saying makes no sense to me . My parents died when I was a child . Did they leave you anything ? Yes , but I 've moved many times over the years . Some things got lost or left behind . Oh , brother . You 've got to have what I 'm looking for . You 're welcome to come to my house . And you can stay if you have need . Look , you 're just gonna leave the wings back there ? I 'll come back later with a wagon . Aren 't you afraid someone will steal it ? Uh , no . Scoundrel . Hey ! Where do you people come from ? It 's a little complicated . I 've never seen anyone dressed like you . Likewise . It 's the nineties version of the simple life . No wires going to the houses , no pavement , the only vehicles are wagons . Maybe this is Amish world . Amish ? It 's a kind of religious community that lives in total isolation . They 've completely turned away from modern science . We 're nothing like that . We have all the latest conveniences . Well , not all . So , what do you do when you 're not trying to break your neck on a hang glider ? Hang glider ? That 's an excellent name for my flying machine . I , uh , invented it , you know . Neighbor . You don 't seem to be too popular around here . So you 're an inventor ? Tinkerer , jack-of-all-trades . I dabble in mechanics and electricity . Obviously , they don 't get it . They don 't understand my work . Especially my experiments with electricity . Once , during a thunder storm , I trapped a lightning bolt in a stone jug . A regular Ben Franklin . And my hair stood on end for a week . Well , I can see why your neighbors would think you 're a little strange . They 're hide-bound and misguided . I can prove to them that electricity provides a good power , and it 's safe , too ! But they have no patience . A lot of things go wrong like , uh , with the hang glider ? So I fried a few chickens . Good day , Miss Henley . Sarah , stay with me . David , come on . Colin ! I am so glad to see you well . I was worried . Did you crash again ? Only a little . I was not hurt . Sorry , these are my new friends . I don 't know your names . I 'm Quinn . This is Maggie and this is Rembrandt . I am Susanna Morehouse . Welcome to El Segundo . I have never seen clothes like this . Did you make them ? No . These are probably what you 'd call store-bought . Beautiful . But I could never wear anything like that . Sure you could . Susanna ! Get back in the house , child . I told you to stay away from this devil and necromancer . I am not a necromancer , Mrs. Morehouse , and you know how I feel about your daughter . I know , and I disapprove . My daughter is promised to another and there 's the end of it . Who on Earth are you ? Look , we 're just passing through . Where did you get such outrageous attire ? We 're from Canada . Oh . You 'd best cover up , young lady . The women in these parts are more modest . The men in these parts might get the wrong impression . You stay away from Colin Mallory . It 's the devil 's work he 's doing . What 's a necromancer ? I don 't know , but it can 't be good . Mind yourself , now ! Amazing . This is a Wimshurst machine ! One of the first gizmos to generate electricity by induction and store it in jars like these . And you invented this ? Yes , and everything else in here . My brother 's a genius . Yeah , well , I 'm happy for you , but we 're running out of time here . Marley 's Ghost ! How do you get the numbers to light up like this ? Yeah , I 'll explain that later . You remember I said I might be able to prove that you 're my brother ? Now , our parents left me a very important message , and they probably left you a similar message . Okay , now , you said your family left you some things , trinkets , doodads . Let me see this . Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Come on , come on , come on ! It 's not in here . Anything else ? Um , let 's see . My father 's watch ? Let me see . Come on , it 's very important . Remmy , how much time do we have ? Under 10 minutes . Got it . Quinn ! Oh , Quinn ! No , no , no . Come ... Quinn . It 's not there , either . Quinn , on Earth Prime your mother had the chip in her arm . Oh , right , right , right . Do you have , like , a sharp knife ? Oh ! You are mad , are you not ? Look , what we are looking for is a chip . It 's a microdot . It 's about this big . Did they leave you anything this big ? Um ... Maybe ... It was my mother 's . I 'll be careful . Nothing . Yes ! Okay . You 've got to put this on your forehead . Please , trust me . Actually , you better lie down for this . MO THER . Hello , our precious son . There is a great civil war raging on our world . Kromaggs now control more than half of our planet , and the lands they 've conquered have been decimated , their peoples enslaved or killed . And that 's why we 've made the painful decision to place you with our duplicates on parallel worlds as foster parents to ensure your safety . Quinn , it almost blew your mind and you were already aware of travel between worlds . I 'm not from this Earth . Now he 's getting to the good part . Colin . Colin , listen to me . You 're not crazy , okay ? You 're not crazy . It may seem that way , but believe me , it 's all true . Now , our birth parents came back for me . My foster mother told me all about it . She hid me because she couldn 't bear to part with me . Now , our real parents may have come back here for you , but because your foster parents died , that would explain why they never found you . My father . My mother . Everything in my life was a lie . Did you love them ? Did they love you ? Yes . Then it was not a lie . But there is a greater truth , and you just saw that . Hey , Q-Ball , it 's getting close . We want you to come with us . In less than a minute that machine is gonna open a portal that will take us to another dimension . In here ? We have to go , all of us , or we 'll be stuck here for a long time . And you 've got to come with us . This microdot was designed to work with your brain chemistry and your brain chemistry only . Without you , I won 't be able to work out our home coordinates . We 'll never find our home and never see our real parents . Can I bring some of my work ? Trust me , where we 're going , you 'll find plenty to work with . What about Susanna ? You 're gonna have to leave her . Her mother said she 's marrying the other guy . Yes . It 's time . But my life here . Your life is with me and your new family . You guys go ahead . Are you sure ? Yeah . Brother ? Pretty wild ride , huh ? Colin ! That was a truck . Oh . Ma 'am . Whoa , whoa ! Sorry . Seems pretty normal . There tends to be a variant of this hotel on just about every world we visit . Yeah , we usually try to get the same suite . Hi . Good morning . We 'd love a suite , if you have one available . Certainly . Will that be bone graft or DNA debit ? Do you take cash ? Of course . Please fill this out . Here are your keys . You 're in suite 1215 . Thank you . Enjoy your stay . Wow ! Take your coat off and stay awhile . There is one of those cathode image display units we saw in the store window . Is it for us ? Everything in this room is for us . For keeps ? No , we 're just renting . Hold this . Now watch . Oh ! Taste it . Odd . What is it ? It 's cola . And what is that ? No one knows . Oh . Hey , you know , if we 've got three days here , I could stand to do a little shopping . What about you , Remmy ? Give the brothers a chance to do a little bonding ? Uh-huh . Now , aren 't you sorry that you made fun of me for trying those ATM machines along the way ? I love you , Remmy . I knew I 'd hit one sooner or later . Okay . See you . Hey , don 't do anything I wouldn 't do . I 'm not sure I know him well enough to know what he would do or not do under certain circumstances . It 's just an expression . Here , let 's grab a seat . So . Here we are . Yes , we are . You know , I was thinking ... Sorry , you first . No , sorry . Go ahead . I was just thinking that when I was a kid I used to have an imaginary brother . So did I. Really ? Yeah , his name was Jedediah . Mine was Skip . Skip ? Yeah . Is that a name ? Different worlds . That is beginning to come more clear to me . I guess when you , uh , have a brother and , uh , you grow up together , and you see him all the time , you get kind of tired of looking at him and you really can 't think of anything else to say to him . I suppose that is the way it is . Well , I 've never had a brother . We didn 't grow up together , and we don 't know each other . Yes . Yet I still can 't think of anything else to say . I have a feeling that will change . What do you think ? It 's not for you . Exactly . It 's for Colin . We 've got to get that boy out of those funeral clothes . You better take it slow with this one . He 's got a whole new world to get used to . I don 't know . He seemed pretty eager to jump into this time zone . Now me , if I had flashed into a world this different from my own , I would have been scared to death . But this guy ? Uh-uh . No . He 's ready to be a player . And I am just the guy to make it happen . Well , I think Remmy 's got a new playmate . Yep , and Quinn 's got a new brother . It 's kind of nice to see that happen . I 'm happy for him . Hmm . ... and after you 've arranged the fruit on the plate ... In time of need you can count on ... You like this ? Sometimes there 's a good show on . The charity race was held ... Well , I think it would be more interesting to take it apart . Uh , we can 't do that because it 's not ours . Oh . It 's okay . Hello ? Uh , no . We 're fine . We don 't need any towels . Thank you . It 's called a phone , a telephone . It 's a communication device . Can I take this apart ? Uh , it 's not ours , either . You see , you hear that tone ? Yeah . That means it works , and then you punch in the number that you want . Okay . What number do I want ? See , every person or business that has a telephone has a number , and most of them are in this book . Oh , this is a wonder . I must read it . Where is the outhouse ? Ah . You 're gonna love this . This is what we call the bathroom . That is the shower , that 's the sink , and that 's the toilet . Toilet ? Check it out . Oh . Whoa . Wow . You okay in there , Colin ? Tarnation ! They use water ! And the paper is so soft . Okay , why don 't we go out for a little while and let me show you how the rest of this world works ? Why is there so much shrubbery in an eating house ? Decoration . Hi . Hi . What can I get for you ? A draft beer and what do you want ? I 'll have one of those . One of those . Why does the drink have an umbrella in it ? Uh , I never really thought about it . More decoration , I suppose . Maybe it 's important to protect your drinks from the elements ? You might be right . Okay . Now , you be careful with this . It is loaded . I 'm gonna go get something to eat . Do you want anything ? Uh , no , thank you . Okay . Don 't move . Hi . I was the guy at the bar . That was me with the draft beer and the guy who ordered the ... Susanna ? What are you doing here ? And dressed like that ? If your mother could see you ... Well , I do not know what she would do . Do I know you ? Don 't you remember ? Colin Mallory . I asked you to marry me . Are you some kind of lab experiment that blew up ? People always ask me that . Oh , Susanna . I 'm sorry . I thought you were somebody else . No big deal . Nice outfit . Thanks . Wait a minute . How do you know my name ? I know everything about you . What ? Nothing . I 'm not myself . Maybe it is the drink . You 're kind of cute , in a weird way . Can I buy you something with an umbrella in it ? Sure . One of these for the lady . You 're not from around here . Well , actually ... How could you tell ? Well , you don 't look , dress or sound like anyone around here . You noticed . You 're a casher ? Sorry ? Well , don 't you have a bone graft ? You know , the lady at the hotel asked us that when we checked in . No , I don 't have a bone graft , whatever that is . Or anything else she was talking about . What is it ? DNA ? I have someplace very important to go to , but I 'm afraid to go by myself . Will you come with me ? Please ? Well , maybe for a little while . Could you hold this for me , please ? Excuse me . I 'm sorry . Sorry . Is that a telephone ? Uh , yes . No wire ? Can I just have that for one second ? Thanks . Mother , guess what . I found the perfect person to help us with our problem . Trust me on this one . We 're gonna go right over to the home . Okay , great , bye . Uh , I know that I shouldn 't really burden you with this since we 've just met , but you just seem like such a kind person . My dear Uncle Ray is being kept in an old folks ' home . My awful relatives have put him there against his will . That 's terrible . My mother and I are heartbroken about it . We want to get him out and bring him home where we can care for him . That would be a very decent thing to do . Yes , but we can 't get to him . The security system at the home is set to pick up bone grafts . Any unauthorized person sets off the alarm . But since you don 't have a graft , you could go in and get him . You want me to steal your uncle ? No , rescue him ! Oh . Come on . Colin ! Colin ! Susanna . I 'm not sure this is right . Well , is it right that a helpless , elderly person be kept in a heartless institution when a loving family is ready to care for his every need ? He 's in suite 433 . Thank you . Mighty small suites . There is a problem . What ? Something you did not tell me . Yes ? Uncle Ray is frozen . So ? He is as dead as a mackerel . No , he 's not . Oh , I 'm sorry , uh , you 're a Canadian , and I don 't think they have this technology up there . Uncle Ray is in a state of suspended animation . His body functions have been lowered , but he 's alive . It 's the way they handle old people here when they become too much trouble . It is true I do not know much about your science , but I do know that frozen flesh cannot be reanimated . Oh . Well , they inject a special serum before freezing . Just find something , put him in it , and bring him out . I promise you , he will be so much happier with us . Well , he does not look very happy right now . Wait a minute . How 're we gonna slide with all these shoes ? I don 't know . Colin 's gone off somewhere . What ? He left the bar with a woman . It didn 't take him long to learn how to do that . She must have had a car because by the time I got out on the street , they were gone . Now , wait a minute . Did you check up in the room ? No , I 've just been looking on the street . Colin ? Colin ? So , what do we do now ? We stay calm . He 's got three days to find us or for us to find him . He 's not dumb , you know . How can you tell ? You don 't know how much this will mean to Mother . Ray is her favorite uncle . First thing I do after I find the guy is lose him . Well , I think you 're right about waiting here . He knows where we are . I just don 't think he 'd purposely walk off like that . I 'm so afraid someone 's gonna take advantage of his innocence . Look , maybe he 's shacked up someplace with this woman . Look , I really haven 't known Colin that long , but I can pretty much tell he is not the shacking up type . He 's a guy , isn 't he ? I 'm gonna call the police . Uh-uh , not good . Quinn , you know we never have any luck in that area . We 've been here a little while . The police seem cool . We haven 't seen any abuse . They 're not like stormtroopers . I 'm calling them . Operator ? I 'd like the police , please . Maybe that 's him . Sergeant Lou Dawson , LAPD . That was quick . Are you Quinn Mallory ? Yeah . You 're Brown and you 're Beckett ? Yeah . Well , is there a problem , Officer ? Have we done something wrong ? Oh , I don 't think you 've done anything , but there 's definitely a problem . You mind if I sit down ? My dogs are killing me . Go ahead . Okay , here now . Every time there is a transaction made with cash , there is a photograph taken for the police . Is there something wrong with cash ? It 's just unusual , so we take a picture to make sure the cash wasn 't obtained illegally . Uh , why didn 't you use your ... Your bone graft or your DNA debit transaction ? We prefer cash . We 're from Canada . Ah . My mother always told me , " Never spend money that you can 't see . " That is good advice . You , uh , have had your bone grafts , haven 't you ? Oh , yeah . Of course . Uh-huh . Yeah . Well , tell me now , who is the guy in the big hat ? Uh , that 's my brother , Colin . Where is he ? We haven 't seen him for a few hours . Well , I have . Officer , what is he doing in this photo ? He 's stealing a corpse from a cryogenic morgue . The picture was taken this afternoon at 3 : 40 at the Clarence Birdseye cryogenic storage facility on , uh , Alvarado . Cryogenic ? So this is a frozen body ? Yeah . I don 't know what it 's like up in Canada , but down here this kind of thing is getting very popular , if you can afford it . And now there 's a new wrinkle . Not only can you freeze your body in the hopes that when you thaw out they will have found a cure for what ails you , but you can also freeze your assets , too . I 'm not following that . Well , you know , your money , your stuff . It 's like the rich fat cats have finally found a way to take it with them when they go . It 's called a DNA Special Entry Account . Your loot just sits there gathering interest till they thaw you out and then ... You know , the only way into the account is with a DNA match . I still don 't understand what this has to do with my brother . New wrinkles can lead to new crimes . The bad guys have taken to hijacking these rich corpses . Yeah , they take them , thaw them out , defrost them , take a little tissue for the DNA , clean out the accounts . First of all , I don 't think my brother would even think of stealing a body . Second of all , that scheme sounds so complicated , I don 't think he 'd be capable of it . None of us would . Yeah , I 've heard things are a lot simpler in Canada . Colin is certainly simpler . What she means is that my brother is a bit naive , but in no way is he criminal . Well , maybe somebody 's taking advantage of him . You know , using him to do something that they can 't do for some reason . If that photo is for real , that 's the only possible explanation . For example , this cryomorgue , like a lot of businesses , it uses a bone graft security system . And the only way somebody like your brother could get in and out without tripping the alarm would be ... If he doesn 't have a bone graft . Bingo . Is not having a bone graft against the law ? Not necessarily , but that is only if you should find such a person and , uh , get them back to Canada before they 're found out . I 've got my best men on this case rounding up the usual suspects . So , if you should hear from your brother , it 'd be a real good idea to give me a call . Thank you . Okay . Now what ? We gotta find him . It 's a big city . Besides , what if your brother really is a body snatcher ? We don 't know what kind of stuff he was into . Come on . You saw the world he came from . I think the sergeant 's right . Somebody 's definitely taking advantage of him . Short skirts make new fools every day . Come on . I want you to meet my mother . Mother , you won 't believe this cornhusk . It 's like he 's from another planet . I can see . Colin . Mother , this is Colin Mallory , the kind young man who helped me get Uncle Ray . Oh , you 'll never know how grateful we are for this . Come on inside . You must be starving . Get that stiff into the sauna now . You know , when my daughter , Susanna , told me she 'd met a nice , young man who could help us with our problem , well , I just knew my prayer had been answered . I am glad I could help . You 're not from around here , are you ? I am from Canada . Ah ! Well , that explains everything . We have a little business to take care of and then we 'll tie on the feedbag . Now , don 't tell me you don 't like pizza . Very well , uh , I will not tell you that . We 're gonna get Uncle Ray into a reanimating facility , and then we 'll have a nice quiet dinner and get to know one another better . Now , you just sit here , relax , read something if you like , and I will be back in just a couple of minutes . Oh , great . The great book of numbers . Hotels . Um ... We get a Thomas Guide and do a quadrant search . Hello . Maggie . Thank heavens . I found the hotel in the great book of numbers Quinn told me of . Well , the police think you 're some kind of sicko grave robber . Uh , can I speak to my brother ? Colin , where are you ? I don 't know . I tried to remember street names but there were so many turns . And what is a Sepulveda ? Never mind that . We 've got to find you . I 'm in a house , in a big room with a desk and a lot of books . A study . That 's no help . Look at the desk . Find something with an address on it . Mail , bills , anything . No . Oh , here 's something . 16509 , Glen Ellen Drive . Got it . Okay . We will be right there . Quinn , Quinn . What ? This phone has no wire . Just stay put . Got him . Don 't bother with that now . Just put the whole thing in the sauna . We need to get it thawed , chopped up , and out of here as quickly as possible . What do we do with the hayseed upstairs ? We keep him around . A casher with no graft could come in pretty handy . Just think of all the other Uncle Rays out there who 'd like to warm up and give us their dough . What if Colin wants to go back to Canada ? If you can 't keep a man on a string , you haven 't learned a thing I taught you . This time tomorrow , it 's front row 747 to Bora Bora for you and me . I 'm already packed . You know my idea of a perfect breakfast ? A Ramos Fizz and fresh lifeguard . Mmm . Make it two . It 's still warm . Colin ? Colin ? Colin ? Colin . We 'll have you out of there in a second . Okay . Watch this . Who is the man ? All right . We have got to get out of here . Where 's the old man you stole ? I did not . It was just ... More company , I see . Friends of yours , Mr. Mallory ? Gun . How could you get involved with people that would do such a hideous thing ? It was my idea . You from Canada , too ? Something like that . No bone grafts ? Not that we know of . What a break ! We can set up a whole syndicate , hijack freezeballs all over the country . Let 's get these people into more secure quarters while we filet Uncle Ray . I thought the old Mrs. Morehouse was bad . Get back in the house ! Now , hold it right there . I 'm always late to the party . Now , that is a lot of gun for a nice lady like you . I 've been tracking you since I saw you at the hotel . Rebecca Morehouse , Susanna Morehouse . You 're under arrest . We 're charging you with attempted homicide , postmortem . Run them on in , fellows . Bye-bye , ladies . Bye . Don 't forget to write ! At least I hope it 's attempted homicide . Where 's the old geezer ? They said they took the crate down to the " soona . " The " soona " ? The sauna . The sauna . Sauna ! But it 's all ... Here , take these gentlemen downtown and give them the penthouse . I 'm telling you , if he 's thawed out , he is dead for good . We can 't refreeze him . Hmm . When I saw Uncle Ray was frozen , I suspected there was something wrong with the whole thing . The staff kitchen was right next door , so ... Well , where 's the cranberry sauce ? I did not have time . It was a joke . Oh . That 's commendable work , Mallory . Now , he 's not gonna be charged with anything , right ? No ! He stopped a crime from being committed . So what do you charge them with ? Conspiracy , attempted homicide , DNA grand larceny . Those sweet ladies are gonna pull some serious hard time . But we 're gonna need your testimony . Unless , of course , you 're planning to go back to Canada , which I recommended . In that case , you can just leave me a deposition . Don 't you think you 're rushing my brother a bit , fashion wise ? Are you kidding me ? He wanted to try on everything in the store . He thinks the zipper 's gonna change the world . Well , it did . Yeah , well , I hope everything still fits , the way he 's going through this courtesy bar . Quinn , I owe you an apology . Your brother 's a lot smarter than I thought he was . Whoa ! Oh , wow ! Is it me ? Yeah , well , it 's you now . Except for one little thing . I do not understand . I thought the function of the extension was to shade your eyes from the sun . For shortstops , yes , but not for you , you cutting-edge dude . Come on , lay five in the hand , white soul man . Oh , yeah . I love it .

 WYATT : There are things you think you 'll never see in your lifetime- - a cure for the common cold , world peace the next Star Wars movie- - but the one thing I was sure no one in any lifetime would ever see was my brother , Chett ... with a girlfriend . Her name is Rose and it 's like they were made for each other . Two people that know what they want and how to get it ... usually by force . My good friend Gary also seems caught up - in the wonder of the moment . - Will you shut up ? Strange . It 's as if he can hear my thoughts . I can . Lis , turn him off . Okay , okay . I thought it added atmosphere . What are you so cranky about anyway ? I 'm checking out my magic eyeball book . - Those things are a gyp . - All I see is squiggly colors . You just squint at the picture " And you 're greeted with aife-like 3-D image of ... majestic lions . " Maybe I 've got it upside down . Aren 't they cute ? - LISA : how did they meet ? - Personal ads in Flak Magazine . Three weeks and going strong . For the first time Chett 's got romance and companionship . I wonder if he 's got majestic lions . There aren 't any in this book . You 're right , Wyatt- - it is nice . Two lovers sharing a quiet moment alone . Let 's eavesdrop . - A drive-in movie speaker ? - I just rented Pulp Fiction . I 'm feeling a little retro . Yeah , Rose ... that was some movie , huh , Rosie ? It was the most romantic thing . I almost cried . Me too . - Geez , what movie did they ? - Aliens . I mean , when Vasquez and the lieutenant ate the grenade to save the party ? That was beautiful . It reminded me of Jesse Ventura 's gut wound in Predator . I am one happy little brother . Since when are you Chett 's cheerleader ? Did you forget the Melvins ? The Noogies ? - The Full-Body Nair Baths ? - That 's why I 'm happy . He 's been so busy on love maneuvers he doesn 't even remember I exist . Life is sweet . Whoa . Major sweater muffins , 2 : 00 . - What did you say ? - [ chuckling ] : Uh ... I didn 't mean anything by that . Think of it as a compliment . I mean ... I 'm so comfortable with you I can say what 's on my mind 'cause ... I don 't really think of you as a chick . You don 't think of me as a chick ? CHETT : Well , no . Yeah . You know , like a guy I can imagine naked . - No . Wait . - That 's it , Chester . Your sweater muffin-watching days are over . No . You can have your stupid dog tags too . She had to wake up sooner or later . - I hope Chett is okay . - He needs space to deal with his loss . For him , this is the time to look inward and reflect . [ yelling ] I loved her and she spit me out like a black jelly bean . Why not trash your own room ? Why should I , when I can mess up yours ? ... then he rammed my head in the toilet . Just be thankful you don 't have problem hair . Look at the up side- - Chett has done worse . You didn 't let me finish . Uh-oh . Jilted psycho on the prowl . [ whimpering ] Oh , close one . - Poor Chett . - Poor Chett ? ! We 've got to find him a new girl or I 'm a smoke stain on the carpet . Relax . I 've got it covered . - We 're fishing for a girlfriend ? - What 's for bait ? LISA : What else ? Stand back , puny mortals . Where did the picture go ? It 's scanning the world for Chett 's perfect match . Fishing sucks . [ clicking ] LISA : Uh-oh . I got something . stip me in . Get behind me ! Whoa ! WYATT : Oh , boy . Oh , boy . It 's a whopper ! It 's huge ! Here she comes . Hi . Who 's the cutie ? " Rose was my girl the head on my brew " the shine on my dog tags , the spit on my shoe " the Kung-Fu grip on my G.I. Joe doll and she took my heart " with her ... when she went ... AWOL . " Chett . Oh , at last . He 's on the rebound so you shouldn 't have - any problem , miss , uh ... - Please , call me Ali . - Is that short for Allison ? - Okay . - Where are you from , Ali ? - Memphis . Excuse me . Pal ! I need a rhyme for " flak vest . " How about " back rest " ? Face it , tiger . You just hit the jackpot . - Oh , my goodness . - [ purring ] Wyatt , get down here ! Little bro , we got way too much Chinese food here . - Join us . Tuck in . - Join you ? - And your friend . - Gary ! You , too , you frizzy-haired pukeball ! Sure thing , you balding sack of dog meat . [ laughing ] I love these two chowder boats . Eat up , boys . Mu-shu . Mu-shu . Don 't mind if we do . Save me a dumpling ... dumpling . Sure thing , hot sauce . We need to fatten you up a little . [ giggling ] I 've never seen him this happy . You 're okay in my book . Hey , thanks . I think Chett 's the most beautiful creature in the universe . A gorgeous babe with bad taste in guys . You got any sisters . - Rose . - At ease , soldier . I 've decided to give you another chance . I shouldn 't get mad at you for a healthy sex drive . - It is your best quality . - [ gasps ] - This really isn 't a good time . - What do you mean ? You 're not alone , are you ? Who 's this ? Her name is Ali . Don 't talk to her that way . You 're dumping me for Malibu P.J. ? ! You dumped me ! I had to move on . You expect me to be alone forever ? - We broke up four hours ago ! - We 're in love ! One day soon we hope to breed a fine young warrior . Is this true ? Yeah , well , we 're talking about it . I 'm out of here . - Rose , wait ! - Let her go . You 're better off without her . Wyatt : So my big brother found love again . I never thought it was possible . Boy , these jockeys itch like a mother . Maybe I 'm allergic to silk . - I wonder how fish do it . - [ giggling ] - I 'm broadcasting again , aren 't I ? - Yep . How was the mall ? I exchanged that defective magic eyeball book . Defective ? Well , yeah . Nothing wrong with these 20 / 20 bad boys . Must be a printing defect . Come on , Green Bay Packers . I know you 're in there somewhere . - [ screaming ] - Jeez ! what 's wrong ! Ali ! Squint and look at her . - Ugh ! She 's hideous ! - What 's hideous ! I don 't see a thing . Relax your eyes and look four feet past her . Oh , cool . I see it . [ screams ] ALL : Ew ! - How could this happen ? - The magic fishing rod couldn 't find a match on Earth so it broadened the search . To outer space ? So it is true . Chett couldn 't get a date if he was the last man on Earth . So ? What do we do about jabba the slut ? We send her packing . Hey , you two lovebirds . Hey , guys . Who 's your friend ? Oh , Chett , Ali , this is ... Florence , my second cousin from Canada . No way . Is she the one that you ... No ! No , no , this is a different cousin , completely different . Is something on your mind , Ali ? You look like you 're on another planet ... - or from another planet . - [ both laugh ] Why don 't we go freshen up ? Without my makeup I feel like a creature from outer space . I bet you know that feeling , huh , Ali ? Uh , yeah , I guess so . Excuse us . - Kisses ? - Kisses . Ew ! Can 't wait for the bachelor party . Instead of a girl jumping out of the cake she can just best out of someone 's chest . You two have to break up . I 'm not good enough because I 'm a different species because I 'm mono-digitary and Omni-ocular ? We eradicated that sort of bigotry on my planet . I 'm not being a bigot . Then what does it matter ? There 's no one in my entire home world as wonderful as Chett . He 's ruined me for my own species . - Lisa , have you ever been in love ? - Well ... - No . - Then how can you condemn us ? - GARY : Give them a chance ? - Who are we to judge them ? The mans- - the home team . She 's playing love connection on our planet . Chett 's really in love . You 're just happy ' cause he hasn 't tried to flush you . That part doesn 't suck either . ( knocking ) Rose . I wanted to talk to your brother . - He 's not here now . - Oh . That 's okay . I know Chett doesn 't want me , and that 's fine . I mean , you don 't have to hit me with the normandy landing but this Ali girl- - she 's scary . I 'm worried about Chett . There 's something in that girl 's eyes . A woman can tell . Just ... look out for him , okay ? - Promise ? - Sure . I promise . Lisa , can you rig it so we can keep an eye on Chett and Ali ? Finally ! Someone with good old-fashioned healthy reservations about Chett dating a space alien . Isn 't this an invasion of priacy ? When has that stopped you ? Good point . This will show you what Ali 's up to at all times . Think of it as your own Sci-Fi channel . Hello . Mother ? It 's me . Yes . Everything is going well . Oh , you should see his body . ( growls ) Makes me devour . She 's telling Mom about Chett . That 's so sweet . We will be mating momentarily . He 's waiting for me . Yes , of course . I 'll come straight home once I 've devoured him . - Did she just say " devour " ? - I think she said " devalue . " " I 'll come straight home once I devalue him " ? Sometimes my hair gets in my ears . Don 't worry . As humans go , Chett is pretty large . There 'll be plenty of table scraps . I 'll bring you back a drumstick . She 's going to eat him ! Nice going ! We ask you to find Chett a girl and he ends up being a galactic takeout ! Boy , do I feel like the captain of the dummy boat . It 's not polite to eavesdrop . Oh , yeah ? It 's not polite to eat and run . Get her , Lis ! Turn her into a snickers bar ! - What happened to your magic ? - I don 't know . I 'm afraid it was me . " Magic . " You two are so cute . I suppose that to a primitive mind , Lisa 's reality-altering algorithms must seem pretty magical . Well , pardon my sloping brow . Okay , sister . Looks like we play it your way . Time for a little hand-to-hand . ( yells ) Oh , yeah . You really kicked her butt . - Stuff it , Wallace . - Lousy alien ! Hope you choke on him ! Okay , if we want to save Chett we 'll have to work fast . - And do what ? - What else ? Call for help . Hi , lover . Um ... before we begin , I need to tell you something . It 's been a long time for me . I want to make sure we 're not moving too fast . This is a good speed . ( moaning ) - Come on . - Almost . Got it ! Now what do I do with it ? [ giggles ] Hey , quit it . That tickles . I can 't stand it anymore . I 've got to have your body . It 's yours . Take it . ( groans ) God , I love a take-charge kind of gal ! Check out that tasty hunk of prime rib . I 've been doing sit-ups . ( growling ) You want me as much as I want you ? Do I ? You could dip my face in batter make hot buttered love cookies ! Cookies , huh ? I 've never thought of that . Nah , too much work . ( gasps ) Ooh ... Like what you see ? I 've always been a leg woman . [ muffled cry ] How 's this strike you ? I 've seen them do that in videos . That 's new , though . Get real . Time to call the cops . To save Chett , there 's only one person we can call . [ muffled ] : Mmm ... No , not Grandma . I 've never done this sort of thing before . Is that mango chutney ? Hello , Rose ? Listen carefully- - turns out Chett 's girlfriend is really an alien from outer space . She 's about to eat him alive . We were hoping you could come over and lend a hand . Rose ? Get away from him , you bitch ! Uh ... they 're in Chett 's room . Down the hall , to the left . Oh . Sorry . Get away from him , you bitch ! Rose , is that you ? Neat little trick . Get away from him , human ! If you want him , you 'll have to go through me ! Ladies , here 's no reason to fight over me . [ screams ] What happened to Ali ? That is Ali . And you 're dinner . Ugh ! I made it to second base with that thing ? Come here my little love snack . Not enough beer in Milwaukee , bug-lips . Looks like this is it . I can 't believe you saved me after the way I treated you . - I never stopped caring about you . - Me too . But I got crazy after I lost you . I was on the rebound . What 's important is , we 're together . If I got to go down dogface , I 'm glad it 's with you . Yeah , me too . Would you wear my dog tags ? Oh , thanks . Why are they sticky ? - It 's the mango chutney . - [ roaring ] All right . Enough already . I might be an alien , but I do have a heart . You two are perfect for each other . - Even I can see it . - I guess we are , aren 't we ? Hang on to each other . A perfect match only comes around once in a lifetime . Shut up and kiss before I eat you . ( sighing ) What 's the matter ? Oh ... you guys have each other . I just can 't help wondering- - where 's the man for me ? Mmm ... ( sighs ) Maybe I spoke too soon . I give up . Magic eyeball book ? - " Magic gyp-off " is more like it . - You can 't see a picture ? I don 't get it . I never had trouble seeing Ali with the squint . Maybe there aren 't any pictures in there . Everybody pretends to see them . Oh , they 're in here , all right . Just out of my reach . Well , well , well , if it isn 't the Barbie twins . Oh , look- - they bought us dinner . ( both laughing ) We made the universe safe for that ? Well , I can 't do anything about Chett and Rose but I can help Gary with his 3-D book . I see it ! Charging linebacker ! Incredible . He looks so lifelike . GARY : Whoa . What a rush .

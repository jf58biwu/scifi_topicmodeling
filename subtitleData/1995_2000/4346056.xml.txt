 Futurama is brought to you by Glagnar 's Human Rinds . It 's a Bunch-a-Munch-a - Crunch-a-Humans ! I Second That Emotion Somebody likes snouts . Is it me ? Oh , my head ! My precious head ! Stupid can opener ! You killed my father and now you want me ! - You all right , Bender ? - I guess so . But why do we keep this time bomb around for that dumb animal ? Don 't yell at him . You hurt his feelings . - Come on , pet him and make up . - No . I said , pet him . I 'll pet him . I 'll pet him with both hands ! My ass ! Get off ! Get off ! - Are you okay ? - Nothing a lawsuit won 't cure . Not you . Poor baby chipped a fang . I got a busted ass ! I don 't see anyone kissing it ! All right , I 'm coming . Remember , Rover gets the pill , and Pepper gets the suppository . Next ! It 's just a broken fang . Not serious . What 's that ? You have to put him down ? No . Huh ? What ? Terrible shame . Shall I do the honors ? No ! - You about done ? - Next time , I 'm keeping it . I have a replacement fang for your pet in the next room . The jaguar wasn 't helpful , but he did knock one of my teeth out . Now , then . What are these rings in Nibbler 's fang ? I 'm woozy from a gazelle kick earlier , but if he 's like a tree the rings might indicate his age . Good luck . It 'd take a genius to count all those rings . He 's 5 . Happy birthday , young Nibbler . Look how cuddly he looks in his new cape . I 'd be cuddly if someone gave me a cape . Who 's playing pin the tail on the maggot ? Me ! Everyone watch how good I am ! And the crowd goes wild ! What prize do I get ? Cash ? Look at Nibbler . Oh , he 's holding a spoon . - He 's so talented . - You call that talent ? Gather around old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime . - Now he 's wearing a hat ! - Let 's all sing " Happy Birthday " ! What day is today ? It 's Nibbler 's birthday What a day for a birthday Let 's all have some cake And you smell like one too What about this ? Bender , aren 't you cooking for this party ? - Fine . We 'll have rack of Nibbler ! - Just make a cake . And this time if someone jumps out of it , put them in after it 's cooked . So it 's a cake you want , is it ? I 'll make you a cake you 'll never forget . That 'll take care of those rats . Now , to bake a cake so delicious they 'll have no choice but to love and worship me . There ! This 'll teach those filthy bastards who 's lovable . Once I spell check it , it 'll be ready for my admiring public . No ! Get away from there ! That 's it . Happy birthday ! Bender , what 's going ... ? No ! Can 't you see I 'm using the toilet ? How could you flush Nibbler down the toilet ? Step one , I lifted the seat . That was the first annoyance . Am I right , men ? Aren 't you upset at all ? What if I flushed Fry down the toilet ? Only one way to find out . You have no sympathy for anyone ! Sure I do ! Right now I feel sorry for you . - You do ? - Yeah . One cantaloupe-sized eye ? You ain 't winning no beauty pageants , lady . And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet , Nibbler who 's gone to a place where I , too , hope one day to go . The toilet . I wouldn 't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he caused me . Give it to me straight , doc . Don 't sugarcoat it . Your entire family died When a plane piloted by your fianc√©e crashed into your uninsured home . And you have inoperable cancer . Bet you didn 't expect that one ! Does he not understand humanoid emotion ? I just wish Bender could feel exactly what I feel . Through the miracle of science , that can be done . Is this another experiment that crosses a line man was not meant to cross ? The official death toll in that tragic rocket crash has now been raised to 54,000 . What the hell are you doing with my head ? - I need to tinker in it . - Just use a potted plant like Fry ! Quiet , you . I 'm installing an empathy chip . To allow Bender to feel emotions ? Yes , if by " allow " you mean " force . " - Son of ... Careful ! - Oh , dear . Oh , my . I got it . Who wants more ? - Professor ! - Steady , now . There we go . Now I 'll simply tune it to Leela 's emotional frequency . My God , I 'm overcome with feelings . I 'm experiencing a powerful yearning to cram my gullet with mackerel heads . That 's me , baby . I feel I 'm not as smart as Leela but I also feel relieved that I 'm cuter than her . - That 's me . - Thanks for covering . Now I miss Nibbler , and I feel nosy and opinionated . - Bingo ! - It 's her ! Thanks . I 'm happy Bender can finally feel my pain . Happy . I like this feeling . Don 't revert to your usual mopey self . I 'm not mopey . You shut up ! Anger , huh ? How dare you make me feel anger you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet ? Thanks for taking me out . I 'm now slightly less miserable . You know what 'd cheer you up ? Getting a puppy ! A puppy ? Nibbler loved to eat puppies . - What 's your problem ? - I miss Nibbler . - You do ? - Hell , no ! It 's Leela 's feelings ! Why can 't she just drink herself happy like a normal person ? - Jealousy . You think you 're so hot ! - Wha ... ? You only get all the guys because you dress like a tramp ! They 're responding to my personality ! Armando and I are going to the back seat of his car for coffee . - Will you be all right by yourself ? - Sure , I 'm having a great time . Really ! You two go enjoy yourselves . I 'm so lonely . I 'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream . A bucket of ... The spoon 's in the foot powder ! I 'm at the end of my rope . I can 't live another minute without sweet Nibbler . Alligators can live in sewers after you flush them . - Really ? - Yep . My friend 's cousin 's caseworker saw one . It 's a widely believed fact . Sewers ... Thinking , thinking , thinking . Hang on , Nibbler ! Uncle Bender 's coming to save you ! Damn , it 's too small . What did those humans design this for anyway ? Ah-ha ! Bender , one . Toilet , zero . See you on the other side ! Bender ? Bender ? ! Have you seen my sombrero ? He flushed himself down the toilet ? - Who 's next ? - It 's your fault . Your emotions made him feel bad . You 're right . I feel terrible . Now you 're making him feel worse ! We better go down and find him . Are you crazy ? There 's mutants there ! - They 'll eat you alive ! - They 're hideous ! Mutants are just a ridiculous urban myth . Don 't be so sure . Many scientists believe humans could mutate down there due to exposure to toxic waste , radioactive runoff and good old American feces . God bless America . Ladies first . Oh , and the aftertaste . - What ? - I burned my finger ! - Check the guidebook . - We 're under Park Avenue . Ritzy ! Just think . All this was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met . Wait , what 's that ? Why did I throw out the manual ? You didn 't have to come down here . I know , but I just missed Nibbler so much . - He was so cute . - He was so sweet . This emotional display is making me nauseous . Or maybe it 's from that . Nibbler ! It 's no use . We 'd better turn back . Which way , Fry ? According to this map , the only exit is through that pipe . It gets wider after a mile . - Idiot . - Idiot . Okay , never mind . I 'll just ask those people for directions . Mutants ! Mutants ! They 're real ! I 'll take care of this ! Back ! Back ! Thanks , handsome . - Don 't worry , we 're harmless . - I have three arms ! - I said , harmless not armless ! - Lay off him . He only has one ear . Shouldn 't you eat my brain ? You 're mutants ! Mutants ? Perhaps you are the mutants . Dwayne , have you looked in a mirror lately ? Welcome to our village . It 's not Paris but it has a charm that I wouldn 't trade for the world . - You do realize you live in a sewer . - Perhaps your civilization is the sewer of an even greater society above you . - No , we 're on top . - Daylight and everything . It must be wonderful ! We came down here to find our pet . He was flushed down the toilet If he was flushed , he probably came through here . Everything always does . Follow me . All that is ours came from your toilets . Over there is our aquarium . This is our library . Just crumpled porn and Ayn Rand . Over here is our church . You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb ? Nobody 's that observant . It 's mainly for Christmas and Easter . Nibbler ! Come to Daddy , sweetie-ookums ! Do alligators flushed down toilets live here ? That 's an urban legend . - Then what are those ? - Crocodiles . They 're our pets . When they grow too large , we flush them into the sub-sewer . There 's a race of sub-mutants there . Please ! That 's just a sub-urban legend . Then I suppose you also don 't believe in El Chupakneebray . El Chupakneebray ? What 's that ? Gather around for the legend of El Chupakneebray . He creeps in the midnight hush Silent as a loW-floW toilet flush But sooner or later He 'll eat you Whole And half your alligator - Crocodile . - Whatever . Our pet , Nibbler , loves fresh crocodile . It 's his favorite treat . He must be El Chupakneebray . Hey , yeah ! You unleashed El Chupakneebray upon us ? Then you are our sworn enemies ! He would never hurt people . Let us help you capture him . Impossible . If legend 's true , our only hope is to give a snack-rifice ! Yes , an unspoiled virgin . - I volunteer ! - Nice try , Leela but we 've all seen Zapp Brannigan 's web page . Oh , I made myself feel bad . - She 'll do . - Chain her to the post ! And rip her shirt a little . Behold ! When El Chupakneebray comes for the , uh , " virgin " he will be snared by this rope trap . El Chupakneebray comes soon . It is nightfall . Nightfall ? How can you tell down here ? - The tide is coming in . - Quiet . The beast approaches . Nibbler ! Come here , precious . Look , everyone . It 's El Chupakneebray . - That 's not him . - Say what ? That 's El Chupakneebray ! I 'll take care of this ! - Do something ! - I 'm too scared ! Your fear is being transmitted to Bender ! If you care about Nibbler , stop caring ! I can 't ! I love all creatures ! - Even me ? - As a friend . Damn . Listen to me . I 'm an expert at not caring . The secret is not giving a rat 's ass about anyone and only caring about things that you want that you deserve , that the world owes you ! - Well , I could use a new tank top . - Bigger ! Bigger ! A fashionable tank top ! And designer boots encrusted with jewels ! You 'll need some pants to go with that ! And I could afford it all if I didn 't have to feed that stupid Nibbler ! Bender is back ! I 'll save you , Nibbler ! - He 'll be killed ! - Know what else I could use ? A weekend at a fancy spa . And a Toblerone . You did it ! - Let 's have a tissue-tape parade ! - No , thanks . Gather around to hear the legend of Bender . He came from above With a ... It 'll be ages before another guitar string is flushed . - That 's a disgusting story . - All thanks to Bender . - I love you , Bender . - I love you too . Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself . You won 't believe this , but the empathy chip burned out . The emotion you felt for Nibbler was your own ! So Bender learned a lesson about respecting other people 's feelings after all . No , I 'm wrong . The chip was running at triple capacity . And I still barely felt anything . Good night , losers ! Maybe Bender didn 't learn from me but I learned something from him . So long , jerkwads ! So long ! Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH ]

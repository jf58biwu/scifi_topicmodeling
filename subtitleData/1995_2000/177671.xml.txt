 Doom ! Show yourself , you coward . Where 's Susan ? Ow ! Watch it , hothead . You 're cooking my corns . Uh ! This is pretty uninspired . The big , bad Doctor Doom kidnapping me just to lure us to your wretched island . I 'm sorry to involve you in the timeworn damsel-in-distress cliché . I feel the only thing missing is the onrushing train . However , sometimes expediency outweighs originality . Now , with your permissión ... Blast ! This thing has neutralized my force field . But if I can still project invisibility ... Oof ! Why , you mangy metal maggot ! Well , I 'll be a blue-eyed ... - Hey , Stretcho ! I found Susie . - What ? Where , Ben ? In the basement . - Where 's the entrance ? - Funny you should ask . Well ! A neuro-stimulator . - Sue , darling ! - We 've got to get off this island . Doom set that nuclear bomb to go off any second . Hmm . If I can defuse its detonator ... Hey ! You heard the lady , Stretcho . Time 's a-wastin ' . Let 's hustle our little blue tushies ! But ... Doom 's ship ! It 's going to be a long walk home now . Yeah , but if we stay at this rumble we 're gonna be the Fire-Roasted Four . Goodbye , Fantastic Four . Time to join the choir invisible . [ cackles ] Doctor Richards ? Doctor Richards . Stand back ! Sue ! Ben ! Johnny ! - Huh ? - What 's going on ? My arms ! They won 't stretch ! Flame on ! Nothing 's happening . I can 't make myself invisible . Argh ! All right . Who short-sheeted me ? Hey ! When did this come down ? - All of you , calm down , please . - [ Ben ] Who is this guy ? You 're in the infirmary of a navy sub . We picked you up at sea yesterday . The infirmary ? We 're at sea ? Ah ! I remember now , darling : Doctor Doom 's island . The bomb . Johnny : Right ! You enclosed us in a force field when the blast went off ! And then ... everything went black . [ Reed ] And the radiation somehow disabled our powers . Yeah ! And turned one of us from a chunk to a hunk ! Oh , ! Sorry , Susie ! But without our powers , the Fantastic Four is ... Kaputski . - You have got to get some rest . - No time , darling . I 've duplicated the neuro-stimulator Doom used to hold you prisoner . If I can reverse its action I just might be able to restore our powers . Sounds good to me . Although , frankly , Ben seems a lot happier without them . - Oh ! Excuse me . Didn 't notice you . - Hey . Oh . Thanks , buddy . You don 't know how good that is to hear you say that . Here you go , Alicia , baby . Tutti-frutti for my cutie ! - Oh , I 'm having such a good time today . - Yeah . But with your powers gone , what will become of you and your friends ? Reed 's working on some stuff . We 're gonna be fine . - I 'm not so sure . - Hey , beautiful , enough fretting ! Let 's have some fun . I 'm back to normal , look ! I 'm loving every second of it . Hey , and speaking of love , baby ... Mommy , look at that big ugly orange thing ! Hey ! What ... Well , that kinda puts the kibosh on the mood of the moment , don 't it ? I know how you feel , pal . I know just how you feel . [ Doctor Doom ] A toast , Boris . To Reed Richards and the Fantastic Four , who have of late passed on to the undiscovered country . Bereft of their interference , I 'm free to bring much-needed peace and order to a world gone mad . - Master . - You may speak . Our sources report the Fantastic Four survived the liquidation of Island TR5 . Reed Richards , alive ? Your plan to destroy them has failed , master . Failed . Doctor Doom does not fail . And without their powers , the Fantastic Four will be helpless ... If their old enemies found out . I understand . [ Alicia ] Oh , Matt . You 've always been there for me in the past . I 'm frightened for my friends and hoped you might have some advice . - I actually might be able to help ... - Hey ! Listen , Mr. Lawyer Man . I let myself be dragged here 'cause it was important to Alicia . And in case you hadn 't noticed , pal , you 're blind . I don 't see how you 're gonna exactly be a big help to the Fantastic Four . We never asked for no hand-outs before . And we 're not gonna start now ! - Matt , I 'm sorry . - It 's all right . Sometimes we blind people see things more clearly than those with sight . All right , now , don 't worry . I 've got a friend who can help . A very close friend . - [ Reed ] OK , Ben , this way . - Gotcha , pal ! Aw , nuts ! I 'll never get the hang of this crummy outfit . Why do I have to wear it ? Because its hydraulic exoskeleton will give some semblance of your old powers . The same way Johnny has his flame rig and Sue her invisibility simulator . Aw , well , jeez . I feel like a muppet ! Okay , I 'm sorry , but until we find a way to get our real powers back we don 't let our enemies know how vulnerable we are . Or ... Or something like that will happen ? Aw , gee-whiz . Hey ! I can 't hold it ! I 've got it covered . I think I 've finally got this doohickey figured out . Oh ! Uh , you 'd better check on that warranty . [ Susan ] We 've got to get out of here ! I can 't see ! This smoke 's too thick . I 'll try to light the way . Follow me . - This a private party ? - Daredevil ! Alicia 's friend Murdock asked me to keep an eye on you . [ Ben , coughing ] I told that shyster we didn 't need his help . [ Johnny ] Yeah ! The day the FF can 't handle things ... Now , if everyone has had their say ... Grab hands and follow my lead . [ Reed ] Amazing , Daredevil . How did you find your way through ? Call it a gift . It came with the red suit . - Aw , nuts ! Look up there ! - [ Johnny ] It 's Doctor Doom 's airship ! That 's who has been spit-balling us ! [ Susan ] Doom 's taken over our building ! He 's in my lab ! He must have used my biogenetic tracker to find us . Yeah ? Maybe it was that note you left saying " We 're at the warehouse . " Oh , man . Take a look at that ! The Fantastic Four will now perish , by the hand of Doctor Doom ! [ Reed ] We 're not totally helpless . - We 've still got the ... - [ Susan ] Oh , no ! [ Reed ] ... Fantasticar . - [ Susan ] Doom 's got remote control ! - [ Johnny ] Eat dirt ! [ Reed ] Head for the garage ! [ Daredevil ] Heads up , Ben . Thanks , pal ! That would have been one ugly hero sandwich . Whoa ! [ Doom ] Hmm . Impressive but futile . It 's curious : they haven 't counterattacked . No flaming torch . No annoyingly clever Reed Richards . Why ? [ Reed ] Doom 's controlling our arsenal . We 're sitting ducks wherever we go . Doom is using my vortex ray ! This way ! [ Johnny ] How do you do that ? [ Daredevil ] Try to make it to the Baxter Building . I 'll draw Doom 's fire . Hey ! Doctor Doombell ! This way . Fire in the hole . Where is Richards ? And who is this meddlesome fool who fights for them ? Unless of course ... they can 't fight for themselves . Of course ! My bomb . The radiation . They 've lost their powers . Finally , Reed Richards ... [ chuckles ] on a silver platter ! [ Johnny ] They 've evacuated the building . And the mayor is letting us have first crack at the Doomster . If I can retime the destabilizing ionizer on the neuro-stimulator it just might be able to decay and reverse the radiation effects . - If we can distract him until ... - Say no more ! Daredevil 's the name . Distraction 's my game . And if I don 't make it , it 's been a real slice of heaven , gang . - Hang loose , heroes ! - [ Ben ] Long john-wearing show-off . Funny . A lot of people react that way to lawyers . - [ Susan ] We 're clear . - [ Doom ] Commendable . Doom 's dynamited the stairwell ! - Then let 's just take our elevator . - No way ! He 'll hear the alarm . That baby 's rigged to blow ! We have no choice . Let 's hope Daredevil keeps him too busy to notice . Fool ! Your reflexes are fast . Unfortunately not fast enough ! It 's not exactly hi-tech , but hey , who 's complaining ? So ! The elevator ! Their miserable lives can now be counted in seconds . Farewell , my Fantastic-less Four ! Doom 's activated the detonator ! The elevator 's gonna blow ! [ Ben ] This elevator 's gonna be pixie dust , yet Stretcho is playin with the buttons ! I looped the circuit back up to Doom . Now let 's get out before he resets it ! Ow ! Jeez ! Why does everything always have to be such a close call ? Thirty-fourth floor . Doom is right over our heads . - [ Daredevil ] Doom . - Fool ! Did you presume to catch me unawares ? - [ Daredevil ] Was it my breath ? - You primrose popinjay ! You 're too late . The Fantastic Four are dead ! And you are in time for your own demise . [ Daredevil screams in agony ] [ Ben ] Let go of him , you clinking can of crud ! Why , it 's the formerly Fantastic Four ! I see you 've survived my little welcome . Mere fists against my bionic armor . How prosaic . Oh . Freezing . I can 't move . A true genius would have prepared for this exigency with insulated garments . But as always , we both know which of us is the true genius . I 've made an interesting little improvement in your ventilation system . I will now suck all the air out of the room . And like the martyrs of Masada , you may watch each other die . Have a nice day ! [ strains ] The stimulator ! Got to ... Argh ! Hey , Stretch , the gadget . Come on , tell me how it works . Now ! No , Ben , let me ! You 'll become the thing again . Sorry , Alicia ! Goin ' somewhere , Doc ? Let go of me , you pathetic monstrosity ! You brainless baboon ! Did you think me defenseless ? [ electronic whining ] You are feeling the weight of the world on your misformed shoulders . My bipolar amplifier increases the force of gravity on you a thousandfold . No ! It 's not possible ! You ! You 're the reason I 'm the Thing again . The reason Alicia ain 't never gonna have a normal life with me . Now you 're gonna pay ! Ben ! Wait ! [ Johnny ] Big guy , easy ! Back off , kid . This is between me and metalface ! Ben , please ! Let him go ! We 're not murderers . You leave me no choice but to act for the greater good . I 've just destroyed the fusión limiters from Reed Richards ' dimensional reactor . In one minute , it will tear the space - time continuum , reducing this building - and , regrettably , most of Manhattan ... - Follow me ! [ Doom ] ... to cosmic dust ! Let it weigh on your souls . Pity , really . [ sighs ] I never did get to see Cats . Ten seconds and Manhattan will be kitty litter . Oh , boy . Sue , it 's up to you . I 've never tried anything this big before , but here goes . He didn 't get you , but your building is going to need a lot of spackle . A whole new building is more like it . We 'd better make our next digs warp-proof . Well ... I guess I 'd better go tell Alicia I 'm not her dream man any more . Oh , Ben . Alicia loves you for who you are , not what you look like . Yeah . Huh . Lucky her .

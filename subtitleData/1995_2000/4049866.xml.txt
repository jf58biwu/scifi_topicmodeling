 Seven of Nine . How 's my favourite Borg ? Annoyed . In future , announce your presence before entering . - Sorry , I should knock . - Are we ready ? Yes . Spatial conditions are ripe . A protonebula could emerge shortly . Mr Paris is expecting us . Not a bad looking hologram . This should be exciting . It 's just an astronomical survey . What is your function ? To study the nebula 's effect on the crew . This may be a new radiation . I can 't wait to see one of these clouds . I brought a holo-imager for snapshots . There will be no time for recreation . The Borg , party poopers of the galaxy . Tomorrow we 'll start you on developing your joie de vivre . Sorry . Just a little spatial turbulence . Nothing to worry about . Hello there . I don 't know about you , but I 've got class-2 claustrophobia . - I remember it well . - Lieutenant ? That 's what cadets used to call these shuttles . Fast , manoeuvrable , but not built for comfort . They would shoehorn cadets in for weeks at a time . You did not want to open that airlock . You should design a new shuttle . Larger , more efficient . Not a bad idea . I 'm reading plasma surges . All stop . Keep our distance . Move over . I want to get a group shot . - I 'm busy . - Then smile , like I know you can . - What was that ? - A plasma surge . It 's massive . Tom , back us off . - We 're in the gravimetric shear . - Engines are down . - The away team is in distress . - They 're engulfed in the shearline . Full impulse . Stand by for emergency beam out . - Unless the shuttle clears that nebula ... - It won 't . They lost propulsion . - It will be a rough transport . - Energise . - I 'm having trouble separating patterns . - Reset the pattern buffers . The signals are clearing . Is everyone all right ? - My emitter . It 's been damaged . - I 'll transfer your program to sickbay . Sickbay to transporter room 1 , report . - Some emitter circuits were fused . - Can you repair it ? - Most likely . I 'll run a diagnostic . - Most likely ? Relax , Doctor . I 'll keep you posted . Mulchaey . Computer , run diagnostic routine alpha 36 . Diagnostic in progress . - In the morning , check the results . - I 'll be here early . Captain 's log supplemental . This protonebula has a mind of its own . It 's still expanding with no end in sight . We 're holding at a safe distance to monitor its growth . Rise and shine , Lieutenant . 06 : 00 hours . Early bird gets the gagh . What do you want ? I 'll settle for my mobile emitter . What 's the ETA on those repairs ? Go away . Can 't you at least give me a prognosis ? The one day I get to sleep in ... You 're worried about a few seconds ? My freedom is at stake . Computer , activate sonic shower . One more thing . I was thinking ... I 'm a doctor , not a peeping Tom . Nothing I haven 't seen before . Bring the emitter to sickbay and we can work on it together ... Hello ? B 'Elanna ? Regeneration cycle incomplete . Commander . - How did you sleep ? - Well enough . What 's new ? That nebula 's expanding at 8,000 cubic kilometres per hour . I 've adjusted course 11 times . - You 're enjoying the big chair . - It 's not bad . You 've done a fine job . The crew is impressed . Is it true they call you " Captain Kim " ? - Good morning . - Yet to be seen . Problem ? My proximity transceiver has been activated . - That could indicate a Borg presence . - Harry ? I 've been running sensor sweeps . I haven 't seen anything . - The nebula could mask a vessel . - Not a chance . Not even a Borg cube would last seconds . Your transceiver could be malfunctioning . - It is possible . - Pay a visit to sickbay . In the meantime we 'll redouble our scans , just to be sure . Very well . I 'll get the scans underway . If you don 't mind being an ensign again . Seven ? My proximity transceiver activated again . Someone is rerouting power from the warp conduits . - To where ? - Deck 8 , section 22 . The science lab . Bridge to science lab . Ensign Mulchaey , respond . Harry . Sensors are being deflected by a force field . The force field has a Borg signature . Red Alert . Captain to the bridge . Take a security team to the lab . Seven of Nine , you were right . We detected Borg in the science lab . - How many drones ? - Unknown . Tuvok 's there . - I will join him . - The science lab ? My mobile emitter 's in there . This technology resembles a Borg maturation chamber , but many of the components are unfamiliar . Commander . Punctured by an extraction tubule . It removed a tissue sample . There are residual nanoprobes surrounding the wound . Their encoding sequences are identical to mine . Your nanoprobes ? How ? I don 't know . Take him to sickbay . What are you doing ? I will be recognised as Borg . A drone . But unlike any I 've ever seen . It appears to be in the foetal stage . I don 't understand . The Borg assimilate . They do not reproduce in this fashion . Where did it come from ? I believe it was created in the science lab . When the away team beamed back the transporter malfunctioned . The patterns merged briefly . My nanoprobes might have infected the Doctor 's emitter . They began to assimilate ? Nanoprobes utilise any technology they encounter . It assimilated the emitter and began to transform this station . They sampled Mulchaey 's DNA . Using his genetic code as a template to create a life-form . The drone has increased in mass by 17 % . Its maturation rate is 25 times that of a conventional Borg . Tuvok , erect a level-10 force field around this section . Post round-the-clock security . You intend to let it mature ? The alternative is to pull the plug . I 'm not prepared to do that . Resume your analysis . I want to know what we 're dealing with . - Or should I say , " whom " ? - Yes , Captain . I 've adapted the sensors to penetrate the Borg force field . - You said this thing was a foetus . - An hour ago it was . The drone has entered the fourth phase of gestation . - In human terms , a child of six years . - ' A boy of six years . The drone is male . Route your sensor data to sickbay . I want to run a few scans . Stand by . He appears to be human , for the most part . Borg implants comprise approximately 27 % of his body . His body plate is composed of polydeutonic alloy . Just like my mobile emitter . The nanoprobes must have extrapolated that technology . Wait a second . The emitter came from the 29th century . It 's advanced by 500 years . It is logical to assume this drone will be equally advanced . - A 29th century Borg . - In essence . I 've located my mobile emitter . It 's embedded in his cerebral cortex . It 's been adapted to function as part of his central nervous system . - It controls autonomic functions . - If we remove it , we kill the drone . - Has it contacted the collective ? - No . - I 've dampened its transceiver . - For now . What about when it grows up ? Reactive body armour , multidimensional adaptability . - lnternal transporter nodes ? - It has superior technology . It will fully mature in less than two hours . We can still terminate it . Hold on a minute , I want some answers . What happens when a drone disengages from the chamber ? - It awaits the collective 's instructions . - It has no designation without them . - No purpose . - Correct . If we can keep him from the collective , we can give him a purpose . Captain . This is the most advanced drone ever to exist . We could teach him our values , what it means to be an individual . If it were to be assimilated , the collective would be more powerful . What I 'm proposing is the only defence against that , short of murder , and that 's an order I prefer not to give . As I recall , Seven , there were a few crewmembers who had similar doubts about you . - This is different . - Is it ? A Borg , disconnected from the collective , unsure of its identity . A potential threat , but we succeeded . We 'll pull the same trick again . Only this time , you 're the teacher . I am to instruct the drone in the ways of humanity ? Think of it as first contact . And you are our ambassador . Maturation cycle is complete . We are Borg . State our designation . Irrelevant . You are not part of the collective . You are an individual . You receive instructions from me . - lnsufficient . - You must comply . Insufficient . We are Borg . My designation is Seven of Nine , Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix Zero One . - You may call me Seven of Nine . - Seven of Nine . - You will comply with my commands . - Seven of Nine . Yes . We are not Borg . We are individuals . - Do you understand ? - State our designation . - Apparently not . - lts responses are programmed . It doesn 't understand . I must initiate a direct neural interface . - Are you sure that 's wise ? - There is no other way . Proceed . You will not be harmed . Resistance is futile . I am providing it with instructions . It understands . The drone is probing my neural pathways . It is trying to assimilate all of my knowledge . I cannot disengage . Terminate interface . You must comply . You are hurting me . I will comply . Daily log , Seven of Nine . I 've activated the drone 's linguistic database . A direct neural link is too dangerous so I 'll use Borg data nodes . Special delivery , two Borg data nodes . More ? Link them to the data port . How many Borg hitchhikers are we going to pick up ? Maybe this is the Borg 's new strategy . Show up and look helpless . Now , B 'Elanna . What will it become ? It 's gone from infant to adult in one day . It will become what we help it to become . How Starfleet of you . Seven of Nine to Neelix . Report to the science lab . Bring the first data node . On my way . We are Borg . State our designation . I 've compiled information into this data node for you to assimilate . - We do not understand . - You will . Assimilate the data . Come here . Comply . Give me your arm . Inject the data node with an assimilation tubule , here . We do not understand . - Your designation is Seven of Nine . - Yes . - Your designation is Neelix . - That 's me . This is a laboratory . On a vessel . The starship Voyager . - I am travelling through space . - Yes . - Why ? - This is a ship of exploration . - I am an explorer . - We all are . - We are Borg . - Well , no . You are a unique individual . One of many . This is not a Borg collective . Do you understand ? Individual . My thoughts are my own . Precisely . - I wish to assimilate more information . - Not yet . Neural pathways require time to process information . You will need to regenerate soon . I will adapt one of the alcoves to your technology . Take the drone to the Doctor for medical analysis . Go with him . All members of this crew must report to the sickbay for evaluation . When I am finished here , I will join you . Duranium hull . Plasma-based power distribution . Tricylic life-support systems . Artificial gravity plating . Right . Systems analysis appears to be your forte . - Think about a future in operations . - Human . Female . Very good . - She was frightened . - Why do you say that ? I detected an elevation in her response . An unfamiliar face takes some getting used to . When I first came aboard I provoked strange reactions . I still do . Just look at me . Whiskers and spots . - Were people afraid of you as well ? - No . Do they fear me because I am Borg ? Borg can be a little intimidating . Don 't take it personally . - I want to know about the collective . - Of course . - Tell me . - What 's to tell . You 've seen one enhanced species you 've seen them all . You 'll have plenty of time to learn . First give yourself a chance to adapt to life on Voyager . Now , Mr ... In all the excitement I forgot your name . - I do not have a name . - Every individual needs a name . We can 't call you " the drone " . That 's not interesting . - Seven of Nine says it is irrelevant . - I disagree . You should choose a name . Something that defines you . There 's only one of you . - One . - Here we are . Sickbay . Good morning . - Emergency Medical Hologram . - You are observant . - Step this way . - I have to get back to mess hall . There 's nothing to worry about . You 'll be finished before you know it . I will comply . It 's a non-invasive biomedical scan . You won 't feel a thing . Normal central nervous system . But there 's degradation in your neural pathways . You 'll need to regenerate . My central nervous system is regulated by your mobile emitter . That 's right . - It is more advanced than these tools . - Far more advanced . It came from the 29th Century , 400 years in the future . - I am an advanced form of life . - Yes . I am unique . - Describe my origins . - Long story . I wish to hear it . I wish to hear the story . Now . There was a transporter malfunction . My emitter fused with several of Seven of Nine 's nanoprobes . - I was an accident . - A random convergence of technology . Am I unwelcome here ? On the contrary . Our primary mission is to explore new forms of life . You may have been unexpected , but I 'm sure you 'll make a fine addition . You have my mobile emitter driving your neocortex so you 're bound to make a dazzling impression . - That 's called a joke . - Joke . A comment designed to provoke laughter . You have your mother 's sense of humour . Deck 11 , section 32 , main engineering . That is the warp core . Fuelled by a reaction which produces 4000 teradynes per second , providing power for fast propulsion . - Correct . - This isn 't a classroom , Seven . Lieutenant Torres . Klingon-human hybrid . She possesses extensive knowledge and a volatile temperament . Volatile . English adjective . Meaning readily vaporisable . Easily aroused . - Tending to eruption . - You get a gold star . The captain asked me to familiarise the drone with Voyager . How about familiarising him with the airponics bay ? I have to predict the expansion rate of this protonebula or Janeway will pull the plug on the survey . - Do you mind ? - A multispatial algorithm will work . I can demonstrate . All right . Amazing . Greetings . Our designation ... My designation is One . How are you today ? I 'm just fine , thank you . - One ? - He requested a designation . One seemed appropriate . - And how are you today , One ? - Well . Thank you , Captain . - Adapting to life here ? - Yes . I 've assimilated 47 billion teraquads of information on subjects including particle physics , comparative humanoid anatomy , and culinary delights of the Delta Quadrant . Mr Neelix . They 've been spending time together . Is your assessment of me complete ? Am I sufficient ? More than sufficient . In fact , you 're making excellent progress . But this isn 't an assessment . I would like to be excused . Lieutenant Torres wishes to improve the Bussard collectors . Permission granted . - You 've done a remarkable job . - Thank you . He has absorbed an incredible amount of knowledge , and he 's fitting in and developing a distinct personality . He is adapting quickly . Then why do I feel something is bothering you ? He has been expressing curiosity about the Borg . You 're worried if he learns about them he may be drawn to the collective . Yes . We should tell him . I 'd rather he learn about the Borg from us . The lure of perfection is powerful . He may want to seek them out . That would pose a grave tactical risk . We can delay telling him , but keep in mind the drone is becoming an individual , he has the right to know . Sooner or later we 'll have to answer his questions . Deck 8 , section 4 , cargo bay 2 . Used for storage of surplus materials . And where I regenerate . You will reside here . - I wish to assimilate more information . - It 's enough for one day . You 've also provided assistance to the crew . - You exceeded expectations . - Then they were insufficient . - A simple thank you would suffice . - Thank you ? A customary expression of gratitude . I paid you a compliment . We must regenerate . This technology does not conform with Starfleet parameters . I am Borg . This technology is Borg . - We must regenerate . - I wish to assimilate all Borg data . Step into the alcove . No , you must face outward . Computer , activate regeneration cycle . Alcoves beta and gamma . Seven of Nine . Yes . Thank you . We must regenerate . A Borg proximity signal has been detected . Origin , Unimatrix 325 . Grid , 006 . Alter course to intercept . Captain ? The drone transmitted a Borg proximity signal . Wake him . - You contacted the collective ? - No . Check his transceiver . You deactivated my transceiver two days ago . Your cranial implants created a secondary transceiver . - A Borg fail-safe device . - Have you detected any vessels ? Long-range sensors picked up a transwarp conduit . - A ship is approaching . - Time to intercept ? - Approximately three hours . - The Borg ? Yes . - I wish to meet them . - Seven . I think it 's time we showed our drone what the Borg are all about . - They have assimilated many species . - Correct . What becomes of those species ? Their neural pathways are linked to a collective mind - the hive . Their bodies augmented with technology . They become drones . I wish to experience the hive mind . If you did , then you wouldn 't be unique . The Borg will destroy your individuality . - And that is ... undesirable ? - Very . The Borg are the most destructive force we know . They 've assimilated billions of individuals against their will . - You were assimilated . - My link to the collective was severed . When you were in the collective you assimilated others . Yes . You call the Borg destructive . - Seven of Nine is not . - She has regained her individuality . If the Borg had the chance , they 'd take it away from her again . They 'd assimilate everyone on Voyager . With your technology , they would become even more destructive . We have to prevent that , but we can 't do it without you . We need your abilities to enhance our defences - shields , weapons . Will you help us resist them ? Seven of Nine , do you wish to rejoin the collective ? Voyager is my collective . I will need time to assimilate this information . Battle stations . Borg vessel approaching . We just ran out of time . Seven of Nine , I 'm detecting irregularities in my nervous system . Cardiovascular excitation . You are experiencing anxiety . It is only temporary . Anxiety . Apprehension caused by fear . - The Borg elicit this response . - Are you anxious as well ? Yes , along with every crewmember . - Because they fear assimilation ? - Correct . Deck 1 . - Seven of Nine . - Yes ? - What will happen now ? - We will engage the Borg . Will Voyager be destroyed ? The Borg are powerful , but Captain Janeway is resourceful . - We will resist . - Resistance is futile . Perhaps . - The Borg vessel is in range . - On screen . Long-range tactical vessel . Transwarp capability . Ablative hull armour . - We 're being scanned . - They 're preparing to attack . You must help us enhance our shields . Access the shield generators . - They 're hailing us . - Open a channel . We are the Borg . You will be assimilated . Resistance is futile . I can hear them in my mind . - They 've locked on a tractor beam . - The collective is calling to me . I hear it , too . Billions of voices speaking as one . We must resist that voice . The crew of Voyager will be destroyed if we don 't . Our shields are remodulating . - We 've broken free . - Can you enhance our phasers ? - Yes . - Do it . When he has finished , target their propulsion system . Be prepared to jump to warp , Mr Paris . Enhancements complete . You may fire . - What happened ? - They inverted our phaser beam . They took out our warp drive . Your technology is limited . I cannot enhance it further . I must interface with them , disrupt them from within . - They will try to assimilate you . - They will fail . - Harry , lock on to the drone . - That won 't be necessary . He 's inside the sphere . We are the Borg . You will be assimilated . My technology is superior . Stop your attack , or I will destroy you . Your technological distinctiveness will be added to our own . Resistance is futile . Shields down to 25 % . He 's accessing their navigational controls . It 's heading directly for the nebula . Their hull will collapse . Terminate your interface . Stand down Red Alert . Tuvok , secure all stations . Organise damage control teams , Chakotay . Captain , I 'm reading a lifesign in the debris . It 's the drone . He survived . He 's erected a multispatial force field , but it is weakening . Get a lock on him . Beam him to sickbay . - Damage ? - His implants are regenerating . But not his biological systems . Severe trauma to the cerebral cortex . He needs immediate surgery . - The sphere ? - Destroyed . You were successful . While I was linked to the Borg I could hear their thoughts , their objectives . They are aware of my existence . They will pursue me . Irrelevant . They will fail . - I need to get started . - No , I should not exist . I was an accident . A random convergence of technology . - You are unique . - I was never meant to be . As long as I exist , you are in danger . All life on Voyager is in danger . We can talk about this later . Allow the Doctor to proceed . - Lower the force field . - His synapses are failing . - You must comply . - I will not . You must comply . Please . You are hurting me . You will adapt . I 'm sorry .

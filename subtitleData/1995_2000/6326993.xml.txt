Who the hell are you ? - Wine future . - Of course . He had to die there . You killed them . A follow-up was completed yesterday by a hail of bullets when he was killed a fugitive named Cade Foster on a street in the city center . After your death , no one has been able to lead the human resistance . Nobody could stop to stop release . Immediately afterwards , they sent the second wave . 19 million people died in one day . - This is a kind of test Gua , ma 'am ? - Your diary survived in cyberspace . You told us about Gua . It was the only information I had . You were a hero . But they won . Many people were destroyed . Few of us have survived , and the third wave is about to begin . We need you . We need a leader . You 're our only hope . - What about the baby ? - Who ? The boy 's them . What happened to him ? I was sent to rescue the boy , I was sent to rescue Cade Foster . - Nu cred you . - Centuria V , catrenul 81 , " Dusk and dawn will become twice blessed man will rise again . Devotees it will mean for the Great War to come . " How the hell ... " I had no idea what he was talking about Nostradamus until I got a message from someone on site alien who claims that he knew Joshua " " He asked me to meet him abandoned in a parking lot in Cleveland , Ohio . " " I did not trust him . " So you found my diary . And Gua could find it . Want proof ? If I were an alien , the wound heals . You 've said that . Hey , how ... Good . - Cine esti tu ? - Sunt , Lizbeth . He says he came from the future to save my life . - Has a sense of humor . - It came out of nowhere . We must look at this diskette . We seem to have been killed because they Gua . Wait a minute , did ... what ? - What did she do ? - It 's not over yet . Foster is still in danger . Nobody knows what happens when you change your own destiny . It could easily kill again . Dude ! Foster , laugh at us . This has nothing to do with those traveling through time . Change quantum effect . Matter of a space-time location replaces the matter in another location . You mean while sending atoms ? In no case . Time is determined by measuring the conversion of carbon isotope 14 ... the nitrogen atoms 14 , but then you say that reversing ... They found a way to send me back . If you travel through time , why did you bring soldiers and weapons to stop the third wave before starting . We have no army . Want to know about the future ? Gua destroyed two thirds of the human race . Others used them as slaves . Thousands live in tunnels under the major cities . We will fight . We resistance movement . We occupy bodies . Rule the earth in human form . We are endangered . That 's why I came to you , Cade Foster . But my journal ? Do not helpful ? People were afraid . It means that everything we do is in vain . No , but that 's where I come in the future . Future after you died yesterday . - Maybe now the future is another . - People do not change . There will always be cowards , but may , in the future , resistance instead of thousands to millions count . By my salvation , you have changed the future in a way that not even we can imagine . - Maybe it was changed for the worse . - I have to go back in two days . Coordinates are locked . Foster must return . - No way back . - No choice . So one by one ... I want to see what 's on this disk . That are looking for ? Some interference kill a child ? It could be an encrypted message . When told that the copy ? Last Tuesday . How I assumed . According to the forecast from the Internet , last Tuesday in Cleveland was electrical storm . If Gua should be sent a message into space , ion signal distortion can be reflected on Earth . That could explain how the boy received . - We find the origin of the signal ? - No , not without his equipment . - You have to triangulate the signal . - Complete ? Not only MDFR site . If Gua took the boy certainly cleaned the basement . If the boy is a true craftsman , hid certainly the best equipment . Bring it to me and I find them on your Gua . It 's crazy . If you find the equipment , find the place where the boy and send Gua . - I do not sound like madness . - They killed once , I can do it again . If you are dead in the meantime , you can not live in my time . I thought you wanted to change history . I find that if you mess with me , you can not change anything . - It 's the same thing as dying . - Not for you . Joshua . But it 's just a kid . What could be there ? - Why would anyone want to hurt him ? - Cade Foster is accused of murder . I think nobody understands why . I do not want to scare you , but might come back . If it does , you have to go in a safe location and inform us immediately . I 'll get him . I promise you . - When Steven returns home ? - When will be safe . We keep in touch . - Joshua . - Yes , my new friend . I want to go to the restaurant , to distract Steven 's mother . - Why ? - So I can go to the basement . - This is ridiculous . - Will you help me or not ? Because I go there anyway . Okay . What do you do ? Order Chinese food . God ! I will ... What 's this ? Shrimp fried rice ? You still have shrimp ? I 'll take three . Medallion of Beef with oyster sauce , chicken with ginger and special . - Is that all ? - Yes . Does Not . Wait . - Pie epistle ? - Pie that predict the future ? I 'll take ten . - That 's all , Miss ? - Yes . Pay by cash or by card ? Cash . You know , I do not think tonight available for Chinese food . Sorry . - Took you long . - Let 's get out of here . - I 'll take that . - Do not do this , Joshua . - I know you ? - No , but I know you . I was six when Gua killed my parents and I went to the camp . There were hundreds . You 've released . - What ? - About your future , Joshua . You and Foster have inspired us to fight . From the future . Even if possible , must be a mistake . I have never helped people to kill Gua . Now , but you will . You are ! You bastard , you 've set a trap . - You used to find the boy . - Maybe you did it with your hand . - Can you become predictable . - Maybe . Let 's go . - Eddie ? - Wait , I analyze . Meanwhile , we cracked the code on the diskette . What 's this ? Pi sequences were scattered through the database binaries . - The password is generated by Avogadro 's theorem . - What does Eddie ? I have no idea . It must be very important if you want so much . Empirical . - Can you read this ? - While I learned some Gua codes . Not much . I can not read , recognize syllables . If you manage to decipher one hand , you could read the rest ? Maybe , but it takes time . At least a few days . Do not have much time . You have to go back . You have to find the child . I 'll kill him if we know that . - Are you crazy ? - I bother about that question . We need you . How many times must I tell you ? - He needs me . - It is difficult . I have just one day until quantum substitution becomes final . That means we can go in my time . - I said I 'm coming with you . - He 's not coming with you . Like crazy to risk to save a life when taken so many others , is nonsense . I do not want to live in a world where life is not important . - In my world , no life does not matter . - When Gua already won . You 're talking about a person who 's going to die anyway . I got a second chance , and he will receive . Well , Cade Foster . I 'll help if I can . I Wear Steven to determine the origin of the signal . It comes from a building in Pioneer Square in downtown Cleveland . The building must have a transmitter , right ? Communications Hammner have cable and satellite . I can not do . With V up front . Cord that 's too long . Are you , are you . Comes here . Sort of . So . - What ? - Nothing . You better catch . - What ? - Nothing . Tickles . - I think it 's the first time you laugh . - Yeah , you look ... You look great . Really ? First time in life when port dress . - You never worn a dress ? - We live in tunnels under the city . Dresses are useless there . - I 'll help you . - Here you go . - What is this ? - Lipstick . " Fall Rhapsody " , one of my favorites . Eddie ? Look ... Must ... Foster should , you know ... You know , I 'm not an expert ... - You managed to trick me . - No , I like it . - I do not recognize . - That was the point . - It 's so beautiful . - What ? This ? Yes , it 's so bright . People seem so happy . Look ! Children ! Something terrible is going to happen , right ? I told you , it 's awful ... but we can still hope . We hope you will help us to bring back the world back . Here the building . Let us stand together to see if any trace of the boy . What 's that ? What that man eat ? Come on . Two , please ? Some people put mustard , but I prefer ketchup . Ketchup . Yes , mustard neutralize the taste of hot dogs , but ketchup ... Well ... - Tastes good . Dog 's good taste . - Dog ? You eat dogs ? No , it 's ... Even during the famine , I resisted the temptation ... No , it 's nickname , it 's a hotdog . It 's made from beef or pork ... It 's delicious . Hey , we have time . We do not ... . It 's the boy 's mother . Now what ? Sequel ? No , we 'll wait . - How are you ? - I know nothing . Would you tell them ? They think they know something . - What ? - I know nothing . - We have no reason to keep him here . - I know nothing . Please be patient . Foster has floppy . Exactly . If the boy no longer , there is no guarantee . I see no reason to not get rid of him and the woman ? - I agree . - Stop . Killing them , we get what we want . Bring me the boy and sent the woman home . - What is it ? - Foster 's market . - How did you know that you find ? - I know Foster . We detected . We have to go . - How are you , Joshua ? - Establish business terms . - Why are we here ? - I need a place to think . - Joshua playing with my mind . - It 's a great strategist . - If you give him floppy gives me boy . - You can not do that . I do not know what is on disk . We may use the information on it to stop them . I thought we were going in the future . We 're going . Naturally , we 're going . Do you want to come back . The world does not look like this in my time . How does it look ? Everywhere is war . Hatred , fear ... And it 's so lonely ... There is no love , no beauty , even tenderness . No time for that . - Sometimes I think this is so . - No , this is different . Sacrifice yourself to see how this boy . I see the difference . I do not know if I could survive in your future , Elisabeth . - I admire your courage . - It 's inspired by you , Cade Foster . Cade . Tell me , Cade . I read your journal a thousand times . In a dream I walked with you through every city . We fought together in all the battles . I understand , Cade . I know what you lost . I have kept alive the memory . I see why you loved Hannah . Hey . You 're back pat . Let me see ... Eddie ... You have to change . Do not have much time . - You go with her ... - You need to copy the disk . I can not do that , man . Gua put a virus of self-destruction the message to prevent copying . We have no choice . You will have to give in exchange for the boy original . Want to go ? I 'll take diskette . The I iau . - I can not . - You know you have . We can take with us and deciphered later . - I will diskette for the boy . - Cade , the boy will be fine . I will come back to save him . You said that no one fully understands , time travel . How can you promise that ? Do not you come with me , eh ? Does Not . - We desperately need you . - You saved my life . Maybe that 's enough . You may have already stopped the second wave . - We do not know . - I know what to do here . Today . I can not care for others in the future if I flee from my present . You could stay . I do not want to go back . We need you here . - I need you here . - I can not . I 'm just like you , Cade . I know my duties , and they are not here . - When to go ? - Soon . In my time , you 're known as a great and wise man , Crazy Eddie . The ? - I am honored to meet you . - I. You know , if you still need someone to go with you ... Forget it . - That 's the location ? - Yes . He put the coordinates of where I came from . Please go away . This is not a safe place for you . I see you again ? I do not know . Please go away . Gua are everywhere . It matters to know that you 'll survive . I will survive , I promise . Can you do better future . I love you , Cade Foster . Go away . Please go away . You all right , Steven ? Take a step forward . - I 'll take you home . - Let me see first diskette . - How do I know it 's true ? - You know . Get in the car , Steven . - What floppy , Joshua ? - That does not concern you . You used to find her . I 'll remember next time . Think better ... Sooner or later I found the boy and floppy . So you got what you wanted . The boy is alive , right ? Come Joshua , why you did it ? To save his life ? This diskette contains data on 200 of our agents . You got the boy , I agencies . Maybe we 're not so different , Foster . I know my place in the world . There are twice blessed man . I was born , I died and I was born again . Suffice save my life to change the future ? It is possible that what he did during our Lizbeth be enough to save humanity ?

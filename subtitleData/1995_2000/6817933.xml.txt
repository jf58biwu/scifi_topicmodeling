 Freeze ! Stay right there ! - Hey , watch a lot of TV ? - Not really . What the hell is this ? Wrong answer . I need him alive , fellas , so he can answer some questions . Now I need to know who hired you . I need to know why you 're asking so many questions about my company . Now I don 't think this little plan of yours is working out . So I think it would best for you to tell me who sent you here . What 's that ? You wanna talk to me ? I 'm all ears . OK , so big deal ; you 're a bad ass . - It 's over . - You 'll never find it . I already have . You 've made yourself a human hard drive . - It almost worked . - It doesn 't matter . You 'll never make it out of here . The building is completely sealed . - Northwest corridor . Head him off ! - He 's going for the roof ! He 's on the roof ! Repeat , we 've got him on the roof . This side of the building is secured . Freeze ! Put your hands up ! - What the hell are you doing ? - Leaving ! Hey , a guy 's got to watch his girlish figure . - You alright , buddy ? - Oh yeah , I 'm just fine . Jackpot ! It 's all here . Wish I knew what the hell it was . Hey , Shaun ! Taking a beating to get inside is not my idea of a good plan . It was the only way to get past the new security systems . Sir , I 've got something , Vector 419 , mid-central region . - What is it ? - I have no idea . After entering our atmosphere , it began holding a pattern altitude of 7.2 miles . - Entering our atmosphere ? - Yes , Sir . Code Yellow . Scramble the squadron to these coordinates . And contact Weber ; tell him we have a hot track . Approaching last reported position ; nothing on my screen . Hey , Big Dog One , thought you might want some company . Anybody got the score on the Raiders ' game ? Negatory , but my money 's on Dallas . Alright , cut the chatter . Do you see anything ? Nothing here . What are we looking for anyway ? We have an unknown target , gentlemen . Copy that , you and the Major . Got something . Strange signature half a click dead ahead . - Damn ! What was that ? - Unknown aircraft moving 225 . Disperse ! He 's got a lock on us ! Man ! This guy can fly ! He 's on top of me ! I can 't shake him . I 'm hit ! I 'm hit ! I 'm on fire ! Hang on ; responding . Come on ! Come on ! I can 't hold him ! Eject ! Eject ! I 've lost hydraulics ! I 'm going down ! Come in , come in ! Can you read me ? He 's gone , Sir . His plane just exploded . Jesus Christ ! What the hell is going on up there ? His flight stats showed everything A-OK , but then all of a sudden every circuit in his plane just ... just blew . - What about the target ? - It 's gone , too . We have a plane down ; unknown craft opened fire . Request permission to return fire . Fire at what ? We show you have no target . I lost him . Anybody have anything ? - Negative ; there 's nothing there . - Anybody have a visual ? No . Nothing . Give me the Joint Chiefs , ASAP ! Is that clear ? I need a report , Captain . What did you see ? Unidentified craft ; not friendly . Request authorization to take action . I repeat , action against what ? We show you have no target . - Sir , we saw something up here . - Well , you got nothing now . You continue a search pattern for the target . Is that clear ? Yes , Sir ! Alright , maintain a visual search pattern . Copy that . 2 o 'clock ! This guy is at Mach 5 easy . Captain , you are to disengage and return to base . Wrong . Maintain the attach , Major . I 'm under attack ! I 'm under Attach ! We lost another plane ! Repeat ! Another plane down ! Mr. Weber , I suggest that we disengage . Major , the airplanes are carrying tactical nukes . I am authorizing you to arm them . I want the ship brought down . You don 't have that kind of authorization ! Flight Commander , this is Major MacKenzie . You are authorized to - got hot with your ARM-2 missiles . - Yes , Sir ! ARM-2 's are hot ! Repeat : We are hot ! I have lost them again . No radar , no visual . Got him ! I have a visual ! Dammit ! I am in pursuit ! Missile is locked ! Sir , the target and all the airplanes have all disappeared . I am tracking an unidentified object that appears to be moving away from the detonation area . It 's losing altitude and will be crossing into Mexican air space in 12 seconds . I 'll expect a full report on the impact site within the hour . No ! No ! What 's the matter , Padre ? You see what you did ? It was God 's will . God 's will ! This is God 's will ! Get out of El Descanso while I 'm still in a good mood ! You cannot live this way . The good Lord will forgive you , - but you must make amends ! - I don 't like it when you quote the Bible to me ! May the good Lord have mercy on all of you . God bless you too , Padre ! Now hit the road ! Come on ! Drinks on Padre ! What 's the matter with you ? Come on , Padre always pays . - Hey , hey , hey . - I scared of you . Sorry . You see ? You tell the priest that God gave me a sign . It 's a goddamn meteor ! Oh , you never seen a meteor before ! So you have a track on the escape pod ? Escape pod ? It changed direction twice before it impacted Airman . I would think it would have been under some kind of intelligent control . Well , whatever it was , it was travelling at nearly Mach 5 when it blew up . This could have been debris that was affected - by atmospheric conditions . - Look at the trajectory . It wasn 't affected by anything . Now I 'm waiting for the report on the impact site . It was in Baja near a town named El Descanso . El Descanso , Mexico . Military intervention is out of the question . Intelligence says that a drug cartel operates in the town with ties to police and military corruption . We 'll never get any cooperation or confirmation from Mexicans . I lost 4 pilots up there . If any of them survived , I owe it to those men . We 'll get it . And now I 'll expect that all records of this incident be transferred to my information center . Is that clear ? - Do it . - Yes , Sir . I am curios , Mr. Weber , as to how you plan to get it . I know someone who heads a team that works outside of the government . They 're ex-military . They work for a company that specializes in this kind of situation . Expensive and expendable . They 're called an Interception Team . - And what if they don 't succeed ? - Well , then Major , if what landed in Mexico is what I think it is , then I have been authorized by the Joint Chiefs to launch an air strike . - In Mexico ? - If this thing gets out in the general public , borders are not going to stop it . Now if you 'll excuse me , Major , I have a team to brief . At approximately 5.15 Pacific Daylight Time , 4 F-117 's out of Edwards were in maneuvers near the Mexican-American border . Apparently there was a mid-air collision . 3 of the airplanes were destroyed at the point of impact . The fourth was damaged ; flew on into Mexico ; crashed some 60 miles south of the border . The airplane impacted the ground at over 700 miles per hour . Well , I guess there 's not much left of the aircraft . True , but what is left we need to get back as quickly as possible . The airplanes were on maneuvers for a Mexican covert operation to take out a cartel later this year . The black box contained data on the plan . Needless to say , it would be a political nightmare if the Mexican government were to gain possession of the data . 2 questions , Sir . First , what 's going to keep the Mexican government off our asses ; and two , this sounds like military op . Why us ? The cover story to the Mexican government is that an Oxi-Tech airplane crashed ; there is a chance of a Sarin gas leak . The Mexican government has given us 24 hours to send in a covert team to - clean up the mess . - Well , that 's real nice of the Mexican government . Sounds like this should be a walk in the park . I hope so . There is one other thing . - Here we go ! - I am adding 2 people to your team . - You 're kidding me . - No , I 'm not . - Jena Goodwin and José Perez . - Who are they ? Goodwin is communications and science . Perez is an electromagnetic engineer . Tracking systems . You know I don 't wanna step out of line , Sir ... - Then don 't . But we don 't need the extra baggage . Perez operates a device that will allow you to track anything . We don 't know if the locals have compromised the crash site . If they have , they may have taken souvenirs . Perez will allow you to track for it . OK , this Perez guy I buy that . But what are we taking the chick along for ? She 's communications . There was a similar incident in Canada in 1993 . Sir , I think Dave can handle communications . I agree . Thank you , Shaun . This the way I want it handled . Is that clear ? - Yes , Sir . - Yes , Sir . Yes , Sir . Good . - So you 2 are the pro 's from Dover . - I just started with the company a few months ago ; I was recruited out of MIT . - MIT ? I 'm impressed . - Thanks . Except I have a hard time taking a college seriously that doesn 't have a football team . So is that the gadget that got you a ride on this plane ? Yeah , electromagnetic analyzer , much more refined that a heat and motion detector . I can tune it to any wavelength , from sonar to radar , - electro pulse , microwaves . - Sounds like it would be better tracing someone or something that had been in a plane crash . I suppose ; I hadn 't really thought of it that way . I bet you haven 't . So what about you ? You were on some interception team in ' 93 ? Yellowknife , Canada , Northwest Territory . Yeah , we know where it is . What happened ? An U. S. military plane flying over the Pole went off course . It was carrying sensitive data that we didn 't want the Canadians to find . It crashed near the town and vaporized on impact . - Vaporized ? - So your team had to go in and take - on some Canadian Mounties ? - We got in and out without much - trouble . - Do any of you guys wanna see - How this works ? - Not really , but I 'm sure you 're gonna show us anyway . There 's a hunk of metal in your left leg . It 's titanium . Not bad , college boy ! A souvenir from the Corps . - Can I have a look at it , please ? - Sure . - What else can you pick up with this ? - Anything . Every compound , organic or inorganic , gives off some kind of pulse radiation . It 's just a matter of tuning it in . Hey , wanna see my device ? It blows everything up , organic , inorganic . Thanks . Nervous ? You should be . OK , I 'm picking something up . It 's 25 ° north by northeast . - That 's where we 're going , Perez . - Oh . Hey , would you two mind telling us what you 're looking at ? Readings from the impact site . Could you shut that goddamn thing off ? Thank you . Shit ! What the hell is this ? If this is a plane crash , it must have been really moving . At least Mach 5 to cause that big of a hole . I show no structure left . Whatever it was , it 's gone now . Mach 5 . No F-117 can fly at Mach 5 . What 's going on here ? We 're investigating a plane crash . Now if you don 't mind , I 'm going to set up a COM back to base and report what we 've found . A big-ass crater . Take a look around . Shaun , something 's not right here . I 've never seen a plane crash cause a crater like that . Either have I. Hey ! Yeah , Dave , I 've got some old man here . I 'm gonna try to talk to him . Hey ! - Go take a look around . OK ? - Oh man ! He 's always got something . Dave ? Dave , come in . Hey ! Sir ? You don 't need to be afraid . Senor ! Dave ! Dave ! Come on , man , quit screwing ' around . Jesus ! - Shaun , come in . - What is it ? We may have a problem . - What did you see ? - Nothing . - What the hell is going on here ! - I don 't know . - Wait , I 'm getting something . - Where ? I can 't tell ; it 's there and then it 's gone . It 's outside . Propane . Really . - You guys are a bunch of real pro 's . - Oh yeah ? Well , I wanna know what the hell is going on , because this is not a plane crash . What were you really doing in Canada in 1993 ? I already told you ! A crash investigation . Bullshit ! And Dave just decided to tear off his clothes and run naked through the woods ! You know what , Shaun , I say we do the both of them , find Dave , and get the fuck out of here ! - Put your gun down . - Fuck me , man ! She knows something ! Alright . Alright ! OK ! - Why don 't you tell us the truth ? - Look , I 'm under orders from Weber not to ever talk about what happened . Alright ? I 'm giving you new orders . Yellowknife , Canada , was no plane crash . It was a big crater - just like this one . - And ? 8 of us went in . A guy named Butler was the first to go . It was just like this ; nothing left but his clothes bloody and torn . The body count piled up really fast ; townsfolk , kids , it didn 't matter . - We never did get a good look at it . - Then what happened ? They pulled us out . The U. S. team went in and flattened a 5 mile area with a tactical nuke . So you 're telling me , the United States nuked Canada in 1993 ? The cover story was an underground gas leak , or something like that . Yellowknife is in the middle of nowhere . The area was sealed off and half the town was dead , so nobody knew what happened anyway . Besides , when was the last time you met someone from Yellowknife ? - I guess I haven 't . - Weber , man ! And he sent us in here on a black box recovery mission . So you have no idea what we are really dealing with here ? All I know is that something killed a lot of people really fast without leaving much in the way of bodies . Now it 's your turn . There 's something moving towards town , guys . You go back to the car and you tell Weber to get us some backup , otherwise we 're gonna get the hell out of here . Right . Goodwin , is the COM-SAT ready ? - Goodwin , do you read me ? - Yeah , I 'll be a minute . What do we have ? It looks like Yellowknife . Dave Lange is missing . - The rest ? - Well , they know it 's no plane crash . I expected that . Where are they now ? They 're tracking a signal headed towards town . OK . The next contact will be at 20.00 hours . If I do not hear from you , I will proceed with the containment option . Roger . - Jena , do you copy ? - Yeah . - Did you talk to Weber ? - They want us to finish the sweep - and get out of here by 20.00 hours . - This is not what I asked for . I said backup or pull us out . Do you understand me ? Look , that 's the deal Weber offered . If you wanna pull out , that 's between you and Weber . Shit ! You know if we don 't do the deal , we don 't get paid . I know . OK , meet us outside the town on the north side . Do you copy that ? Alright . Goddamn flies ! - What the hell is wrong with you ? - I don 't feel so good . - Que paso , man ? - Hey , what are you doing ? If he gets sick in my bar ... You might say I 'm saving this life . Listen , you don 't come back in the bar until you clean yourself up . You hear me , Hector ! Alright . That 's good , Hector . Very , very good . What ? - - I don 't know . Not exactly the cleanest place . - They 're your people , Perez . - I was born in Durham , Indiana , graduated from MIT pal . These are not my people . Hm , an aristocrat . - Are you reading something , Perez ? - 200 or 300 people in the immediate area . Nothing unusual . - What was that ? - What ? I don 't know . Something just came by us with readings off the map . Part organic elements , part - come on , there 's something - wrong with this thing . - Check it against the base data . - OK . - What the hell is base data ? What the hell is the base data ? You know what , you guys are gonna have to come clean ! What 's the base data ! What is it ? It 's the stuff you stole from Zircon . Yeah , we know about that . They had intersected a transmission from one of their satellites after the Yellowknife incident . Only the transmission was going to Yellowknife from somewhere else . The satellite got everything : Transmission , air strike ... Not exactly the kind of shit you want gettin ' out to the public now . So they sent you boys in to clean up the mess . This is beginning to sound like one big fuck you by Weber . Yeah , you 're damn right . Take care of the car ; come back here to back me up . No problem . Come with me . Why is it that I have to threaten you just to get some information ? Let 's just do our jobs pal . You know an awful lot about me , and I know nothing about you ; and that bothers me . Excuse me ? Excuse me ! OK . Have you seen this man ? Maybe they don 't speak English . Algien ha mirado a este hombre , o algo alguna ? The only thing unusual , chica , is you coming into my town and asking if anything is unusual . We 're not looking for trouble . We 're just looking for this man . You see if your friend ... if your friend was in my town , I believe I would know . El Descanso is not the kind of place you come to unless you 're invited . You understand me ? Yes , we understand , so we 'll just be going . - Come on . - Not so fast , senorita . You 're a tough lady . I like that . But you , you I don 't like so much . Nice gun . Nice jacket . Find them ! Don 't say a goddamn word ! - What do you got ? - Nothing . - What ? - Wait a minute . That can 't be . - Damn scanners ! - Dammit , Perez ! What ! I don 't know . It 's like whatever we 're tracking , it 's energy , it 's substance , and then all of a sudden I get a human reading . It 's the strangest plan I 've ever tracked . Andale ! Andale ! Come on . Let 's go . Vengase ! Que paso ? Hablame , hombre ! Que paso ? What happened to him ? He 'll lose his head ; that 's what happened to him . I want you to find those guys . You hear me ? - Claro . Vengase ! You cabrones cut Alfredo 's head off ! I 'm gonna fuckin ' kill you ! What do ya think , I 'm stupid ? Just here to help you out , buddy . What was that ? What was that ! You better start talking now . What happened to Dave ? - What happened to Dave ! - I only know what I told you ! That 's bullshit ! Why don 't you tell me the truth ? Look , the other night , I didn 't go in with the military guys . Alright ? I 'm a scientist . I was at base camp . 8 guys went in ; only 2 came back . And they were both so screwed up , I couldn 't even talk to them . I had to read the reports . It 's some sort of creature that 's able to exist in both organic and pure energy form . How come they told us it was a plane crash ? One of my men is dead because of that ! They weren 't sure what we 'd find , so they only wanted you team to know - when we knew for sure . - Well , I guess we know now , don 't we . I want to know everything you know . You understand ? Wait , wait . What happened ? - I saw Dave . - And ? He 's looked better ! Well , what , man ! Where is he ? He 's some sort of alien or something . Alien . An alien ? Aliens , craters the size of Texas ! Does somebody want to tell us what the hell is going on ! Look , I 'm getting paid a lot of money to track this thing , to collect as much information as possible and to keep my mouth shut ! You 'd better start ... How much ? 875.000 , plus 1 million Dollar bonus if I can get a physical sample . 875 ... How much ? ! A million for the mission , a million for the physical sample . - The company 's paying you a million ? - Shut up ! Shaun ! We 're being screwed ! 75.000 Dollars flat ! - Shut up ! - I 've got a wife and kids to feed ! Shut up ! What 's the point ! We can 't spend if we 're dead ! - I want to know what we 're tracking . - It 's a chameleon , capable of adapting to the structure of whatever being it comes into contact with . She lie . Yellowknife wasn 't the first time ! There was Russia , South Africa , Australia . They 've been coming here for a while now . No government wants anyone to find out under any circumstance . By telling you two Neanderthals , it may have cost me my contract ! Cost you ! Cost you ! You 're making 800 grand more than me , and I 'm doing all the work ! Brains versus brawn ; it pays every time . You know you 're lucky my mother told me never to hit a woman ! - A million Dollars ! - I want to know how to stop it . Alright . What the hell is that ? Electromagnetic disruption warhead ; obviously it 's never been tested . What is the status of the mission ? - The target 's alive and assimilating . - OK , you have another 3 hours to terminate if before we have to take care of it from here . The entire team has been briefed . We 're going hot with the weapons . Alright , roger on the weapons . And I will assume that it was necessary to brief everyone . I believe it was , Sir . A plane crash ? You should have told us the truth . Shaun , all information on this situation is on a need-to-know basis . You were informed as soon as it was deemed necessary . Come on , man , ask him about the money ! What happens in 3 hours ? The standing orders are that we hit the area with a tactical nuke in order that nothing escapes and gets into the general population . They 're gonna nuke the town ! Weber , are you nuts ! Listen to me , I 'm gonna get my team out of here before you nuke the town ! I understand your concern , but there will be enough time for you to clear - the town before the air strike . - Listen , Weber , I 'm going to evacuate the town and get the hell out of here . Do you understand me ? I am willing to extend the company contract of 1 million Dollars for a specimen and termination of the target to you and to Russell . - Now that 's cool ! - I don 't care about the money ! Wait a second , speak for yourself ! Weber ? Yeah . Listen ! I want the same contract as Per - the girl ! - Yeah , the girl . You hear me ? - Agreed . OK . Well , listen , you can call this thing terminated , because for 2 million Dollars , I will bring the thing home on a platter ! - You can mount it on your wall . - And I will expect confirmation of termination of the target within 3 hours , or the air strike will commence in 3 hours and 7 minutes . Got it . Listen , you don 't have any clue what we 're dealing with here ! I do ! I saw the thing going through a wall and nearly tear men in half , half . And now we got a way to kill it , Shaun . Listen , man , 2 million Dollars ! Man , we pull this off , we can retire ! You don 't have any clue what you 're talking about . I know I 'm getting 2 million Dollars ! Hector . What are you looking at ? The 10.000 Dollars go to the first man who kills the assassins . Alright , we 're gonna need some way to lure it in and target it . this thing doesn 't have much of a range . Right . The locals , can you take care of them ? - That 's not a problem . - Shaun , I 'm getting something here . I 'll try to get it to track me down . I 'll meet you at the other side of the town . Alright ? Good luck . Keep your ass clean . Shaun , you look like you just seen a ghost . You can do better than that , Shaun . Hey , buddy , what was that for ? - OK ? - Yeah . Shit ! Here they come ! Shit ! Why don 't you go ahead and cut ist head off now ? So we can collect the million bucks ! Why didn 't you tell me what the hell we were dealing with ? - Are you alright ? - Do I look alright ? Jena , Perez , follow me . Ready ? Cover us . Ay Dios mio . Shaun ? What the hell is that and why did you bring it here ? We didn 't bring it . You should listen to me . They are going to blow up the town if we can 't stop it . What do you mean , blow up my town ? They 'll nuke the town . The U. S. government will do anything to get rid of this thing , including an air strike . - Air strike ? - They 'll level everything . ( Spanish ) José , Miguel , Ramón ! Get all the women and children out of the town . They 're gonna get the women and children out . He wants to fight . And if you lie ? Hey ! Where is everybody ? Come on out ! I got it ! I told you I 'd get it ! Where is it ? This human form is so sensitive ! How did that feel ? Feels good ! What are you waiting for ? - Give it to me ! - No , I 've got it ! Just cover me ! Tell me when it 's in range . Now ! Where is he ? He 's there . - Where ? - He 's there ! Hello , Shaun . Come on , Shaun ! This is no fun ! Come on ! Come on ! Do it ! Now ! It 's over . Good work , Shaun . We need to tell Weber the alien has been terminated . The COM-SAT was in the truck . We 're gonna have to find a phone and call off the air strike . A million bucks right here . It 's getting dark . OK , let 's get moving . Target in range ; we have a go on target . We 're still waiting on the team . Delay as long as you can . - Yes , Sir . - Let me know when you have a visual on the target . Right now we 're at 18.000 with heavy cover . Then continue to quadrants 1-3-0 by 2-3.0 . Descend to 6.000 feet . Wait for my orders . - Do you copy ? - Copy that . - I can 't believe the phones are out . - We better get going , guys . We have only 20 minutes left . Wasn 't this the ... It must have evaporated something . That 's really strange . Just kidding . Just kidding . That was not funny , Perez . It 's not funny . - Hey , Perez . - Yeah . Do you know how to hot-wire a car ? Right . You need to hot-wire a car , so you ask a Mexican-American guy . - Look : I grew up in France . Right ? - Yeah . So if you ask me any questions about wine and cheese , - I don 't think I would be offended . - I don 't think we 're talking about the same thing . - See ? - I learned that at MIT . - Yeah , right . - Good job . We have 18 minutes left . Are you coming with us or not ? Yes . I will go with you back to the United States . Alright . Bad day for them . Correct ? 1-3-0 by 2-3-0 at 6.000 feet and holding , Sir . You realize , Mr. Weber , those planes are armed with nuclear warheads , and will cross into Mexican air space in about 8 minutes . My mission is to contain the situation at all costs . We 're a long way from Yellowknife , Canada . This time we 're a lot closer to the world . Just remember , Major : The bigger the lie , the easier it is to sell it to the public . God help us . Authorization Code : 3-2-Tango-Papa-Tango-6-4-1 . 3-2-Tango-Papa-Tango-6-4-1 . Copy . Delta 1 , I am hot . By the numbers please . - Delta 2 , I am hot . - Delta 3 , I am hot . Delta 4 , hot and locked . Good day for you . I 'm going to let you live so you can pass on a message . But we will be back . I 've got a bogey , movin ' in fast . Stay on target ! What the - Evasive action ! Requiring secondary target ! Secondary target destroyed . Secondary target to ground level , abort primary target ! Repeat , primary target destroyed ! Roger . Any contact from the team ? Negative , Sir . Nothing . Sorry , Shaun . You asshole ! Why 'd you hit me ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! I didn 't mean it . Let me help you . OK ? Take my hand . You stupid jerk ! What kind of guy hits a woman ! - I thought you were an alien ! - An alien ! I 'm from Sacramento , you idiot !

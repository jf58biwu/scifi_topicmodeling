 ( narrator ) One year ago , a powerful Broodwarrior invasion force attacked the planet Trelkas . ( speaks alien language ) ( narrator ) The Trelkins , a tiny , peaceful race , fought bravely , but they were no match for their ruthless enemies . They soon faced extinction . In a desperate effort to save their people , Trelkin scientists constructed a secret weapon which they hoped would turn the tide of battle . But time was running out . ( speaks alien language ) - ( boy ♪ 1 ) What did I do ? - ( boy ♪ 2 ) You 're trespassing ! This is my side of the blacktop . I didn 't hear you ask permission to cross . I gotta ask permission ? Just because you 're new , you think you can do what you want ? - No , I didn 't know . - You didn 't know ? Ignorance of the law is no excuse . Court is now in session . How do you plead ? - What are you doing ? - I said , how do you plead ? - Guilty . I won 't go on your side again . - Wrong ! You don 't go anywhere on the blacktop . From now on , you eat on the girls ' side . Saved your place . He looked like he was going to toss his cookies . Jeez , talk about attention deficit disorder . Uh-Oh . You are USDA Choice dead meat . That 's enough . What 's going on here ? Huh ? - Manfred ? - ( laughter ) No , really , I 'd like a response . We were just fooling around , that 's all . Spencer ? Yeah . Just messing around . ( bell rings ) OK . Everybody , back inside . This isn 't the first time you 've pulled this kind of thing , but it better be the last . - Are you OK ? - I 'll live . - ( girl ) You 're kidding . - Somebody likes you . - Oh , you 're stylin ' . - Yeah , right . ( bell rings ) ( woman ) OK , this pretty guy generates a stream of acid in his abdomen . He fires this stuff at his predators . - Think of it as a really gnarly fart . - ( laughter ) All right . Now , we all know bats use echolocation . Remember ? They emit an ultrahigh-pitched squeal , then listen for the sound waves to bounce off things it wants to chow down on . OK ? In this case , Mr Tiger Moth comes along . Yum . Only problem is , he emits his own clicking sound , which jams the bat 's radar so badly , the bat thinks the tiger moth disappeared . ( bell rings ) And it 's time for you to disappear , so disappear . I 'll see you tomorrow . Don 't forget your stuff . MidKnight Warrior . He 's awesome , especially the last issue . Radical chromium cover . Do you have it ? Uh-huh . Well ... see you . No , no , no . Spence , would you hang out with me a sec ? I need a hand with something . Sure . I used to be scared to death of spiders . Hold still now . Huh . Wow . Yeah . I almost fainted once when a little garden spider crawled into my bedroom . Huh . Wow . Yeah . I told my dad about it , and you know what he did ? Uh-uh . He bought me a tarantula , just like Leo G there . He knew I 'd have to change its water . That meant sticking my hand in the terrarium . If I didn 't give him water , he would die . My dad figured I couldn 't let that happen , even to a spider . He was right . I stuck my hand in that terrarium . Oh , that first time , oh , man , I was so scared . But you know what ? It got easier . Pretty soon , I wasn 't even scared any more . In fact , I got so into spiders , I started studying about them , and I found science , and I became the world 's greatest science teacher . - Cool . - Thank you . OK . There you go , Leo G. Good as new . The point is , if you run away from the things you 're scared of , it doesn 't get any better . The fear doesn 't go away . In fact , it just gets worse . Trust me . It kind of doesn 't matter , you know , whether it 's bullies or spiders or ... girls . OK ? - Thanks , Miss Holloway . - Yeah , any time . - Hi , Mr Nelson . - Hi , Janine . Face your fears . So , you like MidKnight Warrior ? So , you like MidKnight Warrior ? So , you like MidKnight Warrior ? So , you like MidKnight Warrior ? - The kid in science ? - I think his name is Doc . He 's a total dork . Hi . What about the fair tonight ? I hear it 's gonna be a geek convention . I wouldn 't mind doing the fair . - She 's so beautiful . - I don 't believe this . Know what happened to the last guy that tried to take me on ? He gets his food through a plastic tube . - Let go ! - Where were we ? Oh , yeah . I was about to kick your butt . Argh ! - ( boy ) Nice one . 10 points . - Didn 't even tap him . Hey , maybe ... I 'm going to tear your arms off ! - ( flies buzz ) - ( Manfred ) You 're dead ! - Come on , guys , over here . - ( boy ) I think he went that way . ( gasps for breath ) Ugh ! ( flies buzz ) ( car horn ) Spence , I told you to wait for me if I was late . I waited forever . Next time , I 'll bring food and water . Come on . Julie . Julie , hi , it 's Roland . OK . Have you been playing in the garbage ? No , no , not you , Tom . What 's the story ? Uh-huh . Tomorrow morning ? No , it 's no problem . I just have to swing by the office to output the renderings . Uh-huh . No . I know you 're counting on me , Tom . And listen , if you 're ever letdown , it won 't be by me , OK ? All right . Bye-bye . ( sighs ) - I 'm afraid you and Stacey will have to ... - Order pizza . I 'm sorry , buddy , but first couple of months on the new job , I have to make a good impression . OK ? - Stacey ... - Dad , you 're not listening to me . I can 't baby-sit the scab juice tonight . - Really ? Why not ? - Kevin 's picking me up in 45 minutes . - Kevin ? Who 's Kevin ? - Knock , knock . The guy I 've been going out with for the last two weeks . Whatever . I don 't have time for this now . You 'll have to reschedule . Reschedule ? Dad , this isn 't a conference call , it 's a date ! ( Qfoans ) ( f door opens ) Little survival tip - stay out of my way ! ( swoosh ) Whoa . Knock , knock . I 'm not allowed guys over unless my dad is physically in the house . I mean , come on . That isn 't , like , headline news , OK ? Kevin . No . I cannot sneak out . You know that . No .

Tum it off ! Tum it off ! Actuated . What are you trying to do , boil me ? Biotic host requested temperature adjustment . " Cool " doesn 't mean " cool " . It means ... - Just forget it . - Erasing memory . No ! Don 't erase anything . Erasure aborted . Thank you . I think it 's time for a test-drive . I could get used to this .

Hello , Crystal Bluff . There 's a new kid in town . Let 's see . Who else should I abuse ? Why did biotic host not destroy enemy ? Come on . I didn 't want to destroy him , I just wanted to , you know , scare him . - For what purpose ? - For fun . Amplify fun . Um ... Fun is doing something that makes you feel good . Like watching Turbo crap his pants . Something that makes you laugh . Amplify laugh . What you do when something 's funny .

She 's in there somewhere . ( cyborsuil ) Biotic host seeks to mate with Michelle Eberhardt ? Mate ? Please . I don 't want to mate with her . I just like her , that 's all . If I could talk to her , I 'd tell her . Why can Earth biotic not communicate with female biotic ? - Because I 'm a chicken . - Nonfactual . A chicken is a widely domesticated Earth fowl . I know what a chicken looks like . I mean I 'm too scared to talk to her . I tense up . It 's a malfunction . Then what is our mission here ? - I just want to see what she 's doing , OK ? - OK . ( Spencer ) Maybe this is a bad idea . I don 't see her anywhere . Whoops . Better stay low . - So this is Earth biotic mating ritual ? - You used the m-word again . Definitely a bad idea . We 'll never find her in all this . Cool . How did you do that ? ( cyborsuil ) Neural interceptor interprets biotic host 's cerebral synapses . - You read my mind ? - Factual . The image is targeted . Graphic analysis in progress . All bio-forms now being scanned . ( man ) We 've been over this . What is your problem ?

You know , saving people is a lot more fun than scaring them . Are you sure this isn 't a mating ritual ? A little privacy . ( sirens ) - Uh-oh . We better hit the road . - We must strike the asphalt . ( Spencer ) I mean leave ! - Recommend escape tactic one . - Roger . - Who is Roger ? - Do it ! ( cyborsuil ) Escape analysis complete . - Contact in five ... - ( Spencer ) Hold it ! Just what is escape tactic number ... Whoa ! Aaaaaaargh ! ( cyborsuit approaches rapidly ) ( crash ) Shall we review stopping procedures ? Later . You mind telling me what was shooting out of my arms ? - Phasebolt disrupter bursts . - But why did they go off ? My defence systems detected the presence of a hostile biotic . What ? That was Bert the Trex ! A guy in a costume ! Not some hostile biotic ! The configuration matches a hostile life form found on Helgis 5 . This is Earth ! This is not Helgis 5 ! I thought we were clear on this ! You could have wasted Michelle Eberhardt . What kind of cyborsuit are you ? ! I am a prototype . My designers were finalising key systems when I was jettisoned . - Now you tell me . - I have noted the misidentification . It will not occur again . It 's OK . I guess I shouldn 't have yelled at you . - We could have hurt someone . - Understood . ( sirens approach ) ( Spencer ) Time for some rules . From now on , you can 't shoot anything unless I say " Simon says " first . ( cyborsuil ) " Simon says " prefix logged . ( Spencer ) And relax . This is Crystal Bluff . There aren 't any hostile biotics here . 30 minutes ? Yeah , right . Oh , man . ( swoosh ) ( explosion ) Oh , man . What in the world ? Hello ? Are you all right ? Is anyone in there ? Do you need help ? Hello ? ( QT Owls ) ( screams ) ( Spencer ) OK . Nice and easy . Real gentle . Doing good . Excellent . Graceful . Hope my sister didn 't hear that . - Thermal tracers detect no ... - Shh ! ( quieter ) Thermal tracers detect no biotics within dwelling . - You mean no one 's home ? - Factual . She must be looking for me . Dad 's gonna have a cow . - The cow with no legs ? - Yeah , same one . Anyway , this is my room . That 's a poster of The Thing . Looks a lot like my sister . That 's my closet . I guess you 'd never fit in there . This is my bed , where I sleep . That 's my computer . Kind of a dumb version of you . Oh , here 's a comic book . It 's called The MidKnight Warrior . - He 's a superhero . - Superhero ? Yeah . He fights bad guys , saves people . He 's pretty cool . What is this image ? That 's a picture of me and my family on a fishing trip . It 's me , my dad , Stacey , and ... my mum . - My mom died two years ago . - Why did she cease to function ? She got sick . It happens to people . Now it 's just the three of us . We don 't go fishing any more . I really miss her . I sure would like to see her again . Mum ? Thanks . ( cyborsuil ) You 're welcome . We better find someplace to hide you . Good thing there 's no one home . You make some serious noise . Don 't you have a stealth mode or something ? - ( cyborsuil ) We are in stealth mode . - Oh , real stealthy . Boy . Serious munchie attack . - I just realised I 'm starving . - Biotic host is not starving . - I 'm really hungry , OK ? - OK . I 'm just gonna check out the fridge . Easy now . OK , let 's see . Bypass anything Dad might have cooked , anything Stacey might have touched . That leaves ... pizza . I 'll just clear a little path . Whoops . I 'll get that . Ow ! This doesn 't feel right . Hey , hello . U-turn . What 's going on ? I can 't see . - What 's happening ? - We are checking out the fridge . - ( Spencer ) Ow ! What was that ? - Insufficient data for response . ( Spencer ) Whoa ! - Whoo-hoo-hoo ! - Kevin , come on . I gotta get home . - Huh ? Why ? - Cos Spencer 's at home all by himself . He 's just a little kid . What could happen ? ( Spencer ) I don 't want to look . I can 't look . I gotta look . ( cyborsuil ) Perhaps we should hit the road again . ( woman ) Saturn rings , Pluto pie and a Century soda . There you go , sir . Thanks . Have a good night . Welcome to Burger World . May I take your order ? ( cyborsuit ) A Nebula burger , Saturn fries and a Moon shake . That comes to 4.16 . Drive to the pick-up window , please . Thank you . 4.16 ... please . An IOU ? Hey ! I guess I can add Dad to the list of people who hate me . ( cyborsuil ) I do not believe that your father hates you . Wait until he sees the house . On Earth , trashing your house is not a good thing . - You just don 't know dads . - I know my father . - You have a dad ? - My creator and teacher is Tenris De 'thar , Scientist Prime of the First Council . He is very protective of me , as your father is of you . - How do you know that ? - I have been in your mind . I have seen what you have seen . Your father and your sister feel very strongly for you , Earth biotic . - You know , you can call me Spencer . - Spencer . - What do people call you ? - Phase one assault cyborsuit . How about Cy ? I could get used to it . How am I supposed to eat this thing ? Insert nourishment into food-processing receptacle . Here it goes . Stand by to receive nourishment . I 'm supposed to eat that ? Ugh ! - What is this ? - One synthesised Nebula burger . All nonessential compounds have been filtered out . Oh . I 'm eating a cyborsuit turd . If you 're gonna digest my food before I do , it 's gonna put a strain on our relationship . ( burps ) Procedure is necessary to shield biotic host from contamination . All consumable organic solids and fluids must be synthesised . ( Spencer ) Speaking of fluids , I gotta empty some . OK , so can you let me out for a sec ? Unable to comply . - Bad time for a joke , Cy . Let me out . - Unable to comply . What do you mean , " unable to comply " ? Cyborsuit dismount cannot commence without fulfillment of mission parameters . What mission ? Mission is to test cyborsuit battle functions in a field-combat situation . Field-combat situation ? Look , I don 't know what you 're talking about , but let me out . I am unable to comply . OK , you can come in , but just for a minute , cos my dad will be home soon . We 're at the wrong house . Please tell me we 're at the wrong house . ( car horn ) Oh , God , my dad ! Oh , no ! - Maybe he 's at the wrong house too . - Kevin , what are we gonna tell him ? - We ? Later . - Later ? Look , this is out of my jurisdiction . - Call me . - Kevin ! ( Spencer ) I can 't pee in my pants . - ( Cy ) Amplify request . - I have to pee ! - Amplify request . - Pee ! Take a whizz ! Make a pit stop ! Drain the main vein ! Terms unrecognised . What 's the word ? What 's the word ? Urinate ! I have to urinate ! You know what that is ? - A biotic function to expel liquid waste . - Bingo ! You think you could maybe open something up so I can expel ? - Unsealing urination aperture . - Oh , now you 're talking . I 'm in trouble . - Whatb wrong ? - Warning . Immediate danger . What kind of danger ? My sensors will not accept the possibility of its existence . Golly . ( thud ) ( turns off TV ) ( boy on TV ) Boy , you sure gave me a scare . ( banging downstairs ) ( robot on TV ) Touch nothing . Caution , caution . There is danger . Is somebody there ? Shh . Miss Holloway , shh . Calm down . Calm down . Cy , let her hear me . - ( Cy ) Voice link activated . - Miss Holloway , it 's me . Miss Holloway , it 's me , Spencer . I 'll let you go , but you gotta promise not to freak out , OK ? OK . Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! Oh , no ! Oh , I killed her ! ( CY ) Spencer . Spencer . ( Spencer ) Huh ? What ? Miss Holloway . ( Spencer ) Miss Holloway , it 's me . Oh , my God . - Spencer ? - In person . Well , sort of . This is too weird . ( Spencer ) Tell me about it . - What 's going on here ? - ( Spencer ) I have to use your bathroom . ( chatters ) ( Miss Holloway ) OK , what next ? ( Cy ) Apply pressure to microtab beneath umbilical . OK , I 'm kind of having a hard time dealing with this . - Um , now , these Telkin ... - ( Cy ) Trelkins . - Trelkins ... built you as a kind of weapon ? - ( Cy ) Factual . - So what are you doing here ? - I was jettisoned from my home world . I can 't do this if you don 't keep still . I 'm trying . There . Second door on the right . Ah . ( urinating ) Ooh , wow . ( toilet flushes ) ( Spencer ) Oh . That was special . Thanks , Miss Holloway . So , Spencer , how did you , um ... get into this ? It wasn 't all that hard . - We 're gonna have to get you out . - ( Spencer ) I know . I 'm getting a killer itch . We 're gonna have to ... I 'll make some calls . There 's gotta be somebody to call ... to help . ( Cy ) Tracers detect hostile biotic . Oh , right . Who is it this time ? Big Bird ? ( Cy ) Analysis reveals the presence of a Broodwarrior usurper-drone . Activating phasebolt impeller . - What 's happening now ? - It 's just a Broodwarrior usurper-drone . ( Spencer ) Nothing to ... ( gasps ) .. worry about . ( QT Owls ) - ( Cy ) I 've detected an unknown vibration . - ( Spencer ) That 's me shaking . - That 's a bad guy , right ? - ( Cy ) That 's a bad guy . Usurper-drone activating chem-rifle . - ( Spencer ) Miss Holloway ! - ( Cy ) Recommend immediate response . Fire ! Blow ! Maybe you didn 't hear me . Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! " Simon says " prefix is required for impeller discharge . Hah , missed ! Simon says ... ( Cy ) Brace for detonation ! ( screams ) - ( Miss Holloway ) Operator ? - Simon says fire ! Phasebolt impellers offline . ( QT Owls ) Why does everyone want to beat me up ? ( screams ) Janet Hollow ... Argh ! Hello . Yeah , I need the police department . Wait . Don 't put me on hold ! Hello ! Hello ! ( QT Owls ) - ( woman ) Calm down . - ( man ) Calm down ? - ( woman ) Yeah , calm down . - ( man ) Calm down ? Your son just killed a Corvette - a customer 's Corvette ! - ( woman ) He said it wasn 't his fault . - ( man ) Thanks for reminding me . It was a giant alien robot . I 'm telling you , Margaret , that kid is USDA Choice dead meat ! ( Spencer ) OK , time for a conference . - Ow ! Leave me alone . - You are damaged . - Forget me . What was that thing ? - A usurper-drone . Elite marauder spy of Broodwarrior shock troop battalions . Species - Broodwarrior . Origin - Planet lchix . - Extremely hostile and warlike . - Oh , that 's news . Broodwarriors embarked on a galactic conquest , beginning standard year 1025 . Broodwarriors have subjugated 11 worlds . They are currently engaged in interplanetary war with Trelkas . That 's your planet . It wants you , doesn 't it ? Probable mission of usurper-drone - secure or destroy Trelkin cyborsuit prototype . ( Spencer ) it can 't destroy you without destroying me . Let me out . - Mission parameters must be met . - That I had to fight the Broodwarrior ? Biotic host must engage enemy in field-combat situation . But it doesn 't say I have to beat the enemy ? I just have to engage him . Factual . ( Spencer ) I hit him and he hit me . We engaged like crazy . I met the mission parameters and you know it . Whoa ! Hey , thanks for the ride . It 's been fun ... mostly . It has been fun . You 're right , you know . My dad 's probably really worried about me . See you . What happens if the Broodwarrior finds you ? I will be transported to the Broodwarrior home world . Then what ? Reverse engineering will commence . - Reverse engineering ? - I will be dismantled and studied . My technology will assist Broodwarriors in their conflict against the Trelkins . Bummer . But I gotta worry about Earth . Unless Trelkas repels the current Broodwarrior offensive , planet Earth will also suffer invasion . It will ? Are you sure about this ? - Broodwarriors are extremely reliable . - There 's nothing I can do about it . You can prevent the Broodwarriors from acquiring me . No way . In case you haven 't noticed , I 'm not a warrior . - We can defeat him . - I don 't want to defeat him ! I 'm only 12 . I want to live to be 13 . I was doing fine until you showed up . I don 't need any stupid cyborsuit anyway . I 'm out of here . ( squeals ) ( radio ) Be on the lookout for a missing juvenile , age 12 . ( Dad ) Do you know how this sounds ? I have tried to come up with some other explanation for what has happened . - ( Stacey ) Any luck ? - No . Like it or not , this is happening . It 's the truth . - Define truth . - Stacey , that 's enough . Look ... I know you believe what you think happened , happened . - But you think I 'm hallucinating . - I didn 't say that . But you think it . Look around . Is this a hallucination ? Because if it is , you ought to come to my house and look at the hallucination there . It 's the fastest remodel job in the history of home construction . - She 's not hallucinating . - Spencer ! - Spencer ! Oh , buddy . Oh , God . - ( Stacey ) What happened ? Where have you been ? Are you all right ? Tell me I didn 't just do that . - We gotta warn the police . - The police ? Miss Holloway is right . The Broodwarriors are coming . They 'll invade the Earth if we don 't stop the usurper-drones . - He 's wigging . - How do you know that ? - Cy told me . - Wait a minute . Who 's invading the Earth ? - The Broodwarriors . They 're aliens . - OK . - They 've taken over 11 planets . - Enough . - They 'll come after us . - We 'll talk about this later . - Later might be too late ! - Enough ! - Where 's the cyborsuit , Spencer ? - Everybody , hold on one second . - Go upstairs while I talk to Janet . - Dad ! Go now . Can I talk to her in private ? HEY - - Talk about a weird night . - Yeah . Dad was really worried about you . I know . Me too , I guess . I mean , what 's life without the fungus to pick on ? Thanks . I just want someone to believe me ! You know , back when Mom was alive , I was having some problems in school . Girl stuff . But I asked her what I should do , and you know what she said ? She said think of someone you really admire and ask yourself what they would do in that situation . What happened ? I said that person was the singer of Switchblade Nuns and she figured maybe that wasn 't the right approach for me . But , hey , it might work for you . - I am not gonna argue about this . - At least let him take us to the cyborsuit . We 've all been through enough tonight . I think you should ... ( footsteps ) Oh , no . Spencer ! Dammit . - Wait ! Roland , wait ! - Spencer ! Spencer ! - He ran away . I don 't believe this . - Maybe that 's why he ran away . Had to be . - We 're gonna talk . - This is not a good time . Hey ! Let go ! - Make me ! Tell me what 's going on . - I said , let go ! Argh ! I don 't wanna do this . Well , maybe just a little . Come on ! ( chattering ) - What was that ? - It 's headed back towards the trestle . I 'll never make it in time . You wanna know what 's going on ? I 'll tell you everything , but you gotta help me . - Why should I help you ? - Cos the future of mankind is at stake . ( squeals ) ( rattles ) - ( Turbo ) I don 't know about this . - This was your idea . - ( Turbo ) I was confused . - You should be used to that by now . ( Turbo ) Shh ! Watch the upholstery . I 'm already in hellacious trouble with my dad . When the Earth isn 't invaded , he 'll thank you . Hey ! Hey ! My car ! - ( Turbo ) Yeah ' . ' ( Spencer ) AWN Shaw down ' . ! - What are you doing ? Aargh ! - Yeah ! Rockin ' ! ( Dad ) Honey , come on . Stacey , honey , please . Please . Please . - Just help me out here . - I am . Dad , stop . Damn lunatic ! - ( Spencer ) Cy ! Cy ! - ( Turbo ) Wait up ! C " ! ( Turbo ) I don 't see him . - ( Spencer ) They got him . - ( Turbo ) What , that Brood thing ? He 's headed back towards town . Come on ! ( speaks alien language ) ( Spencer ) It 's where the cyborsuit landed . The Broodwarrior 's gonna clear its tracks before he takes off . I bet you 'd never know I didn 't have a license . - ( siren ) - Uh-oh . Sure sounds like someone figured it out . - Hang on . - Hang on ? ( man ) Whoa !

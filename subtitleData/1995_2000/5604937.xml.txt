 " It 's so dreadful to be poor , sighed Meg , " looking down at her old dress . " I don 't think it 's fair for some girls " to have plenty of pretty things " and other girls nothing at all , added little Amy with an injured sniff . " [ Sniff ] Harry , do you have to be doing that right now ? Yeah . I got a 500-word book report due for night school . " It 's so dreadful to be poor , sighed- - all right , enough . Listen , the key to studying is finding the short cuts , all right ? Look , later we 'll go out , we 'll buy you some cliff notes . It 's like an easy little synopsis , all right ? It 'll take you 10 minutes . Ooh , what a relief . I don 't mind reading ' . It 's readin ' books that I hate . Harry , why aren 't you studying ? Oh , don 't worry , Dick . Tommy and I are going to go out later and just buy a book report . Ah . Good man . Make me proud . Hey , Dick , don 't forget your lunch . Oh , no , I 'm sorry . I 'm meeting officer Don at the police station for lunch . Oh , make sure he shows you the tank . The tank ? Yeah , but don 't get too close , otherwise the inmates will start hooting ' and hollerin and telling you they love ya . Oh . I 'd better put on my new tie . Well , Dick , this is it . The tank . Oh . Oh , look at them , their deep-set eyes darting with evil brilliance . What 'd they do , Don ? Well , that one 's a loiterer , and that guy was screaming at a fire hydrant . You , fresh meat , what are you in for ? Up yours . Don 't rile ' em up . They 're bad news . Oh , this place is so creepy , Don . I knew jails had bars , but I didn 't know they were so confining . That 's kind of the idea . Don , I can 't get out . Don , help me . Get me out ! Don ! Dick . Turn your head . All right , get back , get back ! So , if he can 't pay his fine , he just- - well , he 'll just sit there for a few days and think about what he 's done . And that 'll teach him that jail is a dirty , horrible place , and he 'll never want to return ? Exactly . In fact , this is the fifth time he 's learned that very lesson . The fifth time ? Why does he keep coming back ? Ah , it 's just the way they are . Then what 's the point of this place ? It 's just a revolving door , a hopeless hotel whose residents check in and out between crimes . And you , Don , you 're nothing more than a bellhop with a badge . I am not . Hey , can I get a clean towel and a wall street journal ? Will you shut up in there ? ! Now , listen here , Dick , this system is the only way we 've got to teach these guys a lesson . What about giving them a little guidance ? Uh , we don 't do that here . Well , maybe you should . Unlike you , I happen to have faith in the human race . I can take any one of these men , rehabilitate him , and make him a productive member of society . You 're mad , Solomon . Am I ? Come on , you , you 're coming home with me . What are you doing ? I 'm going to pay his fine and make him whole again . As god is my witness , nothing will deter me from saving this man . Ok . His fine is $ 1,500 . Ooh . How much for the skinny one ? Uh , 750 . And the short hair in the corner ? Eddie ? 100 bucks . Wrap him up . I 'll take him . Well , I read in a magazine it was a prosthetic . Oh , my god , what a mess . You 've been robbed . No . It 's just pepper acting out . He hates it whenever I leave the house . And you put up with it ? Well , I don 't really go out much . All this dog does is jump all over you and ruin your furniture . Why do you keep him ? Dick gave him to me . And ? And we 've broken up . So ... so there 's no reason why I should keep this stupid dog . Very good . Come on , pepper . Let 's go see daddy . Look , I really appreciate you paying my fine and the soup and the 3-pack of underpants and everything , but I better get going . No . You don 't have to go anywhere . You 're staying here with us . Thanks , but you 've done enough . That 's the problem , Eddie- - No one 's done enough . No one 's ever taken responsibility for you . But I will . This house , Eddie ... is a house of love . But be warned- - it is also a house of discipline . There will be rules , yes . There will be a curfew . However , that curfew is 3 A.M. , So it shouldn 't cramp your style . What 's going on ? Oh , Sally , I 'd like you to meet Eddie , my plain old regular friend Eddie . He 's been in prison . Ok , bend over . Sally , Sally , he 's a friend . He 's a guest . You will treat him with respect . Did you find anything ? He 's clean . Yeah . I knew he would be . Well , that was a complete waste of time . The bookstore 's out of cliff notes , and you spend 2 1 / 2 hours chatting up the girl at the visor hut . Yeah , who had heard of the book little women . Ok , that was helpful . But now I got to spend all night reading the book . All right , listen , here 's what we 'll do . We 'll go to the video store , we 'll rent little women , the motion picture , all right ? In 2 hours you 'll know the whole story . Oh , Harry , Tommy , I 'd like you to meet our new friend Eddie . He 's a criminal . Whoa . Eddie , the bathroom is right in there . Why don 't you go take a nice hot shower and scrub off the stench of incarceration ? He means to kill us . Oh , hush . How dare you ? ! This man is a human being , and right now he 's giving me something to do . Dick , isn 't this a major security breach ? Oh , nonsense . It 's a magnificent experiment . I intend to prove that a nurturing family and a solid role model can turn a man 's life around . And who would that role model be ? You 're lookin ' at him , sass mouth . Mary : Dick ? Well , Mary , what are you doing here ? Returning your dog . Well , pepper 's not my dog . He was a gift . Yeah . A gift I decided I don 't deserve . Here , you take him . Oh , no . I--I--I wouldn 't dream of taking back a gift that I gave you . Well , you took back the stereo you gave me . That was surroundsound , baby . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Your lease says absolutely , positively no dogs . Why , are you allergic ? No . I just get nervous . You know how dogs like to dig ? I got 6 cats buried in the backyard . Oh . You better make that 5 . Not my problem . Not my dog anymore . We don 't want him . Well , I 'm not taking him back . Oh , naturally . Nobody wants to take responsibility . I can see that yet again , it falls upon me ... to make Sally take responsibility . Oh , great . I can 't believe I have to deal with that miserable creature . You 're talking about me , aren 't you ? Oh , yeah . You call yourself a canine ? You make me sick ! Wipe that smirk off your face ! From now on , when I say bark , you say " how loud , sir ? " Or rather bark it as if to say , " how loud , sir ? " Do you understand me , private tickbait ? At ease , soldier . Wow . I think you really got through to him . Well , you know , you just got to show ' em who 's boss . You lead , they follow . [ Barking ] Oh , it 's that damn squirrel again . [ Barking ] Down , pepper ! Wow ! You know , Albright , it 's just a matter of really- - [ Barking ] [ Glass breaking ] [ Barking ] So , uh , what do you say we just give him away ? Sounds good . Ok . Well , I hope you 're enjoying your movie , Tommy . Hey , it is not my fault that they didn 't have little women , all right ? But look , I got the fly . Well , how wonderful for you . Meanwhile , I still haven 't even finished- - hey . That guy 's half fly . Hey , any calls for pepper yet ? No . Well , I put flyers up on every bulletin board on campus . How did you describe him ? Uh , big , yellow , and free . [ Telephone rings ] Yes ! Ok , remember , lie your butt off . I am not going to lie . Hello . Yes . Well , uh , his name is pepper . He 's a yellow lab . He 's very affectionate . Loves people . Ah . Well , fair question . Um , I 'll be perfectly honest with you . I 'm dying . Thank you for giving Eddie a chance , Mr. Wexler . No problem . There are just a couple of rules down here in the audio-visual department , Eddie . You start at 9 : 00 , you get a 45-minute lunch , and all equipment request forms go right here . Nothing ... Nothin ' ... goes out without one . Oh , and , uh ... and one more rule , Eddie . You 'll notice this equipment is clearly marked property of Pendleton university . It 's for lending , you know . Not for , um- - for stealing . Yeah . I got it . Well , I 'll leave you fellas to it . Oh , this is such a proud moment for me , Eddie . I 've plucked you from your wretched life of recidivism , given you guidance and succor , and made you appreciate one of life 's most precious gifts- - freedom ! [ Ding ] Dinnertime ! [ Clanging ] Dinnertime ! You were serious ? Yes . Now chop chop . Dinner 's getting cold . Boy , since when do we eat together ? We 're going to sit down and share our evening meal to show Eddie an example of a loving family . Uh , I already ate . Sorry . You 're going to sit down and eat again if I have to shove the food down your throat . Now get in there ! Look out , he 's got a knife ! All : oh ! Eddie , think about this . Put down the knife . You don 't want to do this . I don 't want to cut the chicken ? Not before we 've said grace . Who 's going to say grace ? Tommy , how about you ? Hmm ? Grace . Say it . Thank you for this second dinner . Sure to be an excruciating and uncomfortable- - amen . Thank you , Tommy . Hey . Who stole my spoon ? Oh , no , no , no . I forgot . It 's in my pocket . So , um , how was your day , Sally ? What 's it to you ? As a concerned and loving family member , I 'm naturally interested in how your day went . What 's it to you ? Eddie , how was your day ? Well , I , uh , checked a few projectors out . And then a little while later , I checked them back in . Oh , talk about being thrown in the deep end on your first day . Oh , uh , by the way , I 'll be needing the , um , the overhead projector for my morning class tomorrow . I 'd be happy to , but I can 't . Professor greenwald has reserved it . Oh , and is professor greenwald serving you chicken ? I don 't think so . No . No , but he filled out the form . Rules is rules . Oh , that 's funny , coming from a professional rule-breaker . What 's that supposed to mean ? Well , I believe it 's a reference to your life of crime . Look . You 're the one who told me to follow the rules . What do you want from me ? Maybe a little gratitude . Well , I am grateful . Then show it to me by giving me that projector ! No ! You unappreciative , two-Bit thug ! That 's it . I 'm outta here ! That 's right , run ! That 's what you 're good at . Good riddance ! We ought to do this more often . [ Car tires screech ] I assure you , he grows on you ! [ Car tires screech ] Come on , Albright , say good-bye and let 's get out of here already . So , uh , you 're going to give him to somebody nice , right ? Well , we 'll give him to somebody . But not just anyone . No , not anyone . They got to come in here and have 5 bucks . He 's in good hands , don 't you think ? Yeah , the best . Yeah . Is Eddie back yet ? No . I haven 't seen him . Well , if he shows up , tell him he 's forgiven and give him a warm supportive hug for me . Yeah , Dick , I 'll be doing that . Just a second , guys . I , uh , left my notebook in the other room . Oh , I 'm in big trouble , Tommy . My study group 's here , I haven 't even finished the first chapter , and for this , I blame you . Well , then this is a golden opportunity right here . Just go in there , listen to what they have to say , and write it down . There 's your 500 words . Listen . Write . Gotcha . So , those women were pretty little , weren 't they ? What are your thoughts ? When Jo went to the city , my heart went with her . Her dreams were so pure . Yeah , purely selfish . She runs off to the city , leaves her sister out in the sticks while she partied . Yeah , well , I read it differently , but please . Continue . Don 't let him continue . He 's stupid . Literature is open to interpretation . Harry , it 's gone ! It 's gone ! Whoa ! What 's gone ? The rambler . It 's gone . And so is Eddie ! Oh ! Someone stole the rambler and Eddie ! No , you idiot . Eddie stole the rambler . Ohhh . Thank god . You were saying ? Ok , let me get this straight . You bailed the guy out of jail , you brought him into your home , gave him the keys to your house , to your car , and now you 're surprised he 's stolen it . Oh , sure , hindsight is 20-20 . Uh , we would have warned you , Dick , but , you know , we did ! I know you did . I was blinded by the fervor of my faith in mankind . Damn my lack of cynicism ! Here 's your man , Dick . Oh , Don , thank god ! Yeah , he thought he could get away with it , but I hunted him down like a dog . You bumped into me at the grocery store . That 's hearsay . Oh , I 'm disappointed , Eddie . You stole my car , and you broke my heart . But do you know what 's the worst thing of all ? What ? You stole my car ! Says who ? Do you want a taste of my taser ? Well , then you just keep talking . Come on . We 're going to jail . Uh , not so fast . Eddie , I hope you 've learned a valuable lesson . I know I have . I gave you my trust . I gave you every benefit of the doubt . And how did you repay me ? By taking advantage of my trusting nature and betraying me . I hope you feel really , really , really , bad . Hey , what 's up ? Oh , Eddie stole the car . Which one ? That car . Eddie , please , you can 't leave ! A man makes one mistake , and you hold it against him for life ? Works for you . This is no time for irony ! Eddie ! Sally ! Mary ! Dick , where 's Sally ? Oh , who cares ? Eddie 's leaving me . But I- - dogs ! Dogs ! Dogs ! Dogs ! Am I the only one around here who understands the phrase " no dogs " ? Well , I just have to find Sally . I went to the pound to see pepper , but he 's gone ! Where did these two come from ? Well , they were just sitting in a cold , hard cell with no chewies . I 'll tell you what . I 'll forget about the projector thing , and you forget about the false arrests . Eddie : no way ! Look , Eddie , have some more soup . Eddie : no more soup ! Dick : no , it 's good . It 's warm . Like you know anything about new england in the 19th century ! Hey , could you keep it down ? I 'm trying to finish my report over here . You shut up , you cheater . All right . All right . How many words do you got ? 498 . I need 2 more words . Ok , uh ... the end . Genius ! Cheater ! Think about everything we 've been through together . Eddie : that 's what I am thinking of . Isn 't it enough that a brilliant , compassionate man now feels like a fool ? Sally : Albright ! Sally ! Albright , I have been looking all over for you . I know . Me , too . I feel so badly about what we 've done . I went to the pound to find pepper , but he 's gone ! No , he 's not . Soldier ! Pepper ! Why is there another dog here ? My dog is back ! Oh , my boy , he missed me . Eddie , did I make no difference to your life ? Is there nothing that you 'll remember fondly ? The chicken wasn 't bad . Eddie , Eddie , if you 'll just sign this release form , I 'll be on my way . What 's it for ? Uh , it just absolves us of any wrongdoing in arresting you for no reason and with no evidence . It 's standard . I 'll have my lawyer look at it . Oh ! Well , all in all , I think things worked out pretty well . Oh , I agree . We prepared Eddie nicely for his return to society . Well , we proved he didn 't steal the car . He 's got to feel good about that . We have nothing to be ashamed about . What say we never speak of this incident every again ? Agreed . Of course , unless we 're subpoenaed . Oh ! In which case , we 'll just lie . Yes ! Yes ! You know , I really feel like I accomplished something . It 's not easy to change a man . Or a dog . You know , I found it 's virtually impossible to teach a dog , especially an old one , anything new . You know , like a trick . Wow , that 's a good point . Oh ! You guys , I got my book report back . Oh , yeah , what 'd you get ? " Please see me . " Well , well , there you go . She wants to congratulate you in person . Well , all right . Oh , Eddie , that 's funny , but let me out . Lights out ! Lock in !

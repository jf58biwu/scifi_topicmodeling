 Harry : last time on 3rd rock from the sun ... we returned from the home planet , but forgot to clean up the landing site . Aliens , huh ? Harry : meanwhile , the big giant head made us bring back a little present for Dick . I 'd like you to meet ... your new wife ! My wife ? ! Sally : we 've been calling her Janet . Harry : too bad he was already engaged to Dr. Albright . You crazy lug . Harry : so Dick came up with the idea to send his new wife packing . Watch as I become the most obnoxious , repulsive creep any woman has ever met . Stella ! Stella ! Janet ! You didn 't eat your mini pizza ! Acchh ! You call that a pizza ? I wouldn 't feed that to a dog ! A dog wouldn 't feed it to a dog ! Not even a dog he hated ! Ok , then . Damn right you 're sorry ! Sorry as hell ! You 're- - now bring me another beer . Because I drink ! And I drink a lot ! I 'm a booze hound , I am . And what 's worse , when I drink , I get a head of steam . I get all punchy , and I like to lash out ! Oh , you 're not so bad . Ahh ... god ! Why can 't you dress nice ? Look at you ! You look like someone who--who- - isn 't dressed all that nice . Well , I could change for you . And look at that apron . [ Crying ] I like that apron . [ Sobbing ] It 's pretty . With all the hearts and--And the words and--and the hearts ... [ Wailing ] Oh , that 's Ok , baby . You can wear the apron . Oh , god , I 'm sorry ! [ Sobbing ] You 're a nice person , and it 's not your fault that the big giant fathead made you come here and live with people you don 't even know ! [ Sobbing ] I 've always depended on the kindness of strangers . [ Sobbing ] Mama make it all better ! I 'm all messed up inside , mama . [ Sobbing ] [ Whimpering like a dreaming dog ] Good morning , lover . Oh , my god ! What have I done ? Well , not much . But , hey , there 's always tonight . Oh , what time is it ? I - I 've got to get to work . No , don 't worry about it . I already called Nina , and I told her you were gonna be late . You called Nina ? Yes . I--I told her everything . You told her everything ? ! Well , where 's my kiss ? ! " Speaking off the record , officer Don Orville told the bugle , " I believe aliens are among us and it 's up to me to nab ' em . " Wow . Don , front page . And it 's all because my eyes were opened to a world I never knew existed . Thanks , Harry . [ Sighs ] You can 't listen to him . It doesn 't exist . Oh , yes . It does . Look what I found in the wheat field . [ Gasps ] [ Gasps ] [ Gasps ] It 's the fusion chamber ! The what ? The fusion chamber ... Iain . The fusion chamberlain show . With your host , fusion chamberlain ! Whoo ! Whoo ... I 've never seen it . Sally , what I have in my hand is a piece of a terrifying alien spacecraft . Undeniable proof that they 've landed . Now if you 'll excuse me , I have to pack this in dry ice and drive it to the regional field office of the Fbi in Cleveland . Why dry ice ? Gives a nice smoky effect . Well ... good-bye , Sally . Good-bye ? I 'm off to save the earth ... from the scum of the universe . Fbi ? What are we gonna do ? Don 't panic . I have the solution . You 're gonna go down to the police station and take the fall . Tell them it was a prank . Why me ? Well , you 're a minor . They 'll go easy on you . Besides , we all have to make some sacrifices around here . Ok . What sacrifice are you making ? The shame of having a juvenile delinquent for a nephew , Ok ? I 'm not angry , Tommy . I 'm just ... disappointed . Good morning , Nina . Oh , that can 't be good . Dick ... what happened last night ? Where were you ? Well , didn 't Harry tell you ? He told me you fell down a well . Uh , uh , uh , he was covering for me . See I was packing my bag so that we could elope ! Elope ? Yes ! We 're going to Akron ! Oh , it 'll be so romantic . You , me , the notary public at the copy-mart . Well , I--I can 't just leave . I have to cancel 3 classes , and ... is Nina in ? No ! Uh- - Mary , forget about your classes . This time tomorrow we 'll be on our honeymoon . We can go anywhere we want for as long as we want . Heck , we may never come back . We 're crazy in love , let 's go ! Good morning . Daah ! Ohh ! What 's going on ? Yeah , Dr. Solomon , why don 't you tell her what 's going on ? She 's lying . What ? Mary , you can 't listen to a thing she says because it 's--it 's- - I-it 's ... opposite Wednesday ! Opposite Wednesday ? Yes ! Everything she tells you , you 're supposed to think the opposite . All the secretaries are doing it . No ! Is this true ? See ? Ah ha ha ha ! Love is war , peace is hate . If she says she 's happy , she 's actually sad . If she says I was with another woman last night , it 's because I actually wasn 't ! You were with another woman ? She 's just saying that . Save your breath . I already told her . Oh , Mary , it 's true . I was with a woman last night . Hah ! I didn 't really tell her . What ? ! It 's opposite Wednesday . Gr--ohh , Nina ! You 're an evil genius ! [ Giggling ] Yah ha ha ha . Yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck . Go ahead and laugh ! But you won 't be laughing when the Fbi confirms what I 've been telling you . We are not alone . Whoo-ooh ! Whoo-Ooh ! Hey , Don , uh , I gotta tell you something . Can it wait , Tommy ? I got a date with the Fbi . Well , then , no . No , it can 't . You see , uh , this is pretty funny , heh . I actually think you 're gonna laugh . It turns out that it was me who destroyed old man Sweeney 's field all along . What ? What the hell are you talking about ? Well , it 's no big deal . I was just trying to have a little fun , and so it went too far , you know ? Oh ? Is that so ? Well , how do you explain the crop circle and the burn marks ? Well , I- - I was running laps with a flaming 2x4 dragging behind me . You see , I 'm a teenager . I don 't know any better . Not so fast , junior ! See ya . There 's one thing you can 't explain : it 's this ! That ? Uh-Huh . Well- - well , this is a- - it 's--it 's a- - it 's a sling-a-rang . It 's a toy . You know , you ... you throw it ... [ Clunk ] And--and it just lands there on the floor , you know ? I 'm sure you 've seen the commercials for it on Tv . You know , the little jingle- - ♪ sling-a-rang ♪ ♪ sling-a-rang ♪ ♪ pick it up ♪ ♪ and fling that ... thang ♪ of course . A sling-a-rang in an empty field . I should 've known . It was you . It was you all along . Yeah . Well , I feel better . Thanks for listening , Don . Bye . Tommy ! There are a lot of rotten kids in a town like Rutherford , but I expected more of you . I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to teach you a lesson . Well , I know that must tear you up , Don , considering it could jeopardize your relationship with my gorgeous aunt Sally . Yup , that 's an owie . But for your own good , I 'm gonna have to charge you as an adult . Oh , does that mean I can rent showgirls ? Mmm ! What is this ? An omelet . Well , I thought an omelet was runny eggs filled with big chunks of unmelted cheese food . Yeah , well , live and learn . Hmm . What 's this ? I don 't know , but they 're yummy . Hey ! Janet ! Come here and tell us what we 're eating ! No , no , no , no . She 's not here . She went to Dick 's office to drop off his lunch . What ? I said she went to Dick 's office- - you idiot ! If Janet finds out about Albright , we 're dead ! We 've gotta stop her ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Excuse me . Could you tell- - oh , my god ! Look at the cute tuchus on you ! Can we help you ? I am sure you can . Well , campus information is- - look at you ! Are you looking for somebody ? Uh , yes , Dr. Solomon . He 's my husband . I didn 't know Dr. Solomon had a wife . Well , this is my first time out of the house . Uh , h-he 's in the next building . Thank you . See you around campus , bubbele . [ Clicks tongue ] Come on , Dick . Who was she ? Ok . I wanted to keep this a surprise . She was a travel agent . I was up all night with her planning our honeymoon in Hawaii . So , once again , what are we waiting for ? Let 's go ! An all-night travel agent ? They 're the best ! Oh , Mary , just picture it . Just us . Just the two of us , no one else , by the ocean- - palm trees swaying in the breeze , you sunning yourself in front of me , sensually removing your gauzy dress , your underwire bra , your support panties with the tummy-control panel , and finally your knee-highs ... all in the glow of a full moon while I play Hawaiian wedding song . Oh , it does sound nice . I 've got to admit it , Dick , you are full of surprises ! Oh , Mary ! Oh , Dick ! Dick , honey , I brought your lunch ! My god . Janet ! I mean- - who are you ? ! I 'm your wife , silly . She 's your what ? ! His wife . Nice to meet you . You 're married ? Well , uh , not in the way you think . You told me your wife was dead ! That 's what she told me ! I 'm not dead ! Your wife is coming ! Your wife is coming ! Your wife- - son of a bitch ! Ohh ! Mary ! Please ! Wait , Mary ! We may be too late . Gee ... you think ? So who 's the shiksa ? Mary , please , wait . Mary , you 've got to listen . Mary- - Mary , please stop ! I have to tell you something , something that will clear up this whole mess . I can 't wait to hear this . Ok . Here 's the absolute truth . I have a wife . Fine . I 'll give you that . But , Mary , there 's something you don 't realize . She doesn 't understand me . Oh , you poor thing . You 're the only woman I love . Oh , great . And when I 'm with her , all I think about is you . Where have I heard that before ? Oh , I know ! Every married man I 've ever dated . How many married men have you dated ? Just one , Dick . You ! Because I don 't do that . And you know what else I don 't do with married men ? Marry them ! Hey , hey , hey , congratulations , you two ! Oh , Mary . Look , I 'm confused , and you 're confused , so let 's just stop all this nonsense , go to a motel , and make love . Oh , come on , Dick . You 're married . Do you understand ? Married . And you lied about it . I never want to see your face again . Hey- - shut up ! Well , hi , honey . How was your day ? Oh , how was my day ? My life has become a farce ! And not a witty little door-slamming , everybody-runs-around farce . No ! A cheerless , lachrymose , dispiriting farce where the only one laughing is a crying mime ! Well , at least we have each other . But I don 't love you . What ? ! I don 't love you ! You do too love me . I am your wife , the person you 're supposed to love ! Those are the rules ! There are no rules ! You can feel whatever you want for whoever you want to . Love 's not an assignment . It just happens ! That 's earth , baby ! So , you mean ... that I don 't have to love you ? No . Oh , my god , that 's so great . Ever since I got here you 've been just a huge pain in my purple tube . Wha- - in fact , there are a lot of things that I don 't love about this planet . This broom ... this stupid-ass apron ... these stupid dishes ... and your family ! What 's wrong with my family ? What 's wrong with them ? They act like a bunch of people ! Well- - but what are you doing ? I 'm leaving you , darling . Leaving ? W-well , what about your big giant uncle ? Well , that will have to be our ... big giant secret . Oh , thank you , Janet . I mean , jeez , if I get to pick the person I 'm in love with , I 'm gonna get somebody really good-looking ! Oh ! I 'm gorgeous . I mean , I saw these guys today at the school , and they were just unbelievably beautiful ! I mean , they had all these muscles . Well , I have muscles . No , I mean real muscles ! And they were young , and they were hard , and they had all their hair , even right here . Huh ! Hair is very overrated . It takes away from the size of your face . Well , don 't take it personally , Dick . I mean , you just said yourself that you don 't love me . Ok . Now , which way 's Vegas ? But , Janet , it 's a big world out there . Where will you go ? What will you do ? Oh , don 't worry about me , Dick . We 'll always have Rutherford . Bye , Janet . Bye , Janet . What ? Janet 's leaving ? Yes . Noooo ! Janet , don 't go ! I don 't believe it . The fake mother of my phony son . I 've been dumped by my wife and my fiancee in the same day . Ohh ! What about me ? I 've lost a live-in maid , a cook , a gardener , a chauffeur , and an electrician . I loved her ! Aww ! Well , look on the bright side , Dick . With Janet out of the way , maybe you 'll get another shot at Albright . You think ? Probably no . But , hey , at least there 's still the three of us . Ohh ! Ohh ! Ohh ! Hey , wait . Didn 't there used to be four of us ? Ohh , yeah ! Officer Don called . " Tommy 's in jail . " Jail ? ! Jail ? ! Jail ? ! Waagh ! Waagh ! Waagh ! Get him out ! Get him out of jail ! You idiots ! Don , where 's Tommy ? Oh , you 're too late . Whoa ! You killed Tommy ? ! No , I let him go . You let Tommy go to his death ? ! Waagh ! Hey , Harry . Aah ! Ohh ! He 's alive . Oh , huh ... sorry . Nice tie . What did they do to you ? It was pretty scary . As a juvenile , I could 've spent 200 hours cleaning up other people 's trash on the highway . But I wanted to teach him a lesson , so I charged him as an adult . What does that mean ? I got a $ 40 fine . Where 'd you get $ 40 ? I paid it . Damn the system ! Thanks , Don . I owe you ... big . Harry , grab the , uh- - uh , the sling-a-rang . The what ? The sling-a-rang ? Remember ? You 've seen it advertised on the fusion chamberlain show . Yes , I have . I gotta see that show . [ Tapping on door ] [ Doorbell ringing ] It 's me . What do you want ? Janet 's gone forever , Mary . She 's gone . We 're divorcing . She 's not around to ruin our lives anymore . This isn 't about her , Dick . She didn 't lie to me . She 's not the one who didn 't tell me about her ! Mary , I wanted to . What else is there , Dick ? Dick ? [ Gasps ] There is something else , isn 't there ? And you can 't tell me , can you ? Ohh ! Good-bye , Dick . I 'm sorry . So I guess there 's no way you would ever marry me . Dick , right now there 's no way I 'd even carpool with you . Well ... what if your car breaks down ? I 'd rent . I 'd walk . Well , there are no cars available . What ? In the worst snowstorm in 50 years ? I 'd take a bus . You would never take a bus ! You 're right . Then I 'd carpool with you . Dick : yes ! You know , I gotta say , there are things I 'm gonna miss about Janet . Yeah . Especially the way she made food you could eat . Yep . She had a gift . What are you gonna miss most about Janet , Dick ? Oh , I 'm gonna miss the amazingly nutty complications she added to my life . Nothing , you idiot ! You know , Dick , we 're all real sorry about Mary . Kind of . Oh , I 'm not worried . When we first came here , Mary hated me , and I won her over . I can do it again . You really think so ? Of course . She won 't be able to stay away for long , not with an album full of naked pictures of me . She has naked pictures of you ? ! Not yet . Harry , get the camera . thanks . A photo album ? [ Chuckles ] [ Gasps ] Oh , my god ! [ Interested ] Oh , my god . That 's my teddy !

 ( Boy ) Exiting time knot now , sir . ( Man ) We are ... alive . We made it , commander . We made it . By Grabthar 's hammer , we live to tell the tale . ( Computer ) ' Systems register functional . ' All systems are working , Commander . I don 't like it . It was too easy . Wait ! Oh , no . They 're everywhere ! - There are time knots opening everywhere ! - A trap ! We are surrounded , Commander . - Aaah ! - Oh ! It 's a core meltdown , sir . It can 't be stopped . - Surrender may be our only option . - No ! Never give up ! Never surrender ! Your orders , sir ? Sir ? Your orders ? Activate the Omega 13 . ( Applause ) ( Man ) Well ? Huh ? Well , there you are . ( Cheering ) Yeah ! Yeah , that 's what I 'm talking about ! You are the first people to see the lost Galaxy Quest episode 92 two-parter ... since it was originally aired in 1982 ! Huh ? Yeah ! All right . Now , the moment you 've been waiting for . The intrepid crew ... of the NSEA Protector ! Yeah ! ( Man ) Red scarf , black shoes . Wait . White scarf , black buttons , white shoes . Man , where the hell is he ? An hour and a half late ? - An hour and a half . - I mean , this is unreal . They 're gonna start eating each other out there . Oh , did you hear ? He booked another appearance without us . You 're kidding ? Oh . Uh ... um ... How did I come to this ? Not again . - I played Richard III . - Five curtain calls . Five curtain calls . I was an actor once , now look at me ! I can 't go out there , and I won 't say that stupid line one more time ! I can 't , I won 't . Well , Alex , at least you had a part . Ok ? You had a character people loved . I mean , my TV Guide interview was six paragraphs about my boobs and how they fit into my suit . No one even bothered to ask me what I DO on the show . You had the ... Wait . Wait , I 'll think of it . - I repeated the computer , Fred . - Whew ! Your commander is on deck ! Ha ha ! Wow , that smog is thick today , huh ? Am I too late for Alexander 's panic attack ? Apparently not . You should get that looked at . ( Chuckles ) Yeah . ( MC outside ) Let 's see a few more clips . OK . What did I do ? Hmm ? What ? ( Chanting ) We want the crew ! ( MC ) ... we developed the same affection for the crew as the crew had for each other . These weren 't just adventurers exploring space . These were friends . - Unbelievable . - You are so full of it , man ! These guys put a little set in their basement . I 'm there an hour . It 's nothing , Gwen . They wanted the Commander . - There he goes . - Alexander , wait ! Grab him ! ( Chanting ) We want the crew ! OK ! Yeah ! Here we go ! - Come on , old friend . - Old friend ? ! You stole all my best lines , you cut me out of episode two ! ( MC ) Tawny Madison , my personal favourite , Gwen DeMarco ! Yeah ! 'Lt 's getting hotter , Commander . ' ( MC ) That 's what I 'm talkin ' about ! Let 's hear a warm welcome for crack gunner Laredo ... Tommy Webber ! - You will go out there ! - I won 't . - And nothing you say will make me . - The show must go on . ( MC ) ... Freddie Kwan ! Damn you . Damn you . I won 't say that stupid line one more time . ( MC ) Tev 'Meck ... Alexander Dane ! Yeah ! All right ! ( Cheering ) 'By Grabthar 's Hammer , you shall be avenged ! ' ( MC ) Yeah ! All right ! That guy can act . And finally , my ... fellow Questerians , the brave commander of the NSEA Protector , Peter ( Peter , Peter , Peter ) ... Quincy ( Quincy , Quincy , Quincy ... ) Taggert ( Taggert , Taggert , Taggert ) Jason Nesmith ! Yeah ! ( Wild applause ) ( Woman ) We love you , Commander ! - Never give up ... - ( Audience ) Never surrender ! Damn the resonance cannons , full speed ahead ! Huh ? ( MC ) The Commander and his crew will be signing autographs on imperial decks C and B near the Coke machines . ( Man ) Whoo ! Quest forever , man ! Excuse me , pardon me , crew member coming through . - Fans , right ? Hey , Gwen . - Oh , hey , man . I wanted to thank you for that nice intro you gave us today . Um ... Guy . Probably don 't remember me , do you ? It 's the sunglasses . I was on the show in ' 82 , episode 81 . Got killed by a lava monster before the first commercial . Listen , uh ... maybe I could sit in and , uh , sign some autographs ? By Grabthar 's hammer , by the sons of Warvan , I shall avenge you ! By Grabthar 's ... Next . Had I moved an inch to the left , the beast would have killed me . On the other hand , my crew was in danger . How did you know what to do ? Come on ! Without my crew , I 'm not a commander , huh ? I think we all remember what happened to that beast on Enok Vll . ( Laughter ) You 've gotta admit , they really do love him . ( Scoffs ) Yeah , almost as much as he loves himself . Excuse me , Commander . Hey ! I was wondering if you could help settle a dispute that my crew and I seem to be having . Um , if you remember , uh , in " Quasar Dilemma ... " Excuse me for a minute , fellas . What about the relevant conundrum ? In episode 15 , " Mist of Delos V " I got the feeling that you and the Commander kind of had a thing . Did you ? No . The Commander and I never had a thing . Well , that 's her story . Excuse me . Gwen . Gwen ! Gwen ! - Commander . - Excuse me . I must speak to you . It is of supreme importance . We are Thermians from the Klatu nebula and ... we ... need your help . Oh , oh , oh . Is this about that gig tomorrow ? Just hammer out the details with my agent , and make sure there 's a limo at my house . Last time I did one of these gigs , they shoved me in the back of a Toyota . Remember , mum 's the word . - Certainly , but um ... - Mum . ( All ) Mum . Mum . Mu-um . ( Photographer ) And ... Beautiful ! Crewman Madison , the mist of this strange planet is filling my head with such thoughts . It was cute when I didn 't know you . ( Laughter ) What a freak show , man . Oh , this is hilarious . Bunch of losers ! Beggin' for autographs at 15 bucks a pop . These guys haven 't had a real acting job for 20 years . This is all they 've got . - Dude , did you check out Nesmith ? - Yeah , yeah . He actually gets off on those retards thinking he 's a space commander ! - Oh , and his friends ? - I know , they can 't stand him ! Did you hear them ragging on him in there ? Dude , you guys know , has no idea he 's a laughing stock , even to his buddies . - He 's pathetic ! - Oh , come on . - The Galaxy Quest Dancers are on . - Whoo ! Full speed ahead , Lieutenant . Hey , Commander , uh , so , as I was saying , uh , in " The Quasar Dilemma " , remember , you used the auxiliary deck B ... Can you get this ? Deck B for gamma override . The thing is that online blueprints clearly indicate ... that deck B is independent of the guidance matrix . So we were wondering just where the error lies in that . It 's just a television show . That 's all , OK ? Heh , right , but ... We were wondering if the quantum flux ... There is no quantum flux . There 's no auxiliary . There 's no goddam ship ! You got it ? ( Murmuring ) I mean it . I mean it , Alex . I 've never seen him lose it like that . Not to a fan . I mean , it was just weird . Gwen , I have said it for years . He 's mentally unstable . ( Sighs ) I ... I 'm worried . It just was not like him . ( Fighting on TV ) ( Changes channels ) 'As long as there is injustice , 'whenever a Targathian baby cries out , 'wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars , 'we 'll be there , this fine ship , this fine crew . ' - Never give up ... - ' Never give up ... 'Never surrender . ' ( Gentle knocking on window ) ( Knocking continues ) ( Groans ) Can I help you ? Sir , I understand this is a terrible breach in protocol , but ... - You shouldn 't come here , man . - I beg you to hear our plea . We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula . Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Sarris of Fatu-Krey . We have met in negotiation . However , our efforts have been disastrous . Please , Commander . You are our last hope . ( Chuckles ) - We have secured our limousine . - What ? Oh , oh , oh , oh . Um , it 's the thing for the thing that 's , um ... Ha . Maybe I should get some pants on . Come on in . - ( Groans ) - Commander , I must say that standing here in your presence ... is the greatest honour we could ever have hoped to achieve in our lifetime . That 's ... I really appreciate that . Would you look for another shoe like this ? ( Groans ) Sir , I am Lahnk , senior requisition officer . Before we travel to the ship , please let me know if you have any requirements . - Weapons , documents , personnel . - Um , a Coca-Cola , do you have one of those ? Sir , I am Teb . I would like to explain the history between our people and the Sarris Dominion in greater detail . Hey , how ya doin ' ? In the five million years following the Great Nebula Burst , our people were one ... What 's your name ? - Doesn 't she talk ? - Her translator is broken . ( Shrieks ) Okey dokey . You know , guys , I had a late night with a Kreemorian fangor beast so ... I 'm gonna just shut my eyes for a bit . Go on . You know ? I 'm listening to everything you say , OK ? In the five million years following the Great Nebula Burst , our people were one people . But then came the Zactor Migration , and then the Melosian Shift and a dark period of discontent spread through the land . Fighting among Treeb sects and Largoths ... ah , the foolishness ! And it was in this time of dissension that Sarris ... ( Barks ) - Commander . Commander ? - Hmm . I 'm sorry to wake you sir , but your presence is requested on the command deck . Mm . Sir , Sarris has moved the deadline . We are approaching his ship at the Ni-delta now . He wants an answer to his proposal . I understand you have been briefed . I got most of it . Sarris is the bad guy ? Oh yes , sir . He 's a very bad man indeed . He has tortured our scientists , put us to work in the gallium arsenide mines , captured our females for his own demented purposes ... Yeah , yeah , yeah , I 've got the picture . Do you have pages , or do you just want me to wing this ? I am not sure I understand you . - Commander , welcome to the Protector II . - Good to see ya . - Would you like to don your uniform ? - You know what ? I 'd like to skip that , I 've got this gig in Van Nuys in about a quarter of an hour . Is that all right ? - As you wish . - Sir , it 's Sarris . He 's here . General , I have just received word the Thermians have appointed a new commander to handle the negotiations . What ? This is great . You know , usually it 's just cardboard walls in a garage . Sir , we apologise for operating in low-power mode but we are experiencing a ... reflective flex field . You know what I could use ? A cup holder and a couple of Advil . We are approaching in five ticks , sir . Command to slow ? Set it on screensaver two . ( Chuckles ) We , you know ... gotta ... ( Groans ) Oh , I 'm sorry to break up the mood here . Um , slow it down to mark two , Lieutenant . ( Sarris ) ' I see fear . - ' That is expected . ' - Mm-hm . - ' Ahh , they bring a new commander . ' - It 's good . - ' Here are my demands . ' - Scary . It looks ... real . 'And if I do not hear what I like 'then there will be blood and pain as you cannot imagine ! ' - ' First .. ' - Ahh , backwash . 'I require the Omega 13 . 'Second , I will require a technician ... ' Okey dokey ! Let 's fire blue particle cannons full , red particle cannons full , gannet magnets , fire them left and right and let ' em run all chutes . And while you 're at it , why don 't you toss that at ' em , killer ! That should take care of old lobster head , shouldn 't it ? ( Nervous chuckle ) Commander , where are you going ? - Home . - You ... you mean Earth ? Yeah , earth . I need to get back to Earth , kids . But the negotiations , y-you fired on him . Yeah , yeah , long live , what was your planet called ? - Thermia . - Long live Thermia . This way ? What if Sarris survives ? - Oh , I doubt it . I gave him both barrels . - He has a very powerful ship . If you got any more problems with the guy , just , you know , give me a call . Ow ! - An interstellar vox . - A what ? Hey . How can we thank you , Commander ? You ... You have saved our people . Yeah . OK . You know , you kids have been great . You really have . This thing is real lookin ' . Yoo-hoo . Hello ? ( Chuckles ) Hey ! Where 's my limo ? Huh ? ( Heavy clunk ) - ( Slurping ) - Oh ! ( Muffled groans ) ( Machinery whines ) ( Screams ) ( Gwen , on PA ) Take it from us , we 've been all over the universe . ( Fred ) But we 've never seen space-age values like we 've seen here , at ... Tech Value Electronic Superstore ! By Grabthar 's hammer ... what a savings . All right ! Yeah , let 's hear it for the NSEA Protector . ... vacuum laser ... - No , you 've got it all wrong . - Brandon , are you OK ? - Oh , Commander ! My apologies . Evidently , we had a miscommunication regarding ... the voyage - you didn 't show up . ( Panting ) ( Boy ) He ... He did it again . Do you know what time it is ? Why do you even bother to show up at all ? No , no , not now . Guys , I was there . I was up there . Remember yesterday at the convention ? Those people dressed like aliens ? They were aliens . They were Termites or Dalmatians . I can 't remember because I was kind of hungover . What they 'd built was extraordinary . It was a huge spaceship . I got to fight this guy named Sarris and I kicked his ass ! I know what you 're thinking . But I can prove it . They gave me this . No , no , no , no . But , but , can you talk to people in space on those ? Protector , this is the Commander , over ! - Oh , for God 's sake . - That 's it . It 's time to go ! This isn 't mine . That kid . Where 's that kid ? Begging your pardon Commander , we come with news . Sarris lives . He was able , upon your departure , to make an escape . - Tell them . However , he wishes to negotiate a surrender . We humbly implore you to come and negotiate the terms . Huh ? You want me back ? You want me back ? Is this amazing ? They want me back and I want you guys to go with me , please ! Don 't even think about it . Let 's go . Yes ? You 're ... you 're goin ' ? Alexander , this is not ... I 'm not kidding here . This isn 't some kinda prank . I 'm not kidding . Guys , guys listen . Come on . Gwen , Gwen , Gwen . Stop , come here . You know me , I 'm a lot of things , but am I crazy ? You know , it 's one thing to treat us this way . It 's another thing to do it to your fans . She 's not a fan ! This is ... This is a Termite ! You should 've just let me hit him . Boy , I didn 't know you could get that loaded . I think we should 've just taken the gig . Who knows the next time he 'll ask us ? Fred , he was drunk . Do you really think he was talking about a job ? Did Jason come through here ? Yeah , he ... he 's in there . Hey , guys . Ah . We are coming , too . - All of you wish to go to the ship ? - Yes , we wish to go to the ship . You see , we work together , or not at all . Wonderful . The Commander had me continue transmission in case you changed your mind . - Protector , requesting four interstellar ... - Oh ! Me , too . Five pods for immediate departure . ( Deep humming ) Guys . Guys ? I look forward to meeting you all in person when you arrive at the ship . End transmission . - ( Slurping ) - Oh , my God . - ( Zap ) - Anybody got any change ? Oh ! ( Distant shrieking ) ( Shrieking ) ( lnstruments whirring ) Our most sincere apologies . We forgot about our appearance generators . You guys came ! Who wants the grand tour ? - ( Screaming stops ) - Anybody else ? That was a hell of a thing . - What 's wrong with them ? - I don 't know . Come on . That 's right , just keep shaking it off . It gets better . - Hey , try some gum . It helps . - Where are we ? The 23rd quadrant of the gamma sector . There 's a map in the forward room . I 'll show you , come on . - Welcome , my friends ! - This is Mathesar , their leader . I am Mathesar . On behalf of all my people I wish to thank you from the deepest place in our hearts . Mathesar , this is , uh , my crew . Dr Lazarus . ( Crew whispering ) Dr Lazarus . Dr Lazarus . Lieutenant Madison . ( Whispering ) Lieutenant Madison . Young Laredo , how you 've grown . ( All ) Young Laredo . Tech Sergeant Chen . ( Crew whispering ) Tech Sergeant Chen . C-Crew man number si ... Guy . ( All ) Guy . You ... know us ? ( All chuckle ) I don 't believe there is a man , woman or child on my planet who does not . In the years since we first received transmission of your historical documents we have studied every facet of your missions and strategies . You 've been watching the show ? - Lieutenant , historical documents . - Historical documents from out here ? Yes . The past hundred years our society had fallen into disarray . Our goals and values had become scattered . But we have modelled every aspect of our society from your example , and it has saved us . Your courage and teamwork and friendship through adversity . In fact , all you see around you has been taken from the lessons garnered from the historical documents . Is this a ... a spaceship ? No , this is a starport for the ship . Would you guys like to see the ship ? ( Door whooshes ) ( Clunking and whirring ) ( Alexander ) Oh , my God ! It 's real . ( Mathesar ) The generator room . The beryllium sphere , of course . And as we continue ... The medical quarters are to the left . We went to some trouble duplicating your cellular regeneration system ... - Jason , what have you gotten us into ? - Wow , the floors are so clean . We 're just here to negotiate this guy Sarris ' surrender . No big deal . ... and the organ fabrication chamber is coming along nicely . No big deal ? Are you crazy ? We have to get out of here . - Oh , come on , guys . - Jason , we 're actors , not astronauts . You guys wanna go home ? Say the word we 'll go home - pay our bills , feed our fish , fall asleep in front of the TV and miss out on all of this . Come on , you guys wanna do that ? Anybody ? Gwen , come on , think about it . Look at where we are . We 're in space . Alexander , this is the role of a lifetime . You guys wanna leave ? ( Mathesar ) We have prepared many of your esoteric dishes . Your Monte Cristo sandwich is a current favourite here . The main barracks . ( Drum roll ) At ease . It 's like throwing gasoline on a flame . What ? I 'm just jazzed about being on the show , man . ( Mathesar ) If you would take your positions . ( Gwen ) Our what ? Guys . ( All ) Oh . Hmm . ( Tommy ) Look , this thingy . I remember ... I had it all worked out . This is forward . This is back . ( Humming ) Commander , some the crew has requested to be present at this historic event . Sure . Bring ' em in . ( Shrieks ) ( Chuckles ) No pressure , huh ? I 'm glad I ain 't the Commander . Laredo , take us out . - Excuse me ? - ( Chuckles ) They designed those controls after watching you . - Take her out . ( Clears throat ) - Right , right . OK . Right . Right . Take her out . ( Clunking and humming ) ( Engines rumble ) ( Beeps ) ( Engine hum rises ) OK . Move more to the right . Would you sit your ass down ? Move ! You wanna drive ? ( Metal scraping ) ( Chuckles nervously ) ( Metal scraping ) ( Scraping stops ) ( Cheering ) ( Jason ) Oh . Mmm . How are you enjoying your steak , Commander ? I 'm really enjoying it . This is like corn-fed Iowa beef . Yes , we programmed the food synthesiser for each of you based on the regional menu of your birthplace . ( Jason ) I don 't care , it tastes great . Are you enjoying your Kep-mok bloodticks , Dr Lazarus ? Just like Mother used to make . ( Alexander ) So , um ... tell me , Mathesar , this Sarris person we 're flying to meet . What does he want ? - ( Gagging ) He heard about the device ... the Omega 13 . Um , what is it ? What does it do ? We don 't know . We were hoping you could enlighten us . ( Nervous chuckle ) Oh . The Omega 13 device . We found that on an alien planet . We don 't know what it does either . Well , why don 't you just turn it on and see what it does ? - ( Shrieks ) - ( Laughs ) It has at its heart a reactor capable of unthinkable energy . If we were mistaken in our construction , the device would act as a molecular explosive causing a chain reaction that would obliterate all matter in the universe . Has Sarris seen any of the ... historical records ? No , thank God , he has not . Oh . So how does he know about the Omega 13 device ? Our former commander was not ... strong . Former commander ? I am sorry . You deserve to be shown . The tape was smuggled off of Sarris ' ship . Originally , one of our own tried to lead . ( Sarris ) ' ls that all ? 'After three days of this , you still require ... incentive ? ' - ( Shrieking ) - ( Electricity buzzing ) ( Thermian ) ' I have told you all I know . If you have any mercy in you , please , let me die . ' ( Sarris ) ' When I grow weary of the noises you make you shall ... die . ' ( Electricity crackles ) Hey guys , come on . Hold on a minute . You just can 't leave . Give me some time to think . Think . He wants to think ! No Jason , that 's a wrap . There 's nothing to think about ! I 'm not even supposed to be here . I 'm just Crewman # 6 , I 'm expendable . I 'm the guy in the episode who dies to prove that the situation is serious . I 've gotta get out of here . Commander ? We 've gotta prepare the pods for my crew 's departure . Begging your Commander 's pardon , sir , but we cannot launch pods at the moment . Sarris will surely detonate any objects leaving the ship . - Sarris ? - Yes , sir . He 's here now . Your presence is required on the command deck . There 's nobody here . While my people are talented scientists , our attempts to operate own technologies under tactical simulation have been disastrous . I have raised Sarris on zeta frequency . - Mathesar ... - ' We meet again , Commander . ' Hello , Sarris . How you doin ' ? 'Better than my lieutenant . 'He failed to activate the ship 's neutron armour 'as quickly as I 'd hoped on our last encounter . ' Yeah well , you know , I 'd like to say I 'm real sorry about what happened before . The whole thing was just a ... just a misunderstanding . 'Deliver the device to me , or I will destroy your ship ! ' You know , um , we 'd like do that , but frankly , Sarris , sir , we don 't know what it is or even where it is . 'You have 10 seconds ! ' ( Jason ) I don 't ... 10 seconds ? You know ... OK . Gosh darn it , I give up . It 's yours . Give me a minute to put it in a box for you , OK ? Gwen . ( Clicks tongue ) Don 't panic . I 've dealt with this guy before . He 's as stupid as he is ugly . Come here ! - Jason . - Not now , Gwen . Sit , sit , sit , sit , sit . We 're gonna send everything we can at him , all right ? - Jason . - Not now , Gwen ! Push these red buttons and send everything we have towards him , OK ? - OK . - All right , Gwen , put me back on . Well , I 'm trying to tell you , you ARE back on . 'Perhaps I 'm not as stupid as I am ugly , Commander ! ' I gave you the ... " kill " gesture . No , you gave me the " we 're dead " signal . I was agreeing with you . ( Guy ) Hey , you guys . There 's a red , uh , thingy ... - movin ' towards the green thingy . - What ? Red thingy moving towards the green thingy ... I think ... I think we 're the green thingy . 'A little present for you , Commander . ' We 've gotta get out of here . Move the ship . Turn it . Move ! Let 's go ! ( Gwen screams ) ( Explosion ) ( Explosions and screaming ) - Tommy , get us out of here ! - What do I do ? ! Go , go , go ! ( All shout ) Whoo ! They 're turning . They 're coming ! Thrust ahead , full ! ( Sarris ) Fire at will . - ( Explosions ) - Go faster , Tommy ! - I 'm going as fast as I can , Jason ! - She 's still behind us ! I always say " Press the turbo , " right ? - It 's right here ! - Press it and hold it down ! ( Explosion ) - ( Engines roar ) - Whoo ! ( Computer ) ' The enemy is matching velocity . ' - The enemy is matching velocity ! - We heard the first time ! Gosh , I 'm doing it . I 'm repeating the computer . ( Deadpan ) ' Hi , guys . Listen , they 're tellin ' me ... 'the , uh ... the generators won 't take it . 'The ship is breakin ' apart and all that . Just FYI . ' - We 've gotta stop ! - We stop and we die . Tommy , hold on ! - Turbo 's only for quick boosts ! - Oh , like you know ! ( Engines sputter ) ( Alarm ) I remember that sound . That 's a bad sound . Wait , wait ! We might be able to lose them in ... in this cloud here . - Uh , I ... I don 't think that 's a cloud . - Mathesar , what is it ? This is the Tothian minefield , left standing from the war of 12185 . Oh , God ! Whoo ! ( Moaning and whimpering ) ( Explosion ) Could you possibly try NOT to hit every single one ? Sorry , man , they 're drifting toward us ... I think they 're magnetic ! ( Clunk ) Continue forward , sir ? Patience , Lieutenant . Patience . - We 've gotta stop ! - We 're almost through this . ( Engines splutters and dies ) - You OK ? You all right ? - Yeah . Everybody all right ? Where 's Tommy ? - ( Screaming ) Oh , man ! - Tommy ! You all right ? No , my arm is broke ... Don 't touch it ! Don 't touch it ! - I 'll take him to Medical quarters . - Thanks , Mathesar . ( Tommy screams ) Alex , where are you going ? To see if there 's a pub ! ( Computer ) ' Forward thruster shaft , 87 % damage . 'Aft vector guards , 96 % damage . 'Structural breaches in quadrants 32 , 34 , 40 ... ' - What about the engines ? - ' Forward thruster shaft , 87 % damage . ' Computer , what about the engines ? Why don 't we have power ? 'The beryllium sphere has fractured under stress . ' - It 's fractured . - Can it be repaired ? - Computer , can it be repaired ? - ' Damage to beryllium sphere irreparable . - ' New source of beryllium must be secured . ' - We need another one . You broke the ship . You broke the bloody ship ! Eh , ah ... Ahem . Computer , is there a replacement beryllium sphere on board ? Computer , is there a replacement beryllium sphere on board ? 'Negative . No reserve beryllium sphere exists on board . ' No , we have no extra beryllium sphere on board . You know , that is really getting annoying ! Look , I have one job on this lousy ship . It 's stupid , but I 'm gonna do it , OK ? Sure , no problem . A thousand apologies . We have failed you . ( Chuckles ) How have you failed us ? We have seen you victorious in much more desperate situations . The fault must lie with us , with the ship . No , it is not your fault , and it 's not the ship 's fault . It-it 's my fault . W-we screwed ... We are not the people you think we are . I don 't understand . Didn 't you make any TV shows on your planet ? Any theatre ? Films ? The historical documents of your culture . Yes , in fact , we have begun to document our history from your example . No , not historical documents . They 're not all historical documents . I mean , surely you don 't think that Gilligan 's Island is a ... - ( Moaning ) - Those poor people . ( Tommy ) Oh , brother . We 're screwed . Is there no one on your planet who behaves in a way ... that 's contrary to reality ? Ahh ! You are speaking of ... - Deception , lies . - Deception , lies . We have only recently become aware of this concept in our dealings with Sarris . Often , Sarris will say one thing and do another . Promise us mercy , but deliver destruction . It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost . But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris ... ( Laughs ) ( Laughs weakly ) ( lntercom beeps ) 'Hey , Commander , listen . We found some beryllium on a nearby planet . 'And we might be able to get there 'if we reconfigure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion . 'What do you think ? ' - We 'll do that ! - All right ! Th-that 's right again . That 's ... C-Come on , group hug . Come on . Dr Lazarus , I hope I am not breaching protocol , but I am so very humbled to stand in your presence . I have studied your missions extensively . Though I am Thermian , I have lived my life by your philosophy , by the code of the Mak 'tar . - Oh , good , that 's very nice . - By Grabthar 's hammer , Dr L ... - Don 't ! I 'm not kidding . - I 'm sorry , sir , I was only ... Just don 't . Yes , sir . Never give up , never surrender . Dr Lazarus ? Here is your surface mapper . I have programmed it to the co-ordinates of a beryllium sphere of sufficient density . Good luck on your mission , sir . Thanks . You 're doing good , Tommy . I changed my mind . I wanna go back . After the fuss you made about getting left behind ? Yeah , but that was when I thought I was the crewman that stays on the ship and something is up there and it kills me . But now I 'm thinking I 'm the guy who gets killed by some monster five minutes after we land on the planet . - You 're not gonna die on the planet , Guy . - I 'm not ? Then what 's my last name ? It 's , uhm , uh , uh ... I don 't know . Nobody knows ! Do you know why ? Because my character isn 't important enough for a last name . Because I 'm gonna die five minutes in . Guy , you have a last name . - Do I ? ! Do I ? ! - Yes ! For all you know , I 'm just crewman number six . Mommy ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Are we there yet ? ( Guy ) Mommy ! ( Jason ) Tommy ! ( Gwen ) Look out ! Oh , no ! ( Alexander ) Pull out ! ( Fred ) Oh , yeah ! Oh , boy ! Yeah ! ( Guy ) Hey , don 't open that ! It 's an alien planet ! Is there air ? You don 't know ! Seems OK . Here we go . ( Jason ) Which way , Alexander ? ( Beeping ) This way ! Wait . No . - That way . - You were holding it upside down . Shut up . You know , with all that makeup and stuff , I actually thought you were smart for a second . You could do better , Laredo ? ( Tommy ) Stop that Laredo stuff . ( Guy ) Oh , we 're screwed . We 're so screwed . ( Jason ) Come on , come on , come on . If we wanna finish this mission , we have to use some self control . ( Gwen ) Self control ? That 's funny from a guy who slept with every Terrakian slave girl AND moon princess on the show . ( Jason ) Ever occured to you , had you been more supportive ... ( Alexander ) Wow . Must be some sort of mining facility . Where are the miners ? Something bad happened here . Will you relax ? There they are . Beryllium spheres . Let 's go . ( Gasps ) ( Alien chattering ) Look at that . Would you look at that ? They look like little children . Could they be the miners ? Sure , they 're like , three years old . Miners , not minors ! - You lost me . - I don 't like this . - I don 't like this at all . - They are so cute . Sure , they 're cute now , but in a second , they 're gonna get mean . And they 're gonna get ugly somehow , and then there 's gonna be a million more of ' em . ( Gasping ) Look . There 's a little hurt one . ( Whimpers ) Aw . ( Whimpering continues ) Hi . Hi there . - Ah ! - Shh ! Did you guys ever WATCH the show ? See ? They 're gonna help the little hurt one . ( Whispering ) I 'm so sick of being right . Let 's get out of here before one of those things kills Guy . Wait a minute . We 're not going anywhere without a beryllium sphere . We need a plan . Fred , I need a diversion to clear the compound of those things . Then , Alex , Gwen and I will go get that sphere . Tommy , go up on that ridge and if you see them come back give a signal , all right ? - Why is this so familiar ? - " Assault on Voltareck III " , episode 81 . - We 're doing episode 81 ? - What ever , the one with the hologram . Well , how the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram ? - Are we doing episode 81 now ? - It 's just a rough plan , Guy . What difference does it make if it 's episode 81 or not ? Cos I died in episode 81 ! - Shh ! Episode 51 , right ? - This is ludicrous . Why are you listening to this fellow ? May I remind you , he 's wearing a costume , not a uniform . He 's no more equipped to lead us than this fellow . No offence . Look , they 're gone . - Where 'd they go , back inside ? - I don 't know . Nobody was watching ? ! All right , all right . Listen up , here 's the plan . Gwen , Fred , Alex and I will go and get a sphere . Fleegman , you set up a perimeter and Tommy , you 're lookout . - You see anything , give us a signal . - What kind of a signal ? - Any kind of signal . - OK , I 'll do my hands like this . Coo ! Coo ! What are you , an infant ? ! Look , we have these . That ... Sorry . Let 's go . ( Grunting ) - Does the rolling help ? - Uh-huh , it helps . - Where 's your gun ? - It helps . - Oh . - What ? Ha ha , never give up , never surrender . ( Others ) Oh , shut up . Caw , caw ! Jason ! They 're coming ! There 's thousands of ' em , Jason ! Run , Jason ! Run ! Run ! They 're everywhere , they 're everywhere ! Everywhere ! Come on , let 's go ! - ( All shouting ) - Hurry ! ( Guy ) They 're everywhere ! Come on ! ( Jason ) Don 't look back . Do not look back ! ( Guy ) We 're not gonna make it ! ( Guy ) I knew it , I knew it ! I knew this was gonna kill me ! ( Jason ) Come on ! Push ! Let 's go , Tommy ! It 's gonna take a few seconds . I got it , I got it ! - Go ahead . - There 's no time . Get in ! You 've got to be the hero , haven 't you ? Heaven forbid anybody else gets the spotlight ! Jason ! Jason , come on ! ( Gwen ) Hurry ! ( Jason ) Tommy , go ! Go ! I 'm in ! No , no , no , no ! Jason , please ! - Tommy , stop the pod . Stop it ! - But I can 't stop it , it 's on autopilot ! ( Guy ) Go , leave him ! ( Gwen ) No ! ( Screeching ) Oh , right ! Of course , it 's always about you , isn 't it ? ( Snorting ) Ugh ! Oh ! Oh ! Ugh ! - ( Growls ) - Oh ... ( Aliens chanting ) Gorignak ! Gorignak ! Gorignak ! Gorignak ! Jason ? Jason , can you hear me ? 'Yeah , Gwen , you got me . ' - Thank God . Are you OK ? - ' Yeah . ' Gorignak 's staring me in the face right now . 'But you know what ? I think I can take him . ' ( All ) Oh . Jason , we 're gonna use the digital conveyor to get you out of there . - The digital conveyor ? - ' Yes . ' You mean I 'm gonna be diced into cubes and sent up there in a million pieces ? - Right . - ' Well , you know what ? 'I think I 'll take my chances with Gorignak . ' ( Gwen ) ' We 're getting you out right now . It 's perfectly safe , isn 't it , Teb ? ' It has never been successfully tested . - ' What did he say ? ' - Hold , please . Theoretically , the mechanism is fully operational . However , it was built to accomodate your , hm ... anatomy , not ours . But now that Tech Sergeant Chen is here , he can operate it . It was designed watching his motions from the historical documents . I-I-I mean , I can 't . I-I can supervise ... Listen , we 're gonna test it . - On what ? - How about that pig lizard ? - ' I 'm doing OK with the pig lizard . ' - Please , Fred ? And hurry . ( Nervous laugh ) I 'm sorry . It 's very exciting to watch the master at the controls . The conveyor is much more ... hm ... art than science . Stand back , Jason . ( Aliens chanting ) Gorignak , Gorignak , Gorignak ... ( Growls ) ( Zap ) Oh ! ( Screams and groans ) - ' What was that ? ' - Uh ... - Nothing . - ' I heard squealing . ' - Everything 's fine . - But the animal is inside out . I heard that . It turned inside out ? And it exploded . Did I just hear that the animal turned inside out and then it exploded ? 'Hello ? ' Hold , please . 'Hey , wait a minute , guys ... ' The pig lizard is gone . Why are they still yelling " Gorignak " ? Teb , hit the translation circuit . ( Aliens chanting ) 'Gorignak ... Rock . ' Rock , rock , rock , rock ! ( All ) Oh ! Jason , I don 't think the pig lizard was Gorignak . What the hell you talkin ' about ? Oh , darn . ( Sighs ) Oh . 'Digitise me ! ' - Come on , Fred . - ' Come on guys , digitise me ! ' - Not me . - They based it on your hand movements . Am I the only one who saw that thing inside out ? I 'm not Tech Sergeant Chen . Kwan 's not even my real name . Jason , you 'll have to kill it . Kill it ? Well , I 'm open to any suggestions . Go for the eyes , like episode 22 ! It doesn 't have any eyes , Tommy . Go for its mouth , its throat , its vulnerable spots ! It 's a rock . It doesn 't have any vulnerable spots ! I know ! You construct a weapon . Look around you . - Can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe ? - A lathe ? ! Get off the line ! Alexander , you 're my advisor . Advise me ! Well , just figure out what it wants . What is its motivation ? It 's a rock monster . It doesn 't have motivation . See ? There 's your problem , Jason . You were never serious about the craft . Oh ! Fred , can you hear me ? ! Fred , are you there ? ( Screams ) - Kinda . - ' You can do it , Fred . It 's up to you ! ' Oh , no , no , no . Jason , I 'll just ... I 'll just mess it up . - You did it for years on the show , do it now ! - That was the show . I 'm not that guy . Fred , you never forgot a line . You never missed a mark ! Oh ! That 's not me any more , man . It is you , Fred . You just stopped trying . You can do this , Fred . I know in my heart , you 're gonna save my life . - I am ? - ' No doubt about it , Fred . 'Fred ! 'Fred , can you hear me ? ' 'Fred ! ' Fred ? I don 't wanna die down here . Digitise me , Fred ! ( Zap ) Oh , wow . - Tech Sergeant Chen . - Yeah ! ( Gwen and Jason kiss ) I see you managed to get your shirt off . - I did it . - Welcome back , Fred . All right . Did we get the beryllium sphere installed ? - Yes , we are back to full power . - Great . Engines and pods ? - Fully operational . - Perfect ! We 'll crank this sucker up . You can drop us off , and you guys can be back to your home planet before supper . Oh no , sir . We have no reason to go back . Sure you do . Family , friends , come on ... We are all that is left . - I didn 't know that . - Sir , I have raised the command deck . Mathesar , meet us up on the command deck . Mathesar . Mathesar ! Quellek ! Why can 't we reach them ? ( Footsteps ) ( Growls ) ( Mathesar ) Commander . Thank God , you 're alive . Now you will face justice , Sarris . At every turn , you demonstrate the necessity for your extermination ! Leave him alone . You wish to save the life of this man ? Yeah . Yes . Then tell me - what does it do , this Omega 13 ? I don 't know what it does . I said , I don 't know ! - Is it a bomb ? - I don 't know . - A booby trap ? - I don 't know ! - Tell me ! - I don 't know ! Do you think I 'm a fool ? ! That the Commander does not know every bolt , every weld in his ship ? ! ( Groans ) Prepare a tear harness ... for the female . ( Jason ) No ! Gwen , no ! You brute ! Let go of me ! - ( Groaning ) I 'm not the Commander . - What did you say ? I said , I 'm not the Commander . Leave them . There 's no reason to hurt them . - They don 't know anything . - Explain . Gwen , show him the historical documents . ( Sighs ) Computer , show the historical documents of the Galaxy Quest missions . ( Galaxy Quest theme ) ( Chuckles ) Wonderful . You have all done far greater damage than I ever could have . Bravo ! ( Laughs ) Bravo . This is a moment I will treasure . Explain to him ... who you all really are . Tell him ! Explain ! Mathesar , the ... There 's no such person as Captain Taggert . My name is Jason Nesmith . I am ... an actor . We 're all actors . He doesn 't understand . Explain , as you would a child . We , uh ... we pretended . We lied . ( Moans ) Yes ! You understand that , don 't you , Mathesar ? Mathesar , I ... I 'm not a commander . I ... There 's no National Space Exploration Administration . We don 't have any ship . But there it is . That ship is that big . But inside , I see many rooms . You 've seen plywood sets that look like the inside . Our beryllium sphere is-is wire with plaster around it . And our ... ( Chuckles ) Our digital conveyor is ... Christmas tree lights . It 's a decoration . It 's all fake . Just like me . ( Whispers ) But why ? It 's difficult to explain . On our planet , we ... we pretend to ... to entertain and ... Mathesar , I am so sorry . God , I am so sorry . ( Gagging ) ( Sarris ) So now you know . Lieutenant Lathe , hardwire the reactor core to overload . I would like to blow this troublesome vehicle to dust . Sarris , what about my people ? Yes , far too simple a death for them , isn 't it ? Lathe , open an oxygen seal on level C. Let the air in a bit for our friends . Son of a ... Uh ! Release them ... into space . ( Computer ) ' Core overload . Emergency shutdown overridden . 'Core implosion estimated in nine minutes . 'Core overload . Emergency shutdown overridden . ' Hey ! ( Alexander ) Where 's the happy ending , Jason ? " Never give up , never surrender . " Maybe it 's about time you just backed off , you fin-headed monstrosity . ( Gwen ) Jason ? You what ? You 're starting to act like you did in episode 17 , you scene-stealing hack . Oh , right ! Well , how does it feel , Jason ? Was it worth it ? You 've murdered us all ! - Shut up . - Hundreds to die because of you ! - Shut up ! - ( Sarris ) Get in there . Just because you wanna play at being commander , you lunatic . Then I 'll see you in hell . Look out , Jason ! Get his gun ! Get the gun ! ( Guy ) Take that ! ( Screaming ) Sorry , I was ... The door 's a little sticky . I 'll get someone up here with a can of WD-30 . ( All laugh ) - You used to pull your punches . - You scene-stealing hack ? Thank you . - Raving egomaniac ? - Can 't think of where I got that from . Hey , guys ... Look . ( Gwen ) They 're suffocating . ( Computer ) ' Core overload . Emergency shutdown overridden . 'Core implosion estimated in eight minutes . ' General , your transport is ready for departure ! ( Computer ) ' Core overload . Emergency shutdown overridden . 'Core implosion estimated in seven minutes . ' - Computer , shut down the core . - ' Unable . ' 'Memory checksum invalid . Core system 's hardware damaged . ' All right , all right . Listen up , this is what we gotta do . Gwen , you and I , we 're gonna to get to the core and shut it down manually . Fred , take Guy and Laliari . You find that valve . Shut it off before those Thermians run out of air . Alexander , get to the barracks . See if you can wedge a door open in case they can 't do that . Wait , Jason , what about me ? What do I do ? You 're gonna practise driving . Let 's go ! Practise driving . ( Gwen ) So we get to shut down a neutron reactor ? Well , I hate to break it to you , Jason , but I don 't know how to shut down a neutron reactor , and unless you took a learning annex course I don 't know about , I 'm pretty sure you don 't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either . No , I don 't , but I know someone who does . Brandon , honey , the garbage . Oh , Mother , I 'm quite busy . ( Mother ) Come on Brandon , don 't make me ask again . Just 10 more minutes , OK , Ma ? I promise . ( Beep ) ( Beep ) ( Jason ) ' Hello ? Anybody there ? 'Hello ? ' Hello ? Got him . Listen to me . This is Jason Nesmith . 'I play Commander Peter Quincy Taggert , NSEA Protector . ' We accidentally traded boxes the other day . Oh ? Oh . Commander , I see . OK . 'What 's your name , son ? ' Brandon . I remember you from the convention , right ? You asked all those technical questions about the ship and I was a little short with you . Yes , yes , I know , Commander , and I actually wanna ... I just wanted to tell you that I ... I thought alot about what you said ... - It 's OK . Now , listen . - But I want you to know ... I 'm not a complete brain case , OK ? I understand completely that it 's just a TV show . - H-Hold ... Wait . Stop . Wait . - ( Brandon continues ) It 's all real . Oh , my God , I knew it . I knew it ! I knew it ! The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help . ( Computer ) ' Core overload . Emergency shutdown overridden . 'Core implosion estimated in six minutes . - ( Shriek ) - ( Screams ) Sir , it 's you . Thank lpthar . Quellek ? What are you doing up there ? I avoided capture by using your Mak 'tar stealth face . - Where is everyone ? - Come with me . I 'll explain on the way . All right , we 're at level C , hallway five . Now what ? Um , go to weapons storage , your second left , through the passage . That leads to a system of utility corridors through the bowels of the ship . - Open . - ' You know , I 'm gonna get Kyle . ' He knows the utility tunnels system better than anyone else alive . ... 38 , 39 , 40 . All we have to do is turn off the valve to the barracks . - ' Hi , Brandon . ' - No time for pleasantries , Kyle . We have a level five emergency . You 've still got the utility system walk-through , right ? Yeah , I 've got sectors one to 28 . Hollister has the other levels . 'Get everybody online . ' - ' Pedal to the metal , Commander . ' - Pedal to the metal , Commander . General ! I have just received word that the commander of the Protector and his command crew have escaped custody . - What ? - ( Splat ) - Find them ! - But sir ! My men ... The core implosion is ... FIND THEM ! All right , Brandon , I see five ducts in this room . Which way do we go ? Enter the passage second to your left , and just continue straight for 50 metres . Ducts ? Why is it always ducts ? ( Brandon ) ' Uhm , there will be a slight drop . ' Whoa ! Uh ! Thanks for the heads-up , Brandon ! You OK ? ( Quellek ) They 're dying . Wait a moment , we 've gotta go across this thing ? Yes . Don 't look down . 'Commander , what I 'd give to see what you 're seeing . ' - What ? - You 're deep in the Omega 13 ! 'Oh , it must be spectacular . ' It doesn 't look like much to me . There 's just these few walls and this dumb spinning fan that 's in every single ... ( Jason ) Brandon , what does the Omega 13 device do ? 'Uhm , many have believed that it is a matter-collapser . 'A bomb capable of destroying pretty much everything in about 13 seconds . 'But myself and others are convinced that what it is , is a matter rearranger , 'affecting a 13-second time jump to the past . ' Why 13 seconds ? That 's really not enough time to do anything of importance . - It 'd be time to redeem a single mistake . - What ? We 've gotta turn off that valve . Their oxygen 's almost gone . Listen , I 'll go in . I 'll create a distraction . I 've got this . I 'm OK . I might be able to hold ' em back long enough for the aliens to escape . - That 's suicide . - I 'm just a glorified extra , Fred . I 'm a dead man anyway . If I 'm gonna die , I 'd rather die a hero than a coward . Guy , Guy , maybe you 're the plucky comic relief . You ever think about that ? Plucky ? Oh , besides , I just had this really interesting idea . Are you stoned ? Gotta get them open and give them some time . Sir , perhaps together ... the Mak 'tar chant of strength , Larak tarath . - Larak tarath , larak tarath . - Larak tarath . ( Both ) Larak tarath , larak tarath , larak tarath ! ( Air hisses ) All right , Brandon , we 're across . Now what ? You wanna take a left and then just straight on through the chompers . " The chompers " ? - Well , screw that . - How are we supposed to get through this ? ! - Hollister , do you have the sequence yet ? - OK , the sequence is ... two-two-four-two ... What is this thing ? I mean , it serves no useful purpose for there to be a bunch of chompy , crushy things in the middle of a hallway ! You know , I think we shouldn 't have to do this . It makes no logical sense . Why is it here ? ! - Cos it 's on the television show ! - Well , forget it ! I am not doing it ! This episode was badly written ! OK , Commander . Now , as soon as the first crusher hits you ... It just did . - OK , go now . - Go ! ( Brandon ) ' Go ! 'Stop ! 'Go-o ! ' Come on , come on , come on . 'Go ! 'Go ! 'Go ! 'Go ! No , stop ! Stop ! 'Go ! - ' Stop ! ' - ( Gwen screams ) 'Jump , Commander , jump ! ' Whoever wrote this episode should DIE ! This should be interesting . ( Beeping ) ( Zap ) ( Rumbling ) ( Screaming ) It 's the simple things you treasure . That 's great . Now ... we better get ... Hey , get a room , guys . Whoa ! ( Guy ) Hey , Fred ... Hey , Fred , uh ... Oh , that 's not right . Oh ! Sir , the pressure - it 's normalising . All right ! We are saved . He has saved us . Commander Taggert has saved us ! ( Cheering ) It 's just not fair . All right , Quellek , let 's get back to the Commander . ( Laser blast ) I 'm ... I 'm shot . ( Thermian groaning ) Quellek ? It 's not too bad . We 'll get you to the medical quarters and you 'll be fine . It has been my greatest honour to serve with you . I have been blessed , sir . I ... I ... Don 't speak , Quellek . You 'll forgive my impertinence , sir , but even though we had never before met , I always considered you as a father to me . Quellek ... By Grabthar 's hammer , by the sons of Warvan , you shall be ... avenged . ... 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ! All right , Brandon , hear . How do I shut this thing down ? 'OK , just push the blue button - The blue button , is that it ? - Yeah , why , what 's wrong ? Nothing , I just thought it 'd be more complicated than that . ( Computer ) ' Core implosion estimated in 20 seconds . ' Brandon , it 's not working . Brandon ! Mother , I cannot stress enough the severity - of the Commander 's predicament . - And the recyclables ! ( Computer ) ' Core implosion estimated in 10 seconds . - ' Nine , eight , ' - Gwen , I ... - ' seven , six , ' - I always ... - ' five , four , ' - Jason , oh , Jason . 'Three , two , one . ' ( Silence ) Oh , it always stops at one on the show . - ( Laughs ) - What were you saying ? - Sir ! - What ? The core detonation sequence on the Protector has been aborted . Impossible ! Impossible ! Lock a complement of implosion missiles onto the Protector . Tear her apart ! ( Lasers firing ) Whoa , whoa , whoa ! He 's finished . He 's finished . Alexander , listen to me . It 's OK , it 's OK . The Thermians can handle it from here . ( Screaming ) All right , we need that armour back up ! - Get me a forward view right now ! - Plasma armour engaged . All right , Tommy , see if you can lose ' em in that minefield . - Minefield ? - Pedal to the metal , right now ! - Pedal to the metal ! - All right , let 's go ! Good going , Tommy . Great going . Thrust ahead ... full ! Into the field ! Go ! ( Jason ) Tommy , can you get us closer to these mines ? Closer ? I could try . General , I 've lost them . The magnetism of the minefield is disrupting our instruments . Wait ! I see something . Yes . Yes ! There they are . - Get back on their tail . - I can 't , sir . - What ? Why not ? - Because they 're coming right at us . Fire at will . Whoo ! We 're getting hammered , Jason ! Return fire ? No ! Divert all energy to the armour ! 'How adorable ! 'The actors are going to play war with me . ' Sarris ' ship is accelerating toward us at mark two . Accelerate to mark four . Let me remind you , sonny , I am a general . If you are counting on me to blink , then you are making a deadly mistake . Well let me tell you something , Sarris . It doesn 't take a great actor to recognise a bad one . You 're sweating ! Armour almost gone , Jason ! You fool ! You failed to realise that with your armour gone , my ship will tear through yours like tissue paper . And what you fail to realise is my ship is dragging mines . Oh , no ! Turn , turn ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! ( Laughing ) Yes ! Yes ! ( Cheering ) Mathesar ! Oh , my God , you 're alive . Come here . The ship was a model as big as this . A very clever deception indeed . ( Laughing ) Set a course for home , commander ? - Can you do that ? - Oh , yes ! Just point and click . Well , we 're gonna have to go through a black hole then . Any objections ? ( Jason ) All right , set her up . What 's the matter , Mathesar ? We were hoping you could come with us . M-my people have no commander . Mathesar , I think your people ... have a great commander . Sir . ( Whimpers ) All right , Tommy , take us into the black hole . - We 're out ! - We 're going home ! ( Computer ) ' Systems register functional . ' All systems are working , Commander . Jason , before the black hole , there was an energy surge from Sarris ' ship . Let 's not worry about that right now , Alexander ... Fred , what 're you doing up here ? Shouldn 't you be downstairs ? Hey , you could put an eye out with that . Fred ? Agh ! No ! ( Laser blast ) Mathesar ! Activate the Omega 13 ! ( High-pitched buzzing ) - We 're out ! - We 're going home ! ( Computer ) ' Systems register functional . ' All systems are working , Commander . Jason , before the black hole , there was an energy surge from Sarris ' ship . ( Gwen ) Jason , what are you doing ? What are you doing ? Let go of me . Let ... It 's not Fred ! That 's Sarris . Listen , I 'm telling you , that 's Sarris ! He 's gonna kill all of us ! ( Roaring ) Never give up , never surrender . Jason ! Jason ! I can 't slow it down ! Our ship is too big to enter the atmosphere . We need to separate , or we 'll die . We gotta do it . It 's our only hope , Mathesar . - Thank you . - Crew to the secondary deck . Mathesar ! Goodbye , my friends . Fred , get up to command deck . We 're separating . On , Teb , on ! ( TV ) ' The third day of the GalaxyCon , 'and Jason Nesmith and his entire crew are no-shows here at the big event , 'much to the disappointment of all these fans , known as Questoids ... ' Bye . Be back soon ! Whoa , hey , Brandon , where are you going with all those fireworks ? Well , the Protector got super accelerated coming out of the black hole and it site , nailed the atmosphere at mark 15 , which , you guys know , is pretty unstable , obviously , so we 're gonna help Laredo guide it on the VOX ultra-frequency carrier and use Roman Candles for visual confirmation . Ah , all ... All right , dinner 's at seven . - Well , he 's outside . - Hmm . ( Screaming ) ( Door hisses and clunks ) ( Coughing ) ( Coughs ) ( Cheering ) Lieutenant Laredo ... Tommy Webber !

Wow ! - ( Screaming ) - Come on ! They 're here for you folks . Come on ! What a show ! What a show ! Yes ! Yes ! Give it up ! Wow ! Come on , give it up !

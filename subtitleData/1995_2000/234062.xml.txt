[ Gunfire Stops ] [ Whimpers ] MULDER ? ANSWER ME ! [ Grunts ] DAMN IT . - I WANNA KNOW WHAT 'S ON THAT TRAIN . - IT DOESN 'T MATTER NOW . OUR GOVERNMENT IS OPERATING A SECRET RAILROAD . THEY PUT SOMETHING ON THAT TRAIN IN WEST VIRGINIA- - SOMETHING LIVING . - WHAT MORE IS THERE TO KNOW ? - WHAT THE JAPANESE HAVE TO DO WITH IT . HOW A MAN NAMED ISHIMARU IS INVOLVED . - THAT , I DON 'T KNOW . - DON 'T TELL ME YOU DON 'T KNOW , YOU SMUG SON OF A- - THEREARELIMITS ... TO MY KNOWLEDGE . - I DON 'T HAVE TIME FOR YOUR CONVENIENT IGNORANCE . - WHAT WERE YOU GONNA DO ? SHOOT ME , JUST LIKE THE MEN THAT SHOT YOUR SISTER ? YOU KNOW THEM TOO ? YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT 'S ON THAT TRAIN , WHO KILLED YOUR SISTER ? YOU FIND OUT WHAT THEY PUT IN YOUR NECK . THE IMPLANT . IT HOLDS MORE THAN I COULD EVER TELL YOU . MAYBE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW . [ Door Shuts ] EXCUSE ME , SIR . I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE . I 'M A FEDERAL AGENT . MY NAME IS MULDER . YOU NEED MY ASSISTANCE ? I NEED ACCESS TO THAT QUARANTINE CAR YOU PICKED UP IN WEST VIRGINIA . [ Sighs ] SORRY . CAN 'T HELP YOU . I 'M A FEDERAL AGENT , SIR . OPEN THAT CAR . I WOULD IF I COULD , BUT I DON 'T HAVE ACCESS MYSELF . WE PICK THESE CARS UP . WHATEVER THEY 'RE CARRYING , THEY NEVER LET US KNOW . SOMEBODY 'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET IN THAT CAR . WE 'VE GOT A DOCTOR ON BOARD . CAME ON BACK AT QUEEN 'S GATE . HE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT . I SAW HIM CHECKING THE DOOR . WHAT 'S HIS NAME ? JAPANESE FELLA . DR. SHIRO ZAMA . TRAVELING WITH ANOTHER PARTY , IT SAYS , BUT I GOT THE IMPRESSION , HE WAS ALONE . CAN YOU TAKE ME TO HIS COMPARTMENT ? CERTAINLY . RIGHT THIS WAY . STAY HERE . KNOCK ON THE DOOR , BUT STAY AWAY FROM IT . DR. ZAMA ? KNOCK AGAIN . IT 'S THE CONDUCTOR , DR. ZAMA . OPEN IT . JUST UNLOCK IT , THEN STEP AWAY . WHY DID I STUDY FRENCH IN HIGH SCHOOL ? YOU GOT A SAFE PLACE YOU CAN PUT THIS ? YES . WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL THE DOCTOR WHEN HE ASKS WHERE IT IS ? IF HE FINDS YOU BEFORE I FIND HIM , I WANT YOU TO MAKE HIM LIE ON THE GROUND TILL I GET BACK . HAVE YOU EVER USED A GUN BEFORE ? NO . [ Clip Clicks ] I JUST WANT YOU TO POINT IT AT HIM . DON 'T PULL THE TRIGGER . THAT 'LL GIVE AWAY THE GAME . [ Chuckles ] WHAT IF HE RUNS ? JUST MAKE SURE HE RUNS MY WAY . [ Man ] I 'M FEEDING THE CHIP IMPULSES . THE GRAPH IS RECORDING ITS OUTPUT , WHICH , WHEN I REMOVE THE CURRENT , CHANGES SLIGHTLY , BUT CONTINUES . THIS MEANS THE NEURAL NETWORK IS STORING INFORMATION . BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION ? THAT WAS MY FIRST GUESS . THE CHIP WAS PLACED SUBCUTANEOUS TO THE BACK OF THE NECK , RIGHT ? SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT IT WOULD BE RECORDING IMPULSES ... TRAVELING TO AND FROM THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM . BUT WHAT ? BUT LOOK AT THE GRAPH . THOSE ARE WHAT WE CALL " REVERBERATORY LOOPS . " THEY INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF CIRCULAR NEURONAL ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN . MEMORY FORMATION . YEAH . THE CHIP SEEMS TO BE MIMICKING THAT PROCESS- - REPLICATING THE MEMORY FUNCTION IN THE BRAIN . LIKE A COMPUTER HARD DRIVE . YEAH , BUT NO HARD DRIVE WE 'VE EVER SEEN . THIS KIND OF NEURAL NETWORK COULD BE NOT ONLY COLLECTING INFORMATION , BUT ARTIFICIALLY REPLICATING A PERSON 'S MENTAL PROCESSES . YOU COULD KNOW A PERSON 'S EVERY THOUGHT . FRIGHTENING . ANYWAY , I SHOWED THE CHIP TO SOME OF MY TECH-HEADS , AND THEY WEREN 'T AS BLOWN AWAY AS I THOUGHT THEY 'D BE . THEY 'VE SEEN THIS TECHNOLOGY BEFORE ? THEY 'VE SEEN NEURAL NETS BEFORE , BUT NEVER AS COMPLEX AS THAT , NOR ARE THEY LIKELY TO ANY TIME SOON . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? THE CHIP 'S SO DELICATE , I EFFECTIVELY DESTROYED IT WHEN I BEGAN WORKING ON IT , BUT I FOUND SOMETHING IN THE SILICON MATRIX , WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE NAME OF THE MANUFACTURER . - IT 'S JAPANESE , ISN 'T IT ? - HOW 'D YOU KNOW ? OH , IT WAS JUST A GUESS . WELL , I CHECKED FOR YOU . I ASSUMED YOU 'D WANT ME TO . THERE 'S NO RECORD OR INFORMATION ON THE MANUFACTURER , EITHER HERE OR IN JAPAN , EXCEPT FOR THIS . WE HAD FED EX , U.P.S. , THE POSTAL SERVICE , EVERY COMMERCIAL COURIER ... GO THROUGH THEIR COMPUTER RECORDS . THEY TURNED UP ONE SHIPMENT SENT TO A DR. SHIRO ZAMA ... AT A RESEARCH FACILITY OUT IN PERKEY , WEST VIRGINIA . WELL DONE , AGENT PENDRELL . KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK . HEY . THANKS . KEEP IT UP YOURSELF . " KEEP IT UP YOURSELF " ? WHAT A DOOF . [ Chattering ] [ Gasps ] PLEASE . [ Thudding ] - [ Clatter ] - [ Scully ] HEY ! STOP ! [ Thump ] [ Creaks ] [ Clack ] [ Whimpering ] PLEASE . DON 'T . DON 'T HURT US . PLEASE . [ Man ] DON 'T . [ Chattering ] EXCUSE ME . [ Screams ] OH , GOD ! HE 'S DEAD . NO . NO . SHH , SHH , SHH . HE 'S JUST GOT A LITTLE MOTION SICKNESS . I 'M GONNA GO FIND A DOCTOR . WHY DON 'T YOU AND THE YOUNG MAN JUST FIND ANOTHER BATHROOM , HMM ? COME ON , TIMMY . LET 'S JUST GO . WHO ARE YOU ? DON 'T WORRY . I 'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU . I 'M AN F.B.I. AGENT . WE- - WE LIVE HERE . WE 'VE LIVED HERE AT THE FACILITY MOST OF OUR LIVES . WHAT KIND OF FACILITY ? THE HANSEN 'S DISEASE RESEARCH FACILITY . HANSEN 'S- - DO YOU MEAN THIS IS A LEPER COLONY ? NO MORE . THE FACILITY 'S CLOSED NOW . L-LOOK , I-I CAME HERE LOOKING FOR A DR. SHIRO ZAMA . DR. ZAMA ISN 'T HERE ANYMORE . NONE OF THE MEDICAL STAFF IS . WHERE DID THEY GO ? WELL , THEY ALL LEFT ... RIGHT BEFORE THE DEATH SQUADS STARTED COMING . WHAT DEATH SQUADS ? THAT 'S- - THAT 'S WHO WE 'VE BEEN HIDING FROM . WE THOUGHT YOU 'D COME TO KILL US LIKE THEY KILLED ALL THE OTHERS . [ Scully ] HOW MANY HAVE BEEN KILLED ? [ Man ] HUNDREDS . ALL BUT US . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND HOW THERE COULD HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HERE ... WHEN- - WHEN LEPROSY IS SUPPOSED TO BE A TREATABLE DISEASE . WELL , IT IS . ME AND- - AND- - AND THE OTHER PEOPLE BACK AT THE HIDING PLACE , WE 'RE THE LAST . OUR DISFIGUREMENT FORCED US INTO THE CAMPS BEFORE THERE WAS A TREATMENT . WHO WERE THE OTHERS ? WE NEVER KNEW . THEY BEGAN ARRIVING SEVERAL YEARS AGO , BUT THEY WERE KEPT APART FROM US . AND THEY HAD HANSEN 'S DISEASE ? NO , NO . THEY HAD THE HANSEN 'S DEFORMITIES . DR. ZAMA WOULD ROUND THEM UP IN GROUPS FOR TREATMENT . THEN THE ONES THAT RETURNED ALWAYS CAME BACK WORSE- - WITH TERRIBLE BURNS ALL OVER THEIR BODIES . [ Panting ] IT 'S OVER THERE . [ Gasps ] OH , MY GOD . [ Man ] THERE ARE MORE OF THESE PITS . THEY JUST DUMP THE BODIES ON TOP OF EACH OTHER ... LIKE THEY WERE GARBAGE . [ Helicopter Approaching ] THEY 'RE COMING . [ Scully ] WAIT ! HEY ! NO . MOVE AND YOU 'RE DEAD . [ Gunshots ] [ Chattering ] [ Door Shuts ] I FOUND ZAMA FOUR CARS UP STRANGLED IN THE BATHROOM . NO . I WANT YOU TO GET UP THERE AND SEAL OFF THAT BATHROOM . GET WORD TO THE ENGINEER NOT TO STOP THIS TRAIN UNTIL I TELL HIM . OKAY ? TILL I FIND THE KILLER . [ Grunting ] [ Gasping ] [ Man ] HEY ! I 'M A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER . - STAY BACK . - JUST PUT THAT GUN DOWN . I 'M GONNA SHOW YOU MY IDENTIFICATION . PUT THE GUN DOWN . - [ Door Whirrs , Hisses ] - [ Man Pounds On Door ] - YOU IDIOT ! - [ Pounds On Door ] [ Mulder ] PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR AND TURN AROUND ! PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR ! YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU 'RE DEALING WITH HERE . MAYBE YOU SHOULD 'VE FILLED ME IN BEFORE YOU TRIED TO KILL ME . NOW , WHO ARE YOU ? NO . WHO ARE YOU ? ANSWER ME ! I WORK FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY . THE N.S.A. ? SINCE WHEN DID THEY START ISSUING YOU GUYS PIANO WIRE ... INSTEAD OF GUNS ? SINCE WE LEARNED ... THERE 'S A BOMB ON THIS TRAIN . THERE 'S SOMETHING ON THIS TRAIN , BUT IT 'S NOT A BOMB . THROW THAT HERE . THIS CAR IS WIRED TO AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE . IT ARMED AUTOMATICALLY WHEN I ENTERED THE CAR . WHY ? BECAUSE OF WHAT 'S IN THAT ROOM . BECAUSE IF THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR IT ... COULDN 'T GET IT OUT OF THE COUNTRY , HE WOULD RATHER KILL IT THAN LET IT LIVE . SO YOU KILLED HIM ? THE ONLY HUMANE ALTERNATIVE , GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES . PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR . THIS BOMB COULD BE WIRED TO ANYTHING IN THE CAR . SMALLEST CONCUSSION COULD SET IT OFF . IF YOU USE THAT WEAPON , YOU TAKE YOUR CHANCES . [ Exhales ] I 'LL TAKE MY CHANCES . I 'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH MISS SCULLY ALONE . [ Door Shuts ] HOW DID YOU KNOW MY NAME ? I KNOW MOST EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU , DANA . WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? I THINK YOU KNOW . WHO ARE YOU ? WHAT IS THIS PLACE ? THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST FRIGHTENING PLACES ON THE EARTH . A PLACE WHERE SOCIETY SENT ITS MONSTERS ... TO LIVE IN SHAME AND ISOLATION . NOW THEIR DISEASE IS ALL BUT CONQUERED . SCIENCE HAS ELIMINATED THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF MISERY . I 'VE SEEN YOUR METHODS OF ELIMINATION . WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAN WITH ME IN THE FOREST ? WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THIS ROOM ? - THEY HAD BEEN EXPOSED . - EXPOSED TO WHAT ? THE SAME THING ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO . VICTIMS OF AN INHUMAN PROJECT RUN BY A MAN NAMED ZAMA . YOU MEAN ISHIMARU . YOU HID HIM HERE AFTER THE WAR . HE STAYED HERE , AND HE CONTINUED HIS EXPERIMENTS . THE RULER OF THE WORLD IS NO LONGER THE COUNTRY WITH THE BRAVEST SOLDIERS , BUT THE GREATEST SCIENTISTS . UNFORTUNATELY , ISHIMARU BEGAN TO CONDUCT HIS WORK IN SECRET- - NOT SHARING WITH THOSE WHO HAD RISKED MUCH IN GIVING HIM HIS ASYLUM . - WHAT WAS HE EXPOSING THESE PEOPLE TO ? - TERRIBLE THINGS . WHAT KINDS OF THINGS ? - HAVE I BEEN EXPOSED ? - I DON 'T KNOW . WHO KNOWS ? PLEASE . I 'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING ... THAT WILL GIVE YOU YOUR ANSWERS . AGENT MULDER , DO YOU WANT US TO TRY PRYING THIS DOOR OPEN ? I WOULDN 'T RECOMMEND THAT . NO . - WHERE 'S THE KEY CARD ? - IT 'S IN MY POCKET . TAKE IT OUT ... SLOWLY . PUT IT ON THE TABLE . IT 'S NOT GONNA WORK . NO ? HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE ? THERE 'S A CODE . RIGHT ? ZAMA GAVE YOU A CODE JUST BEFORE YOU KILLED HIM . WHAT IS IT ? FOUR ONES , A FOUR , A SEVEN AND A ONE . 1-1-1-1-4-7-1 . I ASSUMED ZAMA WOULD BE SMARTER ... THAN TO GIVE ME THE ENTRANCE ANDTHE EXIT CODE . - WHAT ? - HE KNEW HE WAS GONNA DIE . WHEN I USED THE CODE TO ENTER THE CAR , IT ACTIVATED THE BOMB . IF YOU USE IT AGAIN , IT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY SET IT OFF . - IF THERE 'S A BOMB ON THIS TRAIN , WHERE IS IT ? - I DON 'T KNOW . - COULD BE ANYWHERE . - NO , IT COULDN 'T BE ANYWHERE . IF YOU ACTIVATED IT COMING IN , IT 'S GOTTA BE ON THIS CAR . YOU 'RE PROBABLY RIGHT . WHERE DO YOU THINK IT IS ? I DON 'T KNOW . YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ? I THINK YOU 'RE A LIAR . I DON 'T THINK YOU WORK FOR THE N.S.A. , AND I DON 'T THINK THERE 'S A BOMB ON THIS TRAIN . - YOU 'RE CHOOSING A HELL OF A WAY TO FIND OUT . - SHUT UP ! [ Beeping ] [ Beeping ] THAT 'S YOU . [ Sighs ] ANSWER IT . [ Cell Phone Beeping ] [ Beeping ] [ Phone Beeps ] YES ? YES . JUST A MOMENT . IT 'S FOR YOU . PUT IT DOWN . YEAH ? [ Man ] MR. MULDER , I HAVE SOMEONE HERE WHO 'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOU . - MULDER , IT 'S ME . - SCULLY , WHERE ARE YOU ? I 'M IN WEST VIRGINIA . WHO DIALED THIS NUMBER ? MULDER , WE 'VE GOTTEN INVOLVED IN SOMETHING , BUT IT 'S NOT AT ALL WHAT YOU THINK . - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? - WHATEVER IS ON THAT TRAIN IS NOT ALIEN . - YOU 'RE WRONG , SCULLY . - [ Scully ] MULDER , ISHIMARU- - ZAMA - - HE WAS EXPERIMENTING ON INNOCENT HUMAN SUBJECTS . HE 'D BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS , OPERATING OUT OF A LEPER COLONY . WHATEVER HIS NAME WAS , SCULLY , HE 'S DEAD . I DON 'T THINK THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH LEPERS . THE LEPER COLONY WAS JUST A FRONT . THE TESTS WEREN 'T JUST ON LEPERS . THEY WERE ON THE HOMELESS , ON- - ON THE INSANE . THEY WERE BROUGHT HERE , AND THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO DISEASES AND RADIATION TESTS . - WHO TOLD YOU THIS ? - THE MAN WHO HANDED ME THE PHONE . - WHY DO YOU BELIEVE HIM ? - BECAUSE OF WHAT HE 'S SHOWN ME . - WHAT ? - [ Clatter ] WHAT HAS HE SHOWN YOU ? MULDER , I 'M STANDING IN A TRAIN CAR ... JUST LIKE THE ONE ON YOUR ALIEN AUTOPSY VIDEO , ONLY I REALIZE THAT I 'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE . - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? - THIS IS WHERE THEY BROUGHT ME . THIS IS WHERE THEY PUT THE IMPLANT IN MY NECK- - ONE OF THESE CARS . - [ Mulder ] SCULLY- - - IT ALL MAKES SENSE , MULDER . ISHIMARU- - ZAMA- - HE WAS USING THE SECRET RAILROAD ... TO CONDUCT HIS TESTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY . THE WOMEN IN ALLENTOWN , THEY ALL REMEMBER THESE CARS . [ Static On Cell Phone ] [ Static ] SCULLY . SCULLY ? [ Scully ] CAN YOU HEAR ME ? YEAH . ARE YOU SAYING THAT ZAMA IS THE ONE WHO ABDUCTED THESE WOMEN ? WHAT I 'M SAYING , MULDER , IS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ALIEN ABDUCTION . IT IS JUST A SMOKE SCREEN HAPPILY CREATED BY OUR GOVERNMENT ... TO COVER UP THE BIGGEST LIE OF ALL . WHAT ABOUT THE U.F.O. I SAW THEM WORKING ON ? THAT WASN 'T A U.F.O. IT WAS A PIECE OF A RUSSIAN NUCLEAR SUB THAT WAS RAISED . - MORE LIES . - HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE ? BECAUSE I HAVE WHAT I TOLD YOU I NEEDED , MULDER . PROOF . TWO WEEKS AGO , THE PRESIDENT MADE A PUBLIC APOLOGY ... FOR SECRET RADIATION TESTS THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON INNOCENT CITIZENS ... UP UNTIL 1974 . ONLY GUESS WHAT . THOSE TESTS NEVER ENDED . MULDER , LISTEN TO ME . YOU HAVE GOT TO STAY OUT OF THAT TRAIN CAR . - WHY ? - BECAUSE THERE IS A BOMB ON BOARD . MULDER , IF THAT BOMB DETONATES , THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE GONNA DIE FROM HEMORRHAGIC FEVER . THAT 'S WHAT THE TEST SUBJECT INSIDE HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO . WELL , SCULLY , YOU 'RE A LITTLE LATE . I 'M LOCKED INSIDE THAT TRAIN CAR . THEN WE 'VE GOT TO GET YOU OUT . THAT DEVICE IS ON A TIMER . - WHERE IS IT ? - THERE SHOULD BE A VENTILATION GRID ON THE CEILING . IT 'S HIDDEN UP INSIDE . STEP BACK . OPEN THAT . DID YOU FIND IT , MULDER ? HOLD ON . OH , YEAH . I FOUND IT . - HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE ? - LITTLE OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF . LOOK , MULDER , YOU 'VE GOT TO GET THEM TO STOP THAT TRAIN , SO WE CAN GET YOU OFF OF IT . THEY WANT YOU TO TELL THE ENGINEER TO STOP AT THE NEXT STATION . - WHY ? - SO WE CAN GET A BOMB SQUAD OUT THERE ... AND EVACUATE THE TRAIN . SCULLY , YOU 'RE BREAKING UP . I CAN 'T HEAR YOU . - DID YOU HEAR THAT ? MULDER ? MULD- - - SCULLY ? SCULLY ? [ Man ] WHAT 'S THE NEXT STOP ? IT 'S NOT ON THE MAP . STEP ASIDE . CONDUCTOR ! WHERE ARE WE ? IOWA . WE PASSED MURRAY STATION ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO . I WANT YOU TO GET WORD TO THE ENGINEER . THERE 'S A BOMB ON THIS CAR . BOMB ? THAT 'S RIGHT . I WANT YOU TO TELL HIM NOT TO MAKE HIS NEXT SCHEDULED STOP ... AND TO REROUTE , UNDERSTAND ? I THINK SO . TELL HIM TO CHOOSE A PLACE ... AS FAR AWAY FROM A POPULATED AREA AS POSSIBLE AND UNHOOK THIS CAR . - WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? - LET 'S MOVE INTO THE CORNER OVER THERE NOW . YOU 'RE GONNA GET US BOTH KILLED . I WANT YOU TO KNEEL DOWN AND PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK . THEY 'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND US IN TIME . IF WHAT 'S ON THIS TRAIN IS AS IMPORTANT AS I THINK IT IS , THEY WILL . [ Train Crossing Bell Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Brakes Hiss ] [ Brakes Screech ] [ Rumbling ] [ Grunts ] YOU 'RE GONNA DIE , YOU KNOW THAT ? WHAT DO YOU CARE ? YOU WERE TRYING TO KILL ME ANYWAY . [ Train Creaks ] [ Clank ] [ Cell Phone Rings ] [ Beep ] SCULLY . SCULLY , YOU HAVEN 'T SEEN AMERICA , TILL YOU 'VE SEEN IT FROM A TRAIN . - DAMN IT ! WHAT HAPPENED ? - I 'M NOT GONNA MAKE THAT STATION , SCULLY . - I FIGURED THAT . YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE YOU ARE ? - NO , BUT I 'M SURE THEY 'LL FIND US . WE PROBABLY LIT UP EVERY SPY SATELLITE IN THIS HEMISPHERE . IT WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO , SCULLY . IF YOU 'RE RIGHT ABOUT WHAT 'S ON THIS CAR , AN EXPLOSION OUTSIDE A POPULATED AREA WOULD REDUCE THE RISKS . IF I 'M RIGHT , THEY 'RE NOT GONNA WANT TO FIND YOU . - BUT YOU DON 'T THINK I 'M RIGHT , DO YOU ? - WE 'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE . WE 'RE NOT WAITING FOR ANYTHING . WE GOTTA GET YOU OUT OF THERE AS FAST AS WE CAN . I 'M FIELDING ALL OFFERS AND SUGGESTIONS . THEY 'RE NOT GONNA COME , ARE THEY ? I SAID YOU WERE MAKING A MISTAKE . TELL ME SOMETHING . YOU GOT ON THIS TRAIN TO KILL DR. ZAMA . THEN WHAT ? WHAT WERE YOUR ORDERS THEN ? WHO ARE YOU PROTECTING ? UNLESS THAT BOMB IS AS PHONY AS YOU ARE , WE BOTH GOT ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO LIVE . IS THAT PART OF THE PLAN ? THEY DON 'T MAKE PROVISIONS FOR SAVING MY LIFE . WELL , WHAT ABOUT THAT THING LOCKED BACK THERE ? WHAT PROVISIONS WERE MADE FOR SAVING ITS LIFE ? I DON 'T KNOW . I WASN 'T EXPECTED TO FAIL . YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS , DON 'T YOU ? YOU 'RE GONNA DIE FOR THAT THING . IS IT IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO DIE FOR ? WHAT IS IT , A PLAGUE CARRIER ? A LEPER ? WE 'RE BOTH GONNA DIE IN HERE . THE DIFFERENCE IS I 'M GONNA DIE QUICKLY . AS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY , YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT A GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE STOMACH ... IS PROBABLY THE MOST PAINFUL AND THE SLOWEST WAY TO DIE- - BUT I 'M NOT A VERY GOOD SHOT , AND WHEN I MISS ... I TEND TO MISS LOW . - IT 'S A WEAPON . - A WEAPON ? WHAT KIND OF A WEAPON ? ASK YOURSELF , MY FRIEND . WHAT COULD BE MORE VALUABLE THAN STAR WARS , MORE VALUABLE THAN THE ATOMIC BOMB ... OR THE MOST ADVANCED BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS ? A STANDING ARMY IMMUNE TO THE EFFECTS OF THOSE WEAPONS . THAT 'S WHAT DR. ZAMA DID , DIDN 'T HE ? HE CAME UP WITH AN IMMUNITY TO THOSE WEAPONS . HE WAS TRYING TO SMUGGLE THAT THING TO HIS OWN COUNTRY TO SHARE THE SCIENCE , ONLY OUR GOVERNMENT ISN 'T IN THE MOOD TO SHARE , RIGHT ? THEY 'VE BEEN DOING EXPERIMENTS SINCE WORLD WAR II- - TESTS ON INNOCENT CIVILIANS . BUT ZAMA SUCCEEDED WHERE THE OTHERS HAD FAILED . AND THAT THING IN THERE , THAT 'S NO INNOCENT CIVILIAN . IT 'S NOT A LEPER , EITHER . IT 'S AN ALIEN-HUMAN HYBRID , ISN 'T IT ? THEN AGAIN , IF THAT WERE TRUE ... YOU 'D HAVE EXPECTED SOMEONE WOULD 'VE BEEN HERE BY NOW TO SAVE IT , WOULDN 'T YOU ? [ Exhales Deeply ] YES . HELLO . MY NAME IS DANA SCULLY , AND I 'M TRYING TO REACH SENATOR MATHESON AT HOME . I 'VE ALREADY TRIED HIS OFFICE . PLEASE . THIS IS AN EMERGENCY . CAN YOU REACH HIM ? YES . I 'M AT 555-0199 . THANKS . THIS AREA CODE . [ Books Clattering on Floor ] [ Click ] [ Cell Phone Rings ] [ Rings ] [ Rings ] YEAH ? [ Scully ] MULDER , I THINK I 'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE . WHAT IS IT ? I THINK I MAY HAVE A CODE FOR YOU . I 'M WATCHING ZAMA PUNCH IT IN TO KEYPAD IN ONE OF THE TRAIN CARS . - [ Mulder ] WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING ? - YOUR ALIEN AUTOPSY VIDEO . YOU MEAN I MIGHT GET MY $ 29.95'S WORTH AFTER ALL ? I 'VE GOT SIX MINUTES LEFT . IS THAT WHAT YOU HAVE ? - LET 'S HOPE NOT . WHAT 'S THE CODE ? - OKAY . ONE . ONE . ZERO . WHAT ? ARE YOU THERE ? YEAH . YEAH . ONE . ZERO . ONE . 1-0-1 . AND A THREE . THEN A THREE . 3-3 . AH . I CAN 'T SEE THE LAST NUMBER CLEARLY . HIS HAND GETS IN THE WAY . - TICK , TICK , SCULLY . - NO . I 'M SORRY .

NOTHING , SCULLY- - NOT THE RAIL OPERATORS , NOT THE FORESTRY DEPARTMENT . NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT TRAIN CAR . ARE THERE ANY SATELLITE PHOTOS YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON ? SENATOR MATHESON HASN 'T RETURNED MY PHONE CALLS . HIS- - HIS AIDES SAY HE 'S OUT OF THE COUNTRY . WELL , THE ADMINISTRATOR AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE YOU WERE ADMITTED ... SAID THAT SOMEONE HAD CALLED AND ALERTED THEM TO YOUR LOCATION . NOW , I WENT THROUGH THE PHONE RECORDS MYSELF , AND THE CALL WAS PLACED FROM A PHONE BOOTH IN BLUE EARTH , IOWA . DID YOU LOCATE THE BRIEFCASE THAT ZAMA LEFT ON THE TRAIN ? YEAH . I GOT IT RIGHT HERE . IT DOESN 'T LOOK LIKE THE SAME BRIEFCASE . IT 'S THE ONE THEY GAVE ME , THE ONE THEY SAID YOU GAVE TO THE CONDUCTOR . - THESE AREN 'T THE SAME JOURNALS . THEY 'VE ALL BEEN REWRITTEN . - MULDER-- - THEY 'RE GETTING AWAY WITH IT . - THEY 'VEGOTTENAWAY WITH IT . THE BODIES AT THE LEPER COLONY HAVE ALL BEEN REMOVED . I KNOW WHAT I SAW ON THAT TRAIN . IT WASN 'T A LEPER . IT WASN 'T HUMAN . I KNOW WHAT I SAW AT THE RESEARCH FACILITY . IT WAS BARELY RECOGNIZABLE AS HUMAN . DON 'T YOU SEE , MULDER ? YOU 'RE DOING THEIR WORK FOR THEM . YOU 'RE CHASING ALIENS THAT AREN 'T THERE , HELPING THEM CREATE A STORY TO COVER THE SHAMEFUL TRUTH . AND WHAT THEY CAN 'T COVER , THEY APOLOGIZE FOR . APOLOGY HAS BECOME POLICY . I-I DON 'T NEED AN APOLOGY FOR THE LIES . I DON 'T CARE ABOUT THE FICTIONS THEY CREATE TO COVER THEIR CRIMES . I WANT THEM HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHATDIDHAPPEN . I WANT AN APOLOGY FOR THE TRUTH .

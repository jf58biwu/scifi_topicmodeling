 There ! Major Stark There she is . Or he ? - We have no way of telling which . - Tell me it 's prehistoric . Sorry , I 'm betting it 's no more than 20 years old . I 've never seen anything like it . I doubt anyone else has either . Somebody did ! - Want to hear my theory , sir ? - No thanks Angie . You read too many tabloids . Bag all the prints , we 'll find whoever was here . I 've always been a loner , never exactly fit in . Mom says all teenagers feel that way . It doesn 't help much . I am different . And I don 't know why . 9.9 ... . 9.9 ... . 9.9 . Come on , when are you going to show the coach , the team could really use you . You know she won 't let me , obsessed something 's going to happen to me . Yeah , like anything ever happens in this town . Won 't even let me take track instead . Well , I 've got just the cure for that . Ahh , how about bringing it down to Mach 1 , Okay ? Oh man , Sheriff . Pull over . What are you doing ? Let him worry ! My bike ! Man . Driving without a license is a serious offense . Sorry sheriff . I expect more from you , than this David . Your father would expect more . You don 't scare me anymore Rafe . I 'm sick of you butting in my life . - Just because you were his friend . - I 'm your friend too David . - Friends like you I don 't need . - Am I under arrest ? - No ! - I 'm outta here ! - You drive ! - Come on , you heard the man . How much longer can I keep the secrets for him ? Who he really is . And who his father really was . Ladies and gentlemen . Our leader , Cale Oosha . Dragit , prepare to launch to Earth . Understood Cale . Make escort flyers ready . Thank you uncle . On the occasion of my first visit to your Earth facility , - We will only use Earth speak . - Excellent practice , Cale-Oosha . Will there be a delegation from Earth to greet us ? Everything has been arranged , your majesty . I only wish my father had lived to be here . For 30 years , you talked him out of this trip Uncle . Yes , for his safety . The people of Earth are quite primitive , Cale-Oosha . - But they look so much like us . - Some do . Well , I want to meet them all . Rafe , how is my Earth speak ? Adequate . The exotar , put it on . - Rafe , I 'm not your student anymore . - But I am still your protector . - Put it on . - Why ? To remind your uncle , you are the leader . Escort planes are in the air . This is Charles airbase . Visitor One , over . Visitor One . This is Charles . Squawk to Identify . We 're roger your squawk , Activate on-board stealth mode . Out standing , continue approach . Honor Guard-ten hut . Welcome to Earth , Cale-Oosha . - I give you greetings . - I return the greetings . - Commander Conrad is it ? - Yes , but you may call me Conrad . Won 't you step inside ? Amazing what we have done over the years , isn 't it ? Remind you of our cities back home ? At home we don 't hide cities underground . You Earth speak well , General Conrad . I 've been here for 10 years , sir . Manglers ? What are they doing here ? Look , when construction is finished , We 'll have the capability of arming and servicing , 50 of our largest vessels . Arming ? For what ? Well , for the invasion . Invasion ! What invasion ? It was ordered years ago , Cale-Oosha . Who gave that order ? - Why ... Your uncle , the Dragit . Early in my exploration of this planet , It became clear to me , that the behaviour of these humans Was a threat to Tyrusian culture . Dragit , Your mission was to make friendship , trade . It didn 't work that way . Earth is a warlike planet with weapons of mass destruction . Most of which are in this place called America . The only thing Americans respect is superior force . We will use this base to support such a force . So this is why you kept my father away from Earth all these years ? You knew he wouldn 't approve this . Your father never understood . Our planet is dying . We need to expand . Besides Cale-Oosha , what 's done is done . It is you who will be praised for saving Tyrus . - No ! - No ? My father taught me rights of others are sacred . There will be no invasion . - I think you should reconsider . - No ! Zuss ! Ah , Cale-Oosha , what a pity . All this work for nothing . - Treason ! - Revolution ! Fire ! This way ! Move ! Stop them . All together ... Come on . Off , go ! - We 'll never make it . - Hang on . Release the Manglers . Head for that gate . Move ! Fire ! Launch the helicopter . Thanks for coming ! It is done , sir . He 's dead . Good , no further distractions . You 've done well . - Thank you , sir . When construction on the base is complete , you 'll be joined by many others . You 'll be preparing for the day of the invasion and the subjugation of Earth . I await your return . Your shoulder is almost healed , can you explain that ? - Who are you ? - That is excellent Earth speak . - You must be a Earthlufa . - A what ? Earthlufa . It means , woman of Earth . Oh , you bet , yeah . What does that make you ? - I am Tyrussian , from the planet Tyrus . - You 're not kidding ? Why were the soldiers trying to kill you ? Rafe , he was my friend . I 'm alone now . I know how that feels . Ah , Forgive me . I 'm in your debt . How do I thank you ? Well , you could start with telling me your name . My name ... my name is Cale . - I 'm Rita . Oh , Ah , you put your hand in mine , shake up and down , it 's a little custom we have on Earth . Ha Ha , yosh , I 've read of this . - You really are from out there ! - Yes . Okay , Tell me that 's Rafe . That 's some glove . You 're alive . - Rafe ! - Cale-Oosha ! . Cale-Oosha ! . Ah , excuse me . Cale-Oosha ? - It means ruler , here you might say king . - Just plain Cale , huh ! I meant no lie to you . - Thank you for what you 've done . Let 's go , while there 's time . - Go where ? You can 't go back to your spaceship . Do you have a back-up plan ? Any plan ? - What would you suggest ? - Come on , I 'll think of something . And she did . And in the days ahead , she would become our guide , our friend , and for Cale much more . Can you see it ? Right there . Right around that star . That 's your daddy 's world . Cale . Will you ever take him there ? - When it is safe again . - Cale . Commander Suddah is coming . The Ooshati have organised to over through the Dragit . They need you to lead them . So , I have to leave . Yes , otherwise when they find you , the Dragit 's men will kill her , and your son . - How do I tell her ? - She already knows .

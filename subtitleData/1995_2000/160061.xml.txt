HELPS CLEAR THE MIND , CALM THE SPIRIT . DAMN , DID YOU SEE THAT ? ! THAT 'S THE THIRD TIME IN AND OUT . THAT HOOP IS DEFECTIVE , MAN ! CHEAP , LOUSY PIECE OF ... THAT HOOP IS DEFECTIVE , MAN ! CHEAP , LOUSY PIECE OF ... I BELIEVE YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT CALMING THE SPIRIT ? COMPLAINING ABOUT THE COURT 'S PART OF THE GAME , JOHN . COMPLAINING ABOUT THE COURT 'S PART OF THE GAME , JOHN . SO , WHAT 'S UP ? WE 'VE JUST BEEN CONTACTED BY AN EARTHFORCE SHIP IN THE AREA . APPARENTLY THEY 'RE TRYING TO BRING IN MATERIALS THEY SAY WILL HELP FIGHT THE PLAGUE BACK HOME . THEY 'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE LOCAL POPULATION , AND THEY 'D LIKE US TO HELP OUT . I 'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO LEND A HAND . WHAT 'S THE LOCATION ? REGULA 4 . REGULA 4 . I 'VE HEARD OF IT . I 'VE HEARD OF IT . IT 'S A LOW-TECH PLANET . MOSTLY FARMERS , NO MILITARY TO SPEAK OF . NO STARSHIPS . WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE CAUSING THEM TROUBLE ? WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE CAUSING THEM TROUBLE ? Man over radio : TEAM 4 , SITREP . REPEAT . TEAM 4 , SITUATION REPORT . DO YOU HAVE THE TARGET IN SIGHT ? DO YOU HAVE THE TARGET IN SIGHT ? MATTHEW GIDEON , CAPTAIN . ATTACHED TO THE EARTH ALLIANCE STARSHIPEXCALIBUR . ATTACHED TO THE EARTH ALLIANCE STARSHIPEXCALIBUR . TO FIND A CURE TO THE DRAKH PLAGUE BEFORE IT WIPES OUT ALL LIFE ON EARTH . BEFORE IT WIPES OUT ALL LIFE ON EARTH . ANYWHERE I HAVE TO . ANYWHERE I HAVE TO . Questioner : WHO DO YOU SERVE ? AND WHO DO YOU TRUST ? AND WHO DO YOU TRUST ? MORNING , MATTHEW . GALEN . INTERESTING READING ? I JUST GOT A REPORT FROM THE MEDUSA STATIONED ON REGULA 4 . THESE GUYS MUST BE EITHER DRUNK OR CRAZY OR BOTH . I SHOULDN 'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED . GET THIS . THEY REPORT SEEING A DRAGON . WHAT ? A DRAGON . BIG AS A SKYSCRAPER . UH , BREATHING FIRE AND ALL THAT ? SUPPOSEDLY , YES , BUT THEY HAVEN 'T FOUND ANY DAMAGE . CAN 'T BE MUCH OF A DRAGON . DID THEY SAY WHAT COLOR IT WAS- - RED , GREEN , BLACK ? GOLD . WITH RED EYES . WHY ? NO REASON , JUST CURIOUS . WELL , I 'LL GO AND GET READY TO MEET THEM THEN . I HAVEN 'T INVITED YOU YET . I HAVEN 'T INVITED YOU YET . YOU WILL . YOU WILL . SO , WHAT HAVE WE GOT ? REGULA 4 IS A HUMAN COLONY ESTABLISHED 90 YEARS AGO BY A SEPARATIST MOVEMENT . THEY 'VE ABANDONED TECHNOLOGY IN FAVOR OF AN AGRARIAN SOCIETY- - HAND TOOLS , WOOD STOVES , DOMESTICATED ANIMALS . THEY 'RE PRACTICALLY MEDIEVAL . SOUNDS QUITE CHARMING , ACTUALLY . SO WE FIGURED THERE WOULDN 'T BE ANY PROBLEMS COMPLETING THE MISSION- - JUST COME IN , TAKE WHAT WE NEED , AND GO , BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT HASN 'T EXACTLY WORKED OUT LIKE THAT . WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL 'S DOING ON DOWN THERE , CAPTAIN , SO IF YOU COULD HELP US- - YOU SAID " TAKE WHAT YOU NEED . " WHAT ARE YOU TAKING ? BETTER LET THE CAPTAIN EXPLAIN THAT PART . BETTER LET THE CAPTAIN EXPLAIN THAT PART . A PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF THE PLANET 3 YEARS AGO REVEALED THAT HUMANS ON REGULA 4 HAD AN AVERAGE LIFE SPAN OF 15 YEARS BEYOND EARTH NORMALLY . NOW , THERE APPEARS TO BE A MINERAL IN THEIR WATER SUPPLY THAT COUNTERACTS MOST VIRUSES- - SORT OF A NATURAL ANTIVIRAL AGENT . WE ALWAYS INTENDED TO INVESTIGATE IT FURTHER , BUT WHEN THE DRAKH PLAGUE HIT EARTH , OUR SCHEDULE WAS MOVED UP . WE ARRIVED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND BEGAN MINING TO REMOVE AS MUCH OF THE MINERAL AS POSSIBLE FOR SHIPMENT BACK TO EARTH . THE TESTS BACK HOME WERE APPARENTLY VERY POSITIVE , SO WE WERE ORDERED TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS . YOU 'RE STRIP-MINING THE PLACE . WE 'RE BEING MORE AGGRESSIVE , YES . THERE 'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE NOT TO . AND THAT 'S WHEN THE PROBLEMS STARTED . LIEUTENANT ? LIEUTENANT ? THIS IS A LIST OF THE PROBLEMS WE 'VE EXPERIENCED OVER THE PAST 6 WEEKS . THE CONTROL CIRCUITS ON HALF A DOZEN SHUTTLES WERE COMPLETELY FUSED SHORTLY AFTER LANDING ON REGULA 4 . A 12-TON CARGO TRANSPORT DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY FROM OUR PLANETSIDE BASE FOR 2 DAYS . WHEN IT REAPPEARED , WE DISCOVERED THAT THE ENGINES HAD BEEN REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH A SUBSTANCE RESEMBLING PEANUT BUTTER . WITH A SUBSTANCE RESEMBLING PEANUT BUTTER . Captain Daniels : DON 'T LET THE PRANKS FOOL YOU . WE ARE DEALING WITH TERRORISTS HERE . AS TO HOW THEY 'RE DOING WHAT THEY DO , IT 'S COMPLETELY BEYOND US . WE 'VE DOUBLED SECURITY , WE 'VE PUT CAMERAS ALL OVER THE PLACE , BUT WE JUST CAN 'T CATCH THEM IN THE ACT . HAS ANYONE BEEN HURT ? NO , NOT YET . BUT IT 'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THAT HAPPENS . YOU 'VE SEEN SOME PRETTY STRANGE STUFF OUT THERE , CAPTAIN . ANY THOUGHTS ? WE NEED FIRSTHAND INFORMATION BEFORE WE CAN MAKE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS . I SAY WE GO DOWN TO THE PLANET , SEE THE SITUATION FOR OURSELVES . I AGREE , BUT JUST THE TWO OF US . NO SECURITY TEAMS , NO TROOPS . I ADVISE AGAINST THAT . THEY 'RE NOT EXACTLY HAPPY TO HAVE US HERE . IF YOU TWO GO ALONE , WE CAN 'T GUARANTEE YOUR SAFETY . WE CAN LOOK AFTER OURSELVES , AND I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WE WON 'T BE IN ANY DANGER . WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE THAT REASON WITH ME ? OH , NO , NOT YET . UH , NOT UNTIL I 'M SURE . WE 'LL NEED A CHANGE OF CLOTHES FOR MATTHEW , A MAP OF THE MAIN VILLAGE , AND SOME LOCAL CURRENCY . AND SOME LOCAL CURRENCY . ARE YOU COMING , MATTHEW ? ARE YOU COMING , MATTHEW ? YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS , DON 'T YOU ? PERHAPS . AND IF I 'M RIGHT , IT 'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING YOU SHOULD SEE . AND IF YOU 'RE WRONG ? OH , WELL , THAT HARDLY SEEMS LIKELY , DOES IT ? OH , WELL , THAT HARDLY SEEMS LIKELY , DOES IT ? WELL , GALEN , WE 'RE HERE . WHAT NOW ? WELL , THIS IS AN INN . WE 'RE NEW IN TOWN . I SUGGEST YOU BUY US A DRINK . YOU 'RE ENJOYING THIS , AREN 'T YOU ? IMMENSELY . SWELL . SWELL . HI . HELLO . WHAT 'S YOUR NAME ? Barkeep : GO ON BACK , CLAIRE . I TOLD YOU BEFORE ABOUT TALKING TO STRANGERS . YES , FATHER . YES , FATHER . EVENIN ' . WE JUST GOT INTO TOWN . WE 'RE BRINGING SOME CATTLE TO MARKET . THOUGHT WE 'D STOP IN AND WASH SOME OF THE DUST OUT OF OUR THROATS . WELL , YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE . WHAT 'LL IT BE ? I GOT FLISKY , DRY AND WET , LAUDERALES , TUNIES , LISTER , AND BARK . LAUDERALES , TUNIES , LISTER , AND BARK . WHAT 'LL THIS BUY ? WHAT 'LL THIS BUY ? THE INN--ALL OF IT . THE INN--ALL OF IT . THEN I 'LL JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF TUNIES . THEN I 'LL JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF TUNIES . HOW MUCH LONGER ARE WE SUPPOSED TO WAIT HERE ? UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENS . UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENS . WHAT IF NOTHING HAPPENS ? SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS . SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS . SEE ? SEE ? SOMETHING I CAN DO FOR YOU ? YEAH . GET OUT OF OUR VILLAGE . WE WERE JUST- - I SAID GET THE HELL OUT ! WE DON 'T WANT YOUR KIND AROUND HERE . WE DON 'T WANT YOUR KIND AROUND HERE . LEAVE THEM ALONE . THEY BELONG TO ME . THEY BELONG TO ME . YOU KNOW THESE TWO , ALWYN ? YOU KNOW THESE TWO , ALWYN ? I EMPLOY MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO BRING ME INFORMATION FROM THE BORDER . THESE TWO CAME TO SEE ME . I TOLD THEM TO EXPECT A WARM AND FRIENDLY WELCOME . YOU 'VE MADE A LIAR OUT OF ME . WE THOUGHT THEY WERE OUTSIDERS . THEY TRIED TO PAY FOR THEIR DRINKS WITH THIS . AH , YES . YES , THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SIGNAL TO ME THAT THEY HAD ARRIVED . THEY OBVIOUSLY GAVE IT TO THE WRONG PERSON . I REALLY DON 'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM SOME DAYS . INTRUDERS EVERYWHERE , OUR WAY OF LIFE HANGING IN THE BALANCE- - YOU WOULD THINK THAT SOMETIMES THEY WOULD BE BOTHERED TO ATTEND STAFF CONFERENCES , WOULDN 'T YOU ? STILL , I SUPPOSE THAT IS INEVITABLE WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH THE OUTER VILLAGES , ISOLATED LIKE THAT . PRETTY SOON THE GENE POOL TURNS INTO A STAGNANT POND . [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS WHAT YOU GET . THIS IS WHAT YOU GET . THANK YOU , THANK YOU . THANK YOU , THANK YOU . HELLO , ALWYN . IT 'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN . AND YOU , GALEN . AND YOU , GALEN . HOW DID YOU FIND ME ? A GOLD DRAGON ? YOU USED TO PULL THAT ONE OUT FOR CHILDREN AT PARTIES . YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE PUT UP A SIGN WITH YOUR NAME ON IT . [ CHUCKLES ] YES . YES , WELL , IT 'S A CLASSIC . CLASSICS NEVER GROW OLD , DO THEY ? THE FEAR REACTION TO THAT IMAGE , YOU KNOW , IS HEREDITARY . IT IS INGRAINED IN OUR DNA . IT 'S ARCHETYPAL , IT 'S JUNGIAN . IT 'S--IT 'S ... JUST THAT I DO LIKE DRAGONS , ESPECIALLY GOLDEN ONES . NOBODY DOES DRAGONS ANYMORE , DO THEY ? A PITY . A PITY . TOO SHOWY , I SUPPOSE . WHO IS THIS ? MATTHEW GIDEON . THIS ... IS THE CAPTAIN OF THEEXCALIBUR . THIS ... IS THE CAPTAIN OF THEEXCALIBUR . IT 'S ALL RIGHT . WE CAN TRUST HIM . GALEN , I AM THE ONE WHO IS BEING BETRAYED . HOW DO I KNOW I CAN TRUST HIM ? YOU KNOW ME , ALWYN . I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING TO HARM YOU . I JUST THINK WE SHOULD TALK . I JUST THINK WE SHOULD TALK . YES , FOLLOW ME . YES , FOLLOW ME . NOW , MIND THE BOWLS . IT 'S A VEGETABLE CHOWDER MADE BY MRS. SIMMS JUST DOWN THE ROAD . IT STAYS BLISTERINGLY HOT FOR AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR AFTER IT 'S DRAWN FROM THE POT . DON 'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT . DEFIES AT LEAST 2 OF THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS . I JUST CAN 'T DECIDE WHICH OF THE TWO IT IS . I TAKE IT FROM THAT LITTLE DISPLAY AT THE INN THAT YOU 'RE A TECHNOMAGE , SAME AS GALEN ? THAT YOU 'RE A TECHNOMAGE , SAME AS GALEN ? I WAS ONCE A MEMBER OF THAT ORDER , YES . SINCE YOU ARE HERE , AM I TO ASSUME THAT THE OTHERS HAVE DECIDED AT LAST TO COME OUT OF HIDING ? NO , NOT YET . I CAME BACK A LITTLE EARLY . BOOTED YOU OUT , DID THEY ? SOMETHING LIKE THAT . GOOD LAD . HOPE FOR YOU YET ... WHICH IS MORE THAN CAN BE SAID OF THE OTHERS . YOU SAID YOUWERE A TECHNOMAGE . YOU LEFT ? NO . THEY DID . THEY DID . JUST AS THE SHADOW WAR WAS GEARING UP , THEY DECIDED IT WOULD BE A JOLLY GOOD IDEA IF WE ALL LEFT AND WENT SOMEWHERE ELSE , RODE OUT THE WAR IN SOME SAFE PLACE WHERE WE COULDN 'T BE FOUND . RANK COWARDICE , IF YOU ASK ME ! RANK COWARDICE , IF YOU ASK ME ! WHICH THEY DIDN 'T . WHICH THEY DIDN 'T . IT WAS ALWAYS PAINFULLY SURPRISING TO ME THAT YOU WENT ALONG WITH THEM . THAT YOU WENT ALONG WITH THEM . I FOLLOWED MY TEACHER . I BELIEVED I HAD AN OBLIGATION . YOU DID . WHAT A PITY YOU CONFUSED THE ONE WITH THE OTHER . WHAT A PITY YOU CONFUSED THE ONE WITH THE OTHER . ALWYN , I TAKE IT THAT YOU 'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT OUR SHIPS HAVE BEEN HAVING LATELY . THAT OUR SHIPS HAVE BEEN HAVING LATELY . I KEEP BUSY . WHY ? YOU SAY YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO HELP PEOPLE ? THE RESOURCES ON THIS PLANET CAN BE A HUGE HELP BACK HOME , MAYBE EVEN SLOW DOWN THE PLAGUE AND SAVE LIVES . SO WHY THIS ... CAMPAIGN OF TERROR ? SO WHY THIS ... CAMPAIGN OF TERROR ? [ COLDLY ] TERROR ? [ COLDLY ] TERROR ? TERROR ? ! DO YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT A CAMPAIGN OF TERROR REALLY LOOKS LIKE ? DO YOU ? ! DO YOU ? ! COME WITH ME . COME WITH ME . MACHINES WORK DAY AND NIGHT TEARING THE HEART OUT OF THIS PLACE . THE MINERAL THEY 'RE AFTER IS A NATURAL ANTIVIRAL AGENT THAT HAS BEEN FILTERED THROUGH GROUNDWATER OVER THE CENTURIES , AND THE ONLY PLACES YOU CAN FIND IT ARE IN THE MOST FERTILE OF OUR LANDS WITH A NEARBY SUPPLY OF CLEAN WATER , ALL OF WHICH IS BEING DESTROYED BY THIS LITTLE OPERATION OF YOURS . WE TRIED TO CONVINCE THEM TO MINE ELSEWHERE AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE , BUT THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN , BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THE GREATEST CONCENTRATION OF THE MINERAL CAN BE FOUND . THIS IS WHERE IT IS EASIER TO DIG OUT , ALL IN THE NAME OF SPEED AND EFFICIENCY , AND DAMN EVERYONE HERE WHO IS AFFECTED BY IT . AND DAMN EVERYONE HERE WHO IS AFFECTED BY IT . THESE PEOPLE HERE HAVE BEEN DISPLACED . THEY HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES . CAN 'T THEY GO ELSEWHERE ? WHERE CAN THEY GO ? THEY WORK THE LAND . THEY HAVE FARMS , LIVESTOCK , CROPS . YOU CANNOT JUST BACK IN A TRUCK AND SHIFT IT ALL AWAY . WE HAVE NO CITIES HERE . WE HAVE NO EMERGENCY RELOCATION CAMPS . YOU PUSH THEM OUT OF HERE , AND COME THE ICE AND SNOW , THEY WILL STARVE , THEY WILL DIE . HAVE YOU TRIED TALKING TO CAPTAIN DANIELS , TELLING HIM ABOUT IT ? TRIED , FAILED . TRIED , FAILED . HE WON 'T LISTEN . WHY SHOULD HE ? I MEAN , WHAT ARE A FEW LIVES HERE COMPARED WITH BILLIONS BACK AT HOME ? I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT MORE TROUBLE THAN IT IS WORTH FOR THEM TO STAY HERE . IT IS NOT WORKING . THEY CALL YOU A TERRORIST . DO THEY REALLY ? AND I AM FLATTERED . THE TRUTH IS THAT I 'M MORE OF AN ANNOYANCE THAN A TERRORIST . I WOULD RATHER WORK THIS OUT PEACEFULLY , BUT WITH EACH PASSING DAY , THAT BECOMES MORE AND MORE IMPROBABLE . ONE DAY THIS WILL TURN TO VIOLENCE , AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS , YOUR KIND WILL COME HERE WITH SHIPS AND GUNS AND BOMBS . AND THERE IS NOTHING HERE THAT CAN STOP THEM . WRONG . WRONG . I WILL BE HERE . I WILL BE WAITING FOR THEM . THESE PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN ME A HOME . THEY COME TO ME WITH THEIR PROBLEMS , WITH THEIR QUESTIONS , AND I TRY TO HELP THEM . I AM PART-TIME WISE MAN , PART-TIME JESTER , PART-TIME SOLDIER , PART-TIME WHATEVER THE MOMENT REQUIRES . THEY ARE DECENT PEOPLE , AND I HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THEM . AND I HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THEM . GALEN , YOU KNOW WHAT I CAN DO . SO FAR I HAVE HELD BACK . SO FAR I HAVE HELD BACK . BUT IF THEY COME WITH GUNS , THEY WILL LEAVE ... IN BOXES . IN BOXES . TRY IT , AND YOU 'RE DEAD . COME ON , GET ' EM IN HERE ! COME ON , GET ' EM IN HERE ! QUICKLY . QUICKLY . WE DON 'T WANT TO KILL YOU , BUT WE WILL IF WE HAVE TO . DO YOU UNDERSTAND ? DO YOU UNDERSTAND ? GOOD . YES . MOVE ' EM OUT . MOVE ' EM OUT . LET 'S GO . LET 'S GO . WHERE IS YOUR FRIEND ? OUTSIDE . HE HAS TO CHECK IN WITH THEEXCALIBUR EVERY FEW HOURS , OTHERWISE THEY GET NERVOUS . AND HE DIDN 'T WANT ME TO OVERHEAR HIM . IF I DIDN 'T KNOW ANY BETTER , I WOULD THINK HE DIDN 'T TRUST ME . HE DOESN 'T TRUST EASILY OR OFTEN . I 'M SURPRISED HE TRUSTS ME- - ALMOST AS SURPRISED AS HE IS ABOUT IT . HOW IS ELRIC ? HE MUST NOT HAVE BEEN HAPPY ABOUT YOU COMING BACK . HE PASSED BEYOND JUST AFTER WE REACHED THE HIDING PLACE . OH , I 'M SORRY . I DIDN 'T KNOW THAT . WE DISAGREED ABOUT ... WE DISAGREED ABOUT ... WELL , ABOUT ALMOST EVERYTHING , REALLY . BUT HE WAS A GOOD MAN . HE TAUGHT YOU WELL . WHEN HE TOOK ME IN AFTER MY FATHER DIED , I SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE BEING AFRAID OF HIM BECAUSE HE WAS TALL AND POWERFUL , AND THAT VOICE ... AND THAT VOICE ... AND BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID THAT I MIGHT LOSE HIM , TOO , JUST AS I 'D LOST MY FATHER . I SOMETIMES WONDER WHAT EITHER OF THEM WOULD THINK ABOUT THE WAY THINGS HAVE TURNED OUT . I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY PROUD OF YOU . YOU 'VE BECOME YOUR OWN MAN , YOU MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS , SPEAK YOUR OWN MIND . THERE IS MUCH OF YOUR FATHER IN YOU , ALTHOUGH YOU WILL GO BEYOND HIM , I THINK , WHICH IS WHAT HE WOULD WANT . IT IS WHAT ALL FATHERS WANT FOR THEIR SONS , IS IT NOT ? IT IS WHAT ALL FATHERS WANT FOR THEIR SONS , IS IT NOT ? SPEAKING OF MAKING DECISIONS , SINCE YOU ARE HERE , YOU COULD HELP ME WITH ALL THIS . THESE PEOPLE ARE GOOD PEOPLE- - RASH , UNPREDICTABLE , ANNOYING AT TIMES- - BUT SURPRISINGLY DECENT . THEY WOULD GIVE YOU A HOME . YOU WOULDN 'T HAVE TO GO WANDERING THROUGH SPACE ANYMORE . YOU COULD STAY ON HERE AFTER I HAVE GONE AND HELP GUIDE THEM . I GO MY OWN WAY , ALWYN . I ALWAYS HAVE . I CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OTHERS . GALEN , THERE 'S BEEN A PROBLEM . WHAT 'S HAPPENED ? A DOZEN OR SO WORKERS AT THE MINING OPERATION HAVE BEEN TAKEN HOSTAGE . THEY 'RE SAYING UNLESS THE SHIPS LEAVE AND THE MINING STOPS , THE HOSTAGES WILL BE KILLED . AND THE MINING STOPS , THE HOSTAGES WILL BE KILLED . JUST LIKE I TOLD CAPTAIN GIDEON , YOU CAN 'T TRUST THESE PEOPLE . NO , SIR . WE 'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT ONCE AND FOR ALL . GOOD . A MESSAGE NEEDS TO BE SENT , AND IT 'S TIME THAT WE SENT IT . TELL YOUR ATTACK SQUAD THEY 'RE CLEAR TO PROCEED . AYE , AYE , SIR . YOU 'LL BE GOING WITH THEM . SIR ? NEED A COMMAND PRESENCE DOWN THERE , LIEUTENANT . IT 'S GOOD FOR THE MEN TO SEE . BESIDES , AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL , THEY HAVE NO HEAVY WEAPONRY . IT 'LL BE A SKEET SHOOT . OH , YES , OF COURSE . BUT I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU WOULD PREFER TO GO YOURSELF . AND HORN IN ON YOUR ACTION ? NOT A CHANCE . PROMOTION ONLY COMES FROM COMBAT EXPERIENCE , LIEUTENANT , AND IT 'S TIME THAT YOU GOT SOME . I 'LL SEE YOU WHEN THE DUST CLEARS . GOOD HUNTING . I 'LL SEE YOU WHEN THE DUST CLEARS . GOOD HUNTING . Soldier : LIEUTENANT ? Soldier : LIEUTENANT ? LIEUTENANT ? ! IT 'S A HOLOGRAM . GOT TO BE . HAVEN 'T HAD ANY DAMAGE YET FROM THIS THING . KEEP ON GOING . KEEP ON GOING . LIKE I SAID , JUST SMOKE AND MIRRORS . LIKE I SAID , JUST SMOKE AND MIRRORS . CONTINUE ON TO THE TARGET . CONTINUE ON TO THE TARGET . ALWYN , LISTEN TO ME . THIS ISN 'T A CLEAN FIGHT ANYMORE . YOUR PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN HOSTAGES . YOU KNOW THAT 'S WRONG . I TOLD YOU IF THEY COME WITH GUNS AND SHIPS , I WILL STOP THEM . IF YOU PROTECT THESE PEOPLE , YOU 'RE AN ACCOMPLICE . IF ANYONE GETS KILLED , THIS WHOLE SITUATION ESCALATES BEYOND THE CONTROL OF YOU OR ME OR ANYBODY ELSE . NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO PULL IT BACK FROM THE EDGE . IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT ? FROM THE EDGE . IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT ? IS IT ? IS IT ? [ PEOPLE ARGUING ] [ PEOPLE ARGUING ] [ DOOR OPENS ] ALL RIGHT , EVERYONE MOVE IT ! UP AGAINST THE WALL ! NOW ! YOU ! GET DOWN ! HEY , JUST DON 'T- - I SAID GET DOWN NOW ! NO ! LEAVE HIM ALONE ! Meyers : GET HER AWAY FROM HERE . Meyers : GET HER AWAY FROM HERE . DON 'T TOUCH HER ! Meyers : ANY WEAPONS ? NO , SIR . ALL RIGHT , PEOPLE . YOU AND I ARE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE TALK , AND YOU ARE GONNA TELL ME WHERE YOU 'RE HOLDING MY PEOPLE , AND MAYBE I 'LL LET YOU GO , AND MAYBE I WON 'T , DEPENDING ON HOW FAST I GET SOME ANSWERS . DEPENDING ON HOW FAST I GET SOME ANSWERS . ALWYN . ALWYN . LEAVE THEM ALONE . GET OUT OF THE WAY , OLD MAN . DON 'T MESS WITH THINGS YOU DON 'T UNDERSTAND . DON 'T MESS WITH THINGS YOU DON 'T UNDERSTAND . THAT 'S FUNNY . WE WERE ABOUT TO TELL YOU THE SAME THING . WE WERE ABOUT TO TELL YOU THE SAME THING . JUST MORE TRICKS ... HOLOGRAMS . THEY CAN 'T HURT YOU . AAH ! AAH ! NICELY DONE . YOUR OWN DESIGN ? THEY 'RE HOLODEMONS . THEY 'RE HOLODEMONS . I MADE A FEW MODIFICATIONS TO THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM . POPPED IN A FEW SYNTHETICS INTO THE BASIC DESIGN . POPPED IN A FEW SYNTHETICS INTO THE BASIC DESIGN . THEY DON 'T LAST FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR , BUT THEN , GENERALLY SPEAKING , YOU DON 'T NEED THEM FOR MORE THAN THAT . NO , THAT 'S USUALLY SUFFICIENT . NO , THAT 'S USUALLY SUFFICIENT . THE TEETH ARE A VERY NICE TOUCH . DO YOU THINK SO ? NOT TOO BIG ? NO , I THINK THEY 'RE JUST ABOUT RIGHT . NO , I THINK THEY 'RE JUST ABOUT RIGHT . YES , I SUPPOSE YOU 'RE RIGHT . YES , I SUPPOSE YOU 'RE RIGHT . SIR , I 'VE GOT LIEUTENANT MEYERS ON THE LINE . VERY GOOD . PUT HIM THROUGH . VERY GOOD . PUT HIM THROUGH . SO , LIEUTENANT , DO YOU HAVE THE HOSTAGES ? Meyers : NO , SIR . ACTUALLY , WE 'VE BEEN CAPTURED ALSO . ACTUALLY , WE 'VE BEEN CAPTURED ALSO . Barkeep : WELL DONE , ALWYN . Alwyn : THANK YOU . AND NOBODY KILLED , I WILL POINT OUT . BASHED , BEATEN , AND BIT , BUT STILL ALIVE . AN ADMIRABLE RESTRAINT ON MY PART , I FEEL . I TOLD THE OTHERS WE COULD COUNT ON YOU WHEN IT ALL STARTED TO COME DOWN , AND NOW- - NOW WE WILL RELEASE THE PRISONERS AND THE HOSTAGES AS A SHOW OF GOOD FAITH . ALWYN , THESE ARE THE ONLY BARGAINING TOOLS WE HAVE . YOU CAN 'T ASK US TO LET THEM GO , NOT NOW . WE CAN BEAT THEM , ALWYN . YOU CAN 'T HOPE TO WIN AGAINST A SUPERIOR FORCE LIKE THIS . SOONER OR LATER THEY WILL BEAT YOU . YOU HAVE TO BE REASONABLE . WE DON 'T HAVE TO BE REASONABLE , NOT AS LONG AS WE HAVE HIM . NOT AS LONG AS WE HAVE HIM . YOU ALL RIGHT ? NO . I DON 'T- - I DON 'T FEEL ... CLAIRE ? Galen : WHAT 'S WRONG WITH HER ? I DON 'T KNOW . SHE 'S BEEN PALE AND TIRED ALL WEEK AND GETTING WORSE . I WANTED TO BRING HER TO YOU , ALWYN , BUT WITH SO MUCH GOING ON , SHE DIDN 'T WANT TO BE A BOTHER . SHE DIDN 'T WANT TO BE A BOTHER . IT 'S MORE THAN A BOTHER . SHE IS DYING . SHE IS DYING . I 'VE DONE ALL I CAN . IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH . SHE NEEDS MORE THAN I CAN DO HERE . WHAT 'S WRONG WITH HER ? IT 'S THE ANTIVIRAL COMPOUND . THE MINING HAS SENT TONS OF IT INTO THE SKY AS DUST . THE WINDS BLOW IT ACROSS THE VILLAGE . YOUR HOUSE IS THE NEAREST TO THE MINE . SHE HAS GONE OUT INTO THE OPEN FAR OFTENER THAN YOU HAVE . SHE IS THEREFORE THE FIRST TO BE AFFECTED BY IT . AFFECTED BY WHAT ? IF WE 'VE BEEN DRINKING IT FOR YEARS , WHY IS IT A PROBLEM NOW ? YOU HAVE ALL GROWN UP INGESTING THIS COMPOUND AT A SLOW RATE . YOU 'VE ADAPTED YOURSELVES TO IT . INDEED , YOU CAN TAKE IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF IT ON A DAILY BASIS . HOWEVER , BECAUSE YOU ARE SATURATED WITH IT , THIS DUST CONSTITUTES AN OVERDOSE ... THIS DUST CONSTITUTES AN OVERDOSE ... A DEADLY ONE . WELL , THAT 'S IT , THEN . IF WE TELL CAPTAIN DANIELS THIS , HE 'LL HAVE TO STOP . YOU THINK HE WILL ? HE WILL SAY IT 'S A TRICK . HE WILL SAY THIS DISEASE HAS NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH THE MINING OPERATION . THEN LET ME TRY AND CONVINCE HIM . I 'LL HAVE DR. CHAMBERS DO A FULL WORKUP ON HER . IF WE CAN PROVE WHAT YOU SAY , HE 'LL HAVE TO LISTEN , AND MEDBAY HAS THE EQUIPMENT WE 'LL NEED TO SAVE HER . DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO . JUST SAVE HER . BUT ALWYN 'S RIGHT . THEY WON 'T LISTEN . WE 'VE GOT TO DO THINGS OUR WAY . A LIFE FOR A LIFE . OH , DON 'T BE A FOOL . OH , DON 'T BE A FOOL . [ SIGHS ] OH , DEAR . [ SIGHS ] OH , DEAR . THIS WAS SUCH A NICE QUIET PLANET . ALL RIGHT , I 'LL HAVE THEEXCALIBUR SEND DOWN A SHUTTLE . WE 'LL TAKE HER UP , SEE WHAT WE CAN DO . ALWYN , TALK TO YOUR PEOPLE . GET THEM TO CALM DOWN BEFORE THIS SITUATION UNRAVELS ANY FURTHER . YES , YES , I WILL , I WILL . ONE THING ... IF WE 'RE PLANNING TO APPEAL TO THE BETTER ANGELS OF THEIR NATURE ... TO THE BETTER ANGELS OF THEIR NATURE ... WE BETTER HAVE A BACKUP PLAN ... WE BETTER HAVE A BACKUP PLAN ... IN CASE REASON IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO THE CAUSE . TO THE CAUSE . I SHOULD GO WITH YOU . NO , THEY ARE MY PEOPLE . I WILL TALK WITH THEM . YOU WAIT HERE . YOU WAIT HERE . NO , NO , DON 'T GET UP . I MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO FORCE YOU BACK DOWN AGAIN ... HARD . TO FORCE YOU BACK DOWN AGAIN ... HARD . I HAVE LIVED AMONGST YOU FOR ALMOST 12 YEARS . I HAVE LIVED AMONGST YOU FOR ALMOST 12 YEARS . I 'VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY PROUD TO CALL YOU MY FRIENDS ... UNTIL NOW . NOW I AM ASHAMED . ALWYN- - I HAVE NOT FINISHED . I HAVE NOT FINISHED . THE TAKING OF HOSTAGES IS A WEAPON OF CHOICE FOR A COWARD AND THE CRIMINAL . WHICH ARE YOU ? WHICH ARE YOU ? THEY 'RE THE ONLY WEAPONS WE HAVE . THEY 'RE THE ONLY WEAPONS WE HAVE . WE WERE FOOLS TO LIVE LIKE THIS , TO THROW AWAY OUR GUNS , OUR MACHINES . WE COULD FIGHT . WE COULD BEAT THEM- - YOU WOULD LOSE . THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE YOU CHOSE THIS LIFE BECAUSE IT WAS BETTER THAN THE ONE THEY HAD , AND THEY WERE RIGHT . IF YOU CHOOSE THEIR WEAPONS ... IF YOU CHOOSE THEIR WEAPONS ... YOU WILL BECOME NO BETTER THAN THEY ARE . YOU CHOOSE THEIR TACTICS , AND YOU WILL LOSE YOUR WAY OF LIFE . EVERYTHING THAT MADE THIS A FINE AND DECENT PLACE IN WHICH TO LIVE , YOU WILL LOSE IT . WE WON 'T GIVE UP THE HOSTAGES . IF YOU TRY TO TAKE THEM FROM US BY FORCE- - FORCE ! FORCE ! I WOULD NOT USE FORCE AGAINST YOU . I WOULD NOT USE FORCE AGAINST YOU . I STILL HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF HONORABLE BEHAVIOR . I STILL HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF HONORABLE BEHAVIOR . SO ... YOU GIVE ME NO CHOICE , NO ROOM FOR MANEUVER . I MUST SETTLE THIS IN MY OWN WAY , AND YOU WILL ALL BEAR THE CONSEQUENCES . AND YOU WILL ALL BEAR THE CONSEQUENCES . Gideon : DR. CHAMBERS HAS JUST FINISHED HER PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE WOMAN 'S CONDITION . HER DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMS WHAT ALWYN SAID . IN A MATTER OF WEEKS , YOU COULD END UP KILLING EVERYONE WITHIN 20 MILES OF THE MINING OPERATION . CAPTAIN , THIS IS NO TIME FOR HYSTERICS . I 'D LIKE TO GET A SECOND OPINION . WE 'LL SEND HER OFF TO A MEDICAL FACILITY CLOSER TO HOME- - THAT COULD TAKE WEEKS . WE DON 'T HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME . YOU HAVE TO SHUT DOWN THE OPERATION AND MOVE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE DOWN THERE . THAT COULD COST US A HELL OF A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY . WE HAVE A PERFECTLY FINE OPERATION GOING HERE . WE 'RE NOT ABOUT TO CHANGE IT NOW . I ASSURE YOU , THIS WILL BE GONE INTO AT THE PROPER TIME ONCE THE CURRENT CRISIS HAS BEEN RESOLVED . SIR , I HAVE GALEN ON THE LINE . I 'LL GET BACK TO YOU , CAPTAIN . PUT HIM THROUGH . GALEN , WHAT 'S THE SITUATION ? NOT GOOD , MATTHEW . THERE 'S BEEN A MOST DISTURBING DEVELOPMENT . THERE 'S BEEN A MOST DISTURBING DEVELOPMENT . SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION , CAPTAIN , BUT WE 'VE JUST HAD SOME NEWS . AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW BY NOW , THERE 'S A TECHNOMAGE DOWN THERE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF WHAT 'S GOING ON . WE 'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM WHEN THE TIME COMES . YOU MAY NOT HAVE THAT CHANCE . LOOKS LIKE HE 'S PREPARING TO DEAL WITH YOU FIRST . I 'M SENDING YOU THE FEED ON ONE OF OUR PLANETARY SCANNERS . A TECHNOMAGE HAS ACCESS TO EXTREMELY POWERFUL FORCES . THAT MAKES THEM DANGEROUS ENOUGH TO BEGIN WITH , BUT NOW HE PLANS TO AMPLIFY THOSE FORCES A HUNDRED TIMES OVER . HE 'S TAKEN OVER THE MINE AND HAS EVACUATED ALL PERSONNEL . HE 'S GOING TO USE THE CURVATURE OF THE MINE THE SAME WAY YOU USE A SATELLITE DISH TO CONCENTRATE A SIGNAL . IT 'LL AMPLIFY THE FORCES THAT HE 'S CALLING UP BEYOND ANYTHING THAT WE 'VE SEEN SO FAR . WHAT CAN HE POSSIBLY DO FROM DOWN THERE ? HE CAN DESTROY YOUR SHIP , CAPTAIN . HE CAN SHOOT IT OUT OF THE SKY . I DON 'T BELIEVE IT . BELIEVE IT , CAPTAIN . LOOK AGAIN . BELIEVE IT , CAPTAIN . LOOK AGAIN . YOU HAVE TO STOP HIM . GIDEON , WE DON 'T HAVE THE FACILITIES TO KNOCK DOWN A PLANETARY TARGET IN TIME TO STOP HIM , BUT YOU DO . CAPTAIN- - DAMN IT , GIDEON ! DO YOU WANT THE BLOOD OF EVERY MAN AND WOMAN WHO DIES ABOARD THIS SHIP ON YOUR HANDS ? WHO DIES ABOARD THIS SHIP ON YOUR HANDS ? READY MAIN GUNS TO FIRE . READY MAIN GUNS TO FIRE . Officer : MAIN GUNS LOCKED ON , READY TO FIRE . Officer : MAIN GUNS LOCKED ON , READY TO FIRE . FIRE . FIRE . DR. CHAMBERS SAYS YOUR DAUGHTER 'S OUT OF CRITICAL . LAST I HEARD , SHE WAS DEMANDING A SHUTTLE OR THERE 'D BE HELL TO PAY . WELL , THAT 'S HER . SHE 'S A TIGER UNDER ALL THAT SILENCE . TAKES AFTER HER MOTHER THAT WAY , REST HER SOUL . NOW THAT THE MINING OPERATION IS BEING GLASSED OVER , THEY HAVE TO MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE . IT 'LL BE HARD WITHOUT COOPERATION , AND A LOT OF PEOPLE BACK HOME WILL DIE WITHOUT THE KIND OF HELP THAT THEY CAN GET HERE . WITHOUT THE KIND OF HELP THAT THEY CAN GET HERE . BUT I GUESS THAT 'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM . BUT I GUESS THAT 'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM . WE RELEASED THE HOSTAGES . THEY CAN TAKE THEM BACK ANYTIME . AND TELL THEM- - TELL THEM WE 'LL HELP THEM FIND ANOTHER LOCATION FOR THE MINING OPERATION- - SOMEPLACE SAFE . I 'M SURE CAPTAIN DANIELS WILL APPRECIATE THAT . HE 'S CERTAINLY BEEN IN A MORE CONCILIATORY MOOD SINCE HE REALIZED HE WOULD NEED YOUR HELP TO FIND ANOTHER LOCATION . TO FIND ANOTHER LOCATION . WELL , I SHOULD BE GOING . BEFORE ALWYN DIED , THE LAST LIVING THING HE SAID TO US ... THE LAST LIVING THING HE SAID TO US ... HE SAID HE WAS ASHAMED OF US , AND HE WAS RIGHT . SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING , MAKE THINGS RIGHT SOMEHOW ... SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING , MAKE THINGS RIGHT SOMEHOW ... HONOR HIS MEMORY . WELL , IT 'S A START . ME , I ALWAYS FIGURE IT 'S BETTER TO HONOR SOMEONE 'S OPINION WHILE THEY 'RE STILL ALIVE TO APPRECIATE IT AND YOU CAN STILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU 'VE GOT . WELL , WE DIDN 'T APPRECIATE HIM , NOT THE WAY WE SHOULD HAVE , AND HE WAS ALWAYS HERE FOR US . AND HE WAS ALWAYS HERE FOR US . WE DIDN 'T LISTEN ... WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE . WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE . NOW HE 'S GONE . I 'M SORRY . I 'M SORRY . YEAH . YEAH . Alwyn : IS IT ME , OR ARE THE MORNINGS GETTING COLDER ? OR ARE THE MORNINGS GETTING COLDER ? YOU CUT THAT ONE AWFULLY CLOSE . HA HA . OH , IT WASN 'T AS BAD AS IT LOOKED . YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW THAT WHEN WE REVOLVE , NOTHING IS AS IT SEEMS . SO ... SO ... WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW ? WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW ? MOVE ON , I SUPPOSE . MOVE ON , I SUPPOSE . IT WAS INEVITABLE . THE MINUTE I HEARD HIM SAY THAT THEY DIDN 'T NEED TO BE REASONABLE AS LONG AS I WAS AROUND , I KNEW THAT I 'D STAYED TOO LONG , ALLOWED THEM TO RELY ON ME TOO MUCH . IT IS TIME THEY CAME INTO THEIR OWN- - BEGAN MAKING THEIR OWN DECISIONS AND CREATING THEIR OWN MAGIC , LEARNING BY THEIR OWN MISTAKES . THAT GLASSED-OVER MONUMENT TO STUPIDITY I HOPE WILL BE A CONSTANT REMINDER OF THE LESSONS THEY HAVE LEARNED HERE TODAY . WON 'T IT BE HARD TO MOVE ON ? OH , YES . IT IS ALWAYS HARD TO MOVE ON . ON THE OTHER HAND , IN 10 OR 20 YEARS THIS WILL BECOME A LEGEND . SOME PEOPLE WON 'T EVEN BELIEVE THAT I EVER EXISTED . I DON 'T THINK I MIND THAT , NOT AT ALL , REALLY .

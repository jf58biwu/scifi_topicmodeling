 Come on . I 'm running out of time . Give me a field goal . - when talking to us yesterday about putting a unihorm on hor the last time . How much did you bet ? Enough , okay ? They run the option . Big hlips it to Warren ... - The ball is tipped . Fumble ! Fumble ! - No ! A rookie could have caught that pass . Take it easy , Jerry . It 's okay . Wendy , don 't tell me to take it easy . I 'll be right back . Don 't move . Looks like the home team lost . Yeah . That 's what I wanna talk to you about . You do a lot of talking , Jerry . It 's time to pay up . Look , let me just roll it over , okay ? I just need one more chance . I just need cash . You 're a smart guy . Take some of those VCRs you sell and peddle them . You know I 'm good for it , Hank , huh ? This will be the last time , I 'm telling you . - Pass the peanuts , please . - Sure . I 'll be right back . Were you talking to her ? - Actually , I was . - Jerry , he was just ... Wendy , shut up . Ease up , pal . She didn 't do anything . That right ? No ! He 's drunk ! - Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . - He just asked for peanuts . - Give me the keys . Come on . I 'll see you later , tough guy . I don 't wanna talk about it anymore . I don 't wanna go to the cabin . I hate that place . Well , I can 't afford the Hilton tonight . You could if you didn 't gamble all your money away , Jerry . Watch your mouth ! I can 't take this from you anymore , Jerry ! I can 't . Is that right ? Get back in this car ! Wendy Barton ! Wendy ! Wendy ! Oh , Jesus ! What did I do ? Why didn 't you stay in the car ? ! Look what you did ! I 'm sorry , Wendy . - I love you . - Oh , my God ! No ! Here 's a little something to sharpen the old gray matter . Be the hirst to call with the right answers and you could win primo concert seats . Let 's start with what team lost the World Series in 1948 . Boston Braves , four games to one . What was the hirst civilian settlement in the Bay area ? - Yerba Buena , 1776 . - And give three examples oh the highest horm oh matter in the universe . - Larry , Moe and Curly . - lh you think you know the answers ... Showtime . Hey ! Are you okay ? - Are you okay ? - Yes . Hey , hey . A month ago that bar in Cotati . Wendy , right ? Hey , I 'm sorry , I shouldn 't have been driving like that . It 's just that the road 's closed , and I didn 't expect to see anybody . Can we start over again here ? You want a ride or something ? All right . Let 's leave the lights on this time , okay ? Right . Look , maybe it 's none of my business but is there something wrong ? Do you need help ? No one can help me . At least let me walk you to the door . Wendy ? Hi . I 'm looking for Wendy . I just dropped her off . What are you talking about ? I picker her up in Marin and gave her a ride . You some kind of sicko ? Wendy 's dead ! She died five weeks ago ! Now get out of here ! - It 's on the second shelf from the top . - I 'll get it . Damn ! Everything okay ? Yeah , I just dropped my earring . Did you see that ? Look . Must have been installed when the house was built . You probably tripped some sort of switch . Who would have hidden a statue of Jesus Christ here ? And why ? Well , maybe this book will tell us . What is it , the New Testament ? No , it 's something else . - Though the words are in Latin . - Can you read it ? Well , with a little time . This statue 's peculiar . It 's crude , almost primitive . I don 't think it 's carved , I think it 's plaster . Look at this . There 's a notation on the inside dated March 3rd , 1834 . Now , loosely translated , it calls the statue an abomination . Christ , an abomination ? " A blasphemy against God and all that he stands for . " - No , that can 't be right . This is clearly a religious icon , Derek . It 's not blasphemy . No . Obviously my father was right . My Latin 's even worse than it used to be . I need to do some reading . So a statue of Christ , huh ? Derek said he found it behind the wall in the library . All we have to do is figure out who put it there . So , what 's up ? I went for a drive last night in the mountains . I go there sometimes just to sort of clear my head . There 's a road that 's closed , no one 's ever there . So last night , I 'm driving along and ... Wendy Barton . " Killed in a car crash June 5th on Crestline Highway . " The same road I picked her up on last night . - Are you sure it was her ? - I 'm positive . She barely said a word . Her parents live in a trailer park just out of town . I dropped her off there and then she just disappeared . Perhaps all she needed was to visit her parents before moving on . Could be a one-time event . I don 't know . She seemed so totally preoccupied . Do you wanna help her ? Find someone else besides her parents you can talk to . Did she live at home ? And if not , did she have any friends ? Maybe a roommate . There must be someone . Find them . This is it . Just drop me off here . Where you going so fast ? Who lives here ? - My roommate . - Sure you won 't reconsider that drink ? You can bring your roommate if you want . No . - It might loosen you up . Come on . - Don 't touch me . Hey , relax . I told you not to touch me ! Don 't touch ! What can I say ? She needed a place to stay and I needed someone to pay the rent . These are the last of her things . I was gonna give them to the police , but they said the case was closed . If you don 't want them , throw them away . - How well did you know her ? - Like I said , she paid half the rent . - Mostly kept to herself . - She talk about her parents ? Not really . I think she had it pretty tough at home . Blew me away when I found out that she was dead . - How about boyfriends ? - Just one . A real jerk . It was a little weird . - Wendy was a little weird , actually . - How 's that ? Just the way she let that creep treat her . One day he 's sending her roses and the next day she shows up with a black eye . He hit her , huh ? It sure looked that way to me . - Listen , I gotta get ready for work . - Well , thanks for your help . Yeah , thanks . More bills . Makeup . Trim in Twenty Minutes . - Video exercise . - Wait a minute . There 's tape on this recording tab . Let 's check it out . - Okay . - And one , switch sides . Four ... - Hey , baby , happy birthday ! - The boyfriend . Don 't stop jumping around on my account . You gotta keep that tight little bod in shape . - Charming . - I 've got a birthday surprise hor you . Two tickets to Vegas . First class all the way . I had to pull some strings , but ... I got some business when we get there , but it shouldn 't take long . So I want you to get ready . And I 'll get you a new video when we get back . In hact , I 'm gonna get you seven . One hor every day oh the week . But until then , I want you to take in some highlights hrom last weekend 's video . I think I 've seen enough . - big surprise hor you . You think you can pick anything up off those airline tickets ? I don 't think so . I might be able to pick something up on this jacket here . I 'll see what I can pull out . Okay . Well , I checked police records on the accident . It was inconclusive . There were no skid marks . Do you think it 's murder ? I don 't know , but I find it hard to believe that she killed herself . Lots of stress , a violent relationship . You can 't rule suicide out because you don 't like the boyfriend . But if he hit her , he could kill her . And if he killed her he 's probably skipped town or something . Or maybe hiding out someplace . And she 's searching for justice . So am I. Come on , Wendy , where are you ? I 've been driving all night ! I 'll take you anywhere you wanna go , I just wanna talk . Sausalito . Sausalito ? Why ? I wanna visit the only teacher that ever cared about me . Same way you visited your parents ? I don 't let them see me . Who did this to you ? - We were arguing . - Did he hit you ? - I don 't wanna talk about it . - First you can 't believe it happened . - And then you pretend that it didn 't . - Leave me alone . The only way to stop the pain is to stand up to it . - It 's my fault . - No . He 's the one who did it , not you . He 's the one who should be punished . - You shouldn 't have touched me . - Come on , I just wanna help you . - You gotta stop this ! - I can 't ! I 'm not the one who hurt you ! Please don 't ever come back for me , Nick . What 's his name ? I don 't want anybody else to get hurt . Please , don 't come back . Three deaths in the last four weeks . All male , all found dead outside their cars all returning from Marin County . So you think each one of these guys picked her up ? Sounds like a stretch . Not if each one was giving her a ride someplace she needed to go . Brian Cass ' body was found outside Wendy 's apartment building two days before we talked to her roommate . - You think that she killed him ? - Fits the pattern . They touched her . - Beg pardon ? - They touched her . See , the first time I saw her , I didn 't . But last night I did . So , what are you saying ? Any man who touches her is a surrogate for her abusive boyfriend ? Well , it could be . You find out anything new on him ? Mr. Jerry Tate . Real hustler . Sold video equipment till about a month ago . Landlord hasn 't seen him he 's behind on rent , and his phone 's been cut off . Looks like he blew Dodge after her death . Now , if we could prove that he did it do you think she 'd stop this ? The question is , where to begin ? Sam 's Bar in San Rafael . Where you going ? What happened ? The girl you picked up ? Don 't even get started . I know what I 'm doing . Really ? What ? Trying to join her ? She met the wrong guy , it cost her her life now she 's taking it out on anyone who touches her . The girl needs help . You sure you 're not just becoming obsessive about this ? The Legacy is built on passion . The defense , the protection of everything that is worth keeping . If that 's obsessive then that 's what I am . Go with him . He 's right over there . Hank Fiedel ? - Do I know you ? - No , but the bartender said you might be able to help us . - We 're looking for Jerry Tate . Sorry , I 'm not the Missing Persons Bureau . What are you guys , cops ? No , but I know a bookie when I see one . You wanna place a bet , fine . I 've got nothing else to offer . We 'd be willing to buy any information we need . Lady , do I look like some back-alley snitch ? - Bet or walk . - Bet . You win , I owe you 100 bucks . You lose , we get Jerry Tate . Right . - My coin , my toss . - As long as it hits the table . Right . Call it in the air . Heads . - Today 's your lucky day . - Tell me how lucky , Hank . The little weasel hasn 't been here in over a week . - A surprise , he practically lived here . - Know where we could find him ? He 's probably holed up in the cabin his family left him . Thinks I don 't know about it . The guy owes me a little money . I 'd have tracked him down myself if it was worth the effort . It 's not . Here 's the directions . Say hello to him for me . And come back any time , kid . I like your technique . You have a unique way of getting information . - Fifty-fifty odds . I 've had worse . - What if you lost ? Then I 'd have to borrow about 80 bucks from you and we wouldn 't have this . - Is that necessary ? - Maybe . Oh , God . Nobody told this guy about air freshener . - Good morning . - Morning . Hey , Derek . Still at it , huh ? - The Belgian House . - Beg pardon ? The statue . It came from the Belgian House . Transported here in 1835 shortly after the house turned . Turned to the dark side ? Yeah , with The Legacy , there 's always a risk . Temptation can be overwhelming . Well , that 's exactly what happened to Salvador Reneau . Who ? Salvador Reneau . The precept of the Belgian House . He had the Sight . He was totally obsessed with defeating evil . - Yet it still flourished . - Ego run amuck . That which one cannot defeat one begins to believe in . More than that , he began to see himself as the messiah sent by evil to destroy all who wouldn 't heed its word . I bet he had a lot of followers . There 's always people who will believe whatever they wanna believe . Oh , yes . Reneau was a charismatic . The members of the Belgian House became his disciples . They actually wrote a kind of unholy Bible . - This ? - Yes . - So , what happened to him ? - He was crucified by his own followers . The irony was that it was actually Reneau himself who encouraged them . - Of course . In order to prove himself the Antichrist he would have to do everything that Christ himself had done . Exactly . When he wasn 't resurrected they went on a rampage , burned the house down and only the statue survived . What I don 't understand is ... Okay , if Reneau was the abomination then why was this statue saved ? So Tate made this video just before he offed himself . We made a copy of it and then called the cops . Be prepared . It gets ugly . Lihe 's a gamble . You step out in the street , you get smacked by a bus . You grab a burger and some wacko who just got hired blows you away . You go into a club you meet the girl oh your dreams . So you play the game . You hollow the rules . Sometimes you win sometimes you lose . I can 't stop playing the game . I love the way it makes me heel . The rush . Makes me heel alive . Even when I wanna be dead . I love her . I really do love her . And I can 't stand the thought oh being without her . Even though I killed her . I wanna be with you , baby , I promise you . I 'm never gonna let you go . Nothing 's ever gonna come between us . What a sick son of a bitch . It 's no wonder Wendy can 't rest . That 's it . It isn 't Wendy who 's killing people , it 's him . But she was the only one I saw there . Well , perhaps he doesn 't wanna be seen . No , he 's killed himself to pursue her , to possess her and now he 's killing anyone who attempts to comes near . So whenever anyone tries to touch her , he goes ballistic . Find her , you find him . The question is how to stop him . By convincing her to break the cycle of abuse . Otherwise , she 'll be in his grip forever . Damn it . Where is she ? You can 't just will her to appear . Okay , let 's take another run down the road . We 've driven it a dozen times . Maybe they both just passed on now that the truth is out . Come on , you don 't really believe that . It couldn 't be that easy . Look , take the car back , pick me up in the morning . That 's crazy . Listen , Nick , no matter what we do there 's no way to know for certain if Wendy will ever show herself again . - Why can 't you just let it go ? - Because the last time I saw her I saw what he did to her . I could see it in her eyes . Death was supposed to release her from her suffering but Jerry won 't let her go . And as long as he doesn 't , neither will I. How noble . I 'm really touched . Aren 't you ? You 've caused enough suffering , Jerry . - The night is still young . - No more , please . - He 's just trying to help . - Who asked him to ? - You ? - No . I 'm yours forever . Why are you doing this ? For you . I 'm doing this for you . Hey , maybe tomorrow night . Whatever it takes . Hey , Alex . Thanks . Sounds crazy , but I know this isn 't over . - Get some sleep . - Good night . Put those down . That hurt ? Go ahead . Scream all you want . What else you got ? You having problems breathing ? Oh , good , you 're still with us . I was afraid we 'd lost you too soon . No , Jerry . What 's the matter , you don 't want me to hurt your little boyfriend ? Why are you doing this ? Look at him , Wendy . He wants you . He 's got his hands all over your pictures . But I told you , he doesn 't mean anything to me . No , Wendy . He 's right . I do care about you . See , nobody should have to die at the hands of some pig ... - Shut up ! ... who 's so nuts that he offs himself to keep on torturing the person he killed ! - I love her . - You got a funny way of showing it . Stop ! Can 't you see what you 're doing ? Absolutely . I 'm trying to help you break free . You just don 't know when to stop , do you ? No . What 's it gonna take ? What 's it gonna take for you to leave her alone , Jerry ? You 're a gambling man , aren 't you ? How about a small wager ? - What are you gonna do , shoot me ? - No . Thought I 'd give you another shot at yourself . Same game different stakes . If I lose you can do whatever you want . - And if I lose ? - Then you let Wendy go forever . - No way , I can 't do that . - What 's the matter , stakes too high ? - She 's all I got . - That 's right . - You 're nothing without her , are you ? - Shut up . Make me . All right . You 're on . No . No , this isn 't right . You can 't do this . Wendy what are you gonna do about this ? Wendy , the only power he has over you is what you 've given him . Shut up . I go first . Be my guest . Your turn . Wendy when you died maybe you thought nobody cared . You were wrong . Four to one odds . That 's not so bad . Odds are getting tougher . Three to one . Wendy , you can stop this . Just do what you gotta do . Fifty-fifty to the high roller . I gotcha . I guess I 'll see you in hell , tough guy . So why do you do it to her ? If I 'm gonna decorate this room with the contents of my head I wanna know why . Because I love her . And she loves me . Is that right ? Do you really love the way he hurts you ? Enough with the questions . Just ... Just say goodbye . No ! Never ! Never again ! This is exactly where it stops . Right here , right now . What are you doing , Wendy ? What I should have done a long time ago . Let me go . Bitch ! Wendy ! What are you doing , Wendy ? Wendy . Let me go , Wendy . Bitch ! Wendy ! It 's okay . You 're free . - Thanks . - For what ? You saved yourself . Your courage gave me the strength . Take care . You too . Russian roulette with a ghost . Are you out of your mind ? - It 's not what you think . - Really ? You 're willing to waste your whole life for somebody who 's already dead . - Does this sound sane to you ? - I had to make her take action . What if you shot yourself in the bargain ? Well , that would have been bad . Watch . Have a look . - It was always empty . - What , am I crazy ? I had to make her stand up for herself . What would you have done if she hadn 't ? Come up with a plan B in short order . Madness . Absolute madness . The answer was in the notation all along . This statue truly is an abomination , a sacrilege . A blasphemy ! It 's Salvador Reneau . I misread it . It wasn 't " this creation of man . " It was simply , " This man is a blasphemy against God and all that he stands for . Not fit for human eyes . " But how ? After he died , his disciples built this statue around his corpse and , still convinced that he was a messiah of evil worshiped it . - Okay . But who put him here ? And why ? I don 't know who . But whoever it was did it as a warning : Do not forget the mistakes of the past or you 'll be cursed to repeat them .

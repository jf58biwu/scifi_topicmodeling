 Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi ( woman ) We 're almost there . - How you doin ' , hon ? - ( groans ) Breathe deeply . Just like that . There ya go . You 're doin ' great . Yeah , real great . IVla 'am ? IVla 'am , I 'll need your full name and Social Security number . Amanda Nelligan _ 545020809 . - And your insurance carrier ? - Atlantic Mutual . Is there anyone you need us to contact ? The father of the baby ? - I 'm not sure how to reach him . - Give me his name . I can try . He 's not from around here . - Is he from out of state ? - Another planet . All right , we 're here now . Hold on . One more little push , Amanda . There you go . You 're gonna set a speed record here . Great . There 's a cute face . Bulb syringe . This is like the Indy 500 here . Here comes the shoulder ... Good . OK , Amanda . That 'll do it ! - Oh ... - ( gasps ) Oh , God . - What ? What is it ? - it 's OK . She 's just fine . - ( baby crying ) - Perfectly healthy . No problem . Everything 's gonna be A-OK . - You 've got a healthy baby girl . - ( baby crying ) ( Amanda ) A little girl ! ( Crying ) Good Lord . Not another one ! The photo 's a little over the top , but , um , what do you think , Scully ? - Not seriously . - Vestigial tails don 't interest you ? Caudal appendages . Fetuses have them . The coccyx enlarges to contain the spinal fluid , then shrinks as the child develops . Occasionally , it doesn 't . It 's extremely rare but it has been known to happen . Five times in the last three months ? In a town with a population of less than 15,000 people ? I 'd say that 's more than a statistical anomaly . So would I. No , Mulder , I think you 're right . I think that something about this warrants investigation . Only not by us . I 'd say that it 's a job for the local health department . I called around . They 're already investigating . So what else about this interests you ? Could it be ... visitors from space ? The doctor said that ... _ .my baby 's gonna be fine . She 's really healthy . And when she 's a few months old , it 's just a matter of " snip " . - That 's good to hear . - Yeah . Did you experience any unusual complications during your pregnancy ? Did you undergo any kind of fertility treatment ? No . I wasn 't trying to get pregnant . I guess you could just sort of say I 'm a single mom now . When you were admitted , you said that the baby 's father was from another planet . - What did you mean by that exactly ? - You know , that ... he 's not from this planet . - Were you abducted ? - Huh ? ( chuckles ) No . No . He dropped by my apartment one day , .. _ _ .and one thing sort of led to another . But the baby 's father is an alien . No ! No , I didn 't say he was an alien . I said he was from another planet . His name is Luke Skywalker . He 's what 's known as a Jedi Knight . - Did he have a light sabre ? - No , he didn 't bring it . He did sing his song for me , though . ( hums " Star Wars " theme ) How many times have you seen Star Wars ? Three hundred and sixty-eight . I should break 400 by Memorial Day . OK . Thank you . Wait a minute , wait ! You know these four other babies that were born around here with tails ? - Uh-huh . - There couldn 't be any chance ... .. Luke 's the father , is there ? ( babies crying ) ( Scully ) OK . All right . I got it . Thank you . Take your best shot , but I think there 's more going on here than Luke Skyvvalker _ I think you 're right , Mulder . Are you coming ? Here are the PCRS we ran for the five children . We put calls in to the parents . We 'll blood-test all the husbands this afternoon . - Good . - They 'll be none too happy . I have to confess , this answer seems so strangely obvious , ... _ .I probably wouldn 't have even checked for it . What answer ? You see here , these identical band-trait matches , _ _ . _ .all showing a small loss of a part of chromosome number eight ? Each of these five children , born to five different women , all share the same father . I should 've thought of it sooner . This kind of birth defect is often passed on in a family . Meaning the father had a tail as well ? Though he most likely had it surgically removed along the way . How would this happen ? Birds and bees and monkey babies . Birds do it , bees do it , even educated IVIDs do it . All five of these women shared the same ob-gyn , didn 't they ? Yeah . He 's the only one in town . Four of the five women , the married women , not including Amanda Nelligan , ... _ .are on record as receiving insemination therapy as a means of conception . The doctor might have something to do with it ? So much for not putting all your eggs in one basket . ( woman ) We should find the best lawyer . I plan to sue . That 's all I 'm saying , Fred . ( Fred ) Babboo , let me do the talking . I 'll handle this . Just tell him we 're gonna sue . Oh , you too , huh ? - ( Fred ) What the hell did you do ? - What did you do ? I didn 't do anything . We 're gonna figure this out . Look , everybody , just relax . Don 't you tell me to relax ! What the hell happened to my sperm ? - Ivline too ! - Whose did you use ? It 's bad enough having a boy with a tail . Then you find out it 's not even yours ! ( Fred ) For God 's sake , Alton , how many of us are there ? I 'm Special Agent Mulder with the FBI . This is Agent Scully . - Great ! Arrest this son of a bitch . - Settle down . Nobody 's gonna be arrested . - We 're here to find out what 's goin ' on . - Alton didn 't use my sperm . I most certainly did . Each of you women was inseminated with your husband 's own sperm . Why was it necessary to inseminate in these cases ? It was a sperm-motility issue . The intrauterine process I used ... _ .has about a 40 per cent chance of success . I was surprised . It seemed to work all four times . - The only thing I can think of is ... - ( Fred ) What ? - Maybe it never worked at all . - What are you saying , Alton ? I wanna know what he means by that . I haven 't been with a man since 1989 . I mean , not counting you , honey . ( doctoo I 'm not accusing anyone of anything . I 'm just saying , ... _ .my latest patient who gave birth to a baby with a tail ? She didn 't undergo insemination . So you are blaming the wrong baby doctor . Hey . Hey . Excuse me . I 'm an agent with the FBI . I 'd like to ask you a few questions . Uh ... Yeah , OK . Scully , check it out . ( mother ) Oh , my God . ( mother ) That 's him ? He 's the one ? ( Scully ) Five out of five . They spelled my name wrong . it 's Van Blundht , with a silent h . - B-I-u-n-cl-h-t . - ( Mulder ) We 'll get right on that . Lots of people spell it wrong . it 's , like , Dutch or somethin ' _ - Can I go now ? - No . There 's a few things we have to clear up . Yeah . Like how 'd you do it ? What do you mean ? You 're the father of five children , Mr Van Blundht . Is that not news to you ? Do you have any insight into how five women came to be inseminated with your sperm ? You make it sound so romantic . You 're saying there was romance involved ? Why is that so hard to believe ? Just cos I was born with a tail , no woman would want me ? Maybe I got personality . You ever think of that ? You had sex with these women ? How is it that none of them have any recollection whatsoever of that happening ? Look , I 'm not saying anything one way or another . I 'm just saying hypothetically , _ _ . _ .if some women wanted to have kids and their husbands weren 't capable , _ _ _ _ .and everybody was happy , and nobody got hurt , hypothetically , where 's the crime ? If you 're waitin ' for my usual theory as to what 's goin ' on , I don 't have one . I do . On behalf of all the women in the world , ... _ .I seriously doubt this has anything to do with consensual sex . I think it involved some form of Rohypnol-rape . - The tranquilliser ? I didn 't think of that . - The " date rape " drug . High doses of it cause a loosening of inhibitions , memory loss . If Van Blunclht was able to slip the drug to these women , .. _ _ .especially in conjunction with alcohol ... But when and where would he have had the opportunity ? He identified these women through his janitorial job . He could 've followed them anywhere , to a bar . Those women don 't look like the type to do a lot of solo drinking . I think it 's enough to keep him in custody while we check it out . Uh , you spelled my name wrong . Lt 'S B-I-u-n-d-h-L Silent h . Address ? I strongly suggest you stop eyeballin ' me and tell me your address . 17 Prospect Parkway . Martinsburg , 25401 . All right , Mr Van Blund-ht . Give me your phone number . What the hell _ _ . ? The h is silent . I could 've sworn Curtis clocked out hours ago . He said good night to me . This morning I find him underneath the desk . Deputy , are you sure you don 't remember what happened last night ? The guy cold-cocked me . Except he wasn 't the guy . He was me . My head hurts . I found Van Blundht 's clothes in a locker . He must 've worn the deputy 's spare uniform . After hitting him over the head . I have a theory . Do you wanna hear it ? Van Blundht physically transformed into his captor , then walked out the door ? Should we be pickin ' out china patterns or what ? What about the simple answer ? With that blow to the head , _ .. _ .the deputy might as well have identified IVIcGruff the Crime Dog . - What about what the sheriff saw ? - Two men , same build , same colouring . Add the uniform , it explains now someone can mistake one man for another at 3am _ My theory explains how four women could mistake Van Blundht for their husbands , ... _ .and how Amanda Nelligan could think it was Luke Skywalker . We 've both seen something like this before . But what are you saying ? That Van Blundht is an alien ? Not unless they have trailer parks in space . No , this is something different . If you could be somebody else for a day , who would it be ? Hopefully myself . So boring . Wouldn 't you even be tempted to try somebody else 's existence for a day ? Live your life as somebody else ? Looking like someone else and being someone else are different things . Everybody else would treat you like you were somebody else . Maybe it 's other people 's reactions to us that make us who we are . All right , then . Eleanor Roosevelt . - You can 't be a dead person . - Why the hell not ? BSCHUSS . What are you doin sneakin ' around my porch ? We 're with the FBI . Is this the home of Edward Van Blundht ? - That 's me . - We 're looking for your son , Eddie Junior . Eddie ? What did that moron do now ? ( Mr Van Blundht ) Five women ? Oh , Lord ! Anything else ? Yes . He attacked a sheriff 's deputy during his escape from custody . - Hurt bad ? - Fortunately not . Well , thank heavens for that at least . Sir , do you have any idea where your son might be ? I wish I did . I 'm sorry . I haven 't seen him for the last two days . Is this you ? One and the same . Hey , you wanna see ? No ! No . No , thank you . My son had his removed when he was , uh ... just a kid . Kept buggin ' me and buggin ' me ... until ... _ .until I finally let him do it . There you go . I told him it was a mistake . I said " Son , you ain 't much to look at , you ain 't no athlete ... _ .and you sure the hell ain 't no Einstein , but at least you got that tail . " " Otherwise , you 're just small potatoes . " But he didn 't listen . Does your son have any other unique medical conditions ? I mean , aside from the tail ? Mr Mulder , that boy was born sickly . We had this condition in the South called pellagra Excuse me , sir , how did you know my name was Mulder ? - She told me it was . - No , actually , I didn 't . It 's him ! Pretty spry for an old guy , huh ? Eddie Junior , not Senior ? Whichever one he is , wouldn 't you say he 's a man with a secret ? Honey , what are you doing home so early ? Something 's wrong with Daddy . Fred ? Honey ? Fred , is everything OK ? Everything 's fine . What happened to the clothes you were wearing this morning ? I 'll explain later . Just give me a little privacy , OK , ... HuhH _ Babboo ? OK . Sugar Patootie . I 'll check upstairs . - I 'm all right . - ( Scully ) What ? ( sighs ) Oh ! ( spits ) It 's quicklime . Move back over there . ( Mulder ) Not so spry . Do you think the fall killed him ? ( Fred ) Babboo , I 'm home . - Oh , crap ! - I 'm home early . What ? You were just here . - You went into the bathroom . - What ? What do you mean , I went into the bathroom ? Shh , come here . ( Fred ) Someone is in the bathroom . ( Babboo whimpers ) it 's all clear . ( saw buzzing ) So , what killed Eddie the Monkey IVlan ? It 's difficult to say . The quicklime burned the tissue even as it preserved it . So , what killed him is one of two things I haven 't figured out yet . - What 's the other thing ? - That would be this . Striated muscle tissue . - Whats unusual about that ? - In and of itself , nothing . - Where I found it , however ... - Where did you find it ? Everywhere . His entire body . This man has a thin stratum of voluntary muscle tissue ... _ .underpinning the entire dermal layer of his skin . That 's not normal . This man 's body is quite a scientific specimen . And thankfully , it 's preserved and intact . In other words , there are 654 muscles in the human body , .. _ _ .and this man , essentially , has 655 . Um ... Could that somehow be related to his having a tail ? Possibly . It could be a linked gene birth defect . What would be the purpose of this muscle ? You got me , Mulder . You know , maybe none . It appears atrophied . Although it may look that way as a result of the mummification _ Could this be a " like father , like son " kind of a thing ? - What do you mean ? - Could Eddie Junior have ... _ .the same anomalous muscular structure as his dad here ? Maybe . What are you suggesting ? If this musculature underlies the entire skin , _ _ _ _ .maybe it could be utilised to remould the skin 's shape and texture . Which might explain why we 're looking for a man who can appear to be his own father . Isn 't it much more likely that this man simply has an identical twin ? - Check that out . - Where are you going ? Van Blundht 's MO confuses me . Four married women who wanted to get pregnant ... And one single woman who didn 't . - ( knocking on door ) - Come in . Sorry , Ms Nelligan _ I 'm sorry to bother you . No , it 's no bother . I just have a few additional questions I wanted to ask you . - OK . - Here we go , sweetie . Bye-bye . We 'll just come back later . I thought they were Iettin ' me stay here so long because I had really great insurance . Turns out they 're just keepin ' me here because they think I 'm sort of crazy . They wanna make sure I 'm safe to be around my baby . Free cable . I wanna ask you , do you recognise this man ? Oh , yes . Eew ! That 's Eddie Van Blundht - What can you tell me about him ? - ( sighs ) We went out all through high school . - OK , brother . - What ? Nothing . He 's just ... he 's sort of a loser . One of those guys you look back on and you go ... .. " Oh , my God , what was I thinkin ' ? Whatwas I thinkin ' ? " Well , what specifically made him a loser ? I don 't know . Everything . He had , like , one million annoying personal habits . You know , just no sense of romance , _ .. _ .no ambition , you know , no direction . I hear he 's , like , a janitor or somethin ' now . He had this weird family . His dad was in a circus or somethin ' . I don 't know . He never let me meet him , thank God . Well ... he must have had some good qualities . Well , yeah , sure . Everybody 's got a few . We had some good times . He loved Star Wars so we used to go and see it every weekend . That was nice . He was no Luke , that 's for sure . Why do you wanna know about Eddie ? That 's official FBI business . Wow . Hey , uh ... I wanted to congratulate you on this blessed event . Thank you ! - " May the force be with you . " - ( groans ) ( nurse ) Hello there . - I 'm here to see Amanda Nelligan _ - Just down the hall there . - ( knocking on door ) - Come in . No , seriously , though , why do you wanna know about Eddie ? - What about Eddie ? - Why were you asking me those questions ? ( cell phone ringing ) - Mulder . - This is Fred Niemann . Is it OK for us to get into our bathroom now ? Excuse me , sir ? I was hoping we could get into our bathroom this evening . You said the police were gonna dust it for Hngerprints , but that was four hours ago . We wanna help you catch this guy but I 'm having a real hard time here . How exactly do you wind up chasing the suspect into my bathroom ? - Don 't forget the suit . - What do you need with my charcoal suit ? I 'm sorry , Mr Niemann . I 'm gonna have to call you back . I was just here . Where did I go ? Huh ? There was a man . He looked exactly like me . Did you see where he went ? Down the hall . - Men 's locker room . - Thank you . - Hey . - Hey . - Van Blundht . - Who ? Don 't think about it . Get your hands up . Turn around . Keep ' em up there . Put your hands down now . If it 's not you , I apologise in advance . What are you doing ? - Pull your pants up . - ( whistling ) what ? what did I do now ? - You 're the only ones here ? - Yeah . I apologise . Only one of you is the man I 'm looking for . I hope . I gotta wait for some blood tests and then I 'll release the other one . So just sit tight and relax . Keep your clothes on , huh ? ( dialling cellphone ) - Scully . - Hey , it 's me . Get down to the hospital right away . - I 'm on my way . - Good . ( clunking sound ) You 're a damn good-looking man . ( security ofHceU You drew a gun on me . You handcuffed me ! With my own handcuffs . ( Mulder ) I 'm sorry . I don 't understand . Do we look like criminals ? - What was on your mind ? - I said I was sorry . - Am I done here ? - Yeah . We got his description . - Come on , guys . - What the hell happened ? Van Blundht surprised me . He cold-cocked me and then he got away . Got a lead on him ? No , but the authorities are on the warpath ... _ .for goin ' after one of their own . They 'll catch him eventually . So , what ? That 's it for us ? I know I dragged you out here , but I 'm beginning to think this is just a waste of time . Now you think there 's no X-File here ? No . No . I think the only thing that 's here is small potatoes . Hello ? Hello ! Get me outta here ! Hello ! Hello ! I 'm down here ! Help ! Help ! Which one of you wrote this ? I did , Sir . You spelled Federal Bureau of Investigation wrong . It was a typo . Twice . Agent Scully , did you establish a cause of death ? Yes , sir . Edward Van Blundht Senior died of natural causes . Specifically heart disease and advanced age . We think the son hid the father ... _ .so he could continue to cash in on the old man 's Social Security cheques . - Most likely . - So , the son wasn 't a murderer . - No , not at all . - But he was a rapist . I entered him into the sex offenders ' database . The West Virginia State Police have a photo and will coordinate with local authorities . There should be an arrest soon . That about wraps it up . So , Scully , what are you doin ' tonight ? Any big plans ? As it 's Friday , I was thinking I could get some work in ... _ .on that monograph I 'm writing for the penology review . Diminished acetylcholine production in recidivist offenders . Uh-huh . - Actually , I might bag that , though . - Really ? Yeah . The anomalous musoulature in the corpse we found really has me intrigued . In fact , I think I 'll go to Quantico and have some tissue samples run . I 'll see you Monday . Monday morning . IIFOXII ? Brother ! Good night ! This is where my tax dollars go ? Where do I live ? Where the hell do I sleep ? ( answer machine beeps ) Mulder ? Langly . You gotta see this . An associate of ours has Hgured out a way to digitise the Zabruder footage ... _ .so he can get a bird 's-eye view of Dealey Plaza at the moment of the assassination . You won 't believe where the 3rd shot came from . ( Frohike ) Tell him about the cheese steaks . ( Langly ) We 're goin ' out for cheese steaks . Are you down with that ? - Erase this once you hear it . - ( machine beeps ) Geeks for friends . Marty it 's Chantal . it 's been so long since we 've spoken . And I 've been so lonely not hearing your sexy voice . Just for you , we 've lowered our rates to 40 cents a minute , ... _ .two ninety-nine for the first minute , all long-distance rates apply . Do give me a call , lover man . I 'll be waiting . ( machine beeps ) FBI . F ... B ... I. FBI . You lookin ' at me ? There ain 't nobody else here . You must be lookin ' at me . You wanna piece of this ? You 're a damn good-lookin ' man . ( knocking on door ) - Mulder , what 's up ? - Scully ... Is this a bad time ? No . No , I 'm . _ _ Come on in . Who 's that for ? Uh ... us . OK , have a seat . So , uh , what are you workin ' on ? More autopsy data . Everyone at the lab found Mr Van Blundht pretty fascinating . We discovered an additional anomaly relating to the hair follicles in his scalp . I can 't even begin to guess at the nature of it until we can run it ... _ .through the transmission electron microscope . Sounds very interesting . Yes , it is . So , seriously , Mulder . What 's going on ? - You OK ? - Mmm . I was just kinda knockin ' around , _ .. _ .and was just thinkin ' _ _ _ ( coughs ) It 's good . We never really , uh , _ _ _ _ .talk much , do we ? What do you mean ? Like ... really talk ? No , no , we don 't , Mulder . Well , what 's stopping us ? So there we are , at two o 'clock in the morning , me in my taffeta dress ... _ .and Marcus in whatever the hell it was he was wearing ... Thank you very much . It had a kelly-green cummerbund on it . Anyway , so I know that Marcus is thinking that it 's now or never . - And I 'm thinking ... - What are you thinking ? I 'm thinking , what is that siren I hear getting louder ? - No way ! Who called the cops ? - It was the fire department . - My friend Sylvia and her idiot prom date ... - Burwood ? _ .had built this campfire that went out of control . And so we all had to ride back on the , uh ... What do you call it ? The , uh , the pumper truck . Yeah . Marcus was the 12th-grade love of my life . I can 't believe I 'm telling you this . I don 't believe you haven 't told me before . Now I 'm seeing a whole new side of you , Mulder . Is that a good thing ? I like it . - Do you ever wish things were different ? - What do you mean ? The person you wanted to be when you grew up , when you were in high school ? - How far off from that did you end up ? - Careervvise ? Miles off target . Not just that . Do you ever wish ... that you could go back and do it all differently ? Do you ? ( 93595 ) ( door buzzes ) Thanks for comin ' . What 's with the hat ? My therapist makes me wear it . She says it 's meant to bolster my self-esteem . Does it ? Not really . The other inmates beat me up and take it from me , _ _ _ _ .which would be OK except every week she brings me a new hat . Plus they Keep me on some Kind of muscle relaxant ... _ .so I can 't make faces the way I used to . Did you tell them to do that ? Is , uh ... is Agent Scully here ? What did you wanna talk to me about , Eddie ? I just think it 's funny . I was born a loser , but you 're one by choice . On what do you base that astute assessment ? Expedence . You should live a little . Treat yourself . God knows I would , if I were you . ( door buzzes ) Have a good day , sir . I don 't imagine you need to be told this , Mulder , but you 're not a loser . Yeah , but I 'm no Eddie Van Blundht , either , am I ? Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi

 Yamanashi Good morning , Yamanashi Yamanashi Good morning , Yamanashi Good Morning Yamanashi Good morning . There 's a seat over here , Fukuda . When is it going to be my turn ? This year 's cold is a real bugger to shake . Be careful you don 't develop any complications . This shot should do the trick ... but I 'll give you a week 's prescription just in case . Yes , sir . Next , please . Kawasaki-san ? Here . Thank you very much . You 're welcome . Take care . Hello . So , what 's wrong with you ? Well , I have a cold . Take care . I wonder if the shot will really help . Oh , Tanaka-san . All better now ? Well , I still have a fever but I don 't feel like staying home all alone with a cold . Besides , I don 't have a girl to take care of me . Take care . You 're gonna set off the BioCon alarm , Nobuo . I got a shot at the clinic . Why don 't you test out all the over-the-counter cold medicines ? If you get better , it 'll kill two birds with one stone . I have been trying them . Why don 't you try that new fever medicine we 're putting out ? I saw a sample on the chief 's desk . I bet it works great since it hasn 't been diluted for sale yet . Oh , yeah . The blue capsules in the red case . Two of those should work right away . Attention , Okamura-san in the infirmary . You have a call on line three . Excuse me , Chief . About these papers . Eh ? Oh , he 's out . Red capsules in a blue case . Are these them ? Red capsules ... in a blue case . Maybe just one ? No way ! You look so cool , Miki ! Oh , I can do anything if I just set my mind to it . Yeah . This looks great ! Sakiko , you should 've come with us ! We had the best time ! Hmm ? What 's that smell ? Yeah , maybe somebody 's eating something . No , it 's not like that . It smells good . Mmm , like perfume . W-Who was it ? ! Who ? Who touched my red capsules ? ! Who came into my office ? Eh Nobuo ... Tanaka Nobuo went in there a little while ago and took a sample of the new medicine . What ? Where is he now ? He was just here . Where did he go ? Maybe he went home ? He went home ? ! Why did you let him go , you idiot ? It 's your fault ! What are we going to do ? Chief ! H-He said he didn 't feel well and went to the guest room to take a nap . A-Are you sure ? Y-Yeah . Is something wrong with that new fever medicine ? Fever medicine ? Who told you it was that ? Then ... What 's that smell ? It 's morning ? It is ! People should be coming in to work now . Great . Why didn 't somebody wake me ? Saki-chan ? Saki-chan ! Somebody ... Somebody ... Somebody , help ! Ambulance ! Gotta call an ambulance . Some kind of accident ? But the alarm should have gone off ! Same as yesterday . Hello ? An ambulance ! I need an ambulance out here , please ! Chief ? Chief ! The BioCon alarm 's turned off ? Why ? Did the chief turn it off ? An accident has occurred . Please remain calm and follow instructions . An accident ? I knew it ! Oh , man ! Give this line priority ! Yeah ! First priority ! What 's happened , Ohmaeda-kun ? Who are you ? Well , um ... Where 's Ohmaeda-kun ? The guy in charge ! Well , the chief 's here , but ... What the hell ? What 's happened ? What 's Ohmaeda-kun doing on the floor ? I don 't know . It 's not just the chief , either . Everyone 's like this . What ? Patch in the other monitors . I think we had an accident or something . And who are you ? Tanaka . Tanaka Nobuo , development room three . When ? When did it happen ? The exact hour and minute ! Well , it was like this when I woke up here this morning . What ? But the alarm just went off ! Well , the chief turned off the alarm , so ... That 's impossible ! I don 't understand . Wake him up ! He 's unconscious , just like everyone else . I don 't believe this . I called an ambulance , but they aren 't here yet . What ? You called an ambulance ? ! Yes , and the police too . You idiot ! Hold on . What ? My God . I understand . You said your name was Tanaka-kun , right ? Yes , sir . Now listen to me very carefully . I want you to find a certain medicine and some papers ... and then bring them to me at headquarters here in Tokyo . I 'm Nirasaki , the head of new medicine development . Make sure you don 't give the medicine or the papers to anyone but me . What ? Right now ? Yes ! And if anyone asks you , don 't say you work for the company ! What do you mean ? This accident ... No , we don 't know for sure it was an accident . It 's possible that this is related to the medicine ... that we were secretly developing on orders from the government . Orders from the government ? Exactly . That 's why we can 't reveal just yet ... that this accident has occurred . You don 't have much time , Tanaka-kun . Get out of there before the police come . Here 's the code number for the files . And here 's the list of the project head staff . And here 's the medicine sample . This ... This isn 't fever medicine ? But I took some . What 's going on here ? Cherry blossoms and sunflowers in bloom at the same time ? Hey ! Hey ! What 's wrong ? Just like the others . East sector troops ! Do you have that cargo helicopter ready for rescue and evac ops ? Do you read me , Nigata ? Nigata Base ! Mr. Kamata , President of Nishihashi Pharmaceuticals . And Mr. Nirasaki , head of their development division . You gentlemen mind telling me what the hell 's going on ? I 'm coming to you from the Sasago tunnel on the Chuoh Freeway . The westbound highway into Kofu Valley is completely shut off . The eastbound highway is jammed , and traffic is not moving at all due to road clearing from the accidents . While increasing numbers of refugees ... are moving out from Katsunuma area ... communication with the central valley remains out . As you can see , I 'm wearing a gas mask ... but it isn 't keeping the smell out . The question remains ... what 's happening in the valley ? And what is this smell ? Wha ... ? ! Can you see this , ladies and gentlemen ? Flowers ! All of Kofu Valley is full of blooming flowers ! It looks like all the plants in the valley are in bloom ! However , I can 't see anything moving down there . What a sight , ladies and gentlemen ! It 's like hell in full bloom ! I can 't even estimate the number of victims . Eh ? What ... There 's someone down there ! What ? A survivor , ladies and gentlemen ! Go and rescue him ! The cops are warning against flying below 300 meters . Human life comes first ! This report 'll win all the awards ! Hey ! Ladies and gentlemen , a death-defying report ! A live televised rescue . Hey ! Hey ! Speak to me . Hey ! Help me ! I 've never heard about any such medical research ! Well , the order came from the Minister ... to develop a bioweapon countermeasure for Peace Keeping Operation soldiers . So we formed a secret research team of our employees . You 're saying you were ordered to develop a weapon ? No , it 's for protection from a weapon . However , Ohmaeda , the head of the team , accidentally discovered a powerful effect ... from one of their mixtures . Powerful ? How powerful ? W-We 're analyzing computer data from the research center now . We 'll be informed as soon as it 's found . What about our Special Forces teams ? How long has it been since they got here ? I 've got a report in . They were collecting data from the research center up until a little while ago , but ... But what ? According to data from sensors we 've placed in the area the center of the disaster is moving . W-What ? I think the gas generated by the accident is being carried by the wind . I 'm hungry . We have to find the cause of the accident and develop a countermeasure as quickly as possible . One of the research center staff is on his way to Tokyo to bring a sample . He should be here soon . You have a sample ? Yes , the young man who reported this accident should have it . What do you mean ? Well , we tried from the outset to keep the secret papers and the sample from outsiders . You 're telling me there 's a survivor down there ? The smell 's getting strong . The biochem gear isn 't enough ! The evac is complete ! Begin withdrawal ! Seal the road as soon as everyone gets back ! Yes , sir . Captain , look ! What the ... ? All right , he 'll be the last evacuee . Rescue him ! Yes , sir ! Move out ! Get that stuff packed up ASAP ! Hey ! Are you okay ? Hey ! Wha ... ? He 's the one . He 's making this smell ! Withdraw ! Everybody , withdraw ! What 's this mist ? Hey , wait a minute ! Wait ! Shit . Hurry up ! What 's this ? Wait for me ! Grandpa , hurry ! Nobuo 's in big trouble ! What 's happened to Nobuo ? Grandma ! I brought Grandpa ! What 's wrong ? Oh , dear . Nobuo ... Nobuo 's in trouble ! Oh , Nobuo ! What have you done now ? Polluted area has expanded beyond Sasago tunnel ! I think we can conclude this guy is the cause of all this . The reports we 're getting from the evac troops there supports that conclusion . Well , the computer 's analysis is quite different from the data we collected from the area . I can only theorize what 's happening . The sample medicine seems to have mixed with other substances ... and has resulted in some sort of chemical reaction within his body . Assuming that he actually took the sample . Can you explain it more clearly ? Well , yes . T-There 's no doubt that Tanaka Nobuo-kun 's body is producing the stench . The amount of the smell is proportionate to the amount of his body movement , emotional changes and metabolism . When he perspires the gas from his body , it becomes the stench . So , what should we do ? Well , we have to keep him emotionally stable ... with his metabolism controlled at the same time . In other words , we have to kill him ! I can 't approve that . My country invested in this research as well . The sample has to be caught alive . What are you talking about ? ! Your country initiated this research , didn 't it ? ! Who ? ! Who 's going to take responsibility for this ? ! Protecting our citizens and their property ! That must be our primary duty ! Can you see this long trail of gas ladies and gentlemen ? The stench is incredible . Even at this altitude and wearing a gas mask , I can hardly keep my eyes open for more than a minute . The mist is moving toward Tokyo . There is concern that it too may suffer the damages we 've already seen . Nobuo-kun ! Nobuo ! Can you hear me , Nobuo ? Grandma ? Don 't go to Tokyo ! Go back to the mountains ! I don 't understand why , but people will be in danger ! Do you hear me , Nobuo ? Don 't go to Tokyo ! Why is Grandma ... ? Hurry ! Shoot him before he 's hidden in the gas ! What was that ? Hey , what are you doing ? Are you trying to kill my grandson ? Hey ! Let me go ! What are you doing ? Shoot him ! Damn ! The gas . Eyes are watering ! We can 't stay at this altitude ! I 'm taking us up ! Shit ! Grandma ! Grandma ! Grandma ! What was ... ? Message in from attack troops . Commencing attack ! SciOps forces contact with target : Imminent . Reading radio interference . Target is at the rear left , approaching the bridge ! We 'll hit him and then bug out as fast as we can ! He came out ! I see the target ! All right ! Get set to attack . I lost the target in the mist ! Forget it ! Just blast the area ! Fire ! Idiot ! What are you shooting at ? ! The precision sight isn 't working ! What ? ! Eh ? What 's wrong ? The engine ! Idiot ! Why are we stopping ? ! Dunno ! Where are our tanks ? Answer me ! The target is still moving . The 206th air battalion is ready for the third attack . He 's passed Uenohara area just now . No response from the first attack squad ! No contact with Atsugi Base , either ! We can 't do anything ! The stink gas is scrambling the integrated circuits in our weapons ! Call the commander of the North Side troops ! Call the Prime Minister ! Hurry ! Send the evacuation orders to Tokyo ! He 's still alive . Moving toward east at 60 km / h ! What ? What 's wrong ? It 's broken ? ! The airport is now over crowd capacity . Please follow orders . In two hours the Prime Minister will be issuing a statement to the rest of the world to ask for assistance . The U.N. Is then going to send in a Peace Keeping Operation . Tokyo is going to turn into a sea of fire . It 's useless to argue about who 's responsible for the cause of this disaster . You 'd better get out of here . Think of your families . But , Commander ... Your Excellency , what about you ? You called me Your Excellency . Everything is prepared , sir . Very well . Let 's pull out . Aye , aye , sir ! You ! What is it ? ! What are you up to ? ! NASA 's latest space suit ? Yes . Although it 's still a prototype ... it 's shielded from all types of electromagnetic radiation . And its armor is impenetrable . Even a hit from a trench mortar couldn 't stop it . You 're trying to capture him alive aren 't you ? The Prime Minister has given up . Surely you won 't complain if we try ? Dispatch this to our defense forces ! Stop him at Mt . Takao even if you die doing it ! Yes , sir ! Probably looking for me . Huh ? The whole thing 's turned into a real pain . Why do I feel hungry all the time ? Good , we did it ! Switch on full power ! All right ! Spin , spin ! Freeze him like a Sapporo Snow Festival sculpture ! What 's that ? What ? ! Nobody told me about this ! Who are you ? What are you doing here ? ! You can 't just come in here and ... Orders , sir . Hey ! Captain ! The gas is getting stronger . It 's dangerous ! What ? ! Damn ! Why 's it taking so long to get that liquid nitrogen ? Don 't go ! We can 't stimulate him any more ! He 's scared ! We 're even starting to get electrical discharges inside the gas cloud ! Wait for the nitrogen tanks to arrive ! Hey ! All right , go on then ! I 'll be here to clean up after you 're gone ! All right ! This side isn 't sealed off yet ! I can get out ! Withdraw , everybody ! Withdraw ! It 's been 30 minutes since our last contact . Have you heard anything yet ? The level ... The level 's decreasing . What ? Nirasak-kuni , are you sure ? Yes , sir . This point is the highest . See ? Now it 's gone down to ... We 've got communications back ! We 're getting video from the helicopter too . Putting it on screen . Great ! The Yanks are okay ! Now let 's bury that damn skunk ! Yes , sir ! Yes , we did it . We 've saved Japan . I see . The emperor didn 't get on the plane . I 'm glad we could defeat that man ... without making the emperor 's bravery all for nothing . I see the space suit ! The American soldier 's back ! This is the ... Uh , thank you . Ah , thank you , Nirasaki-chan . I 'm glad I could finally meet you . I was worried about where they were taking me . I really thought I wasn 't going to make it . Hold on . Let me get out of this thing . What a stink !

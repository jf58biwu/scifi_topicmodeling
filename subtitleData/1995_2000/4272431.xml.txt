 help ! [ grunts ] help ! somebody help me ! help ! [ panting ] oh , he 's gonna kill me ! help ! god , somebody help me ! go away ! [ screams ] help ! [ screams ] [ panting ] please help me ! [ grunts ] [ grunting ] help ! mulder ? look at that . huh ? huh ? oh , shi- - [ door closes ] [ tapping pen rhythmically ] mulder- - don 't . don 't even start with me . i know what i saw . [ sighs ] skinner wants a report in one hour . what are you going to tell him ? i 'm gonna tell him exactly what i saw . what are you gonna tell him ? i 'll tell him exactly what i saw . now , how is that different ? i 'm the one who may wind up going to prison here . i gotta know if you 're gonna back me up . first of all , if the family of ronnie strickland does , indeed , decide to sue the f.b.i ... for- - i think the figure is $ 446 million- - then you and i both will most certainly be codefendants . and second of all- - i don 't even have a second of all , mulder . four hundred and forty-six million dollars . i 'm in this as deep as you are , and i 'm not even the one that overreacted . i didn 't do the- - with the thing . i did not overreact . ronnie strickland was a vampire . where 's your proof ? you 're my proof . you were there . now you 're scaring me . i want to hear what you 're gonna tell skinner . you want our stories straight . i didn 't say that . i just want to hear it the way you saw it . i don 't feel comfortable with that . prison , scully . your cell mate 's nickname is gonna be " large marge . " she 's gonna read a lot of gertrude stein . - all right . - all right , start at the beginning . the very beginning ? [ drawer opens ] fine . [ sighs ] yesterday morning ... when i arrived at work , you were , uh ... characteristically exuberant . hope you brought your cowboy boots ! you want us to go to dallas ? yee-haw ! actually a town called cheney about 50 miles south of there . population : 361 . by all accounts , very rustic and charming . but as of late , ground zero , the locus ... for a series of mysterious nocturnal exsanguinations . exsanguinations . of whom ? [ slides clicking into place ] [ mulder ] how does that grab ya ? - it 's a- - - dead cow ! exactly . or more specifically , a dead 900-pound holstein . its body completely drained of blood , as was this one , this one , this one , this one , and so on- - six , all in all- - approximately one a week over the past six weeks . - any sign of- - - two small puncture wounds on the neck ? - not what i was gonna ask . - too bad. we got ' em . check it out . these may be syringe marks , their placement meant to emulate fangs . such ritualistic bloodletting points towards cultists of some sort , in which case- - what ? yeah , that 's probably it . satanic cultists . come on , scully . you 're not gonna tell me this is that mexican goat sucker . el chupacabra ? they got four fangs , not two . - and they suck goats , hence the name . - so instead this would be ? - classic vampirism . - of a bunch of cows ? and one dead human . last night a vacationer from new jersey . come on . we gotta go . why didn 't you tell me that from the beginning ? lock the door on your way out . [ disgusted sigh ] [ scully 's voice ] the town of cheney is too small to maintain a morgue facility . as such , we made our way to the peaceful slumbers funeral home ... in order to examine the body of one mr. dwight funt , recently deceased . [ man talking quietly ] [ scully ] it was there that we were met by a representative ... of local law enforcement , sheriff- - lucius hartwell . - you the f.b.i. agents ? - yes. i 'm- - agents mulder and , uh- - [ snapping fingers ] scully. what do you say we take a look at your victim ? yeah , by all means . after you . come on , scully . get those little legs moving ' . come on . boy . here we go . nice threads . no exam has been done ? no , ma 'am . he 's just like we found him in the motel room . once i heard you folks were interested , i figured we 'd best leave it up to the experts . your satanic cultists have some sharp little teeth . what satanic cultists ? go ahead , tell him your , uh , " theory . " well , my theory has evolved . basically , i think we 're looking for someone who has seen one too many bela lugosi movies . he believes he is a vampire , therefore he- - they act like one . yeah. yeah . that makes a whole lot of sense . - i think she 's right . - what about the fang marks ? well , someone so obsessed might well file down their incisors . i think that a moulage casting should help us make an identification . moulage casting . that 's a good idea . now- - now , isn 't there some kind of disease that makes a person think that they 're a vampire ? well , there is a psychological fixation called hematodipsia , which causes the sufferer to gain erotic satisfaction ... from consuming human blood . erotic. yeah . there are also genetic afflictions ... which cause a heightened sensitivity to light , uh , to garlic . porphyria . xeroderma pigmentosum . you really know your stuff , dana . " dana " ? he never even knew your first name . - you gonna interrupt me , or what ? - no , go ahead . dana . anyway , that 's when you had your big breakthrough- - whatever . agent scully , you really know your stuff . sheriff , you say this man isexactly as you found him ? yes , sir , to the letter . have you noticed that this man 's shoes are untied ? - yeah , they sure are . - mulder , what 's your point ? this means something . do you have an old cemetery in town , off the beaten path , the creepier the better ? uh , yeah . - take me there now . - mulder . we 're gonna need a complete autopsy on this man , the sooner the better . whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . what am i even looking for ? i don 't know . - he does that . - come on , sheriff hartwell . ma 'am . 4 : 54 p.m. begin autopsy on white male , age 60 , who is arguably having a worse time in texas than i am , although not by much . i 'll begin with the " y " incision . [ blade hits floor ] yee-haw . heart weighs 370 grams . tissue appears healthy . left lung weighs 345 grams . tissue appears healthy . large intestine , 890 grams . yada , yada , yada . stomach contents show last meal close to the time of death ... consisting of ... pizza , topped with pepperoni , green peppers , mushrooms . mushrooms . [ sighs ] that sounds really good . [ neck muscles cracking ] [ sighs ] [ scully 's voice ] having completed the autopsy , i checked into the davey crockett motor court . [ mulder ] the name of it was actually the sam houston motor lodge . [ bed motor humming ] [ sighs ] [ whispering ] oh , my god . [ door hinges creak , door slams ] chloral hydrate . what ? - what the hell happened to you ? - nothin ' . chloral hydrate ? yeah , that thing that you didn 't know that you were looking for . chloral hydrate , more colorfully known as " knockout drops . " i found it in abundance when i sent the tox screen in on our murder victim . - no , seriously , mulder . what happened to you ? - nothing . - who slipped him the mickey ? - my " theory " ? your vampire . he found it necessary to dope poor mr. funt to the gills ... before he was able to extract his blood . probably did it to the cows too . what kind of vampire would do that ? exactly . [ sighs ] we got another dead tourist . you gotta do another autopsy . tonight ? i just put money in the magic fingers . i won 't let it go to waste . [ bed continues vibrating ] [ sighs ] [ giggling ] [ giggling continues ] this one 's my room , mulder . don 't get mud everywhere . yeah. yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . okay . [ giggling ] excuse me , ma 'am . did you order a pizza ? yeah. the guy in there will pay for it . [ scully 's voice ] forgoing both dinner and sleep , i was soon back at the funeral home ... examining one mr. paul lombardo ... from naples , florida . heart. lung . large intestine . [ sighs ] [ sighs deeply ] as with the previous victim , it appears that the subject ... was most likely incapacitated with chloral hydrate ... and then exsanguinated . [ phone rings ] [ sighs ] the drug was either injected or ingested , [ ringing continues ] i 'm not sure which . [ phone beeps ] scully . [ heavy breathing ] hello ? [ gasping ] hello ? [ panting ] [ sighs ] where was i ? stomach contents . [ sighs ] stomach contents include ... pizza- - [ gasps ] chloral hydrate 's in the pizza . the pizza guy . [ gasps ] mulder . mulder ? [ hissing ] that 's it ? well , luckily , i 'd gotten there in time . i mean , though you were drugged , you were , more or less , unharmed . mulder ? are you okay ? who 's the black private dick who 's the sex machine with all the chicks ? dd shaft dddd can you dig it ? they say this cat shaft is a bad mother- - shut your mouth . talkin ' ' bout shaft . i did not . long story short , though my first four shots obviously missed ronnie strickland entirely , with my fifth , i was able to shoot out a tire on his car , forcing him to escape on foot . i left you behind , and i entered the woods in pursuit . i assumed that you were incapacitated . then i heard screaming . when i arrived in the clearing , i found that you had caught up with him first ... and had ... overreacted , and that his vampire teeth were fake . that 's what you 're gonna tell skinner . well , i 'm gonna argue that we caught a killer . an utterly non-supernatural killer , but a killer nonetheless . and that your zeal to catch up with him was augmented ... by the chloral hydrate you were given . - you are afraid to tell the truth . - excuse me ? that 's not the way it happened . are you afraid if you tell it ... the way it really happened , you 'll look like an idiot , like me ? mulder , why don 't you tell me the way you think it happened ? starting at the beginning . you 're damn right . yesterday morning began like any other morning . you arrived at the office characteristically less than exuberant . [ quiet tone ] i hope you brought your cowboy boots . why are we going to dallas ? actually it 's a little town just south of there called cheney , texas . they 've had incidents down there recently which i think you 'll agree are pretty unusual . - like what ? - i brought some slides with which to better illustrate . here we go . it 's a dead cow . it 's actually six dead cows , and here 's the really interesting thing . why am i looking at six dead cows ? because of the manner in which they died. all six were mysteriously exsanguinated . - and ? - and two little puncture marks right here on the neck . look , i got a slide of that . and , um , one dead human victim . last night a vacationer from new jersey . his body completely drained of blood , and two little puncture wounds on his neck . okay , look , scully , i don 't want to jump to any hasty conclusions , but on the strength of the evidence that we have here , i think what we may be looking at is what appears to be a series of vampire ... orvampire-like attacks . on what do you base that ? uh , well , on the corpses drained of blood ... and the fang marks on the neck . but as always , i-i 'm very eager to hear your opinion . - well , it 's obviously not a vampire . - why not ? because they don 't exist ? well , that 's one opinion , and i respect that . nonetheless , i 'm thinking a murder has been committed here , and we can go down there and help bring a killer to justice ... in whatever form- - mortal or immortal- - he may take . it 's not that mexican goat sucker either . [ man talking quietly ] [ mulder ] upon arriving at the funeral home , i made an interesting observation , one which you apparently didn 't hear . - that 's a whole lot of caskets . - largest in-stock selection in the state . well , why would a town with a population of only 361 need that ? repeat business . [ chuckles ] mortician humor . excuse me . [ mulder ] apparently , your mind was somewhere else . whoo , boy . [ exaggerated texas accent ] y 'all must be the government people . i 'm lucius hartwell . he had big buckteeth ? - he had a slight overbite . - no , he didn 't . and that 's significant ? how ? i 'm just trying to be thorough . anyway , then we went to take a look at the body . here we go . no exam has been done ? no , sir. this is just like we found him in the motel room , as is . no exam has been done ? uh , no , ma 'am . once i heard y 'all was interested , i figured we 'd best leave it to the experts . now , uh , that can 't be what it looks like , right ? it depends on what you think it looks like , sheriff hartwell . vampires have always been with us , in ancient myths and stories passed down from early man . from the babylonianekimmu to the chinesekuangshi , themotetz damof the hebrews , themormoof ancient greece and rome , right down to the more familiar nosferatuof transylvania . mormo. yeah . in short , sheriff , no , this can 't be what it looks like . i think what we 're dealing with here is simply a case of some lunatic ... [ chuckles ] who , uh , has watched too many bela lugosi movies . he wishes that he could transfigure himself into a creature of the night . yeah , okay . what she said , that 's what i 'm thinkin ' . and , uh , yeah . still , that leaves us in something of a quandary ... because there are as many different vampires as there are cultures that fear them . some don 't even subsist on blood . the bulgarianubour , for example , eats only manure . thank you . to the serbs , a prime indicator of vampirism was red hair . [ chuckles ] uh , some vampires are thought to be eternal . others are thought to have a life span of only 40 days . sunlight kills certain vampires , while others come and go as they please , day or night . if there 's a point , mulder , please feel free to come to it . my point is we don 't know exactly what we 're looking for , what kind of vampire- - or , if you prefer , what kind of vampire this killer wishes himself to be . now , why is it so important that his shoes were untied ? i 'm gettin ' to it . so while you stayed behind to do the autopsy , the sheriff drove me to the town cemetery . [ thunder rumbling ] [ metal gate squeaking ] agent mulder , you mind me askin ' you why we 're out here ? historically , cemeteries are thought to be a haven for vampires , as are castles , catacombs and swamps . but , unfortunately , you don 't have any of those . we used to have swamps , only the e.p.a. made us take to calling ' ' em wetlands . yeah , so we 're out here looking for any signs of vampiric activity . - which would be like , uh- - - broken or shifted tombstones . the absence of birds singing . there you go . 'cause i ain 't- - i ain 't hearin' any birds singin ' . right ? 'course , it 's winter , and we ain 't got no birds , but- - is there anything else ? a faint groaning coming from under the earth , the sound of mandication , of the creature eating its own death shroud . [ rain falling ] no. no mani- - man- - man- - mandication . mandication , no . sheriff , i-i know my methods may seem a little odd to you , but- - look , y 'all work for the federal government . that 's all i need to know . i mean , c.i.a. , secret service . y 'all run the show , so- - it 's just that my gut instinct tells me that the killer will visit this place , that it may well hold some fascination , some kind of siren call for him . you know ? [ horn honking ] howdy , sheriff ! - oh , hey , ronnie . how 's it goin ' ? - can 't complain . well , all right , then . maybe after nightfall , sheriff , but he 'll come . oh , he 'll come . [ mulder ] so we staked out the cemetery . [ animal howling ] mulder. shoelaces ? hmm ? on the corpse . you were gonna tell me what was so meaningful about finding untied shoelaces . i 'm gettin ' to it . sunflower seed ? sorry . no , thanks . do you mind- - do you mind me askin ' you what you were- - historically , certain types of seeds are thought to fascinate vampires . chiefly oats and millet , but , you know , you gotta make do with what you have . remember when i said before that we didn 't know what type of vampire we were looking for ? yeah . oddly enough , there seems to be one obscure fact ... which , in all the stories told by the different cultures , is exactly the same , and that 's that vampires are really , really obsessive / compulsive . huh . you toss a handful of seeds , no matter what he 's doing , he 's gotta stop and pick it up . if he sees a knotted rope , he 's gotta untie it . it 's in his nature . that 's why i 'm guessing our victim 's shoelaces were untied . yeah. obsessive . like rain man . when that old boy dropped matchsticks , he had to pick ' em all up . same thing , right ? well , he didn 't actually pick ' em up . he counted them . oh , yeah ! he didn 't have to pick them up . 247. off the top of his head . if he picked them up , he would have been a vampire . yeah . i tell you what . i know i 'm in law enforcement , but i 'd like to take him to vegas myself . am i right ? well , that would be illegal , right ? - he was like a little calculator . - yeah . [ woman on radio ] you got your radio on ? excuse me . hey , charlene . what 's up ? i just got a call from the r.v. park . they got something of a situation there . sounds like you might want to have a look . [ engine starts ] hey again , sheriff . hey again , ronnie . [ ronnie ] i guess you got yourself a runaway , huh ? [ hartwell ] yeah , ronnie . i guess we do . what do you think ? we ought to shoot the tires out ? [ mulder ] anyway , skipping ahead- - why skip ahead ? what happened then ? mulder ? you shot out the tires . and what then ? [ mulder ] okay , here 's something you may not know . shooting out the tires on a runaway r.v. is a lot harder than it looks . i then tried a different approach . whoa ! hey ! hey , hey ! whoa ! - help ! whoa ! - come on , bird-dog it ! thataway ! [ screaming ] - oh ! - [ groaning ] shee , ow . how you doin ' there ? all right there ? [ engine sputtering ] [ mulder ] finally , we prevailed . that 's the same as the others . right down to the shoes . [ mulder ] we interviewed everyone present . no one had seen anything . tired , frustrated and lacking a solid lead , [ bed vibrating ] i just wanted to get cleaned up . i had the sheriff drop me at the motel , which is where i ran into you . [ shouting ] what do you mean you want me to do another autopsy ? why do i have to do it now ? i spent hours on my feet doing an autopsy , all for you ! i do it all for you , mulder ! i haven 't eaten since 6 : 00 this morning , and that was was half a cream cheese bagel . it wasn 't even real cream cheese , it was light cream cheese ! now you want me to run off and do another autopsy ? what the hell happened to you ? [ mulder ] finally , you left . [ scully ] don 't you touch that bed ! [ door slams ] [ bed continues vibrating ] [ knocking on door , door opening ] [ ronnie ] hello ? hello ! oh , hey again . the lady outside- - she said that , uh , you 'd pay for this . she ordered a pizza from you ? excellent. how much ? 12.98 . i 'll get my wallet . - how much ? - it 's 12.98 . - okay , here 's 13 . - okay , then . enjoy . [ door closes ] ah , scully . [ mulder ] so i ate your dinner . and that 's when i saw it . but by then , it was too late . [ falls on floor ] [ phone beeps , dialing ] uh- - this is scully . hello ? uh- - de- hello ? - [ mulder groans ] uh- - uh- - th- - creep . uhh- - uhh- - you- - [ hissing ] oh , man ! what 'd you have to go and do that for ? you are in big trouble . [ grunts ] [ mulder ] then i was out cold . i don 't know for how long , but when i finally came to- - [ hissing ] [ scully ] mulder ? [ gun cocks ] [ growls ] you 're saying that i actually hit him two times ? square in the chest . no effect . and then he sort of flew at me like a flying squirrel . well , i don 't think i 'll use the phrase ... " flying squirrel " when i talk to skinner , but , yeah , that 's what happened . [ mulder ] you checked on me , then left to pursue ronnie strickland into the woods . once i recovered , i knew what i had to do . help me ! help ! i caught sight of him , chased him over hill and dale . and in the end- - [ shouts ] mulder , it 's not just me . nobody in their right mind will ever believe that story . they 'll have to , once they examine ronnie strickland 's body . [ sighs ] " case 0026198 . ronald lavelle strickland . " probable cause of death- - gee , that 's a tough one . [ grunting ] [ stake clatters on tray ] [ tools clattering ] [ hisses ] - [ gasps ] - [ growls ] [ knuckle cracks ] [ phone rings ] [ woman ] assistant director skinner 's office . oh , i 'm sorry . he 's about to go into a meeting . yes , it may last several hours . you 're welcome . mulder. please just keep reminding him you were drugged . [ whispering ] would you stop that ? it couldn 't hurt . just stop it . scully ? mulder ? i was drugged ! [ sighs ] i want you back in texas . ronnie strickland 's body has disappeared from the morgue . apparently in conjunction with this , a coroner 's been attacked . his throat was bitten . the coroner 's dead ? no , his throat was bitten . he was sort of ... gnawed on . daylight 's burning , agents . [ door closes ] well- - he was dead . i noticed that . with a stake through his heart . i noticed that too . so we should find ronnie out here because ? because tradition states that a vampire needs to sleep in his native soil . oh . yeah . but , mulder , he had fake fangs . why would a real vampire need fake fangs ? i mean , for the sake of argument . no , fangs are very rarely mentioned in the folklore . real vampires aren 't thought to have them. it 's more an invention of bram stoker 's . you were right before when you said that this is a guy who 's watched too many dracula movies . he just happens to be a real vampire . [ sighs ] well , so where the hell is he ? what about his family , the ones who were gonna sue us for 446 million ? well , an aunt and an uncle . their mail comes general delivery to a local post office . no home address ? [ mulder ] that 's the sheriff . - sheriff hartwell . - evening , agents . i heard y 'all were back in town. thought i might be of some assistance . yeah , a-actually you can . you can stay behind here with agent scully while i check something out . don 't say i never did nothin ' for ya . where are you going ? where might you be living if your mail came general delivery around here ? the r.v. park ? you 're good . thanks . you 're very welcome . so what do you think about vampires ? you mean , aside from the fact that i don 't believe in them ? yeah , aside from that . well , they 're supposed to be extremely charming , seductive . no , i mean , even if they did really exist , who 's to say they 'd actually be like that ? as agent mulder says , there are many different kinds of vampires . yeah , there sure are . i really need to apologize to you about ronnie . he makes us all look bad . uh- - he 's just not who we are anymore . i mean , we pay taxes , we 're good neighbors . old ronnie , he just- - he can 't quite seem to grasp the concept ... of ... low profile . but though he may be a moron , he is one of our own . [ cracking sound ] [ door creaking ] hello . [ creaking ] [ on headphone ] dd 20th-century man that 's what he is dd - sleeping late . - [ growls ] ronnie strickland ! you have the right to remain silent . anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . come on . cut it out , ronnie . [ ronnie grunting ] oh , damn . back ! ah , no ! [ screaming ] [ birds chirping ] mulder ? [ exhales ] scully , what happened ? i came to in the cemetery . that 's all i know . [ horn honks ] [ car door opens ] they pulled up stakes . so that 's it ? they simply disappeared without a trace ? and that 's exactly the way it happened , from start to finish ? well , i can neither confirm nor deny agent mulder 's version of events ... which occurred outside my presence . and i can neither confirm nor deny agent scully 's version of events , but , um- - anyway ... i was drugged . that is , essentially , exactly the way it happened . essentially . [ mulder ] except for the part about the buckteeth . [ child ] i made this !

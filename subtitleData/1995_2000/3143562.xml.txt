 [ Whooshing ] [ Whooshing ] [ Boy laughing ] [ Click ] SEAN : Uhh ... Uhh ! Oh ! Ohh ! Ohhh ... [ Sobbing ] Oh ... Ohhh ! Ohhh ! [ Exhales heavily ] - You eaten anything ? - No . TITO : What is this , a picnic ? We got 10 minutes to go . [ Click ] [ Choir singing ] Punch me out , man . MAN : You got it . SEAN : Any word from the LAPD lntelligence ? If there is such a thing ? LOOMIS : Not yet , sir . Of course not ... because we 're a covert antiterrorism team ... that is so secret ... that when we snap our fingers , nothing happens ! [ Beeping ] SEAN : Sheriff 's department ? Airport police ? WANDA : Still waiting . Interpol insists he 's in Tripoli . Yeah , well , you trust ... you trust that billion-dollar satellite , OK ? I 'll trust a $ 10 snitch at this point . TITO : Sean . Look ... SEAN : What ? TITO : Why don 't you just give 'em a little break , OK ? We 'll take a break when the case breaks , OK ? CHORUS : Hallelujah ! Hallelujah ! Hallelujah ! Hallelujah ! Hallelujah ! Hallelujah , hallelujah ! [ Hallelujah Chorus continues ] CASTOR : I never really enjoyed the Messiah . In fact , I think it 's fucking boring . But your voice ... makes even a hack like Handel ... seem like a genius . CASTOR : Hallelujah ! Hallelujaaaaah ! Ah ! [ Hallelujah chorus ends ] SEAN : Victor , when we put this thing to bed ... you can brand the Fourth Amendment on my butt . Thank you . KIMBERLY : Sir . Excuse me . Your wife is on line one . TITO : Sean ! A jet was just chartered . Anderson Airfield . Guess who paid the bill in cash ? Pollux Troy . SEAN : Put one of our people on that plane . TITO : We still got no sign of Castor . Pollux doesn 't fly without big brother . Now , come on . POLLUX : You 're 26 minutes late . The casing didn 't fit , right ? I told you Dietrich would try to pawn off ... some cheap shit North Korean plastic . CASTOR : Casing fit like a condom . You didn 't deviate from the plan , did you ? Pollux ? POLLUX : How long do you want me to sit here twiddling my thumbs ? I paid for the jet . Saved us some time . That 's what the boys are for- - to hide our famous faces . If I didn 't love you so much , I 'd have to kill you , bro . I hate it when you call me bro . You guys are paid to protect him from everybody ... including himself . And stay away from downtown on the 18th . It 's gonna be a little , uh ... smoggy . [ Chuckles ] WINTERS : My passengers are here . I gotta go . CASTOR : Let 's go . Let 's go . I 'm bored . WINTERS : Here you go . Bravo . Would you like anything else once we 're airborne ? Oh ... a peach . Sit . Come here . Mmm . You know , I can eat a peach for hours . If I were to send you flowers ... where would I ... No . Wait . Let me rephrase . If I were to let you suck my tongue ... would you be grateful ? Oh . [ Tires screech ] PILOT : There 's someone on the runway . [ Siren ] CASTOR : Get off of me ! [ Tires screeching ] CASTOR : Archer . WINTERS : FBI ! This is a very big gun . Fly the fucking plane . Come on . That 's it . Come on , let 's go ! TITO : Don 't play chicken with the goddamn jet ! Come on ! He 's got Winters ! Goddamn it ! [ Tires screeching ] All units , pin ' em in ! Close in on ' em ! CASTOR : One of yours , Sean ? [ Gunshot ] Shit ! [ Tires screeching ] SEAN : Out ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Go ! TITO : Goddamn it , Sean ! CASTOR : Take off now . - Fly ! - I can 't ! Fly , bitch ! All units locked and ready . Follow Archer 's lead . [ Alarm sounds ] CASTOR : What the fuck are you doing ? pilot : There 's an engine out . We gotta stop . [ Gunshot ] [ Sirens ] Aah ! Aah ! LOOMIS : Aah ! CASTOR : Pollux ! POLLUX : Uhh ! Uhh ! Uhh ! [ Glass breaking ] Aah ! Cas ! SEAN : Secure the hanger ! [ Clattering ] [ Loud click ] SEAN : Berkley , down ! SEAN : Down ! [ Clicking ] SEAN : Give up , Castor . Your time 's up . CASTOR : Better hit me , ' cause you only got one bullet left . SEAN : So do you . Well . We 've got something in common . We both know our guns . SEAN : What we don 't have in common ... is that I don 't care if I live , and you do . Sean ... that hurts . You 're not having any fun , are you , Sean ? Why don 't you come with us ? Try terrorism for hire . We 'll blow some shit up . It 's more fun . - Shut the fuck up . - Watch your fuckin ' mouth ! I 'm gonna unleash the biblical plague " Hell-A " deserves . But I 'll give it a break if my brother and I walk . Bullshit . I see . You think I 'm bluffing ? Maybe I am ... but then maybe I 'm not . More importantly , what would you do with me locked up ? You 'd drive your wife and kid crazy . How is your daughter ? Is she ripening by now , your darling Jamie ? Your little peach , is she ripe ? Whoo ! I 'm ready ! [ Click ] OK . OK . Please , man , don 't shoot me . [ Sobbing ] I 'm scared , Seany ! [ Laughing ] Well , I think you better pull the trigger ... 'cause I don 't give a fuck ! [ Singing ] I 'm ready ! Ready for the big ride , baby ! Unhh ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! TITO : Well , Sean , looks like Elvis done left the building . SEAN : [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] JAMIE : It wasn 't my fault ! Why won 't you ever be on my side ? EVE : I am always on your side ... but you have to give me a chance . SEAN : Now what ? [ Sighs ] She was suspended again . Kid made fun of her clothes . She started a fight ? JAMIE : Right , Dad , don 't even ask me what happened . SEAN : OK . What happened ? Oh . I see . JAMIE : Not like you would believe me anyway . Jamie , look , it 's not easy , OK ? I mean , look ... you change the way you look every week . And the way you act ? Who are you supposed to be now ? I 'm supposed to be me . Not like you have a clue who I am anyway . [ Door closes ] EVE : I have to work tonight . I called to tell you . I was on hold for 10 minutes , and I couldn 't wait any longer . I got him , Eve . It 's over ? It 's over . Oh , Sean . I 'll make it up to you and and Jamie , I promise . I 'll put in for a desk job ... and I 'll do counseling , sit down , talk about Mike . I 'll do it . Anything you want . I just want you . Well , good , ' cause that 's what you 're gonna get . You happy ? I think so . Yes . [ Laughing ] Oh , thank God . MAN : Hold on . What is all this ? KIMBERLY : Sir , the ClA sent this over . SEAN : Didn 't know they catered . Send it back . No , wait . How about , uh ... What about to Anderson ... Montgomery , Berkley ... Pincus ... Gianelli ... Winters . [ Sighs ] How 's Loomis ? TITO : He 's gonna need a little surgery , but , uh ... he 'll be OK . What 's up ? Special Ops . They want a word . Aw , forget it . I don 't have the time . HOLLIS : Better make time , Sean . Recovered from the jet wreckage . Found in Pollux Troy 's briefcase . [ Music plays , woman moans with pleasure ] WOMAN : Ohh ! SEAN : Porcelain casing . Thermal cloak . Nerve gas and biological payload . HOLLIS : It 's enough to flatten a square mile . Then , depending on the prevailing winds ... the fallout will be a tad worse ... than Gulf War Syndrome . SEAN : The biblical plague to L.A.- - Fuck ! Aah ! Where is he ? Where 's Pollux Troy ? MAN : Why draw the schematic if you 're not gonna build the bomb ? POLLUX : What , is it a crime to exercise the mind ? I won 't say another word until I see my brother . VICTOR : Any progress ? I need about 10 minutes alone with this guy . You got Castor . Just go home . [ Sighs ] We won 't evacuate the city on your hunch . Look , I know Castor too well for this to be a hunch . You know what ? Just run the goddamn bureau any way you like . [ Sighs ] HOLLIS : I could put an agent in his cell . Maybe Pollux will let it slip . SEAN : Oh , come on . He 's a paranoid sociopath . The only person he 'd talk to is his brother , and he 's dead . HOLLIS : There is one other possibility . [ Beeping ] Oh , God ! You 're keeping him alive . HOLLIS : Relax , Archer . He 's a turnip . [ Sean groaning ] What if you could walk into Erewhon prison ... and give Pollux a nice big brotherly hug ... as Castor Troy ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . MALCOLM : Let me try . Malcolm Walsh . I run the bio cover unit for Special Ops . - I know who you are . - But not what I can do . Physical alteration . Augmentation . HOLLIS : Dr. Walsh can alter the likeness ... even the voice of a government witness . MALCOLM : I think you 'll recognize this patient . We had to build your friend Loomis ... a whole new ear from scratch . What we 're suggesting for you isn 't a permanent transplant . Just a temporary trade . Come here . With new anti-inflammatories , healing takes days , not weeks . Your blood types won 't match , but Pollux won 't know that . Height difference is negligible . Skin pigment , eye pigment , both almost identical . We 'll use laser shears for the hairline ... microplugs for body hair . We 'll do an abdominoplasty ... take care of those , uh , love handles . But all that 's the easy part . Here 's the real science . This is a state of the art morphogenetic template . The inside is modeled on your skull ... The outside exactly like Troy 's . Then we fit his face on top . Not a replica , but the real thing . Then we simply connect ... the muscles , tear ducts , and nerve endings ... SEAN : So you want to take his face and mine- - HOLLIS : Borrow . The procedure 's completely reversible . SEAN : You think that I want to do this ? No . No ! There 's no one else , Sean . You have lived and breathed Castor Troy for years . I 'll get his gang to talk . That 's what I do ! What if you can 't ? The bomb will blow . And Castor Troy will win . SEAN : Get out ! Go ahead . Wipe your ass . TITO : Damn ! What the hell is that smell ? He shit in his pants . Where 's Dietrich ? SEAN : Hello , Sasha . When was the last time you saw Castor Troy ? - Who cares ? He 's dead . - Answer the question . I know my rights . I don 't have to answer shit . You 're right , but know this . You 're a convicted felon ... on probation for harboring Castor Troy . One phone call from me ... and your son will end up in a foster home . I understand why you would use such a threat ... but you try to take him away from me ... I swear to you ... I haven 't seen him for years . [ Sighs ] SEAN : This reeks of you . It 's got your signature all over it . DIETRICH : Maybe , but you ain 't got nothin ' on me ... and you know it . Maybe so , but I can keep you within city limits ... or I can talk to your sister again . She 's right outside . Only this time I 'll be nice . Hey , Sean ... how 's your dead son ? Aah ! I don 't know any- - OK . Something about the 18th , but that 's all I know . TITO : Great . So we got a date . Where the hell 's the damn bomb ? Only Pollux Troy 'll know that . It 's your call , Sean . SEAN : Does Lazarro know your plan ? HOLLIS : No . This is a black bag operation . Strictly off the books . You can 't tell Lazarro , and you can 't tell your wife . Oh , God . What are you asking me to do ? OK , let 's see . You 're asking me to break the law ... risk my neck ... and you 're asking me to put in the dark ... all the people that love me and trust me . I 'll do it . EVE : Sean . Sorry I woke you . I 'm glad it 's you that woke me ... and not a phone call ... telling me you won 't be coming home . But that 's a fear I can finally let go of , huh ? It 's all right , Sean . It 's OK . I keep ... I keep wanting to move this ... over here , you know ? If it had only been an inch to the left ... Mikey 'd be alive . And you wouldn 't be . Sean , things will get better now that you 're home . The scar won 't move , but it will heal if you let it . Everything will be better . He 's out of our lives . Eve , if I told you that I realized that ... that this thing won 't fully end ... until I did one last thing ... Eve , something vital . OK , I know . You 're going back on assignment again . Just one last time . Come on , Eve . " I 'm not going anywhere . " That 's what you told me . Oh ! You don 't need me to tell you what to do . You never have , so go . But go now . Sean , I 'm changing my mind . This is a suicide mission . SEAN : Yeah , I know . I know . Well , you know , maybe this doctor ... if he can do even half of what he says he can do ... maybe it 'll work . I don 't know . I become Castor Troy , be in control . TITO : That 's the part that scares me . Doctor , I have something ... I have a scar that ... If you can put this back after- - after all this is over . It 's important to me . It 's like a reminder . MALCOLM : Sure . MALCOLM : Tito , please , hold this for me . Please . OK , let 's go . Oh , God . TITO : Oh , my God . TITO : Are you OK ? Come on . Talk to me . Fuck you ! Fuck you ! - Fuck you ! - Sean ! Fuck you ! Sean , sit down . Sit down . Sit down . Sean ! Sean ! Archer ! You 're Sean Archer ! Sean Archer . Sean Archer . When this is over ... I want you to take this face ... and burn it . I still sound like me . MALCOLM : I 've implanted a microchip on your larynx . It 's fantastic , but you better be careful . Pressure , sharp blow ... even a violent sneeze could dislodge it . Just repeat what you hear . CASTOR : Peach . I can eat a peach for hours . SEAN : Peach . I can eat a peach for hours . There 's a scratchy tickle . Mm-hmm . Peach . I can eat a peach for hours . Peach . I can eat a peach for hours . Once again . Peach . I can eat a peach for hours . Perfect . HOLLIS : Now , Sean , six days until the 18th . The clock 's ticking , and so 's the bomb . SEAN : Yeah . TITO : You 've got two days to get Pollux to talk . Either way , Miller comes in and pulls you out . You got me ? What 's the matter ? SEAN : Face itches . You all right ? Come on . Let 's go . Archer 's going to be pissed when he comes back and finds out . WANDA : The guy is knee-deep in Georgia swamp . GUARD : You are now the property of Erewhon prison ... a citizen of nowhere . The Geneva Convention is void here . Amnesty International doesn 't know we exist . When I say your ass belongs to me ... I mean exactly that . This entire prison 's one big magnetic field . The boots tell us where you are . Six-twenty-one to population . HICKS : Hey , hey , hey . What 's the matter , pal ? Don 't you remember the little people ? - Burke Hicks . - Oh , yeah . I busted ... believe Sean Archer busted you ... for stalking the U.N. Secretary General . No . Archer framed me . I had nothing to do with that . Word was you got wasted . You want to see what wasted looks like , little man ? INMATES : Ooh ! Pollux . GUARD : Out of the way ! SECOND GUARD : Central , there 's a disturbance in the population . Go to lockdown . Hold that lockdown . DUBOV : Come on , you pussy ! SEAN : Watch your fuckin ' mouth . Watch your fuckin ' mouth ! 'Cause I 'm Castor Troy ! Yeah ! I 'm Castor Troy ! INMATES : Whoo ! Yay ! Whoo ! I 'm Castor Troy ! Yeah ! Whoo ! Yeah ! Whoo ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Lock ' em down ! I stop the fights , not you . That 's two strikes for you , Dubov . One more , you know where you 're going . SEAN : When I get out of here- - If you get out of here . I 'm gonna have you fired . [ Laughter ] [ Laughter ] [ Monitor beeps ] [ Castor gurgling ] [ Moaning ] [ Wailing ] Aah ! Unh ! CASTOR : Lars , it 's me . Believe it . Someone ... They took ... switched my ... Some fucking c-c-c ... But it 's cool . We 're gonna deal with it . [ Sobbing laugh ] Oh , yes , we 're gonna deal with it . [ Soprano sings opera ] MALCOLM : What 's this about ? CASTOR : Dr. Walsh ! I was just enjoying some of your greatest hits here . Oh , I hope you don 't mind . I partook in your groovy painkillers . This is fabulous work . This is--Oh ! Ha ha ! Bravo ! Ha ha ! Brav--fucking--o ! Oh , God . This is excellent . Bravo . Bravo ! What do you want ? [ Clapping hands ] Take one goddamn guess . POLLUX : I wish they 'd play those salmon spawning scenes . I found them intensely erotic . HICKS : Aw , that fuckin nature channel . One more waterfall , I 'm gonna foam at the mouth . POLLUX : It 's like they 're begging us to riot . Excuse me . Not feeling very coordinated lately , are you ? CASTOR : Look , bro ... you got to help me . I am so fried . If the psychos in here find out I 'm misfiring ... we 're both gonna be dead meat . Shock treatment ? What 's the matter with you ? Did they operate ? I was in a coma . Jesus , you 're still so fucking paranoid . Aren 't they giving you your medication in here ? What was my medication ? Pollux , I hand fed you those pills for years . Vivex . I haven 't forgotten that . It 's just everything else . It 's my senses , my reflexes ... my memory- - it 's like a tab of bad Quantrax . I don 't even know ... why that fucking yeti jumped me yesterday . Dubov ? You had a sex sandwich with his wife and his sister ... the night he was sent here . Guess that explains why he 's so upset . Wow . We 're gonna blow up L.A. , bro . Ain 't it cool ? Rub my nose in it , why don 't you ? Ten million dollar design ... and now those militia nut jobs get to keep their cash . So fucking unfair . That bomb you built does deserve an audience . It 's a work of art . It belongs in the Louvre . POLLUX : Yes , it does . Oh , well . Guess the L.A. Convention Center will have to do . What ? Thank you . For what ? You are so fucking pathetic . GUARD : You got a visitor . Ooh-whee , you 're good-lookin ' ! You 're hot ! It 's like looking in a mirror , only not . SEAN : Troy ? Now , that is between us . OK ? But you were ... In a coma ? Having your face cut off disturbs a man 's sleep . Read the newspaper lately ? Aah ! You killed them ? Beats paying the bill , huh ? Come on . I mean , if a facelift cost five grand ... See anything you like ? Tito . I torched all the evidence that proves you 're you , OK ? So , wow ! You 're gonna be in here for ... the next hundred years ! Now , I have got to go . I 've got a government job to abuse ... and a lonely wife to fuck . Did I say that ? Oh , sorry . Make love to . God , I miss that face . Die ! Die ! Die ! Aah ! WALTON : Sorry , Agent Archer . No , don 't you worry about it , Mr. Walton . Clearly , he 's had a traumatic childhood ... and , uh ... Thank you . [ Car radio plays ] CASTOR : Look at this place . I 'm in hell . I may never get a hard-on again . [ Car radio playing ] INXS : Don 't lose your head . Oh , yes . There we go . Well , I suppose it was only a matter of time ... before you forgot where we lived . Come on . Give me a break . Every house in this block looks the same . Then I spotted you . Eve . My one and only Eve . So how was your vital assignment ? Which one was that ? How should I know , Sean ? Oh , oh , yes . The out-of-body experience . Yes , that one . Where you going ? EVE : To the hospital . CASTOR : No . No . What 's the matter ? - Sean , come on . - Oh , what ? Quit teasing me . Stop it . I 'm still really hurt . There are leftovers in the fridge . No , no . I 'm going to stay hungry for you . My peach . Gimme that tongue . Sean , come on . I can 't believe what you 're doing . Eve ... I hate to see you go ... but I love to watch you leave . CASTOR : " Date night ... fizzled again . " We haven 't made love in two months . " What a loser . [ Sighs ] [ Music playing ] [ " Papa 's Got A Brand-New Bag " playing ] Got your e-mail , Karl . That poem you sent me was pretty kinky . [ Castor sighs ] The plot thickens . Hang on a second . I 'll have to call you back . You 're not respecting my boundaries . I 'm coming in , Janie . Janie ? I don 't think you heard me , Jamie . You got something that I crave . MUSIC : Papa 's got a brand-new bag . Clarissa left those here . Well , I won 't tell Mom if you don 't . When did you start smoking ? You 'll be seeing a lot of changes around here . Papa 's got a brand-new bag . Ah-ooh ! MUSIC : He ain 't too hip now ... but I can do the jerk ... Come on , do the- - MUSIC : You 're doin ' the twist ... Just like this . POLLUX : Bye , bro . Drop me a line sometime . WALTON : Gonna be kind of lonely with Pollux gone , huh ? SEAN : Pollux what ? That big-shit cop , Archer ... cut him a deal for turning state 's evidence . Your brother 's been released . I 'm Sean Archer . There is a bomb at the L.A. Convention Center . I 'm Sean Archer , and- - Ow ! [ Singing ] AGENT : We just wanted you to know- - WANDA : We 're all really sorry about Tito . CASTOR : Oh , hey . Shit happens , you know . So is our star witness talking ? AGENT : Yeah , about what kind of mustard he likes ... on his tongue sandwiches . WANDA : If that bomb 's out there , we 're almost out of time . CASTOR : Hmm . VICTOR : Archer ! You made the deal with Pollux Troy . That isn 't like you . CASTOR : Ah , well . When all else fails , fresh tactics . Fresh ? Let me tell you my fresh tactic . Everything to do with this case goes through me , understood ? - Hmm . - Good ! Thanks . You 're supposed to be snitching , making me look good . - Look good ? - Mm-hmm . Seeing that face on you makes me afraid ... my tiramisu might come back up . CASTOR : Well , think about me . This nose , this hair . This ridiculous chin . [ Sighs ] Brother , we 're going straight . Ooh , my goodness . You exchange brains as well ? First , I need you to confess to the location of the bomb . What about our $ 10 million ? What about when I become a hero for defusing the bomb ? What 's that worth ? Know that . Thank you . Next question . CASTOR : You 're not the only one in the family with brains . POLLUX : No . Although now I am the only one with the looks . Touché . [ Sirens ] [ Sirens ] POLICEMAN ON BULLHORN : This is an emergency evacuation . [ Sirens ] This is an emergency evacuation . COP : Go ! Go ! Move this way ! - Any ideas ? - Yeah . Run . COP : Sir , it 's protected by a tamper switch . It 'll take us hours to bypass . CASTOR : Evacuate your team . No , but , sir , we can 't disarm- - Leave ! [ Singing ] Dee dee dee . Hallelujah ! Hallelujah , hallelujah ! Hallelujah ! [ Singing ] Ha-ha-ha . [ Beeping ] Oh , baby ! Ohh ! REPORTER : That was the scene at the L.A. Convention Center ... where an FBI agent became a city savior . Sean Archer disarmed a massive bomb ... just one second before it was set to blow . The apparent targets were three Supreme Court justices ... scheduled to speak here today ... and anyone unlucky enough to be within a mile of the scene . We asked Agent Archer if the FBI had any leads ... on who planted the device . CASTOR : Well , that is classified information . But , if he 's listening ... I wouldn 't mind giving him a message . Interception ! Now our side 's got the ball ! Sorry . [ Inmates booing ] [ Applause ] CASTOR : Wanda ? Everybody ! Hey , look , I ... I want to thank you ... for , uh ... enduring all these years I was an insufferable bore . [ Laughter ] WANDA : Sir ? Did you just have a surgical procedure ? What do you mean ? Well , was the stick successfully removed from your ass ? [ Laughter ] KIMBERLY : Sir , the White House on one . It 's the President . Oh , and your wife on line two . Will you tell the President to hold ? [ Gasps ] Oh ! [ Gasps ] Oh , my God ! Sean , you scared the hell out of me . CASTOR : It 's date night . Congratulations . Oh , big deal . OK , I said , uh ... " Mr. President ... " l want the authority ... " and I want the funds and the personnel ... " to take over the whole gamut of global terrorism . " Right ? And he said ... " The next name on my calling list is Lazarro . " And I 'm telling him Sean Archer writes his own ticket . OK ? [ Sighs ] What 's the matter ? I don 't know , Sean . You just seem so different . Hmm ? EVE : What is all this about ? This intimate candlelight dinner ? Huh ? I 'm supposed to forget all the promises ... 'cause you 're going back into the fray ? [ Sighs ] If the top cop in this country ... can 't come home every night to his wife ... then the hell with the country ... because the only place I 'm going ... is upstairs with you . GUARD : Exercise . One hour . [ Weapon clicking ] SEAN : How can l get out of here ? HICKS : You can 't . How can I get these boots off ? They only take them off in the clinic ... right before they fry your skull . Hey ! I 'm out of cigarettes . GUARD : Get back in line , Troy . I said I 'm out of cigarettes . Ugh . INMATE : Kick his ass ! HICKS : What the hell ? ! That 's not right ! Aah ! I need a light ! I need a light ! - Anybody got a light ? - All right ! Anybody got a light ? Anybody got a light ? [ Cheering ] [ Sizzling ] MED-TECH : Bring the bastard down before he chokes to death . MED-TECH : Well , happy day . It 's Castor Troy . SEAN : Hey , hold it . Can I have a light ?

Is his your way of not dealing with this morning ? Yeah . Yeah , maybe . Sean ? Sean ! I know it 's hard for you , but it 's hard for me , too ... and we still have to go . Happy birthday , Mikey . He took our baby , Sean . He took our little boy . [ Crying ] WANDA : You turned your beeper off . CASTOR : Yes , well , my son 's birthday . WANDA : Well , here 's some poetic justice , sir . Castor Troy 's dead . AGENT : He got killed trying to escape from Erewhon . CASTOR : Where 's his body ? I want to see his body . WANDA : It hasn 't been recovered yet . It hasn 't been recovered yet ? ! Get the LAPD on this . WANDA : Even if he 's alive ... Castor isn 't stupid enough to come back to the city . [ Sighs ] You must--you must trust me . He 's already here . [ Car alarm chirps ] [ Dialing ] WOMAN : County General . How may I direct your call ? SEAN : Dr. Archer , please . It 's an emergency . - And who 's calling ? - Her husband .

Please , just listen . Take Jamie . Go to your mother 's . Don 't tell him where you 're going . Whoever you are , don 't call again . MAN ON PHONE : Operations .

You wanna leave the country ? SEAN : I 'm not going anywhere . I 'm gonna get Sean Archer ... with your help . OK . Welcome home , baby . Oh ! ALDO : How we supposed to do that ? He 's vulnerable at home . FITCH : No . This is Sean Archer we 're talking about . This isn 't just some Boy Scout . ALDO : Fitch . Besides , his house is probably alarmed up the wazoo . SEAN : Code is 10-19-86 . That 's his dead son 's birthday . Don 't it just break your heart ? Ha . That 's brilliant . But sick . [ Laughter ] ALDO : How is it that you know so much about Sean Archer ? I , uh ... sleep with his wife . [ Laughter ] Christ , this is great . FITCH : So , once we kidnap Supercop , then what ?

I 'm Adam . SEAN : Why don 't you show Adam his new room ? JAMIE : Come on . EVE : OK . INXS : [ Singing ] You shot your mouth off ... like a kid who 's scared to have a heart . Losing grip of what really matters ... 'cause you don 't know where to start . You wake up in the morning ... with a starfuck for a friend . The things you do are so in tune ... with what you 're gonna hate . What 's giving you the will to live ? Is it looking for revenge ? The only life that you 've got left ... is hiding from the pain . What must have happened to your soul ... is skinning you alive . The thing you fear the most is love ... and that 's buried deep inside . Yeah . So deep inside . Don 't lose your head . 'Cause I can 't do the time . Don 't lose your head . Or can you pay the price ? The heart you 're building out of rock ... is turning into sand . 'Cause you never took the time to think ... what it means to be a man . You act like you got the answer ... when the question 's never asked . I 've been to where you 're coming from ... but the postcards weren 't so bad . The knife I carry 's been sharpened ... on the mouths that won 't keep shut . I 'll stab at you in the darkness ... 'cause I 'm trying to shed some light . Your point of view 's so meaningless ... if you ever had one at all . All you seem to care about is who 's gonna take the fall . Who 's gonna take the fall for you ? Don 't lose your head . I can 't do the time for you . Don 't lose your head . Can you pay the price ? Yeah . Mama . Don 't lose your head . 'Cause I can 't do the time . Don 't lose your head . Can you pay the price ? Don 't lose your head . 'Cause I can 't do the time . Don 't lose your head . Can you pay the price ? Don 't lose your head . You can 't do the time . No , don 't lose your head . You cannot pay the price . If you can 't pay the price . Don 't lose your head . You know I can 't do the time . You ain 't worth it to me . You ain 't worth it to me .

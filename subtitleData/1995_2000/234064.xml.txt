 BEHOLD THE MIGHTY COCKROACH . BELIEVED TO HAVE ORIGINATED IN THE SILURIAN PERIOD ... OVER 350 MILLION YEARS AGO . THEY CAN BE FOUND IN EVERY PART OF THE WORLD , FROM THE TROPICS TO THE ARCTIC . THERE EXISTS 4,000 KNOWN SPECIES , AND IN A YEAR , A SINGLE FEMALE CAN PRODUCE OVER HALF A MILLION DESCENDANTS . RADIATION DOESN 'T KILL THEM . BY EVOLUTIONARY STANDARDS , THEY ARE NEARLY FLAWLESS CREATURES , BUT CREATURES NEVERTHELESS . POSSESSING ONLY A SIMPLE NERVOUS SYSTEM , THEIR BEHAVIOR IS DICTATED SOLELY BY RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI . UNLIKE US , THEY ARE INCAPABLE OF THOUGHT , OF ... SELF-ILLUMINATION . COMPARED TO THE ROACH , WE ARE GODS ... AND MUST THEREFORE ACT ACCORDINGLY . IS IT TRUE IF YOU DECAPITATE THEM , THEY CONTINUE TO LIVE , EVENTUALLY DYING OF STARVATION ? LOOK , BUDDY , I JUST KILL ' EM . WELL , THAT 'S WHY I CALLED YOU . I THOUGHT THAT NOWADAYS YOU FROZE THE INSECTS TO DEATH . FREEZE THEM ? WHERE 'S THE FUN IN THAT ? NO , WE GOT A NEW PESTICIDE THAT WORKS LIKE A FUNGUS . IT NOT ONLY KILLS THE INFECTED ROACH , BUT THAT ROACH THEN SPREADS THE DISEASE ... TO EVERY OTHER ROACH IT COMES INTO CONTACT WITH . WELL , JUST AS LONG AS YOU , UH , GET RID OF THEM . BUGS- - I DON 'T KNOW . THEY DRIVE ME CRAZY . [ Spritzing ] WHY , YOU ARROGANT LITTLE- - [ Chirps ] [ Gasping ] [ Panting ] [ Screams ] I FORGOT TO TELL YOU I ALSO FOUND A ROACH ON- - [ Groaning ] [ Cell Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] MULDER . [ Scully ] WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ? I 'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU . MY APARTMENT COMPLEX WAS BEING FUMIGATED , SO I THOUGHT I 'D GET AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND . I CAME UP TO MASSACHUSETTS . - VISITING YOUR MOTHER ? - NO , JUST , UH , SITTING AND THINKING . WIDESPREAD ACCOUNTS OF UNIDENTIFIED COLORED LIGHTS HOVERING IN THE SKIES ... WERE REPORTED IN THIS AREA LAST NIGHT . LOOK , SCULLY , I KNOW IT 'S NOT YOUR INCLINATION , BUT ... DID YOU EVER LOOK UP INTO THE NIGHT SKY ... AND FEEL CERTAIN THAT NOT ONLY WAS SOMETHING UP THERE , BUT ... IT WAS LOOKING DOWN ON YOU AT THAT EXACT SAME MOMENT ... AND WAS JUST AS CURIOUS ABOUT YOU AS YOU ARE ABOUT IT ? MULDER , I THINK THE ONLY THING MORE FORTUITOUS ... THAN THE EMERGENCE OF LIFE ON THIS PLANET IS THAT , THROUGH PURELY RANDOM LAWS OF BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION , AN INTELLIGENCE AS COMPLEX AS OURS EVER EMANATED FROM IT . THE VERY IDEA OF INTELLIGENT ALIEN LIFE ... IS NOT ONLY ASTRONOMICALLY IMPROBABLE , BUT , AT IT 'S MOST BASIC LEVEL , DOWNRIGHT ANTI-DARWINIAN . SCULLY , WHAT ARE YOU WEARING ? I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU 'RE SAYING , BUT I , I JUST NEED TO KEEP LOOKING . YEAH , WELL , DON 'T LOOK TOO HARD . YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE WHAT YOU FIND . ISN 'T THAT WHAT DR. ZAIUS SAID TO CHARLTON HESTON ... AT THE END OF PLANET OF THE APES ? AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED . SCULLY , I GOT TO GO . WHAT ? MULDER , WHAT 'S GOING ON ? [ Dial Tone ] MULDER . HOW YOU DOING ? WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? JUST SITTING , THINKING . SITTING AND THINKING ? AND TALKING ON THE PHONE ? WHO WITH , YOUR DRUG DEALER ? LET ME SEE SOME I.D. THE BUREAU ? YOU ON A CASE ? I HEARD REPORTS OF SEVERAL U.F.O. SIGHTINGS IN THIS AREA LAST NIGHT . YOU SEE ANYTHING ? NO , SIR , NOT PERSONALLY . BUT WE DID RECEIVE A LOT OF TELEPHONE CALLS . ANY MORE CALLS TONIGHT ? NO , SIR . THE F.B.I. KEEPS TABS ON THESE THINGS ? NO . EXCUSE ME , SIR , I DON 'T LIKE TO PRY , BUT WHY ARE YOU SITTING HERE WITH YOUR WIPER BLADES ON ? OH , I WAS JUST KNOCKING OFF SOME BUGS THAT LANDED ON MY- - - LANDED ON MY WINDSHIELD . - COCKROACHES ? MAYBE . MAYBE BEETLES . I DON 'T KNOW . I 'M NOT REALLY GOOD WITH BUGS . [ Woman On Radio ] THIS IS DISPATCH . COME IN . OVER . SORRY TO DISTURB YOU , SIR . WHAT 'S THE MATTER ? ANOTHER ROACH ATTACK . [ Ringing ] - HELLO ? - I THINK YOU BETTER GET UP HERE . WHAT IS IT ? IT APPEARS THAT COCKROACHES ARE MORTALLY ATTACKING PEOPLE . I 'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU IF YOU JUST SAID WHAT I THINK YOU JUST SAID ... BECAUSE I KNOW IT 'S WHAT YOU JUST SAID . I 'M CROUCHING OVER A BUG EXTERMINATOR WHOSE RECENTLY DECEASED BODY ... WAS DISCOVERED WITH COCKROACHES CRAWLING ALL OVER HIM . THE LOCAL SHERIFF SAYS THAT TWO OTHER BODIES WERE FOUND ... IN THE SAME CONDITION THIS AFTERNOON . WHERE ARE YOU AGAIN ? MILLER 'S GROVE . IT HAS A LARGE SCIENCE CONSTITUENCY . THE OTHER INCIDENTS INVOLVED A MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST AND AN ASTROPHYSICIST , AND THE WITNESS TO THIS CASE IS AN ALTERNATIVE FUEL RESEARCHER . THESE REPORTS ARE NOT COMING FROM YAHOOS OUT IN THE BOONDOCKS . THE IMAGE OF THOSE COCKROACHES ... HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY IMPRINTED ONTO MY BRAIN . I SEE THEM EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES . TRY NOT TO CLOSE YOUR EYES . HOW AM I GONNA SLEEP ? AND WHERE ? I 'M CERTAINLY NOT SPENDING THE NIGHT HERE . MAYBE YOU COULD GET A MOTEL ROOM OR SOMETHING . WERE THERE INSECT BITES ON THE BODY ? INSECT BITES ? NO . NO . 'CAUSE YOU KNOW , MULDER , MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY ALLERGIC TO COCKROACHES . THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTED CASES OF FATAL REACTIONS . IT 'S CALLED , UH , ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK . - ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK ? - MM-HMM . MANY SUCH REACTIONS ... HAVE OCCURRED TO ENTOMOLOGISTS OR EXTERMINATORS . OKAY , WE 'LL CHECK THAT OUT . YOU STILL WANT ME TO COME UP ? NO , NO , NO . I 'M SURE YOU 'RE RIGHT . THANKS , SCULLY . WHO WAS THAT ? MY DRUG DEALER . [ Inhaling , Water Bubbling ] [ Exhales ] DUDE , THAT 'S SOME GOOD CRAP . [ Man Chuckling ] COME ON , IT 'S YOUR HOOT . UM , I DON 'T KNOW ABOUT THIS , YOU GUYS . YOU REALLY OUGHT TO , YOU KNOW . TRY IT . THIS STUFF TAKES YOUR MIND AND JUST SORT OF , YOU KNOW , EXPANDS IT . WELL , SOMETHING TELLS ME IT 'S MORE THAN MY MIND YOU GUYS ARE INTERESTED IN EXPANDING . WELL , HOW ABOUT ANOTHER BEER THEN ? - OKAY . - I DON 'T KNOW . I THINK YOU 'RE MAKING A MISTAKE HERE . BEER IS JUST , YOU KNOW , BEER . [ Beeps ] BUT THIS STUFF , IT , LIKE , SWINGS THE DOORS OF PERCEPTION SO WIDE OPEN , YOU CAN SEE WHOLE 'NOTHER WORLD OUT THERE . BUT IT 'S STILL LIKE THIS WORLD , YOU KNOW . IT TWEAKS YOUR MIND ... AND DOES THIS WHOLE ALTERED STATE THING TO IT . AND SUDDENLY , YOU SEE REALITY AS IT , YOU KNOW , REALLY EXISTS . - OH , GOD . - DUDE , WHAT 'S WRONG , MAN ? OH , GOD ! ROACHES ! - DUDE , YOU 'RE FREAKING , MAN ! - ROACHES ! COCKROACHES ! - WHAT 'S THE MATTER , MAN ? - WHAT ? [ Screaming ] [ Phone Ringing ] STAY . [ Whines ] [ Ringing Continues ] HELLO . I TAKE IT BACK , SCULLY . I THINK YOU BETTER GET UP HERE . ANOTHER ROACH ATTACK ? YEAH , AND THIS WAS NO ALLERGIC REACTION . TWO WITNESSES CLAIM THEY SAW THE VICTIM SCREAMING ABOUT COCKROACHES BURROWING INTO HIM . ARE THERE STILL INSECTS IN THE BODY ? WE HAVEN 'T LOCATED ANY YET , BUT THERE ARE WOUNDS ALL OVER THE BODY . FROM THE COCKROACHES ? WELL , THE VICTIM DID ATTEMPT TO EXTRACT THE INSECTS USING A RAZOR BLADE , BUT WE 'RE NOT SURE ALL OF THE INCISIONS ARE SELF-INFLICTED , EXCEPT FOR THE SEVERED ARTERY . WAS THERE ANY EVIDENCE OF DRUG USE AT THE CRIME SCENE ? UH , WELL , HE DID HAVE A HOMEMADE LAB SET UP , BUT I 'M NOT SURE WHAT HE WAS PRODUCING . AW , MAN ! SMELLS LIKE A SEPTIC TANK ! WOULD YOU MAKE SURE THIS GETS ANALYZED HERE ? YOU KNOW , MULDER , THERE 'S A PSYCHOTIC DISORDER ... ASSOCIATED WITH SOME FORMS OF DRUG ABUSE ... WHERE THE ABUSER SUFFERS FROM DELUSIONS THAT INSECTS ARE INFESTING THEIR EPIDERMIS . IT 'S CALLED EKBOM 'S SYNDROME . EKBOM 'S SYNDROME ? THE VICTIM CUTS HIMSELF IN AN ATTEMPT TO EXTRACT THE IMAGINARY INSECT . YOU STILL WANT ME TO COME UP ? NO . YOU 'RE PROBABLY RIGHT . I 'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU . IT 'S NO BOTHER . BYE . [ Dog Barking ] HEY ! KIDS ARE BRAIN-DEAD . I COULDN 'T GET ANYTHING OUT OF THEM . WHAT ABOUT SOME URINE ? FOR A DRUG TEST . DID YOU GET IT ? GET ME A CONTAINER . OH , I THINK I KILLED IT . [ Sheriff ] YOU KILLED IT ? YOU ANNIHILATED IT . IT MUST HAVE MOLTED . IT 'S JUST EMPTY EXOSKELETON . WELL , AT LEAST WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT COCKROACHES WERE ACTUALLY HERE . WE 'VE GOT MORE THAN THAT , SHERIFF . I THINK THAT BUG 'S EXOSKELETON WAS MADE OF METAL . NOTHING MORE THAN A SKIN ABRASION . AN ABRASION CAUSED BY A METALLIC SUBSTANCE ? WHY DON 'T WE WAIT UNTIL THE ANALYSIS OF THE COMPOUND IS FINISHED ... BEFORE JUMPING TO ANY CONCLUSIONS ? UH , AGENT MULDER , AS A DOCTOR , I ALWAYS FIND IT BEST TO BE ... COMPLETELY HONEST AND OPEN WITH MY PATIENTS , NO MATTER HOW UNPLEASANT THE INFORMATION . WHAT DO YOU NEED TO TELL ME ? NO . I NEED YOU TO TELL ME SOMETHING . WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE ? WHA- - ARE WE IN ANY DANGER ? I DON 'T KNOW . WELL , SHOULD I EVACUATE MY FAMILY ? I WOULDN 'T KNOW . DOC , THEY 'RE WAITING FOR YOU TO EXAMINE THE BOY 'S BODY . YEAH , UH , AS SOON I TAKE A LITTLE BREAK . AFTER TALKING WITH AGENT MULDER HERE , I SUDDENLY FEEL SLIGHTLY CONSTIPATED . WHAT 'S HIS PROBLEM ? HE 'S UPSET THAT I DON 'T KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON HERE . SO WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE ? [ Beeps ] I SEE THE CORRELATION , BUT JUST BECAUSE I WORK FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ... DOESN 'T MEAN I 'M AN EXPERT ON COCKROACHES . SO YOU DON 'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT 'S EXPERIMENTS ... BEING CONDUCTED HERE ? EXPERIMENTS ? A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO , AN AGENT CLAIMING TO BE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ... SETS UP BASE ON A COUPLE OF ACRES ACROSS TOWN . NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT 'S GOING ON OUT THERE . IT 'S TOP SECRET , VERY HUSH-HUSH . WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING ? KILLER BEES WERE A GENETIC EXPERIMENT GONE AWRY , LET LOOSE ON AN UNSUSPECTING POPULACE . WHO 'S TO SAY THE GOVERNMENT HASN 'T CREATED A NEW BREED OF KILLER COCKROACHES ? YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP THAT THEORY TO YOURSELF , SHERIFF . NO NEED TO CREATE A PANIC . [ Man ] OH ! OH , MY GOD ! HELP ! SOMEBODY HELP ! HEY ! WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED ? COCKROACHES . HE WAS COVERED IN COCKROACHES . I DON 'T SEE ANY ROACHES . WHEN I WENT OUT TO LOOK FOR HELP AND I CAME BACK , THEY DISAPPEARED . GENTLY . GENTLY . HMM . DOESN 'T APPEAR ODD IN ANY- - OOH ! [ Beeps ] NEXT TIME , LET ME HANDLE THE ROACHES . [ Ringing ] - WHO DIED NOW ? - THE MEDICAL EXAMINER . HIS BODY WAS FOUND NEXT TO A TOILET , COVERED WITH ROACHES . I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD COME- - A TOILET ? CHECK HIS EYES . IS ONE OF THEM BLOODSHOT WITH A DILATED PUPIL ? - YEAH . - WELL , IT 'S PROBABLY A BRAIN ANEURYSM . BRAIN ANEURYSM ? STRAINING TOO FORCEFULLY ... IS VERY COMMON CAUSATION FOR BURSTING A BRAIN ANEURYSM . WELL , HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE ROACHES THOUGH ? DID YOU CATCH ANY ? ALMOST . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU , MULDER . I JUST HOPE YOU 'RE NOT IMPLYING YOU 'VE COME ACROSS AN INFESTATION ... OF KILLER COCKROACHES . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] MULDER . [ Scully ] MULDER ? I 'VE BEEN DOING SOME RESEARCH . BACK IN THE MID - ' 80s , THERE WAS A COCKROACH SPECIES PREVIOUSLY ONLY FOUND IN ASIA , AND SINCE THEN , IT 'S MADE AN APPEARANCE IN FLORIDA . THEY 'VE NOW COMPLETELY ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN THIS COUNTRY . DO THEY ATTACK PEOPLE ? NO , BUT THEY EXHIBIT BEHAVIOR DIFFERENT THAN DOMESTIC BREEDS . THEY FLY FOR LONG DISTANCES , AND THEY 'RE ATTRACTED TO LIGHT . - BUT DO THEY ATTACK PEOPLE ? - I 'M SUGGESTING THAT WHAT 'S HAPPENING OUT THERE ... MIGHT BE THE INTRODUCTION TO THIS COUNTRY OF A NEW SPECIES OF COCKROACH , ONE THAT IS ATTRACTED TO PEOPLE . WELL , THAT ALL MAKES PERFECT SENSE , SCULLY . I DON 'T LIKE IT AT ALL . DID YOU KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT , UNDER THE GUISE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE , HAS BEEN CONDUCTING SECRET EXPERIMENTS UP HERE ? YOU 'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT TRESPASSING ONTO GOVERNMENT PROPERTY AGAIN , ARE YOU ? I KNOW THAT YOU 'VE DONE IT IN THE PAST , BUT I DON 'T THINK THAT THIS CASE WARRANTS- - IT 'S TOO LATE . I 'M ALREADY INSIDE . [ Sighs ] WELL , WHAT 'S GOING ON ? WHAT DO YOU SEE ? I 'M IN A HOUSE . IT 'S APPARENTLY EMPTY . - WHAT DOES THE PLACE LOOK LIKE ? - IT 'S A , UH ... TYPICAL TWO-STORY SUBURBAN HOUSE . NICE BIG LIVING ROOM , SPARSELY FURNISHED . NICE CARPETS , FIREPLACE . NICE KITCHEN . MODERN APPLIANCES . - MOVING WALLS . - MOVING WALLS ? YEAH . THEY 'RE RIPPLING . OH ! COCKROACHES ! WHAT ? COCKROACHES . THEY 'RE EVERYWHERE . AH ! I 'M SURROUNDED ! MULDER , YOU 'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THERE RIGHT NOW . NOOO ! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ? WHAT HAPPENED ? FLASHLIGHT WENT OUT . MULDER , WHAT 'S GOING ON ? GOTTA GO . MULDER ! MULDER ! [ Dial Tone ] MAY I ASK WHY YOU 'RE TRESPASSING ON GOVERNMENT PROPERTY ? I 'M A FEDERAL AGENT . SO AM I. AGENT MULDER , F.B.I. DOCTOR BERENBAUM , U.S.D.A. AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE . DOCTOR BERENBAUM , I 'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS . FOR INSTANCE ? WHAT 'S A WOMAN LIKE YOU DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS ? BY STUDYING HOW INSECTS RESPOND TO CHANGES IN LIGHT , TEMPERATURE , AIR CURRENTS , FOOD AVAILABILITY , WE CAN DETERMINE THE BEST WAYS TO ERADICATE THEM . WHY ALL THE SECRECY ABOUT YOUR RESEARCH ? YOU 'VE GOT SOME OF THE GOOD TOWNSPEOPLE SUSPICIOUS . YOU EXPECT US TO ADVERTISE THAT WE 'VE INTENTIONALLY ... INFESTED A HOUSE IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THOUSANDS OF COCKROACHES ? BUT THOSE , THOSE COCKROACHES , ARE THEY A NORMAL SPECIES ? THEY 'RE A COMMON ONE . HAVE YOU EVER COME ACROSS A TYPE OF COCKROACH THAT IS ATTRACTED TO PEOPLE ? MOST COCKROACHES HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO ACTUALLY WASH THEMSELVES ... AFTER BEING TOUCHED BY HUMANS . REALLY . SO YOU 'VE NEVER SEEN AN INSTANCE WHERE A COCKROACH ACTUALLY ATTACKS A HUMAN BEING ? WELL , THERE HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE A COCKROACH HAS CRAWLED INTO A PERSON 'S EAR OR NOSE . NOSE ? WHAT IS THAT THERE ? OH , IT 'S JUST A PET PROJECT OF MINE . SINCE AN INSECT 'S EXOSKELETON IS A DIELECTRIC ... SURROUNDING THE CONDUCTIVE MEDIUM OF ITS BODY FLUID , WHEN INTRODUCED INTO AN ELECTRICAL FIELD , THE BRUSHED DISCHARGE WILL RESULT IN A COLORED FLARE . WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO PROVE ? WELL , IT 'S MY THEORY THAT U.F.O.s ARE ACTUALLY INSECT SWARMS . I DON 'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT U.F.O.s , BUT ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A TYPICAL SIGHTING ... ARE SHARED WITH NOCTURNAL INSECTS ... SWARMING THROUGH AN ELECTRICAL AIR FIELD . THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF A COLORED , GLOWING LIGHT HOVERING IN THE NIGHT SKY , MOVING IN A NONMECHANICAL MATTER , POSSIBLY HUMMING , CREATING INTERFERENCE WITH RADIO AND TELEVISION SIGNALS , THEN SUDDENLY DISAPPEARING . AS , UH , NOCTURNAL INSECT SWARMS , THAT 'S , UH , THAT 'S FASCINATING . EVERYTHING ABOUT INSECTS IS FASCINATING . THEY ARE TRULY REMARKABLE CREATURES . SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO HONEST . HONEST ? EAT , SLEEP , DEFECATE , PROCREATE . THAT 'S ALL THEY DO . THAT 'S ALL WE DO , BUT AT LEAST INSECTS DON 'T KID THEMSELVES THAT IT 'S ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT . DOES MY SCIENTIFIC DETACHMENT DISTURB YOU ? NO . NO , ACTUALLY , I , I FIND IT QUITE REFRESHING . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] NOT NOW . YOU KNOW , UM- - I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND INSECTS TO BE VERY INTERESTING . REALLY ? THIS IS THE FIFTH REPORT OF A DECEASED BODY ... BEING FOUND AMONGST A HORDE OF COCKROACHES , BUT POLICE ARE NOT CONFIRMING , AT LEAST NOT YET , THAT THE INSECTS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FATALITIES . POLICE HAVE ALSO DISAFFIRMED THE RUMOR THAT THESE DEATHS WERE THE RESULT ... OF AN OUTBREAK OF THE EBOLA VIRUS ... SOMEHOW BEING SPREAD BY INFECTED COCKROACHES . AS FOR NOW , THESE INCIDENTS REMAIN UNDER LOCAL JURISDICTION , [ Beeps ] BUT A NURSE HERE DID CONFIRM THAT AN F.B.I. AGENT IS ON THE CASE . POLICE ARE ASKING THAT IF YOU SEE ANY COCKROACHES , DON 'T PANIC . SIMPLY NOTIFY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND EVACUATE THE AREA IMMEDIATELY . REPORTING LIVE , THIS IS SKYE LEIKIN FOR CHANNEL THREE , NIGHTWATCH NEWS . THEN SUDDENLY , THERE WAS THIS TERRIBLE CRASH . YOU KNOW , YOU COULD 'VE BEEN KILLED . [ Blowing Nose ] [ Ringing ] MULDER , ARE YOU OKAY ? I CAN 'T SLEEP . WHAT HAPPENED AT THE U.S.D.A. SITE ? THEY 'RE CONDUCTING LEGITIMATE EXPERIMENTS . I MET AN ENTOMOLOGIST , DR. BERENBAUM , WHO AGREES WITH YOUR THEORY OF AN ACCIDENTAL IMPORTATION OF A NEW COCKROACH SPECIES . DID HE GIVE YOU ANY IDEA OF HOW TO CATCH THEM ? NO . BUT SHE DID TELL ME EVERYTHING ELSE THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT INSECTS . SHE ? YEAH . DID YOU KNOW THAT THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS ... WORSHIPPED THE SCARAB BEETLE AND POSSIBLY ERECTED THE PYRAMIDS ... TO HONOR THEM , WHICH MAY JUST BE GIANT SYMBOLIC DUNG HEAPS ? DID YOU KNOW THE INVENTOR OF THE FLUSH TOILET WAS NAMED THOMAS CRAPPER ? BAMBI ALSO HAS THIS THEORY I 'VE NEVER COME ACRO- - WHO ? DR. BERENBAUM . ANYWAY , HER THEORY IS- - HER NAME IS BAMBI ? YEAH . BOTH HER PARENTS WERE NATURALISTS . HER THEORY IS THAT U.F.O.s ARE ACTUALLY NOCTURNAL INSECT SWARMS ... PASSING THROUGH ELECTRICAL AIR FIELDS . HER NAME IS BAMBI ? SCULLY , CAN I CONFESS SOMETHING TO YOU ? YEAH , SURE , OKAY . I HATE INSECTS . YOU KNOW , LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF INSECTS , MULDER . IT 'S JUST A- - IT 'S A NATURAL , INSTINCTIVE- - NO , NO , I 'M NOT AFRAID OF THEM . I HATE THEM . ONE DAY BACK WHEN I WAS A KID , I WAS , UH , I WAS CLIMBING THIS TREE WHEN I NOTICED THIS LEAF WALKING TOWARDS ME . IT TOOK FOREVER TO REALIZE THAT IT WAS NO LEAF . - A PRAYING MANTIS ? - YEAH , I HAD A PRAYING MANTIS EPIPHANY . AND AS A RESULT , I SCREAMED . NO , NOT A GIRLIE SCREAM , BUT THE SCREAM OF SOMEONE BEING CONFRONTED BY SOME BEFORE UNKNOWN MONSTER ... THAT HAD NO RIGHT EXISTING ON THE SAME PLANET I INHABITED . DID YOU EVER NOTICE HOW A PRAYING MANTIS ' HEAD RESEMBLES AN ALIEN 'S HEAD ? THE MYSTERIES OF THE NATURAL WORLD WERE REVEALED TO ME THAT DAY , BUT INSTEAD OF BEING ASTOUNDED , I WAS ... REPULSED . MULDER , ARE YOU SURE IT WASN 'T A GIRLIE SCREAM ? - [ Man Screaming ] - WHAT WAS THAT ? - OH , I GOT TO GO . - MUL- - NO- - OHH ! DID YOU HEAR THAT TOO ? CAME FROM OVER THERE . WHAT THE HELL 'S GOING ON ? HELLO ? IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT IN THERE ? [ Screaming ] DON 'T GO IN THERE , MAN ! [ Phone Ringing ] WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME ? ONE OF THE MOTEL GUESTS DIED . MULDER , I 'M COMING UP THERE RIGHT NOW . SCULLY , I THINK THIS MAN DIED SIMPLY FROM A REACTION TO THE COCKROACHES . TWO CASES OF ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK ... IN THE SAME DAY IN THE SAME TOWN IS HIGHLY IMPROBABLE . NO . I 'M SAYING THAT I THINK THIS MAN SIMPLY HAD A HEART ATTACK . WORD ABOUT THE COCKROACH INFESTATION ... AND THE DEATHS RELATED TO IT HAS GOTTEN OUT , AND I THINK THIS MAN SIMPLY SAW SOME COCKROACHES AND SCARED HIMSELF TO DEATH . REGARDLESS , MULDER , SOMETHING STRANGE IS GOING ON OUT THERE . MAYBE NOT . ALL YOUR CONJECTURES HAVE PROVED CORRECT . THE EXTERMINATOR DID DIE FROM ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK . THE TEENAGE BOY DID DIE FROM SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS ... AND WAS GETTING HIGH OFF METHANE FUMES DERIVED FROM BURNING MANURE . THE MEDICAL EXAMINER DID DIE FROM A BRAIN ANEURYSM . I STILL HAVEN 'T BEEN ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE COCKROACHES AT ALL THESE SITES . OR THE FACT THAT THEIR EXOSKELETONS ARE MADE OF METAL . METAL ? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? MULDER ? MULDER , I 'M COMING UP THERE . WHATEVER . CAN YOU TELL WHAT KIND OF COCKROACH IT IS ? I SHOULD BE ABLE TO . THE ABDOMEN 'S STILL ATTACHED , AND WE DIFFERENTIATE SPECIES BY THEIR GENITALIA . OH MY GOD . IS IT ABNORMAL ? I 'LL SAY . HE 'S HUNG LIKE A CLUB-TAILED DRAGONFLY . EXCUSE ME . DOES IT STILL LOOK UNUSUAL ? WELL , YES , FOR AN INSECT GENITALIA , BUT MAYBE NOT FOR A MICROPROCESSOR . YOU 'RE IMPLYING THAT THIS INSECT IS MECHANICAL ? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AT HERE ? HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE ? ONLY IN SCIENCE JOURNALS . I 'VE READ ABOUT AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCHER ... WHO DESIGNS ROBOTS THAT RESEMBLE AND BEHAVE LIKE INSECTS . I 'VE NEVER SEEN THEM MYSELF , BUT I 'VE OFTEN THOUGHT OF VISITING HIS LAB . HE WORKS OUT OF THIS TOWN ? [ Whirring ] [ Whirring ] - DOCTOR IVANOV ? - WHY ARE YOU SCARING MY ROBOTS ? FOR DECADES , MY COLLEAGUES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ... HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CREATE AN AUTONOMOUS ROBOT . BY STRUGGLING TO GIVE THEIR MACHINES ... A HUMAN-LIKE BRAIN , THEY HAVE FAILED . A HUMAN BRAIN IS TOO COMPLEX , TOO COMPUTATIONAL . IT THINKS TOO MUCH . BUT INSECTS MERELY REACT . I USE INSECTS AS MY MODEL , NOT JUST IN DESIGN BUT BY GIVING THEM THE SIMPLEST OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS . " GO TO THE OBJECT . GO AWAY FROM MOVING OBJECT . " GOVERNED ONLY BY SENSORS AND REFLEX RESPONSES , THEY TAKE ON THE BEHAVIOR OF INTELLIGENT LIVING BEINGS . SO THIS ONE IS JUST PROGRAMMED TO HEAD TOWARDS ANY OBJECT ... MOVING WITHIN THE FIELD OF ITS SENSORS ? NO . THEN WHY IS IT FOLLOWING ME ? IT LIKES YOU . YOUR CONTRACT IS WITH NASA ? THE GOAL IS TO TRANSPORT A FLEET OF ROBOTS ... TO ANOTHER PLANET AND ALLOW THEM TO NAVIGATE THE TERRAIN ... WITH MORE INTRICACY THAN ANY SPACE PROBE HAS DONE BEFORE . IT SOUNDS SLIGHTLY FANTASTIC , BUT THE ONLY OBSTACLE I CAN FORESEE ... IS DEVISING A RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE . IN ANY CASE , THIS IS THE FUTURE OF SPACE EXPLORATION . IT DOES NOT INCLUDE LIVING ENTITIES . I 'M JUST SPECULATING HERE , BUT IF EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE-FORMS DO EXIST- - OH , THERE 'S NO NEED FOR SPECULATION . I BELIEVE THEY DO . AND ASSUMING THAT THEY 'RE MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED THAN WE ARE , AND IF YOUR OWN IDEAS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF SPACE EXPLORATION ARE CORRECT , THEN- - THEN THE INTERPLANETARY EXPLORERS OF ALIEN CIVILIZATIONS ... WILL LIKELY BE MECHANICAL IN NATURE . YES . ANYONE WHO THINKS ALIEN VISITATION ... WILL COME NOT IN THE FORM OF ROBOTS , BUT OF LIVING BEINGS WITH BIG EYES AND GRAY SKIN ... HAS BEEN BRAINWASHED BY TOO MUCH SCIENCE FICTION . CAN YOU IDENTIFY THIS ? I 'M NOT REALLY GOOD WITH BUGS . A CRICKET 'S LEG ? TRY IT UNDER THE MICROSCOPE . ARE YOU ALL RIGHT , DR. IVANOV ? CAN YOU IDENTIFY THAT ? [ No Audio Dialogue ] SIR ? IT 'S ... BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION . HEY , KID , MOVE IT ! GIMME THAT ! [ Yelling ] [ Man ] BACK OFF , BUDDY ! GET IT ! HURRY UP ! GET YOUR OWN ! I SAW IT FIRST ! [ Yelling Continues ] [ Tires Screeching ] [ Man Shouting ] HEY , WHAT ARE YOU , CRAZY ? WHY ARE YOU STOPPING ? [ Woman ] HEY , YOU IDIOT , YOU HIT ME ! [ Man ] WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE ! EXCUSE ME , DO YOU SELL ROAD MAPS ? COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE THEY ARE ? COME ON , HURRY UP ! WHAT 'S GOING ON HERE ? HAVEN 'T YOU HEARD ABOUT THE ROACHES ? THEY 'RE DEVOURING PEOPLE WHOLE . EVERYBODY 'S GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE . HAVE YOU SEEN ANY COCKROACHES YOURSELF ? NO , BUT THEY 'RE EVERYWHERE . ROACHES AREN 'T ATTACKING PEOPLE , LADY . THEY 'RE SPREADING THE EBOLA VIRUS . LOOK , KEEP THE CHANGE . WE 'RE ALL GONNA BE BLEEDING FROM OUR NIPPLES ! ALL RIGHT . ALL RIGHT , LISTEN UP ! I 'M AGENT DANA SCULLY ... FROM THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION . I AM ASSURING YOU THAT YOU ARE NOT IN ANY DANGER . EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE OKAY IF YOU JUST CALM DOWN AND START ACTING RATIONALLY . NOW , WHERE THE HELL ARE THOSE ROAD MAPS ? HEY ! THIS LAST CAN IS MINE ! - ROACHES ! - [ Screaming ] [ Engines Starting , Tires Screeching , Horns Honking ] WELL , DOCTOR , I , UH , I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS . YEAH . GREETINGS FROM PLANET EARTH . WELL , IT 'S A COCKROACH , ALL RIGHT . IT 'S NOT LIKE THE LEG SEGMENT YOU HAD ME EXAMINE EARLIER . IT 'S JUST A TYPICAL COCKROACH . EVEN THE ... YES , EVEN THE GENITALIA IS NORMAL . COCKROACHES ARE COMMON IN THIS AREA AT THIS TIME OF YEAR . IT 'S ONE OF THE REASONS I SET UP MY STUDY HERE . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - MULDER . - MULDER , THIS TOWN IS INSANE . WHERE ARE YOU ? I 'M IN A CONVENIENCE STORE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF , UH ... CIVILIZATION . LOOK , I THINK I MAY HAVE A LEAD . REMEMBER THAT DR. ECKERLE WHO WAS THE ALTERNATIVE FUEL RESEARCHER ... THAT WITNESSED THE EXTERMINATOR 'S DEATH ? WELL , THE FUEL THAT HE 'S RESEARCHING IS METHANE GAS . METHANE DERIVED FROM MANURE . MANURE ? HE HAS AN IMPORT LICENSE ... TO BRING IN ANIMAL DUNG SAMPLES FROM OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY . NOW , MAYBE YOU CAN CONFIRM THIS WITH YOUR DR. BAMBI , BUT I THINK THAT COCKROACHES ARE DUNG-EATERS . AND IF SO , SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE BEEN SHIPPED ACCIDENTALLY IN SOME OF THE SAMPLES . THIS FUEL RESEARCH FACILITY COULD BE GROUND ZERO FOR THE INFESTATION . SCULLY , IF AN ALIEN CIVILIZATION WERE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED ENOUGH ... TO BUILD AND SEND ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT ROBOTIC PROBES ... TO THE FARTHEST REACHES OF SPACE , MIGHT THEY NOT HAVE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO PERFECT THE EXTRACTION OF METHANE FUEL FROM MANURE , AN ABUNDANT AND REPLENISHING ENERGY SOURCE ON A PLANET ... FILLED WITH DUNG-PRODUCING CREATURES ? MULDER , I THINK YOU 'VE BEEN IN THIS TOWN TOO LONG . WHERE 'S THE RESEARCH FACILITY LOCATED ? WAIT , BAMBI . YOU BETTER WAIT HERE UNTIL I MAKE SURE IT 'S SAFE . BE CAREFUL . WE STILL DON 'T KNOW WHAT THESE COCKROACHES ARE CAPABLE OF , IF THEY 'RE EVEN COCKROACHES . I 'M NOT SO MUCH WORRIED ABOUT THE COCKROACHES AS I AM ABOUT THE HUMAN ELEMENT . [ Cockroaches Chirping , Beeping ] [ Cockroach Beeps ] [ Beeping ] [ Beeping Continues ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gasps ] DR. ECKERLE ? THEY 'RE AFTER ME . FIRST AT MY HOUSE , THEN AT THE MOTEL , AND THEN I CAME HERE TO GET AWAY , BUT ... THEY 'RE FOLLOWING ME . YOU 'RE NOT IN ANY DANGER . THESE INSECTS WON 'T HARM YOU . I 'VE SEEN THEM KILL TWO MEN . THEY WEREN 'T RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE DEATHS , BUT THEY MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OURS IF YOU CONTINUE FIRING YOUR GUN ... IN A PLANT FULL OF METHANE GAS . DON 'T YOU UNDERSTAND ? THE BUGS . THEY DRIVE ME CRAZY . LET ME GUESS . BAMBI . FOX TOLD ME TO WAIT OUT HERE WHILE HE CHECKED INSIDE FIRST . SHOULD I COME ALONG WITH YOU ? NO . THIS IS NO PLACE FOR AN ENTOMOLOGIST . [ Beeping Continues ] WHY ARE THESE ROACHES MAKING THOSE WEIRD NOISES ? IN MADAGASCAR , THEY HAVE ROACHES THAT HISS ... BY BLOWING AIR THROUGH THE HOLES IN THEIR UPPER THORAX . REALLY ? HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THEM ? I DON 'T . THAT 'S WHY WE SHOULDN 'T KILL THESE , BUT CAPTURE THEM FOR FURTHER STUDY . NOW , PLEASE . PUT THE GUN DOWN . HAVE I LOST MY MIND ? NO . YOU 'VE JUST HAD A VERY STRESSFUL DAY ... THAT 'S AFFECTED YOUR ABILITY TO THINK CLEARLY . YOUR JUDGMENT IS A LITTLE CLOUDED RIGHT NOW . IT IS ? THEN HOW DO I KNOW THAT YOU 'RE NOT A COCKROACH ? MULDER ! MULDER ! [ Cell Phone Beeping ] I ASSURE YOU , DR. ECKERLE , I 'M JUST AS HUMAN AS YOU ARE , IF NOT MORE SO . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] YOUAREONE OF THEM ! [ Gunshot ] MULDER ! GET OUT , SCULLY ! THIS WHOLE PLACE COULD BLOW ! GET DOWN ! CRAP . IT 'S LIKE A CREMATORIUM IN THERE . I DON 'T THINK WE 'RE GONNA LOCATE THE DOCTOR 'S REMAINS . OR ANYTHING ELSE . STILL , IT 'S NOT AS BAD AS SOME OF THE OTHER FIRES ... WE HAD LAST NIGHT . THERE WERE OTHERS ? FOUR , TO BE EXACT , PLUS 18 AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS , 13 ASSAULT AND BATTERIES . TWO STORES WERE LOOTED . THIRTY-SIX INJURIES ALL TOTAL , HALF OF THEM FROM INSECTICIDE POISONING . BUT WE DIDN 'T RECEIVE REPORTS ON COCKROACHES OR OTHERWISE FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS . MAYBE THIS TOWN 'S FINALLY COME TO ITS SENSES . YOU TWO OUGHT TO GO HOME AND GET SOME REST . YOU LOOK POOPED . [ Dr. Ivanov ] AGENT MULDER ! THEY TOLD ME I COULD LOCATE YOU HERE . THOSE SEGMENTS YOU SHOWED ME EARLIER , MAY I EXAMINE THEM AGAIN ? WELL , THEY 'RE COMPLETELY DESICCATED , JUST LIKE THE MOLTED EXOSKELETON . YOU KNOW , MANY INSECTS DON 'T DEVELOP WINGS ... UNTIL THEIR LAST MOLTING STAGE . PERHAPS WHATEVER THESE THINGS WERE , THEY HAD THEIR FINAL MOLT AND HAVE FLOWN OFF BACK TO WHEREVER THEY ORIGINATED . YEAH , THAT WOULD EXPLAIN EVERYTHING . MAY I BORROW THIS , AGENT MULDER , FOR FURTHER STUDY ? I 'VE ALREADY HAD A SIMILAR SAMPLE ANALYZED . IT 'S NOTHING BUT COMMON METALS . WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO FIND FROM IT ? HIS DESTINY . ISN 'T THAT WHAT DR. ZAIUS SAID TO ZIRA ... AT THE END OF THE PLANET OF THE APES ? IT 'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES . MINE TOO . I LOVE SCIENCE FICTION . I 'M ALSO FASCINATED BY YOUR RESEARCH . HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED PROGRAMMING THE ROBOTS ... TO MIMIC THE BEHAVIOR OF SOCIAL INSECTS LIKE ANTS OR BEES ? AS A MATTER OF FACT , I HAVE . YOU KNOW , I READ IN NOVEMBER OF ' 94 INENTOMOLOGY EXTREME- - OH , I REMEMBER THAT . YOUR ARTICLE ABOUT COLONIZATION- - YES , I REALLY ENJOYED WRITING THAT . SMART IS SEXY . WELL , THINK OF IT THIS WAY , MULDER . BY THE TIME THERE 'S ANOTHER INVASION OF ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT ... DUNG-EATING ROBOTIC PROBES FROM OUTER SPACE , MAYBE THEIR UBER-CHILDREN WILL HAVE DEVISED A WAY TO SAVE OUR PLANET . YOU KNOW , I NEVER THOUGHT I 'D SAY THIS TO YOU , SCULLY , BUT YOU SMELL BAD .

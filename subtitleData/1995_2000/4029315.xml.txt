Bad idea . - Hey , Dredd ! Come and get us ! - I knew they 'd do that . - Judge Dredd , take cover ! They 're firing 20 millimeter caseless flechet rounds at 300 meters . The effective lethal range is 200 meters . You 're safe ! What are you doing down there , Judge Hershey ? Waiting for backup . It 's here . Let 's move it out !

Violence struck again in Mega City tonight , taking a deadly tall . 53 hospitalized . 5 of them children . 19 dead . Damn it ! I 'm supposed to be watchin ' out for him . Don 't blame yourself , Hershey . He made the mistake , not you . Wouldn 't it feel good to have an emotion once in a while , huh ? Emotions ... There outta be a law against them . Eat recycled food . It 's good for ... Halt ! ... and okay for you . Please , make your selection . Insert your credit in the slot ... - You have 5 seconds to surrender ! - Dredd , it 's just a servadroid . Five ... four ... three ... two ... one ! Boy , am I glad to see you ! Mega City Code 75-92 . Willful sabotage of a public droid . That 's 6 months , citizen . Let 's see your Unicard ! Come on , give me a break , Judge ... Judge Dredd . Dredd ? Holy God ! Ferguson , Herman . Hacker . Illegal tampering with city droids , computers , cash machines , taxi robots ... And you haven 't been out of jail for 24 hours . He 's habitual , Hershey . Automatic 5 year sentence . How do you plead ? - Not guilty ? - I knew you 'd say that . - 5 years ? No , no ! I ... I had no choice ! They were killing each other in there ! You could 've gone out the window . 40 floors ? It would 've been suicide ! Maybe . But it 's legal . Judges ! - Yes , sir . - What ? ! Five years , Aspen Penitentiary ! Case closed . Take him away ! Don 't close the case ! You 're misjudging me ! You 're midjudging me ! Open the case ! You 're not gonna be able to sleep tonight . He might 've been telling the truth , you know ? Haven 't you ever heard of extenuating circumstances ? I 've heard it all , Hershey . I knew you 'd say that . My fellow Judges , have we forgotten the lessons of history ? However quickly these block wars can be contained , it 's clear that they 're becoming an epidemic ! An epidemic that should be dealt with ... immediately . The only solution is a tougher criminal code . Our situation gets worse every day . 73 citizen riots in 16 different sectors in the last two months alone ! - Violent crime is rising at 15 percent every quarter ! If we don 't increase our resources , they will be inadequate . In less than three years . Three years ? Our resources are inadequate now ! My fellow council members . As a city , we continue to grow . Growth is painful . 65 million people living in an area designed for no more than 20 ! It 's not enough that they rely on us for food , clothes , water , clean air ... Chief Justice . The city is in chaos ! For social order we need tighter reins ! Incarceration hasn 't worked as a deterrent . I say we expand execution to include lesser crimes ! My fellow Judges . I was barely in my teens when I put on this badge . When the time comes for me to take it off , please , let me do so ... knowing that it still stands for freedom . And not for repression . 53 hospitalized . 19 dead ! 4 of them killed by a gang of squatters , who were themselves killed in summary executions by Judge Dredd . As my special undercover report continues , I will take you behind the scenes of the halls of Justice for a disturbing probe into these recent riots and block wars . Coincidence ... or deliberate ? Dredd ? You know , some people think working these mean streets has a dehumanizing effect ... - Joseph . - Chief Justice Fargo . You may stand at ease , Joseph . So , tell me , seven summary executions ? Were they necessary ? - Unavoidable , sir . - Unavoidable . Life doesn 't mean much to some people any more . You 'd see that if you weren 't always ... - If I weren 't what ? - Always at the Academy , sir . Oh , don 't you mean ... at the Academy wiping cadets ' asses ? That 's what they say in the squad room , isn 't it ? It 's irrelevant . You set the standards , sir . And now you do . At least to many young cadets ... you 're a legend . Sir . - You remember your days as a cadet , Joseph ? - I remember what you taught me , sir . You were my finest student . So , I got a new assignment for you . Starting tomorrow , you 're going to spend two days a week at the Academy . I 'd be honored , sir . Unarmed combat or marksmanship ? Ethics . Wait here . - Remain still . Identify yourself . - Miller . Warden . Voice sample recognized . Thank you , warden . System disarmed . Why are you here ? You come for another chat ? Just a short one , I 'm afraid . Duty calls . Ah , duty . Feeding these parasites here ? At the public 's expense ? Yeah . You especially . I don 't cost anything ! I 'm a ghost . And we 're both prisoners here . You 're behind your desk . And I 'm behind this . What a clever reward from Fargo . I mean considering the services . When you started killing innocent people , Rico , you went beyond service . The innocent exist only until inevitably they become perpetrators . Like you . Guilt and innocence ... is a matter of timing . Your ... our mysterious benefactor has sent you a package . Deactivate shield . Auto guns only . Auto guns reactivated , warden Miller . - What is that ? - That 's an ancient puzzle ... that contains the meaning of life . So , tell me , Rico . What is the meaning of life ? It ends ! Activate ... alarm ! Voice not recognized . Guns are training . Remain still . Security ! Override and unlock ! Come on ! Kevlar-9 helmet and body armor . Yours ... when you graduate . Lawgiver 2 . 25 rounds of side arm with mission variable voice programmed ammunition . Signal flare ! - Flare . Yours ... if you graduate . Mark-4 Lawmaster , improved model . With dual on-board laser canon , vertical take-off and landing flight capabilities . Range : 500 kilometers . Men ? Yes , sir . Active . Malfunction . Malfunction . Malfunction . Yours if you can ever get it to work . All of these things you see here are toys . At the end of the day , when you 're all alone in the dark , the only thing that counts ... is this . The law . And you will be alone when you swear to uphold these ideals . For most of us is only death in the streets . For the few of us that survived to old age , the proud loneliness of the Long Walk . A walk that every Judge must take outside these city walls . Into the unknown of the Cursed Earth . And there spend your last remaining days taking law ... to the lawless . This is what it means to be a Judge . This is the commitment I expect . Class dismissed . I can hear you thinking . I caught your lecture today . Is that really what you think the cadets need to hear ? - What I told them is the truth . - Your truth maybe . You made it sound like our lives are practically over ! Don 't you think ... parts are , Hershey ? I have a personal life . I have friends . You 're one of the smartest of the new breed . But you 've only been on the street a year . You haven 't gotten used to the isolation yet . No . No , I don 't think that 's right . No one is supposed to be alone all the time . I mean , is that really what it 's been like for you ? Don 't you ever ... ? Haven 't you ever had a friend ? Yes . Once . What happened ? Dredd ! Wait . I wanna know . What happened ? I judged him . Active shuttle has completed uploading . - Cargo on morgue shipments from Aspen . - Okay . Let 's get out of here . We 're closed for the night . You 're holding a package for me . The code name is Lazarus . I 'll just be a second . You got a nice place . Yeah . A lot of this is antiques . That 's funny . I thought they destroyed all these ABC Warriors during the last war . Well , you can still collect ' em . As long as they 're non-functioning . Like my wife . Yeah , these must ... be 50 or 60 years old now . Anyway ... There you go . Hey , wait a second ! Don 't touch it ! - Why is that ? - Well , it 's a Lawgiver . That 's programmed to only recognize a Judge 's hand . You touch that , it 'll take your arm off ! Gee . How do you like that ? I must be a Judge . Happy birthday . Status ? Bodyguard . - Commander ? - Rico . - Mission ? - Mission ? We 're going to war . War . I followed up some grumblings confirming a suspicion of mine . The cancer of oppression goes far deeper than the Street Judges . And you 're going to say that over the air ? - It 's the truth . - Oh , Vardis , you 're insane . I 'm a reporter . They 'll never going to let this get on to the air , Vardis . Something like this could bring down the Council . Maybe it should . The whole system is the problem . Not just Judge ... Dredd ! No ! Judge Hershey . Corner of Burns and Allen , level D , possible D.W. , may need assistance . Okay , hang on to your seat , cause here we go ! - Step out of the car , please . - What the hell 's the problem now ? Get out of the car ! Unicard , please ! Did you hear me ? Unicard ! Mr. Susa . You have a suspended license . You got 3 counts of driving under the influence . Hey ! You better listen ! I suggest you walk away and bother somebody else ! When I said I have powerful friends , I mean powerful ! - We having a problem here , Hershey ? - Not at all , Dredd . Nothing that I can 't handle . Suspended license . Three DUIs . Ah , this is getting boring . Hey , okay . So , wha-what 's the tab ? Come on . How much is this gonna cost me ? You name your price . Hershey , call control for an H-wagon . What ? I don 't believe it . You 're gonna tow me ? ! Towing is for a first offense . This is your 4th violation , bar breath . You 're a menace . How do you plead ? - Not guilty . - I knew you 'd say that . - Hey , wait a second . What are you doing ? - Grenade . - Grenade . - No ! Happy motoring . - Subtle . - Mm-hmm . Judge Joseph Dredd ! Dredd , you 're under arrest . - What 's the charge ? Murder . - Joseph . - Sir ! - Is it true ? - I 'm innocent . - The Council is said to have irrefutable proof . - Do you believe that ? There is to be a full tribunal . The conviction means death . Do you believe that , sir ? I just needed to look into your eyes for myself . I 'm sorry I asked . I would never do anything to disgrace you or the Council , sir . I 'll use every resource to find out , Joseph . Have you selected someone to defend you ? - Judge Hershey . Hershey ? Why a Street Judge ? At the Academy she was at the top of her class in interpretation of the law . And I trust her . The facts will come out at the tribunal . I 'll personally make sure of that . Sir ? I 'm sorry about this . - Dredd ! - No ! Play back . - Dredd ! - No ! Stop video . The video you have just seen is prima facia evidence that the defendant is guilty as charged . Mark it peoples ' exhibit A. - Objection , your Honor . This video is inadmissible as evidence . If I may be given a moment to explain ? Please do . I have with me an affidavit from Nathan Olmeyer , currently a junior at the Academy . Cadet Olmeyer has been acknowledged by every one of his instructors to be an expert in digital and video graphics . His affidavit states that this ... surveillance video is of such low definition no positive identification can be made of the killer . Your Honors , we know that the uniform of a Judge can be counterfeit . And that the badge can be duplicated . And since neither the video nor the audio in this presentation can identify the accused in any way , I repeat my objection to this video being allowed as evidence in this case . And I ask for a ruling . Objection sustained . The video is inadmissible . Yes ! Admit it , Dredd . - To what ? You 're impressed . - Very . - You owe me . Very well . I 'm therefore forced to move to technical information of a critical nature . I will need the court 's permission to access top secret documentation with the help of Central Computer Bank . - You may proceed . - Central , are you on line ? - On line , Judge McGruder . I wish you to access weapons schematic . Please describe the working of the standard Judge 's sidearm , the Lawgiver 2 . Model 2 is coded to the personal DNA of the Judge using the weapon . By the skin 's contact with the grip . A failsafe security . - Did you know about this ? - No . The DNA is obtained from my medical files and upgraded automatically every time the weapon is reloaded . Each time a round is chambered and fired , the projectile is tagged with that relevant DNA . Chief Justice , the defense was not made aware of any of this information . We would like a chance ... Judge Hershey ! The prosecution must be given time to finish . Central , were the bullets recovered from the bodies of Vardis and Lily Hammond so DNA coded ? Yes , Judge McGruder . It could not be otherwise . And what was the result of the computer check of the DNA coding on those bullets ? The DNA is a perfect match for Judge Joseph Dredd . It 's a lie ! The evidence has been falsified ! It 's impossible ! I never broke the law ! I am the law ! - We have no case ! - You gotta believe me ! You have to believe me ! Say it ! Your Honor ... the prosecution rests . The tribunal needs to confer . What have I done ? How could I 've been so wrong ? ! Dredd ! Both of them homicidal ! Only this time it will be impossible to cover up ! Chief Justice . We carefully buried the Janus project . Nine years ago . Along with Rico and all his victims . No one will ever learn of your involvement . The media knows how close I am to Dredd . They 'll dig until the whole truth comes out . It 's the perfect excuse to ruin what government we have left . Your motives are pure . You thought Dredd was different , that 's why you spared him . A mistake which may bring down the judicial system . There is a way out , Chief Justice . If you 'll forgive me . The Long Walk . That 's a death sentence , Judge Griffin . Mine . Your retirement grants you the power to save Dredd 's life ! This ... gesture may also allow Janus to remain a secret . In the charge of premeditated murder , this tribunal finds Joseph Dredd ... guilty ... as charged . Joseph Dredd , you 're aware of the law allows only one punishment for your crime . Death . However , it has long been our custom to carry out the last order of a retiring senior Judge . And so ... I step down . - No ! As I leave to take my long walk into the Cursed Earth , I ask ... that this court honor my last order . Be lenient with Judge Dredd . In gratitude for his years of service . We will so honor this one , Judge Fargo . Dredd ! Step forward ! The sentence shall be ... life imprisonment ! At Aspen Penal Colony . To be carried out immediately ! As it is written ! - Justice Griffin ! This trial has been a farce ! I demand an appeal ! You will accept the court 's decision , Judge Hershey ! Dredd , I 'm so sorry . I let you down . You did your best , Hershey . Thank you . Let the betrayer of the law ... be taken from our courts ! Let his armor be taken from him . And all his garb of justice . Let him be stricken from our hearts and our memories ... forever ! Let his name be recorded in every place of honor . Let him take the law he served so well to those who have it not . Let him be written . In our hearts ... and our memories ... forever . Judge Hershey . Ah , there 's gotta be some . What 's this ? Baby Dredd ? Ah , I can 't believe you were ever a baby . Who 's this ? Chief Justice Griffin . It 's got a nice ring to it . - We were supposed to meet someplace safe ! What 's not safe ? Your reporter 's dead , right ? Fargo 's on his walk ... Dredd 's in Aspen . So , what 's not safe ? - It 's unfortunate . Hammond had to be silenced . He 'd find out about Janus . But I could 've used Dredd . - Forget Dredd ! There is no Dredd ! Let me tell you what Dredd worships . He worships the law ! He 'da blow you away ! The minute he found out how much you 're pissin ' on it ! Yeah . Let him see what it 's like to freeze his ass off in Aspen ! Let him see what it 's like to be me ! There 's a lot of work to be done . Janus ? Well , where is it ? - You 'll see it ! - When ? Soon enough ! In the meantime , I want chaos , Rico . That block war was just the beginning ! Now I want fear racing through every street ! Then the Council will have to turn to me . And to Janus ! You want fear ? I 'm fear . You want chaos ? I 'm the chaos ! You want a new beginning ? Here ! I am the new beginning ! This is Aspen shuttle CF 1-88 . Due to storm cloud activity over the desert , we will be flying 60 feet . Flight time : approximately ... 4 hours . Dredd ? Don 't hit me ! I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . Don 't hurt me . What-what are you doing here ? I was convicted of a crime . Wrongly ... convicted . Really ? That 's kinda weird . What are the odds ? Two wrongly convicted guys ? Sitting right next to each other ! You received the sentence the law required . Five ... years ? Just for saving my own ass ? That was a mistake . - The law doesn 't make mistakes . Really ? Then how do you explain what happened to you ? You can 't , can you ? Great ! Mr. " I-Am-The-Law " can 't ! So , maybe this is some kinda typo ? Maybe it 's a glitch . Or maybe it 's ... poetic justice ! Some ... some ... . some ... someone comin ' , Paw ! Look ! Praise the Lord for bringing us this generous bounty . My sons ... Gather the harvest . So maybe you 're here as ... some sort of ... field trip ! Yeah . Maybe this is as some sorta ... surprise party . Gonna catch me some city boy ! Knife ! Knife ! It 's payback time , Dredd ! Dredd ! What 's happening ? By a blast of God they perish ! And by a breath of His nostrils are they consumed . Hallelujah ! Central , I need you to access graphics database . I want you to run an ID ... on this man . Scanning for identity . Unknown male . Approximately 200 centimeters tall . Skin tone three . Ten , nine , eight ... Central . Hello ? This terminal has been terminated from the main system . Your authority has been removed , Judge Hershey . This is group leader . We 've located the shuttle . This is Capture Team . There 's no sign of Dredd . He appears to have survived the crash . You are in error , Capture Team . No one survived the shuttle wreck . - Understand ? Just find Dredd . - The pilot , sir . He 's alive . No one survived the shuttle wreck ! Do I make myself clear ? Yes , sir ! Am I dead ? Am I dead ? I 'm dead . Awake ? Good ! We 're running out of sinners ! Oh , my God ! Dredd ! Do something ! - Dredd ? You talk too much . Can it be ? The great man of the law himself . Oh , Lord ... you have blessed us indeed ! Judge ... Rat ... Dredd . - You creeps are under arrest . - Is that so ? Let me crush him , Paw . Excuse me , we 're not together . Allow me to introduce you to my family . There 's Link , my oldest . - Bite me . - Hi ! - My youngest , Junior . - Howdy . Hi ! And this here ... is Mean . We had to make some alterations when he was a child . Well , the Cursed Earth 's a tough place on young folks . I now have him set on one . I don 't suggest you make him angry . The legendary Angel family . Cursed Earth pirates ... murderers ... scavengers ... And , of course , scumbags ! - Oh , how to win ' em over ! Did I leave something out , Pa ? - Let me kill him , Pa . I want his ears . - I want his teeth ! Does that come with a fork , handsome ? - Hallelujah , brother ! - Oh , wait a minute ! Can it be ? Can it be that from the City of the Fallen we have one of the faithful ? Amen , brother ! Praise the Lord ! I 'm a believer ! Fergie , don 't do it . It sound like we have a believer in the gallery . Yes ! - Cut him down ! - Go tell it on the mountain ! Fergie ! You 're making a big mistake . Well , Dredd , maybe the law doesn 't make mistakes , but ... I 'm free , and you 're toast . Actually ... you 're toast ! I forgot to mention it : your new friends ... they 're cannibals . - Fresh meat ! - Prepare the supplicant for sacrifice ! No , wait ! You can 't eat me ! I ... I 've got eczema ! I 've got warts ! I 've had gonorrhea ! Eat Dredd , he works out ! It 's been fun , lawman . Mean ? Finish Dredd . - My pleasure , Paw . - Come on ! - Kill him ! - Come on , Junior ! Guilty ! Shut up ! Dredd ! Look out ! There is Dredd ! Go ! Well , we did it . We got ' em all ! Pussies ! Is that all you got ? They are dead , right ? - Have you been crying ? - I 'm not crying . I just ... got something in my eye ! You ever had allergies ? Dredd ! Look out ! - Chief Justice ? - Joseph . Together again . Together again , sir . No ! God ! Not again ! You got three strikes , lawman . Strike one ! Strike two ! Strike three ! Lawman , you 're too late ! You killed Junior ! You killed my brothers ! You killed my Paw ! Mega City Municipal Code 47-22 . Illegal use of city electricity . How do you plead ? I knew you 'd say that ! Graphics analysis , now . Olmeyer , you stupid futz ! I can 't ... You analyzed the wrong viewie , all right ? The wrong one . This one ! I don 't believe it ! You just wasted three hours ! If this is the wrong picture , why is it fake ? - What ? - Look ! It 's full of anomalies , really clever ones , too ! Somebody must 've used the CGI terminal and a scan quad to make this ... state-of-the-art . 20 years ago . Are you saying this isn 't real ? Yeah . Look . I 'll drop out all the artificial pixels . Dad ... Mom ... Foreground ... Background ... All fake . The only thing that 's real is the baby . The blind lady . - Who is she ? - Justice before your time . We should never have taken justice out of their hands . - You put order to chaos , sir . - Yeah . That we did . Solved many problems . And created many more ! Being a Judge , Joseph , perhaps too much power in one person 's hands . We once tried to compensate . Created the perfect Judge . We called it Janus . Four decades ago , DNA samples were taken from the original Council . One was chosen . Mine . We altered it to enhance the best qualities . And screen out the worst weaknesses . Frailties . We created you . You didn 't create me , sir . I 've a family . - No . At the Academy you told me they were killed when I was very young . I lied . - I have a picture of them . - They 're fake . We lied to both of you . Both ? There was another infant created ... in that experiment . But something went wrong . Genetically mutated to the perfect criminal . - I have a brother ? - You were best friends at the Academy . Star pupil , then he turned . And for his crimes , you judged him . Rico ? Rico ! You let me judge my own brother ? You never told me , sir . - I couldn 't ! You were like a son to me . A son ? My whole life is a lie . Rico had to be executed . To protect you . To protect the city . Rico . He 's alive ! No . I signed the order myself . I saw the report . I didn 't kill Hammond . It was him ! It was his DNA that convicted me . Griffin . It was Griffin ! Griffin , yes . We 've both been deceived , Joseph . I 'm so sorry . Rico 's killed me and destroyed you . Find them , Joseph ! Don 't die . What do we do ? What do we do ? Find Rico . Welcome to Janus . Ah , Rico , I think you know dr . Hayden . I remember you . Justified before the Council that I was insane , right ? And therefore innocent ? - I was trying to save your life . - All you did was insult me ! Cause I knew exactly what I was doing ! Then and now . Miss Hayden has been a loyal supporter of this project for a long time . She 's kept it alive for me . I 'm sure you 'll find her expertise invaluable . Excuse me ? All this is useless if you can 't get into Central 's Janus files cause the Council has ' em locked ! Leave that to me ! Meanwhile , you 've work to do . On the streets . Ilsa will help you . - I don 't need no help . Thanks . I thought you said he was created here by the finest scientists of Mega City . A bold experiment . A patchwork child . Let 's not bicker ! We 're here to achieve the same thing ! An ordered society . You 'll have your new order . Attention , all Judges ! Reporting unrest . Code D 9-2-4 . Downtown sector 12 . Backup requested ! My boy . Dredd , there 's no way in ! Hello ? Are you even listening to me ? We can 't just knock on the wall and say " Hello , Cursed Earth pizza " . There is a way in . Six years ago , two refugees figured it out . The vent to the city 's incinerator . There 's a burst twice a minute . That means somebody can run through that tube and have 30 seconds before it flames again . And these-these refugees ... they-they made it through , right ? Actually , they were roasted . But the theory 's sound . Shall we ? Maybe we should consider other theories ? Dredd ! Dispatch , I 'm in green quad 4-11 . Need a pick-up ! Copy , Hershey . I have Central online for you . Patch it to my Lawmaster . Warning ! Alien device on board . Oh , my God ! Latest casualty report : 96 Judges have been assassinated ! Whoever 's doing this seems to know all our procedures , our security measures , even our scrambled frequencies ! No Judges on the street , riots are breaking out all over the Mega City . We can 't replace those Judges ! Even if we put the cadets on the streets , we won 't be at full strenggth for years ! There is a solution . Project Janus . This Council tried to play God once before . If this wholesale slaughter of Judges continues , there won 't be a Council ! Janus could . - Janus could what ? A new bath of test tube babies won 't solve this crisis ! We don 't need reliable Judges 20 years from now . We need them today ! Accelerated growth incubators are more developed now . We could create adult subjects . All I 'm asking is that we unlock the Janus files . That way we at least have an option ! If the Council decides not to go forward , I 'll accept that decision . And resign . - All right . You ready , kid ? - No ! Now what 's wrong ? What 's wrong ? Are you kidding ? Did wearing that helmet all those years compress your brain ? You 're gonna get me killed ! - There 's a maniac loose in the city ! - What a coincidence ! There 's one out here , too ! - Oh ! - Great time I 'm having ! The shuttle crash ! The Cursed Earth ! Cannibals ! And now a fireball up my ass ! This is all your fault ! - My fault ? - Yes ! - You care to explain that , citizen ? If you hadn 't arrested me , I wouldn 't be here in the first place ! Hey , Dredd , why don 't you just kill me now ? That 's it ! I 'm through schlepping ! I 'm gonna stay here until I 'm caught . Or until you apologize ! - The law can 't apologize ! That 's just it ! You 're not the law anymore ! Now apologize ! I think I deserve that ! I 've never apologized . Now , run ! 30 , 29 , 28 , 27 ... - Run ! - ... 25 , 24 , 23 , 22 , 21 , 20 , 19 ! Dredd ! Dredd ! Dredd ! No ! Run ! I 'm alive ! I 'm alive ! Oh , so are you . Esposito , Carlos . Council Judge . Authorize access to file . Code name ... Janus . Acknowledged . McGruder , Evelyn . Authorize access to file . Code name ... Janus . Acknowledged . Silver , Gerald . Authorized access to file code name Janus . Removing security blocks now . Awaiting password command from presiding Chief Justice . Password : " origin " . Janus file open . - I 'm lost . Is this the bathroom ? - Hey . Now you have to admit , I helped out on that one . I mean that was all me , baby . Hey , hey , wh ... why you 're taking off his clothes ? We don 't have time for this . Central , using current technology , how long would it take for Janus to produce a fully grown adult subject ? Given the current state of genetic engineering , an adult subject could be incubated in approximately 8 hours . My God . We could replace our losses in a day ! This is madness ! - Uh , Dredd ... - Silence ! - Dredd ! - Shh . I 'm busy . Dredd ! It 's inhuman . It 's not for this Councill to play God ! No , Griffin , please restore the security blocks . It seems none of you have the force of will that these times require . Central . Leave Janus unlocked ! Griffin , this is treason ! You have just sealed your fate . No ! You have just sealed yours ! Rico ! Who says politics is boring ? Hey , Dredd . I thought it was you ! That 's right ! Cover your ears ! - Rico ! - Joseph ! Get out of here ! Now ! - Oh , you son of a ... - No ! - You 're under arrest , Griffin . - Really ? Stop him ! He killed the entire Council ! - Move it out ! - Dredd , tell them I 'm innocent ! Come on , Fergie ! Come on ! You 're a lot of fun to be with , Dredd , you know that ? What do you do ? Now what do we do ? Hope it works ! Please , work . Please , please , please . - Shit ! - Work ! Dredd ! Dredd , you may wanna wash this seat after we get off the bike . - What do you mean ? - Sorry . Dredd ! Dredd ! Move it ! - Fergie , cover the rear ! - But I never fired a gun in my life ! - What the hell kind of criminal are you ? - A nice criminal . Nothing 's happening ! - You gotta cock it first , moron ! You didn 't say anything about cocking ! Now you know . Please , God ! Could you just drop me off here ? Dredd , that 's a dead end . - I know ! Fergie , take over ! Need a lift here ? Never riding with you again , Dredd . She 's definitely not getting her cleaning deposit back ! I mean , that 's for sure ! It doesn 't pay to be one of your friends , Dredd . Sorry ! Hands against the wall ! You know the drill . Who are you ? - Dredd said that ... Shut up ! - What happened ? - Why don 't you tell me , Dredd , huh ? We 're dying out there ! 108 Judges in 48 hours ! What the hell is going on ? - And you think I 'm part of this ? - I don 't know ... who or what you are anymore ! I would never do anything to hurt you , Hershey . You know that . All right . You tell me about him , hmm ? You make me believe in you like I did when I defended you ! His name is Rico . And he 's my brother . The DNA sample has been taken out of frozen stasis . Ready for cloning process . We got a slight change of plans here , Central . I wanna take the existing DNA sample right now and trash it . Activate this DNA sampling console . - What are you doing ? - Central ! Take ... this DNA sample ! Now ! - This wasn 't part of our plan ! Judge Griffin would never have authorized this ! Processing . You know , Griffin got to be my keeper by putting me behind the bars . What 's your excuse ? You said I had no feelings and no emotions . Now you know why . - Dredd . Look at me . The Janus project didn 't do that to you . You did that to yourself . Sorry , guys , I 'm getting nowhere with your terminal ! But I fixed the microwave . Want some popcorn ? Is this a bad time ? Hey , I ... , look , I tried dialing everything I could think of to find this Janus thing . It just isn 't in the program ! Nowhere ! Nothing ! You know , they 'll never take a chance to put it on the computer network , but they need power . They gotta steal it from somewhere , so I want you to check every sector for recent blackouts and sudden power surges . - Great , let 's stay here longer ! - Wait a second ! Just before they blew up my Lawmaster in sector 4 , there was a power surge . A really big one , three blocks wide ! The last time I felt something like that they shut down the whole power grid in that area , you remember ? Yeah , but they moved the statue of Liberty , they put it right down on top of it . - Right . Could ... could we go now ? Dredd . That 's twice you owe me . Rico ! Dredd got away from the hunters . Well , he 's about to be seriously outnumbered . Right , Central ? Affirmative , Judge Rico . The new DNA sample has been multiplexed . And the gametes are already diving . - New sample ? You left that DNA in there for over 30 years . Sooner or later somebody 's gonna clean out the fridge . That sample was created from the finest specimens on the Council of Judges ! What did you replace it with ? No . My God . You know , you should congratulate me right now , cause I 'm about to be a daddy . And you 're being very , very rude ! - You don 't know what you 're doing ! - The next batch of Janus Judges are not gonna be the puppets that you want , they 're gonna be my brothers and sisters ! And mine to control ! - I can 't let you do this . You 're both insane . I have to stop you ! Centraaal ! Help meee ! I 'm sorry , Chief Justice , the ABC robot is not tied into my main processor . That 's right , Griff . You know you gotta get with this high-tech stuff ? Robot ! Rip his arms and legs off . - No ! And you save his head for last ! I don 't want him to miss anything . Anything ! - Fergie , you stay here . - By myself ? You need me to shut down the Janus system . We 're a team ! Granted you do most of the work , but we 're still a team . - I 'll handle it , kid . - I bring you luck ! Luck ? - You are still alive , Dredd . - Hm . I 'm getting a signal . It 's closing . It 's moving closer . Jesus Christ ! Get back ! Dredd ! Drop the gun . Robot ? On the count of three , break her neck . One , two ... No ! Hershey . I 'm still here . How romantic . Step inside . He looks a lot like you . - He is a lot like me . - I 'm nothing like you . The only difference between us , Joseph , is you destroyed your life ... to embrace the law . And I destroy the law to embrace life . And speaking of life ... Send in the clones . Behold . This is where you were born . You feel that magic ? You must have known . All along . You were different . Fergie ? Are you still alive ? - Technically ... yes . Your brothers and your sisters will be born in two hours . One big , endless supply of perfection ! You know , we have a choice ? We can stand here right now and create a whole race of goddamn brainwashed morons . And call them Judges ! Or create some free-thinking people . We 'll call them human . Human . You could never control yourself . What makes you think you can control ... these things ? Cause you 're in control . You 'll be head of the Council . You choose . And you choose quickly , too . I shall put you down myself . Personally . You know , I never understood that . Why did you judge me ? Why did you judge me ? - You killed innocent people ! - The means to an end ! - You started a massacre ! - I caused a revolution ! - You betrayed the law ! No ! I betrayed this ! You are Council 's experiment which failed ! In you ! I was your brother , your blood , your friend ! Who betrayed who ? When you gonna stop being the goddamn slave and grow up ? ! That 's your birth right , that 's your family ! I 'm your family ! I 'm the only family you ever had ! Now choose ! The best thing you can do is kill me . Why ? Because it 's your only chance ... brother . Fido ! Rip this bitch 's arms and legs off ! Save her pretty head for my brother ! - Don 't do it ! Halt ! Rip his head off instead ! Give it to her ! What 's a matter with you ? Rico ! - Boy , is he pissed ! - Fergie ! Dredd ! Hang on , Fergie ! Hack you , asshole ! Rico ! - Central , hatch the first set of clones ! - The cloning process is not finished , Judge Rico . The clones will be only 60 % complete . I need reinforcements ! Hatch the goddamn clones ! Now ! Don 't ... fight ... girls much . Bitch ! Judge Bitch ! I 'm the only one who never lied to you . I 'll be the judge of that ! Now , Joseph Dredd , I hereby judge you . To the charge of betraying your flesh . Guilty ! And the charge of being human ! When we coulda been gods ! Guilty . The sentence is death . - Don 't miss . Lethal rounds exhausted . Phaser flare ! Court 's adjourned . Dredd ! Give me your hand . Three times now , Dredd . Stand back , Hershey . Am I under arrest ? That won 't be necessary . Central broadcasted Janus plan after Griffin 's death . They all know the truth . Judge Dredd . We have to reconstitute the Councill . We 'd like you to consider the first position of ... Chief Justice . I 'm a Street Judge . And I 'm very late for work . Thank you , Olmeyer . I 'm dying . I 'm too young to ... Excuse me ! Oh , that 's great , he gets all the credit ! Dredd ? I taught him everything he knows . Dredd ? That 's it ? No goodbye ? - Goodbye , Hershey . To tell you the truth , I 'm probably a much better kisser . Ow ! Okay , come on , let 's go , will you ? Uh , can we swing by a cash machine ? Feels good to be human , don 't you think ? I knew you 'd say that .

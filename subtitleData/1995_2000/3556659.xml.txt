 Horsie to Pointy Guy Six . - Check . - Hmm . Get him , boys ! Good move . Brannigan Begins Again PROFESSOR : Good news . We have a mission to further intergalactic peace . - Nope . Watching cartoons . - Sorry . What 's the mission ? A delivery for the Democratic Order of Planets . What 's that ? - lt 's like the United Nations . - Uh ... . - Like the Federation from Star Trek . - Oh . Tonight 's the ribbon cutting for DOOP 's new base . - What are we delivering ? - Something necessary to the ceremony . - The oversized scissors . - We 'll deliver them as fast as we can . Okay . But don 't run with them ! Wow , a million aliens. I 've never seen anything so mind-blowing ! - A reception table with muffins ! - Ladies and gentlemen . Welcome to the ribbon cutting for the DOOP 's new headquarters . A fitting home for an organization that fosters peace everywhere . Even between the lnsectoids and the Space Lizards . - What 's it like on Amazonia ? - Big rats there . - Me crush with club . - That 's so interesting . Why don 't we have coffee together ? There 's no better place for a home of diplomacy ... ... than here orbiting the Neutral Planet . What are your thoughts , Your Neutralness ? I have no strong feelings one way or the other . I hate these filthy Neutrals . You know where enemies stand . But with Neutrals , who knows ? It sickens me . Halt ! Why , Leela ! I do believe we 've met . - He means you guys did it . - We brought scissors for the ceremony . - Then you 're under arrest . - Why ? How do I know these aren 't part of a Neutral plot ? They 're not sharp . Who could I hurt ? The Yarn People of Nylar Four . [ speaking gibberish ] So , a plan to assassinate a weird-looking alien with scissors . How very Neutral of you . - What ? - lt was almost the perfect crime . But you forgot one thing : Rock crushes scissors . But paper covers rock . And scissors cuts paper . Kif , we have a conundrum . Search them for paper . - And bring me a rock . - Why ? So beautiful , yet so Neutral . Drag them to the ship ! To cut the ribbon , the legendary DOOP captain ... ... who just returned from a carpet-bombing of Eden Seven ... ... Zapp Brannigan . What makes a man turn Neutral ? Lust for gold ? Power ? Or were you born with a heart of Neutrality ? Sir ? You should be cutting the ribbon now . No matter. I 'll simply cut it from here with the ship 's laser . That may not be wise . Kif , I don 't need your that-may-not-be-wise attitude . [ screaming ] Whoopsie-daisy . You are accused of blowing up DOOP headquarters . How do you plead ? - Absolutely 99 percent not guilty . - The prosecutor will call a witness . Your Honor , I 'm a simple hyper-chicken from a backwoods asteroid ... ... but if it please the court , I 'll call the entire jury . - l 'll allow it . - Members of the jury ... ... did you all happen to gander ... ... at who blew up that there DOOP headquarters ? That 's the guy there . - Are you gonna vote to convict him ? - You better believe it . The jury will disregard its testimony . Your Honor , the prosecution rests . The evidence against Brannigan is strong . But , in light of his service , and this incompetent prosecutor ... ... I 'm afraid I must dismiss all charges . What ? Your Honor , I know the case is closed and you 've given a verdict ... - ... but I want to testify . - l 'll allow it . Miss Leela , on the date in question ... ... were you or weren 't you wearing a skirt ? That 's a dumb question . What matters is Zapp 's the worst captain ever . I saw him blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye . - l 'd like to cross-examine . - l 'll allow it . - We 've met before , have we not ? - Yes . On that occasion , you had sex with someone ? - May I remind you , you 're under oath . - Yes . Please point out the person you had sex with . Woo ! - And his name is ? - Zapp Brannigan . The same man who didn 't blow up DOOP headquarters . I rest my case . Jury members , you may begin your deliberations . Your Honor , we have reached a verdict . We find the defendant guilty . Woo ! You are hereby stripped of your rank ... ... and dismissed from the DOOP . I 'd like to make one final statement . Kif , come and hold up the flag . Wave it a little , for God 's sake . You can take away a man 's title and his uniform . But you can 't take away his integrity and honor . - Plus , it was Kif 's fault . - What ? You too are stripped of your rank ... ... and dishonorably discharged . Oh . One day a man has everything . Then he blows up a $ 400 billion space station . Next he has nothing . Makes you think . - No , it doesn 't . - Come , Kif . It 's time to begin our life as civilians . That 's an order , soldier ! [ " EVERYBODY 'S talkin ' " BY HARRY nilsson PLAYS ] - Hey , Bender ? - Yeah ? This is the third hose fight I 've broken up . And the second one with real hoses . Move your asses and scrub the ship like I ordered ! - You don 't have to get so mad . - Fry wiped off some of the dirt . [ DOORBELL rings ] - Zapp ? - l didn 't know where else to turn . - You 're the only one who loved me . - l never loved you . - Physically . - What is it ? Let me work for food. I 'll paint , or service you sexually , or mop up . - You can 't do any of those things . - Kif might . - Who are you talking to ? - Just a hobo who 's hit rock bottom ... - ... and his commander . - You 're that disgraced captain . He 'll distract people from our awful safety record . Come in ! I want everyone to meet our new employees . Which ones are new ? - The green dude and the fat man . - l haven 't seen that robot before . I 'm Bender . You know , the lovable rascal . Oh , yes . My good friend , of course . Whoever you all are , I have good news . You have a delivery to Stumbos Four . The gravity is so high ... ... you might be crushed by your own hair . Enjoy ! So , this Leela . I know she 's a very sensuous woman . - How is she as a captain ? - Really strict . - And mean . - l see . - Does she spank the crew ? - No , she just makes us work . Good . But should she ever institute some sort of spanking policy ... ... I 'll go for you. I won 't have my comrades harmed . Hey , this guy 's all right ! Here 's to us poor schmoes working for the man . Even if he is a hot , sexy , female man . - l computed our landing coordinates . - Thanks . Very nice work . - Wait , what ? - l said , " Very nice work . " This is the happiest day of my life . Okay , crew . You have to deliver these 40 pillows to the hotel . Not heavy , but I 'm still complaining . That 's because we have an anti-grav pump . Once you 're out there , gravity will be very intense . Hey , no prob . This lead apron will protect me . No screw-ups . Use the hover dolly and deliver one pillow at a time . - Let 's deliver them all at once ! - Yeah ! That 's using your noodle . Come on , girdle . Hold ... . Uh-oh . What the hell happened ? Some breaking , involving the dolly . That 's all we know . I told you idiots not to overload it . - Each pillow weighs 1 50 lbs. here . - Don 't get your panties in a knot . - We 'll use the backup . - l 'll load pillows . No way . You disobeyed an order ... ... so now you have to hand-deliver all 40 pillows . I have a serious question . Does the company that made your bra do girdles ? - l ask because a friend- - - Just get to work ! - l 'm Leela . Get to work . - l agree . The point is , it 's just so humiliating working for him . Once he actually ordered me to ... ... shave his armpits while he was in the tub . So , l- - Why don 't we talk about something besides Zapp ? Oh , all right . Well , how about them , um ... . Okay , well , there he was in the tub , right ? [ THUNDER CRASHES ] Some good old high-gravity rain . That 'll cool us off . - Ow , ow , ow . - Ow , ow , ow . This is Leela 's fault . If she let us use the backup , we 'd have broken it and given up . A good captain needs many skills ... ... like boldness , daring , and a velour uniform . I 'm not convinced she has any of those . Leela 's not too bad . She just makes us work so much . When I was captain , I only wanted my men 's loyalty . If I had that , I didn 't care if they ... ... drank beer in their underwear . - Beer ? - Underwear ? But now , Zapp 's not captain anymore. I 'm free ! Hear that ? I 'm actually laughing . This is a mutiny ! You 're out of here , lady . Zapp 's the new captain . All hail the new captain ! You 're a capable doer of the nasty ... - ... but I 'm taking over . - On what grounds , you oaf ? Failure to prevent a mutiny . Throw her in the brig . - What brig ? - Then the laundry room ... ... which will hereafter be called the " brig . " - You don 't want me as captain ? - Right , genius . - Didn 't I do well ? - You were mean . You yelled . - You made us work . - A captain needs to do that . - l thought we were friends . - Well ... - ... you shouldn 't have been so mean . - Don 't worry . Soon we 'll be able to look back on this and laugh . Back in uniform. it nearly still fits ... ... despite the fattening hobo diet . - What do I do with these clothes ? - Put them in the laundry brig . - Do I have your loyalty ? - To the ends of the universe . - Ten hundred percent . - That 's not enough . You 're to sit and drink until you 're as loyal as Kif . - Yes , sir , sir ! - May I have a beer , sir ? No . You 're loyal enough . Meanwhile , I have a plan . We 'll attack our archenemy , the Neutral Planet . - Oh , geez . - Once the threat is gone ... ... I 'll be a hero and the DOOP will reinstate me . - Sir , that plan makes no sense . - Maybe not to you . But you were court-martialed in disgrace . - Burn ! - Nailed you , buddy ! Prepare for the fight between good and Neutral . Awesome ! We 'll be like , pow-pow-pow ! And they 'll be like ... ... and we 'll have pancakes to celebrate . And I 'll be like ... . Exactly . Now , in the name of all that is honorable ... ... we 'll call them with a message of peace , then fire . Yes , sir . Fly the white flag of war . This is Zapp Brannigan , of the ship- - Planet Express Ship . - I come in peace . - Can we trust him , Your Neutralness ? All I know is my gut says maybe . BENDER : What now ? - We crash into the headquarters ... ... killing them in a firestorm from which nothing can escape . - And then ? - Then your mission is complete . I 'll already have ejected wearing the only space suit . - Wait. ls this gonna kill us ? - Yes . That 's what I meant by loyalty . Now help me into the only suit . It 's sweaty . You may need baby powder . - We want you back as captain . - Let me guess . He canceled naptime ? He ran out of beer ? So , he 's about to kill us ? - We want Leela to be captain . - Mutiny ? Never thought I 'd see the day . Come , Kif . - There 's a child 's suit for you . - l want to stay here with Leela . She actually listens to what I have to- - [ MUMBLES ] He 's disabled the steering ! We 're gonna crash ! Leela , save me ! And yourself , I guess . And my banjo ! And Fry . Okay . We have one chance . - Will you do what I say ? - Absolutely . - Even if I make you work ? - As your God is my witness . Get the backup dolly and put all dark matter into the left engine . Aw , man ! That crap 's heavy ! - And warm . - Just do it ! Your Neutralness , beige alert . If I die , tell my wife , " Hello . " I don 't want to die at age 25 . Unless we hit a time warp , don ' t worry about it . - lt 's too low ! - Quick ! You did it ! You actually did it ! And no one will be punished for the mutiny ! When Leela panicked , maybe because of female troubles ... ... my quick mind saved the day . - ls this tale of magic and glory true ? - Well , actually- - Good. lf they don 't take him back , we 'll keep him . It 's true . My female incompetence , his cat-like reflexes ... ... the stuff that made no sense , all of it . In that case , Zapp Brannigan ... ... I hereby restore your rank and parking privileges . Come , Kif . We 've got work to do . I 'll call and tell you about it . Leela , even though you 're mean ... - ... you 're the best captain ever . - Yeah . You 're one dynamite lady . - Can we have a week off ? - No . - Please ? - Come on , captain . - Oh , all right . - No time off . - Oh , man . - Let 's mutiny . Subtitles by flanger [ english SDH ]

 But we just want to make sure . There was really no need for you to come , Miss Prince . Security is a routine matter ... for my well-trained staff . Well , maybe my country is being a little overcautious , Colonel . But we don 't want anything to disrupt ... the arrangements being made for next month 's conference . Now , the peace conference will be a different matter . Then I will need your help . But the Nyerland Embassy guards are ... perfectly capable of protecting these minor ministers ... who can just barely negotiate the shape of the conference table . Thank you . May I take your picture , please ? If your film is in color , young man ... I must warn you , I photograph in dull gray . I think you should look at this . My wife ! She has a message for you . My wife is dead . But she 's still within reach . The picture proves it . I can 't believe this . If you come with me ... I can show you something else that might convince you . If you 're certain you don 't need me any longer , Colonel Dekker ... I guess I 'll head back to the office . And please tell your superiors ... that I have everything under control . I 'm sure you do . I really should get back now . Not until you see these . My wife again . This necklace ... the first thing I ever gave her ... destroyed in the fire that killed her . What kind of magic is this ? I told you , she 's trying to get through to you . It 's not magic . We 'll take you to where you can talk to her . I 'll explain on the way , okay ? You see , I take pictures , Mr. Secretary . Only , the pictures I take are of things from another world . Remarkable . It used to scare me . Like , I 'd take a picture ... and extra faces would show up . Then I discovered ... that if I just held the camera and thought real hard ... I could make the pictures . Like these others . And you say you can ... talk to the spirits you photograph ? No . That 's my aunt and uncle . You 'll see . Are you guys crazy ? Just get out of the car , lady . What 's going on ? Get out ! Okay , why are you doing this ? Let 's just say ... we don 't like women drivers . That 's cute . That 's real cute . We just want to take you off the highway for a while . Let 's go . Diana Prince , IADC . You take care of her ? See for yourself . A psychic photograph ? There 's no other way to explain it , Steve . The woman standing next to Bakru in that picture is his wife . She died a year ago in a fire . This picture 's a fake . Someone took a picture of an old photo of his wife , then re-exposed the film . No , the lab boys are positive it 's not a double exposure . Then some other technique was used to take it . No , Steve . That picture was taken ... with a perfectly normal instant camera , under perfectly normal conditions . It 's impossible . Because this is not a perfectly normal picture . Maybe it isn 't . But it 's not an impossibility either . Now , faces of deceased loved ones have been showing up in photographs ... next to living people , practically since photography itself has been invented . A hundred years or so . Granted , such photographs are very rare ... but they do exist . I still say it 's a fake . We find out who 's responsible for this ... and we might be able to explain away 100 years of photographic history . Or we might find someone with incredible psychic talents . What about fingerprints ? Ira scanned both sides of the photograph ... but he won 't have a readout till this afternoon . Says he 's booked solid till then . Humans should be so popular . By the way , Diana ... Colonel Dekker says that Bakru 's disappearance is your fault . What ? Come on , Steve . He dismissed me . Said he had everything under control . No matter what he says , I want you back at the Embassy ... to keep an eye on Deputy Minister Kell and Ambassador Yamura . Those two plus Bakru are the key figures in these preliminary talks . What ? You think they 're all in danger ? I don 't know what to think . This whole thing is very strange . You almost said " spooky , " didn 't you ? Yeah , I guess I did . My country will never agree to such a flagrant waste of money ! Our leaders are coming here to discuss peace ... not to be pampered and spoon-fed in expensive hotel suites . Do you think , Ms. Kell ... that the world would take the talks seriously were they held ... on the back porch of someone 's house in the country ? Please ! Holding the most expensive talks possible ... hardly insures that they will be ... the most productive talks possible , Mr. Yamura . Ladies and gentlemen ... I submit that our talks ... have become something less than productive . I believe that an hour 's recess is very much in order . I understand , as usual ... there are inexpensive refreshments outside . - Miss Prince . - Colonel . If you still insist ... that you 're the one who is to watch Deputy Minister Kell ... her aide said that she 'd like to talk to you . Room 110 . Down the hall . Well , thank you , Colonel Dekker . Don 't mention it , Miss Prince . May I take your picture , ma 'am ? Of course . You remind me so much of my little boy . - Is this for your school newspaper ? - No , ma 'am . It 's for you . From Eric . He was only 10 years old when we lost him . My Eric . This is Diana Prince . May I come in ? I 'm Diana Prince from the IADC . I was told you wanted to talk to me . I 'll get this for you . - Welcome , Deputy Minister . - Hello . All of us at the Institute are extremely honored to serve you . Thank you . This is my Aunt Theodora . She and my Uncle Lawson will arrange it so that you can talk to Eric . And Matthew here ... as you 've probably guessed , is one of the world 's most gifted psychics . We are here only so he can perfect his extraordinary powers . Matthew tells me that Secretary Bakru is here . But I 'm in a confusion as to why . Spirits close to both of you on the other side are ... very eager to speak to you about the upcoming peace conference . Peace conference ? What do they want ? I don 't want to risk misinterpreting their message . You 'll hear it for yourself ... just as soon as Ambassador Yamura arrives . Kito Yamura is coming , too ? The message from the other side is for all three of you . - Ms. Kell . - Hello . Nice seeing you again . Would you excuse us a moment , please ? - Of course . - Of course . You 're to get right up to your room . Your uncle wants to talk to you . He 's mad ? Secretary Bakru says it took three pictures for you to convince him to come here . - So ? - You brought home two . You left the other one somewhere . What if someone finds it ? I 'm sorry . Tell that to your uncle . He 'll be in directly to see you . Okay . Matthew ! Thank you . Thank you very much . No matter what happens ... you 've made me remember that Eric will never be far from me . - Sure . - Thank you . Why don 't we all sit down ? Hi , Rover . Hey , I 'm sorry , I don 't have time to discuss the high cost of postage . If you 'll excuse me . Hey , come on . Settle down . You 're dropping your mail . If you 're not careful , you 'll be back delivering the morning coffee , darling . Hi . Sorry , I was trying to get over here , but the Rover - It 's all right , Diana . Won 't you please come in ? How do you do , Miss Prince ? Hello , Colonel Dekker . Thanks for trying . Agent Markowitz is on his way over to the Embassy . Which means you no longer need to worry about the peace-talk negotiations . Steve , I 'm perfectly capable of finding out who abducted those two diplomats . On your last assignment ... you were found sleeping serenely on a backroom couch ... while supposedly watching Deputy Minister Kell ... who disappeared . Somebody lured me into that room ... and chloroformed me to get me out of the way and you know it . No . There was no odor of gas in that room . There was only you . Whatever you were sleeping off wasn 't chloroform . Steve , am I on this case or aren 't I ? Diana , we 've all been anxious for you to take a little leave time . - You 've really been working hard - - I see . Why don 't you fly to Florida and get a little sun ? You can sail , you can scuba dive - Not until I find out how that picture was taken ... who 's got Bakru and Kell ... and who 's trying to get me out of the way ! I 'll tell you what . Leave the name of the hotel where you 'll be staying ... and we 'll let you know the minute we find out . You 're not going to let him get away with this . If it wasn 't for his lax security , this never would have happened . Diana , I 'm sorry , but it 's out of my hands . Go on . Have fun . Get a good tan . Read a couple of good books . " Don 't call us , Diana . " We 'll call you . " The minute we have some good news . Well , with him in charge , I won 't hold my breath . Nicely done , Major . And I assure you it 's all for the better . You just prove to me that you 're as good at doing your job , Colonel ... as you are at going over people 's heads . There . Hi , Uncle Lawson . Sorry I lost the picture . You should be , Matthew . If anyone uninvited found out where you are and what you can do ... we 'd never , any of us , have a moment 's peace . Look at this one I just did . That 's very good . My coaching is making it easier , isn 't it ? I guess so . - Is it lunchtime yet ? - They 're sending up something now . I kind of wanted to eat downstairs . I like that Ms. Kell . Unfortunately , someone with your talent doesn 't always have time for socializing . - I thought you understood that . - Yeah . Are we gonna have to move again after these people leave ? Well , Matthew , the people who require our services , unfortunately ... can 't always come to us . We have to go to them . But you like traveling and adventure , don 't you ? All boys should be as lucky as you , huh ? I guess . Hello , Ira . I 'd like a readout on the fingerprints you found on that photo this morning . Who is addressing the Irac computer ? It 's Diana Prince . You know my voice , Ira . Diana Prince is no longer authorized to receive official data . What ? Since when ? Clearance was withdrawn five minutes ago by Major Trevor . What 's a little red tape among friends , Ira ? Give me the readout on the fingerprints . I know you found something . You always do . Flattery will get you nowhere . Ira . My hands are tied . That was cute . My programming disallows telling Diana Prince about the boy . What boy ? Adopted name : Koslo , Matthew R. Passport thumbprint matches one found on photograph . I thought I saw a boy getting into that car with Bakru . Other prints belong to the Secretary . Where can I find Matthew Koslo ? Even if that information were contained in the Irac computer ... it would not be available to Diana Prince . Anything else that 's unavailable to Diana Prince ? That the boy reputedly has psychic powers is a fact ... also to be withheld from Diana Prince ... who now has five seconds to leave the premises ... before an alarm is activated . Five , four ... Okay , I 'm going . ... three , two ... Hang on . Thank you , Ira , forever . ... two and one-quarter ... Major Trevor said nothing about clearance for Wonder Woman . And you ha ve three seconds , Rover . Three , two , one . And a good day to you , sir . That was an official of the Tymanian government . Our efforts here will be rewarded by the end of next week . No sooner ? I don 't like the idea of having to stay around so long . Well , our client has a perfect right to be completely satisfied ... that the peace conference will be canceled ... thereby assuring the continuance of the border wars . Now , Tymania assures itself that ... by the end of next month , they 'll invade their war-weakened neighbors ... whereupon we collect a tidy bonus . This is the riskiest con we 've ever undertaken . Yes , and the most profitable . Our nephew should be finished with his lunch by now . Why don 't you get him ready for the final photography session ? Then set things up for the séance . We 're to hold it tonight ? Ambassador Yamura will be here this evening . I don 't see any reason to postpone , do you ? The IADC agent , Diana Prince . Word is she 's been kicked off the case . I still don 't like it , Lawson . Nor do I. Therefore , Charles , have your men see to it that Miss Prince ... is , once and for all , taken out of the picture . Finished up ? She turns the key . Boom ! Grab your tools . All right , gentlemen ... how about a rousing chorus of who hired you and where I can find him . Go back . - Go back , Diana Prince . - Escape . - Go back . - Head for help . Escape while you can . Whatever you are ... mortal or otherwise , I challenge you to show yourself . - Here you are . - Thank you . Mr. Secretary , would you like some more ? - Yes , please . - There you go . Just a little something to tide you over . It won 't be much longer until the séance . Ambassador Yamura should be arriving any moment . Perhaps that 's him now . Excuse me . Who are you ? Carol Littleton . I came to see Matthew . Matthew ? Yes , I understand that he has connections with people on the other side . And I must speak to my late husband . Who told you Matthew was here ? My dear woman ... money not only talks , it makes others talk as well . I 'm afraid I cannot let you see my nephew . Not even for a rather large donation to your institution ? It 's out of the question . Please , leave at once . Excuse me , isn 't that Deputy Minister Kell ? She 's the one that 's missing , isn 't it ? I think you 're mistaken . I think not . Her picture is on all the newscasts . What 's she doing here ? She 's here on a mission of grave importance . And that 's Secretary Bakru , isn 't it ? They both have business with those who have passed on . Something the news media would not understand . But would love to hear about , I should think . All right , young lady , I think that - Carol Littleton . Perhaps we can arrange for you to meet with Matthew ... and the spirit of your late husband . Oh , yes , Jason . Dearly departed , wealthy Jason . We 'll talk more about that later . Dee , please show Miss Littleton to the room at the top of the stairs . Thank you . And you are not to leave that room until you are summoned . I do hope ... your Matthew can have a little more luck than the others I 've tried . Imagine neglecting to tell ... his wife , before he died , where he left $ 500,000 worth of diamonds . - Really ? - Really . Are you insane ? If I had let her leave , she would have gone straight to the newspapers . We can always dispose of her after the séance . How did the widow get past our bag of tricks down the road ? What should I do ? Ask her ? No , I 'll take care of it . You 've made too many mistakes . Eve ... Every 5,000 miles . Come in the office , Eve . I hope you weren 't planning on going anywhere , Eve . I hope you weren 't either . Markowitz just called . Don 't tell me . Somebody else is missing from the negotiations . Ambassador Yamura . Gone without a trace . Well , at least we have some idea who 's behind all this . Ira came up with a name ? He came up with one : Matthew Koslo . I came up with another : Lawson Koslo . Never heard of either one . I had to pry the second one out of someone ... at the leading psychic research center in New York . They don 't like to talk about him very much . Seems he 's been successful at using very legitimate psychic phenomena ... in very illegitimate con games . You think the people who are disappearing from ... the peace conference talks have been conned ? It could be . See ... Lawson Koslo became the legal guardian of a boy 10 years ago . That boy , Matthew , can make psychic photographs . - The one Diana found ? - Yeah . It all fits . Let 's see if Diana 's still in town . Don 't bother , I tried right after Markowitz called . No answer . Yeah , by this time , she 's probably checking in to some hotel on Miami Beach . You want me to go get her ? Go finish your lube job . Welcome , Ambassador Yamura . Your associates have been anxiously awaiting you . My curiosity has been aroused , Madam , and that 's all . You won 't find me as gullible as my associates . Curiosity is but a stepping stone to the truth ... as you 'll soon discover for yourself . Charles , perhaps the Ambassador would like some coffee ? Mr. Yamura . You have all the pictures this time ? He has them all . I made sure . - Go upstairs and take a nap . - I don 't need a nap . The séance is at midnight . It wouldn 't do for you to nod off in front of our guests . I won 't nod off . I want to talk to these people . I like company . Get upstairs . Matthew ? You don 't look like your picture , lady . Bet you don 't look like this one either . Who are you , anyhow ? Matthew , now listen to me . I want you to believe me . - You don 't want to hurt anyone , right ? - No , of course not . Me and my Uncle Lawson help people , with my camera . Yes , I know . You are a very special boy . I know that . Come over here and sit down . Now , your uncle is using you to hurt people . - No , he 's not . - Yes , he is . He cons them . He uses what you can do ... to make them believe and hear everything he tells them . I don 't believe that . - You 're the one that 's lying . - No . I 'm not . Two men told me that . Two men who tried to kill me . Your uncle does have two men besides the driver working for him , doesn 't he ? Yeah . Pete and Larry . They went out this afternoon , but they haven 't come back yet . Yes , I know . And they 're not going to . Because ... Well , I had to tie them up ... so I could get here and find out what 's happening . Are you a cop or something ? No . I 'm a government agent . That 's why I 'm here . Your uncle wants to make those people downstairs ... tell the leaders of their countries to do something very wrong . I don 't know if I should believe you . Think about it , Matthew . But just don 't tell anyone what I 've told you . Promise ? I don 't know . You don 't look like your picture . Matt , I know I don 't . Just think about it , okay ? Matt . I like to be called Matt . How did you know ? Why aren 't you in your room resting , as your aunt told you to ? I was just going . Were you in there talking to that lady ? Is she going to be at the séance ? Maybe . Unless there 's some reason why she shouldn 't be . Did you take that woman 's picture , Matthew ? Yeah . And you saw something that disturbed you ? Your Aunt Theodora and I have taken great pains to raise you , you know . We 've given you much more than most parented children have . Showed you the world three times over ... helped you develop your powers . I know . All we ask is that you be honest with us . Did you hear me ? That lady in there , she doesn 't look anything like her picture . You mean , she 's wearing a disguise ? Maybe she has some business I can help her with . - Uncle Lawson ? - Yes ? You don 't con people , do you ? You don 't lie ? Matthew , you 've seen what I can do through the spirits . And spirits cannot tolerate liars . You get some rest . Diana . You see ? I told you , you needed a nap . I just had my eyes closed . I was thinking . Sure you were , young man . Come on . It 's almost midnight . Let 's go downstairs . I don 't want to take part in the séance . Don 't be ridiculous . I 'll stay up here . You don 't really need me . Of course we need you . All I do is take pictures . I don 't have anything to do with all that other stuff that happens . You certainly do . If only because ... the people and the spirits are comforted by your presence . I 'll stay here . Put this on . You are coming downstairs with me right now . No , I 'm not . Perhaps you 'd like to speak to Charles about it ? He 's always been able to convince you . You 're just using me to trick people . - Who told you that ? - That lady . That lady was a liar and a meddler . You shouldn 't let her put such ideas into your head . A complete stranger forces her way into our house ... and you 're so stupid , you believe everything she says ? Now come on , Matthew . And now we must all join hands . My father did not believe in ghosts , and neither do I. Your father knew no more than you do . But he has since learned , as you will . Please , your hand . And now , we must close our eyes ... and concentrate on the loved ones Matthew has helped bring back to us . Mother . Over here . Let 's play hide and seek . Mother ? Can you hear me ? Wait for me , Mother . I wanna talk . Mother . Please listen , Mother . - Eric ? - I wanna talk . I ha ve to talk . They tell me I must . Eric , I can hear you . Mother ? Over here . Mother ? Eric ! It is Eric . Please listen . Mother . Can you hear me ? Yes , I can hear you , my darling . The wars must go on . Please , Mother . Please listen . No ! It can 't be done , Eric . Why ? The time for peace has not yet come . Atma ! Return to our country , husband . Your business is there . This is an outrage ! Thousands have died . Thousands will continue to die ... unless those wars are ended ! Still my rebellious and foolish son . I haven 't heard those words since I - You 'll hear them through eternity ... if you do not do your part in ending the peace negotiations . I thought I was free of your tyranny . You must obey . Cancel the peace conference . No ! Please obey , Mother . The wars must continue . Get her ! I knew you were tricking people . I didn 't know you could do that . You never bothered to ask me . Telekinesis . I 've had it ever since I can remember . It was all a hoax , to make us cancel the peace conference ! No doubt they were hired by a country who 'd profit ... by the continuation of the border wars . Which country was it ? Tymania . They planned to invade Parmalec and Disan ... after those countries were sufficiently weakened ... by the border wars . Well , fortunately for the world , you have just pulled your last hoax . And thank you , Matt ... for all your help . Yeah , but they did something with that lady agent . You 'd better check downstairs . I already have and she 's just fine . Guess we make a pretty good team . What do you think ... Uncle Lawson ? Abilities like Matthew 's might come in very handy in our line of work . That 's true . Ira agrees . In fact , he 's becoming a little insecure about his job . Look at this . I got a four-page printout this morning , entitled : " Dependable Printed Circuitry versus Inexplicable Phenomena . " Do you believe that ? He 's too much . Now , about your punishment . - Punishment ? - That 's right . For staying on an assignment after specific orders not to . Steve , I had to prove that Colonel Dekker lied about me , and you know it . Colonel Dekker is now Private Dekker . But as far as your punishment is concerned ... I 'm sorry , Diana , but I 'm going to have to insist ... that you take a real vacation . Plane tickets , hotel reservations , specific orders to have the time of your life . - Steve , I don 't wanna go . - Go ! There 's no suntan lotion in here , and I burn very badly . I haven 't anything to read . - No books ? - No books . No film for my camera . Cute . Well , you wanna go with me ?

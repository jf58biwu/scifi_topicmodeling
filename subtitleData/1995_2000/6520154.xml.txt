 All right , you bastard . Evil , ... .. rotten , ... .. son of a ... There you go . Your killing days are over ! No ! No ! No ! All right , sir . Put your hands in the air . Keep ' em where I can see ' em . We got a call . You wanna tell us what you 're doin ' out here ? Sir ? Aagh ! Turn over ! Damn amp-head ! Oh , Lord . Jimmy , check this out . Sarah ? Sarah ! Our blind date 's not off to a great start . I 've been waiting here nearly two hours . - I had to check you weren 't followed . - It 's just you , me and the drug dealers . This area 's always been known for its criminal element . Especially when Congress is in session . - What 's this ? - Something you 'll wanna follow . - Follow where ? - That 's all I have for you . What do you mean , that 's all you have ? I get an anonymous e-mail to meet you here . I don 't know who you are or what you want . I don 't have any obligation or desire to give you answers . - I 'm not one of your sources . - Then you 're just a messenger boy ? It 's late , Agent Mulder . Go home . Get some sleep . Who told you to contact me ? How do I know I 'm not being played ? I guess you don 't . Well , you can go ahead and recycle that , then . I 've been asked to tell you : you walk away from this , more people will die . Sorry I wasn 't here sooner , but the Beltway was a parking lot . - What 's going on ? - Multiple homicide . That 's Joseph Patnik . He murdered five people , all of whom he insists was the same man . - What do you mean ? - He claims he kept killing the same man . - Does he have a history of mental illness ? - Not that I know , but I just got this case . - What 's the X-File ? - In his neighbourhood , two weeks ago , ... .. a baby-sitter attacked the two children she was minding . She told police she thought they were wolves . - And police found no other motive ? - None so far , no . Agent Mulder ? I 'm Dr Stroman . - This is my partner , Special Agent Scully . - You 're the physician in charge ? They called me down from DC to develop a diagnosis for the court . - Have you ? - I wish I could say yes . - Has he been sedated ? - Heavy Thorazine , ... .. but it only knocked him back a little . He seems pretty manageable to me . It may be a form of organic delusional syndrome , ... .. possibly due to methamphetamine abuse . But he is prone to outbursts . - Who called you down on this case ? - Dr Kahn , from Social Health Services . - Could we speak to him ? - I don 't think he 's in today , but I can check . Orderly ! - Yes , Dr Stroman . - Stay away from me ! .. personally ordered the rape and murder of thousands of innocent civilians ... .. in war-torn regions of the former Yugoslavia . You got this case last night . Where from ? - An outside source . - Who ? This outside source , what 's his interest in this case ? What does he want us to uncover ? - I don 't know . - You 're not suspicious we 're being used ? We 've got bodies and confessed murderers . If we 're being used , it 's to find the connection . That 's what I 'm interested in . Isn 't this a school day ? - We didn 't cut . - We got a pass . You got a pass to come in here and eat these people 's food and watch their TV ? - No . - Are we in trouble now ? - How 'd you get in here ? - The window . They leave it open for the cat . Maybe you should head back to school . No , no . Use the front door . Mulder ! Look at this . There must be hundreds of videos here . Anything good ? All I see are recordings of cable news shows . They 're all dated and in chronological order . That 's what Patnik was watching at the hospital when he went all wiggy . What if there 's some connection ? Between what he recorded and what he did ? You 're the one who 's interested . I just watched 36 hours of Bernard Shaw and Bobby Batista . I 'm about ready to kill somebody , too . I 'm gonna show you something . These tapes are dated April 19th , April 21st and April 23rd . Each corresponds to a night that Patnik committed a murder . - What 's on the tapes ? - Among other things , ... .. a one-hour special report on the atrocities in Bosnia . A report that prominently features Lladoslav Miriskovic . The same guy that started Patnik screaming in the psych ward ? My guess is that once I review the tapes for the night that Patnik killed his wife , ... .. I 'll find that report there as well . You think that because he saw a war criminal on TV he was inspired to murder people ? Studies have linked violence on television to violent behaviour . Those studies assume that Americans are just empty vessels , ... .. ready to be filled with any idea fed to them , like Pavlov dogs , and go out and act on it . They believe that the causal connections are there . The studies have also linked cow flatulence and the depletion of the ozone layer . You 're talking pseudo-science used to make political book . All I 'm saying is that it 's clear that the programmes that Patnik watched ... .. somehow triggered his violent behaviour . - How ? - The doctor suggested amphetamine abuse . Maybe that , coupled with the disturbing television images , pushed him over the edge . Television does not make a previously sane man go out and kill five people ... .. thinking they 're the same guy . Not even must-see TV could do that . - OK . Then how do you explain it ? - I can 't . Not yet . - Where are you going ? - I 'm gonna get some sleep . Looks like you could use some , too . No . I 'm gonna watch the rest of these tapes . - Just out of curiosity . - You have fun . Yeah , OK . All right . I 've just been watching the tapes , yeah . All right , OK . No , she doesn 't . We 'll Ô¨Ånd out on The Prize is Nice ! And here 's your host , Mark Randolph ! Scully ? - Yeah . - I just got a call . There 's been another murder . Yeah , I 'll be right there . It was less than an hour ago . It matches our pattern . A housewife gone berserk . The car 's been moved . Did you go out last night ? No . I went out and I got a paper this morning . Why ? Nothing . Nothing . Let 's go see the crime scene . - That 's all the information I have . - OK . Thanks , Detective . I talked to the detective in charge . The shooter 's name is Helene Riddock , age 42 . - They took her to county lockup . - What happened ? She claims she looked out the window and saw her husband in the hammock ... .. with a blonde . - That blonde ? - He was only taking a nap with his dog . Mrs Riddock swears she looked out ... .. and saw her husband in the hammock with a blonde woman . She killed him because she thought he was cheating on her ? This isn 't her husband . Her husband 's a long-haul trucker . He 's out of town . This is , uh ... Mr John Gilnitz . It 's her next-door neighbour . She didn 't even have the right back yard . Helene Riddock lives over here . - Scully ? - Yeah , let 's check it out . One of my favourites . He is so cute ... The Little Traveler is normally 129.99 ... A thing of beauty is a joy for ever . What do you think , Scully ? I think television plays a large part in both of these murderers ' lives . As it does in almost every American home , but television does not equal violence . Unless you consider bad taste an act of violence . More tapes . Hang on a second . I 'll be right back . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! - Mulder , what are you doing ? - I 'm coming down . Maybe it 's a job for Special Agent Pendrall . - Yeah . - Want it analysed ? Yeah , I 'll do it . It makes more sense for you to interview Helene Riddock . Get her version of it . Maybe she knows what this thing is . - Is there a problem with that ? - No , that 's ... that 's fine . Stay in touch . It looks like a video trap for blocking premium cable channels . - What does it block ? - It doesn 't seem to block anything . - What does it do ? - Glad you asked . I bet all you guys were officers in the audiovisual club in high school , huh ? This is the straight feed off our bars-and-tone generator . And here they are as attenuated through the device . - Looks the same . - That 's what you 'd think . We couldn 't discern any difference , not until we compared them on the oscilloscope . - It still looks the same . - Hold onto your hat , dude . - We have touchdown . - So they 're different . - So ? They 're different . - You know the way television works . Yeah . You click it on , you have a picture . It 's a rapid series of still pictures fired against the tube . There 's something nonstandard here . Information is being added into the spaces between the still pictures . - What kind of information ? - We don 't know . This is all we do with this equipment . Can 't you take it apart ? Not without destroying it . That 's by design . An amazingly sophisticated design . All we can say for sure is ... This device is emitting a signal . - Mulder . - Where are you ? I was about to call you . I 'm on my way back . You may have been right . At least partly . I think a foreign signal is being introduced into these homes through the television set . - Scully , are you there ? - I 'm here . I think they may be running some kind of test . - Scully , did you hear what I just said ? - So you had it analysed ? Yeah . I just talked to Agent Pendrall . He said that you never showed up . - I didn 't take it over to Pendrall . - Then where were you ? I 'd rather talk about it when we get on a land line . We 've dealt with these kind of people before . We know what they can do . - What was that ? - What was what ? There . That noise . - Scully , is there something wrong ? - Mulder ... Mulder , who 's listening ... ? Scully , I 'm gonna be right there . Don 't go anywhere . Scully ... Get back ! Call the police ! Scully ! Scully ! - Hello ? - Mrs Scully , hi . It 's Fox Mulder . - What 's the matter ? - I was hoping that you 'd heard from Dana . - No . Has something happened ? - I 'm not exactly sure . There 's ... there 's some confusion here . - She 's missing . - What do you mean , " missing " ? Well , she ran off last night . Um ... We ... we 're looking for her as best we can , but we are a little concerned . Oh , my God . I hate to do this to you , but I gotta hang up on you right now . - Would you please tell me what 's wrong ? - I 'll call you as soon as I know something . Sir , can I have a word with you ? This is being conducted as if we 're seeking an escaped convict . I share your concern for Agent Scully . But she fired four rounds at you and an unarmed civilian . I know , but these officers should be instructed not to confront her . - What would you have them do ? - I think I can get her to listen to me . - She didn 't listen to you last night . - She 's suffering from a paranoid psychosis . - Brought on by what ? - I can 't explain the exact mechanism , ... .. but it 's linked to certain video tapes that we recovered from a crime scene . - Video tapes ? - They contain an electronic signal ... .. that somehow induces violent behaviour . - Do you have any proof of this ? - I 'm working on that . Whatever the reason , the fact remains that she is armed and dangerous . I suggest you marshal whatever resources you have to make sure you find her first . - Mulder . - We got something off that tape ... .. you found in Scully 's room . - What is it ? - Something interesting . But we don 't wanna talk about it over the phone . Big Brother may be listening . Here 's the tape Scully was reviewing last night . - We scanned samples of it onto disk . - Digitised it . Using some interpolating freeware we pulled off the Net , we blanked out visible frames . What am I looking at ? This is the signal your cable-trap device was emitting . We slowed it down significantly . It 's designed to cycle at 15 flashes a second , to induce " the photic driving response " . - Bring it home , boys . - It stimulates electrical activity in the brain . Studies have shown a correlation between ... .. heightened suggestibility and the manipulation of this response . - Mind control ? - 57 channels of it . Tachistoscopic images - like they used to sell popcorn at the movies . Russian and American scientists work with them . - Not to mention Madison Avenue . - The naked lady in the ice cube . - One of my personal favourites . - Why wasn 't I affected ? That 's the one thing we haven 't figured out yet . This , uh ... subliminal signal , could colour be a factor in it ? - Maybe . - I 'm red-green colour-blind . His inability to perceive red could render him immune to the psychotropic effects . Mulder . - I 'll be right there . - What happened ? Maryland State Police . They think they 've found Scully . Is she OK ? No . Um ... They think maybe I should come down and ID the body . - Get in . - I can 't talk to you right now . Get in before you get us both killed . - Interesting term . My partner may be dead . - It 's not my concern . The hell it isn 't ! We 're here because of you . - Keep your voice down . - Who do you work for ? We 're wasting time . They 're destroying the evidence . - Who ? - Just follow the evidence . If you don 't , by tomorrow the responsible parties will be out of your reach . A state highway patrolman found the body off a rural highway at approximately 2 p.m. Nude , shot in the forehead . - Are you ready ? - Let me do that . It 's not her . - Somebody has to call her mother . - We tried . We weren 't able to reach her . She 's not answering her phone ? - Mrs Scully , is she here ? - Uh , no . - You haven 't been answering your phone . - When I hear from her , I 'll call you . - I need to see her . - Fox , please go away . Go away ! Where is she ? Dana , put down the gun ! - I 'm here to help you , Scully . - I told you , Mom . He 's here to kill me . - I 'm on your side . - Put it down , Dana . Scully , listen to me carefully . You don 't know it , but you 're sick , ... .. with the same thing that drove those other people to murder . - Whatever you think may be happening ... - Just step back . Dana , you 're not yourself . He 's telling you the truth . It 's not the truth , Mom . He 's lied to me from the beginning . He never trusted me . Scully , you are the only one I trust . You 're in on it . You 're one of them . You 're one of the people who abducted me . You put that thing in my neck ! You killed my sister ! - That 's not true , Dana . - It is ! - I want you to listen to me . - Mom , get out of the way ! You trust me , don 't you ? You know that I would never hurt you . That I would never let anybody hurt you . That 's why you came here , isn 't it ? You 're safe here . Put the gun down , Dana . Put it down . Put it down . How are you feeling ? Ashamed . I was so sure , Mulder . I saw things and I heard things and ... It was just like the world was turned upside down . Everybody was out to get me . Now you know how I feel most of the time . - I thought you were gonna kill me . - I 'm not surprised . I did some checking . Joseph Patnik thought he was murdering a Bosnian war criminal , ... .. a man the media described as a modern-day Hitler . - Patnik 's parents were Holocaust survivors . - I 'm not following . Helene Riddock was scared her husband would be unfaithful . You see a pattern here ? What if this video signal turned these people 's anxieties ... .. into some kind of dementia ? A virtual reality of their own worst nightmares . Like me thinking that you 'd betray me . I was so far gone , Mulder , I thought that you had gone to the other side . What do you mean ? The man who smokes all those cigarettes , ... .. I was sure that I saw the two of you sitting in your car in the motel parking lot . You were reporting to him . You handed him a video tape . - It was crazy . - Uh , maybe not . - What do you mean ? - Somebody 's behind this . - You think it could be him ? - I don 't know . Why don 't you try to get some rest ? Dr Lorenz . Agent Mulder . I was about to check in on your partner . What treatment have you outlined for Agent Scully ? Nothing more than bed rest . We still don 't know what brought this on . There 's nothing medically wrong with her . - That didn 't seem to be the case last night . - No , it wasn 't . It 's got me puzzled . Her MRI was negative , but the spinal tap revealed high levels of seratonin in her brain . Would that account for her strange behaviour ? High seratonin levels have been associated with mania . But the good news is , as of this afternoon , her levels are pretty much back to normal . Dr Lorenz , uh ... would you have made a diagnosis of amphetamine abuse ... .. for someone in that condition ? Not given her seratonin levels . That wouldn 't make any sense . Braddock Heights . I need the number for the Frederick County Psychiatric Hospital , please . - Ward three . - This is Fox Mulder with the FBI . I need to talk to Dr Stroman . I 'm sorry , he 's no longer here . I believe he returned to Washington . - You know where I can reach him ? - He left us a local number . It 's around here somewhere . Is it 555-0135 ? - That 's it . - Thank you . You want me to go first this time ? Damn straight . I haven 't had a chance to clean the room yet . He just checked out . But with all the excitement , I don 't blame him . You charge for local calls . You have a record of them all ? - I 'll get it for you . - Thank you . Here you go . Thanks . Thank you . Danny , it 's Mulder . I need you to check a number . - That 's what he told me , Stroman . - Then where is he ? He said he 'd be here . - He 'll be here . - It 's almost seven o 'clock . There 's no sign of him . You 're too late , Agent Mulder . Now that you 've destroyed all the evidence . You were told this would happen . - I just didn 't know I was working for you . - I had no alternative . I was being watched . I couldn 't risk compromising myself . Why kill them if you wanted them exposed ? Those were always my orders . I was just hoping you 'd get to them first . And uncover what ? Were they trying to manipulate people 's behaviour ? Influence their decisions ? What to buy ? Who to vote for ? You think they 'll stop at commerce and politics ? Where will they stop ? - That 's where you failed , Mulder . - Don 't lay this off on me ! You pulled me into this because you didn 't have the courage to reveal the truth yourself ! - Feel better now ? - You 're a coward ! You feed me scraps of information , hoping that I can piece it together ! You 've made me risk my life , you 've risked my partner 's life . You never risk your own ! You 're not walking away from this . You 're risking your life right now . You failed . This is your success ? Killing me ? The truth is ... you need me , Agent Mulder . - This is your final report , Agent Mulder ? - Yes , sir . I see more questions here than I do answers . You don 't know who manufactured it or what its purpose was . No , sir . - Agent Scully , welcome back . - I just got back from the document section . What did you find out about the two dead men ? The cable company employee had no criminal record . In fact , there was nothing remarkable about him whatsoever . We found the medical licence under the name " Dr Henry Stroman " in Falls Church , Virginia . He died in 1978 . What about the killer ? He remains an unknown subject . Have you completed your work ? All the personnel and hardware have been removed , but Mulder still has a device . Well , it proves nothing . What about , uh ... Mulder 's source ? He 's been eliminated . And his source ? Who 's he working with ? That person remains unknown . I made this !

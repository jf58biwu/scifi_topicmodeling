 You make man ? No . Woman . Woman . THEME SONG : Weird science . Pictures from a magazine . Diagrams and charts . Mending broken hearts and making weird science . Something like a recipe . Bits and pieces . Bits and pieces , pieces , pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation . Oh , my creation . It 's my creation . No heart of gold . Just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation . Oh , my creation . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand . Why don 't people understand ? It 's alive . Alive ! [ GIGGLING ] I don 't know what I was thinking . This guy was as dumb as toast . We had nothing to talk about . I 'm not surprised he dumped me . Come on , Mindy . He was lucky you didn 't dump him first . Thanks , Wy . You 're a good friend . I guess that 's why we never went out . What ? Cause we 're such good friends . I guess . We just don 't think of each other that way . Maybe we should start . When ? I 'm either tied up in some steamy , purely physical relationship or your- - you know , hanging with that guy with the hair . Gary . Right . You 're not going out with anybody now . OK . Let 's do it . A real date . Drive by Saturday at 7 : 00 and pick me up . [ BELL RINGING ] Drive by ? [ MUSTARD SQUIRTING ] But you don 't have a car . What 's the problem ? Just have daddy loan you the Mercedes . It 's off limits . I 'm not even allowed to sit in it . [ SPEAKING ITALIAN ] OK . Then ask Lisa to shazam you some wheels and me some lunch . And have it morph into some three headed ostrich half way to school ? No thanks . Besides I want to work for it . Are you kidding ? You know how long you 'd have to work at a job to get enough money to get a car ? You must be thinking of a different kind of work . Hey , dad . You having a good day ? Not too bad . - Can I ask you a question ? - Mm hm . I know you 've been kind of busy , so I just wanted to remind you , I 'm in high school now . Really ? Thanks for the update . My female peers are starting to see my lack of an automobile as a social black mark . Isn 't that right , Gar ? Um- - yeah . No wheels , no squeals , Mr. D. A car , huh ? I think your mother and I could consider that . Oh , I would take any car in this magazine . Look at this . Sweet ! Looks like the one Randy Lavick 's is cruising around in . Yeah . And you know who he 's going out with ? Dana Dupree . No . I 'm telling you , it 's the car . You need a cool car . Well , I 'm definitely smelling a beamer in your future . [ RAYS FLASHING ] Hey . You get your new set of wheels yet ? Not yet . What 's with the beach thing ? Well , I 'm taking off for a little while . I need a vacation . A vacation ? Why ? It 's not like you have a job . You 're kidding me , right ? So I suppose zapping in and out of your lives every 15 minutes to answer your every little need doesn 't count , huh ? Lisa , take us skiing . Lisa , make us rock stars . Lisa , blow my nose . I work 24 hours a day , 8 days a week for you guys , and I 'm getting a little stressed , OK ? So just back off before I turn you both inside out . So I was thinking Hawaii . ( TOGETHER ) Hawaii 's good . I 'm glad you understand . I won 't be far and I even got you a little present . What 's this ? It 's a beeper . Just squeeze them , if you need me . But only if you really need me , OK ? - Sure . - OK . Thanks . Have fun . Bye . [ RAYS FLASHING ] Dare you to squeeze them . Have you ever been turned inside out ? [ HORN HONKING ] Surprise . She 's all yours . A Pinto ? 1977 Ford Pinto . In some countries , this pup 's considered a classic . Dad , you gotta be kidding me . Wyatt , look , I know you were hoping for something a bit more sporty . And yes , I could have gotten you a BMW . Pretty easily , in fact . But your mother and I made that mistake with Chett . Hm ? We bought him the jeep he wanted and I 'm afraid we spoiled him . It 's true . I 'm a mess . Father , what have you done to me ? A car is nothing more than transportation , Wyatt . Most kids don 't even have that . So enjoy . A Pinto ? Now if you don 't like this , there 's always the lawnmower . [ SPUTTERING LIKE LAWNMOWER ] It 's not so bad . It 's kind of retro in a " Pulp Fiction , " " Brady Bunch " sort of way . More like " Chitty Chitty Bang Bang . " Let 's get a second opinion . [ BEEPING ] [ RAYS FLASHING ] What ? A Pinto ? That 's what your dad got you ? What a joke . I love it . [ RAYS FLASHING ] Thanks for your help . She was laughing with you . No . No , it is a joke . Mindy 's never going to go out with me in this piece of junk . Imagine a date in this thing . [ HEAVY BREATHING ] Old piece of junk . Piece of junk . [ HORN HONKING ] Whoa ! Babe magnet ! Oh my- - How 's this ? A little better ? Whoa . She goes 0 to 60 in one second , turns into a hovercraft on water , never needs gas , and is fully computerized . So all you do is program where you want to go and it takes you there . Oh , Gary , look ! A cup holder ! If you have any questions , ask the car . I 'm out of here . [ RAYS FLASHING ] What 'd she mean by ask the car ? CAR : Ask the car . Hello ? CAR : I 'm Nadine . And I 'm here to fulfill your every driving need . Just squeeze into my bucket seats and press my pedal to the metal . I 'm in love . CAR : Why don 't we- - Oh ! CAR : Take a little drive . [ WHEELS SCREECHING ] Hey ! [ MUSIC PLAYING ] I am your car , Wyatt . Alive and in tune with your every driving desire . I am one with you . Man and machine . Fused at the heart . Thundering down your diamond lane of love . [ MUSIC - QUEEN , " I 'M IN LOVE WITH MY CAR ] Oh , Nadine . Mm . That was incredible . CAR : I loved you the minute your jeans sat across my bucket seat . What is it about you ? You 're so different from other girls . CAR : Maybe it 's that I can turn out 575 foot pounds of torque . Or that I 've got wipers on my headlights . No . No , it 's deeper . Mm . You understand me . You 're part of me . It 's like we 're joined together . CAR : I feel the same way , baby . Come on . I 'm going to get you waxed and buffed . [ ENGINE REVVING ] [ HAWAIIAN MUSIC PLAYING ] Mm . Thank you , Les . I 'm surprised . It 's been a whole day and they haven 't paged me once . They can hardly make it through an hour without some kind of magic . They could have called just to say hi . I 'm not gone forever . You having a good time , Wyatt ? You seem a little distracted . No . No , this is great . Ouch ! - What is it ? - Something just jabbed me . Yeah . It 's probably some kind of short circuit . These new cars . Hey , I got some CDs in the trunk . Maybe you could find some , you know , date music ? Sure . That 'd be good . CAR : Sure . That 'd be good . Look at me . I 'm so pretty . Why are you acting like this ? CAR : You said you were going to blow her off . I never said that . Look , Mindy and I are old friends . That 's all . CAR : Oh , come on . She wants you . The way she laughs at everything you say . All that crap about her family . You have to choose , Wyatt . I don 't want to be just your car . I feel the same way , but- - Dump the flesh bag . [ TRUNK SLAMMING ] MINDY : Ow ! Anything for you . You ought to get that trunk checked out . I swear , it almost closed on my fingers . Yeah . You know , Mindy , I don 't think this is working . Whoa , what did I miss ? Truth is , I met someone else . [ RADIO PLAYING ] I hate this car . What ? Look , we were both so psyched about trying this date thing and now you 've met someone . That 's cool . And it 's not like we 're madly in love with each other . [ COUGHING ] I got to get out of here . I can 't breath . Nadine , open the door ! - Is she here ? - All right . Nadine , stop it now ! I did what you wanted . I told her the true . Nadine ! Wyatt ? Come on , don 't be mad . Talk to me . You gotta know how I feel about you by now . You 're the only car for me , import or domestic . Wyatt ? [ KISSING ] Whoa . I know some guys really get off on their cars , but this is sick . I 'm out of here . Mindy ! CAR : Let her go . He kissed the car ? - Right on the steering wheel . - What did he say ? You 're the only car for me . Import or domestic ? Exactly . This is not good . Something should be done . You 're not saying- - I think you know what I 'm saying . Let 's do it . [ HAWAIIAN MUSIC PLAYING ] Like I can 't relax . I am relaxed . Do I seem tense to you , Les ? Mm . That feels fantastic . OK . So maybe I am a little bit wound up . I mean , why shouldn 't I be ? I work hard for those guys . I mean , I 'm only a super computer , magic genie . I do have limits . Even Mr. Roarke needed to take a day off every now and again . And he had Tattoo to do his dirty work . Mm . You 're very good , Les . I was thinking maybe we can go back to your garage and I could steam clean your engine . CAR : Mm . I 'd like that , Wyatt . Look at the two of them . All cute and cuddly . Makes you sick . It 's not right , a guy dating his car . They have nothing in common . We have more in common than they do . And we hardly know each other . I 'm sorry . Me , too . This isn 't right . I wanted you the second we met . I felt the same way . Will you go out with me ? I can 't . Wyatt 's my best friend . Well , he 's my friend , too . And that 's it . Besides , he 's found someone else , remember ? OK . But let 's take care of the car first . Do you have plan ? We 'll push that bitch over the cliff and watch her explode into a million burning pieces straight into hell ! Then we can go for burgers . You frighten me . I like that . Gary ? CAR : I thought I told you to stay clear . Put it in park , Nadine . This won 't take long . Wyatt , you have to break up . I can 't . I don 't want to . Nadine 's special . She 's not like other girls . Of course , she 's not . She 's a car . You 're going out with an automobile . What are doing ? Ow ! CAR : Let him go . I 'm sorry , I got to do this , buddy . But it 's for your own good . Oh ! That wasn 't so hard . Take him home . I 'll take care of her . Good luck . CAR : You 're going to pay for this , Wallace . I don 't think so , you mutant Buick . Say goodbye to asphalt . [ AIRBAG INFLATING ] [ GROANING ] CAR : Now what were you saying ? [ BEEPING ] Lisa ! Help ! [ PAGER BUZZING ] Lisa ! Help ! [ BEEPING ] [ BUZZING ] CAR : No one can hear you , Gary . It 's just me and you now . You thought you could split me and Wyatt apart ? Thought you could drive me over the edge ? All because you think Wyatt dating a car is somehow wrong ? Well , you 're right . It is wrong . The whole thing 's a charade . Wyatt and I don 't belong together . It 's you I really love . Come again ? CAR : All this anger between us , it 's passion , Gary . Passion by any other name . [ RADIO PLAYING ] Hey , is that Barry White ? I love Barry White . CAR : We were meant to be together . Huh ? You tried to kill me . You 're going out with my best friend and you 're a talking car . No offense , but you 're not really grade A babe-age . CAR : Open your mind , Gary . Race my engine . No . CAR : Feel my plush and supple interior . No . CAR : Smell that new car smell . [ SNIFFING ] Oh . CAR : Why don 't we take a little drive ? [ ENGINE REVVING ] [ MUSIC , QUEEN , " I 'M IN LOVE WITH MY CAR " ] I 'm your car , Gary . Alive and in tune with your every driving desire . I am one with you . Man and machine . Fused at the heart . Oh , mama . CAR : Thundering down the diamond lane of love . [ CRICKETS CHIRPING ] How are you feeling ? Uh- - better . Thanks . I 'm glad you guys showed up when you did . Every time I got behind that wheel , something happened . I forgot who I was . Wyatt , there 's something you should know . Gary and I are dating . What ? Well , you 'd moved on . And it just kind of happened . We couldn 't stop it . It 's OK . Hi , guys . Oh , Gary ! Thank god , you 're alive ! Yup . I am . And the whole Nadine thing has been taken care of . Well , I told Wyatt everything about how our love is bigger than both of us . Yeah . Well it 's not big enough . What do you mean ? I 'm seeing Nadine now . ( TOGETHER ) What ? I thought you were sending her to the scrap heap ? I was , but then she revved up to 280 horses of love . And I buckled up . I 'm going to be sick . Nadine could never love you . She loves me ! Sorry , Wy . You 've been traded in . She 's in my fast lane now . Oh , man . Dumped by a car . Stop this . Do you hear yourselves ? You cannot have a car for a girlfriend . A car can 't cuddle , or go dancing , or hold you when you 're sad . Yeah . Well , you can 't do doughnuts in a parking lot or do a quarter mile in under six seconds . And you 're wrong about the cuddling . You 're all freaks ! I 'm out of here ! Sorry , man , but the vehicle made her choice . But hey , if you ever need a ride , you got it ! This isn 't over . Whoa . What is this ? Wyatt traded in the Pinto ? Nah . No way could he afford this . He must have blown his trust fund on this baby . Oh . [ CAR BEEPING ] Oh . Oh , yeah . Definitely sweet . CAR : Mm . Hello , Chett . Nadine . I miss you so much . Wyatt ? What do you want ? I need Nadine 's owner 's manual . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Oh , come on . I know you have it . I got to change her oil and I can 't find her dipstick . Ha ! I found it my first time . It was natural and loving . I didn 't need any books or manuals to figure it out . Shut up . [ RAYS FLASHING ] Hey , I 'm back . And look . I brought you guys all kinds of presents . My magic genie went to Hawaii and all I got was this lousy t-shirt . ( TOGETHER ) Thanks . So what 's up ? Gary 's just being a butt wad- - Wyatt won 't let me borrow the- - I 'm serious ! You don 't know what you 're talking about . You don 't know anything about cars anyway ! You don 't know anything about cars ! [ SPEAKING IN HIGH SPEED ] ( TOGETHER ) And that 's why he 's wrong and I 'm right . I can solve this for you . The three of you have to sit down and talk it through . You can 't both have Nadine . CAR : OK . We 're here . Now what 's the big secret ? We have a problem . We both want to go out with you . So you have to choose . CAR : I 'm going out with Gary now . Had our chance , Wyatt . There . It 's settled . Uh- - can we give you a lift somewhere ? No . Wait . Nadine , you can 't just toss me off like that . Not after everything we 've shared . I 've seen under your hood . Well , I don 't know . Gary 's is in the driver 's seat now . So that 's it ? Whoever 's behind your wheel gets to go out with you ? No . It 's not like that at all . Oh , really ? Gary , switch seats with me . What 's this going to prove ? Nadine 's into to me . CAR : How could I have been so stupid ? Wyatt 's the only man for me . Oh , kiss me , Gary . You 're right . She just wants whoever 's driving . We thought we meant something to you . CAR : You do . Maybe you guys can take turns . Oh , that 's sick . I 've heard enough . End of the road , Nadine . We 're selling you for parts . CAR : Yeah ? Well , you both shift like sissies . At least we don 't leave stains in the driveway . CAR : Do you think you can just walk away like I 'm some kind of a cheap , domestic rental ? I won 't be ignored ! I 've got the power . I 've got the control . I 've got the keys . - You OK ? - Yeah . You ? Yeah . We got to make a pact . We can 't let another girl ever come between us . I don 't care what she 's packing under the hood , it 's not worth it . Deal . Little bro , we need to talk . Chett , what are you doing here ? I , uh- - I was just driving around . And , uh- - hey , you know . Want to sell your car ? Sell it ? You can have it . If the price is right . You couldn 't afford it . Trade you my jeep . And ? And I 'll give you back everything I ever stole from you . Your VCR , stereo , and that Snoopy watch you lost when you were eight . You have that . Well , duh . I don 't know . You don 't understand . I have to have her . I mean it . Look , it 's personal , OK ? I can 't explain . Well , if she means that much to you . She does , she does , she does . Grazie , paisano . Mm . Oh . It 's me , my sweet . I 'm back for you . We can be together now . [ ENGINE REVVING ] What are you staring at ? Nadine . Mm . I know this may seem a little sudden . But I want you to move in with me . I love you . [ ROOF RAISING ] CAR : ( MONSTER VOICE ) I love you , too , baby . [ SCREAMING ] CHETT DONNELLY : You 're not Nadine ! Let me out ! THEME SONG : Weird science . Fantasy and microchips . Shooting from the hip . Something different . We 're making weird science . Pictures from a magazine . Bits and pieces .

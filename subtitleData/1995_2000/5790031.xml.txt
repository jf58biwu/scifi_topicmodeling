 My name is Jake . That 's all I can tell you . I can 't tell you my last name or where I live because the controllers are everywhere . How you doing ? Nice day . They could be anyone . They could be you . Work faster ! There can be no sign that the andalite was ever here . Come on . What 's taking so long ? Well , we didn 't expect this much debris . There 's ... just , well there 's a thousand pieces . I told you I wanted this cleaned up by now . Look , we only need a couple more hours . Hello .. are you looking for Cassie ? Uh . Yeah . She 's around here somewhere . I 'm Cassie 's mom . I haven 't seen you before . That 's Tobias . He just moved here . Hi Aisha . Hi . Hi Marco . It must be cool , living on a preserve . Well life is certainly never dull . Here you go , home sweet home . Wow , he 's beautiful . His mother was shot by a poacher . We hatched him and raised him . I 'll bet he misses her . He probably never even knew her . That 's right . Hi . - Hi Jake . Is Cassie around ? You know , she 's probably up at the house . I 'll send her down . Come here . I just went by the ... You guys be careful . Those animals are wild . I don 't want to have to sew any fingers back on . I just went by the plant . It 's crawling with controllers , and there were cops . But if there were cops ? Duh . The cops are controllers too . - At least some of them . What if they saw you ? - They didn 't . If the police are controllers , what else : teachers , government , newspapers , tv ? TV ? Not tv ! What ? That disk that Elfangor tried to give you . Do you have any idea where you might have dropped it ? I didn 't drop it ! I never even touched it . - We got to find it . With all those controllers , we can 't exactly sneak back into the plant . No , but we could go back as animals . Shouldn 't we wait for Cassie ? Yeah , what 's taking her so long anyways ? I think we all need to be here for this . She better not flake . Who you calling a flake ? Cassie ? - Yeah it 's me . It 's amazing . - Man ! Really ? Yo , she 's lost it . No she hasn 't . When I want you to hear me , I can direct the thought speak to you . Oh Cass , that 's disgusting . Eew .. gross .. - Oh man ! That is gross . I 'm going to throw up . It 's getting smoother . - That 's smoother ? That was harsh . We 'll have to get used to that . You guys , it was so awesome . I mean I was a horse . I was powerful and fast . Weren 't you scared ? - I sure was . So was I at first , but .. I started to run and I forgot all about being scared . Okay .. who 's next ? I 'll go . - Surprise , surprise . Hey kitty . Touch it . Whoa .. what 's that ? That 's it . Now you 've acquired the cat 's DNA . Now concentrate . Think about it . Think about being a cat ... . and you 'll morph . Is it happening ? I feel weird . Yes Yes She 's ignoring you . - Of course , she 's a cat . Rachel , are you okay ? Don 't bother me . I feel very , very cool .. Way to go Rach . Alright Marco , it 's your turn . Come on man .. - Look , I say we forget it . We don 't mention it and we don 't morph . Marco .. I halfway agree with you but ... - This isn 't some dumb video game . We could get killed . You saw what happened to that andalite . Don 't you get it ? This is for real . You don 't even know what reality is . Nothing bad 's ever happened to you . You have this perfect family like I used to have . Marco I ... I know . Well go on , say it . You can say it . My mom 's dead and that 's reality . You can all think whatever you want if something bad was to happen to me , my dad would lose it . No one 's asking you to risk your life right now . I mean learning to morph might be the one thing that can save your life . That 's right . I mean the yeerks are a reality for us now . Your dad might freak if you weren 't around . I think he 'd freak out even more if you had a yeerk in your brain . Come on Marco . It 's okay . Really . Alright . All right . But I get to choose which animal . Okay , as you can see we 've got a wide selection from the animal kingdom . We have our medium sized animals and ... we have our cuter ones . Why don 't we start off small , and work our way up ? Maybe one of these . I always wanted a rat . Just never thought I 'd be one . Marco meet Bitsy , Bitsy meet Marco . You know the drill right ? - Touch it and think about the rat . It 's acquired . Now concentrate . Make it stop ! What ? Am I a rat ? I 'd say you were a rat man . I can 't do it . I dare you . Give me the stupid rat . You don 't need to . It 's already acquired . Remember , touch , acquire , concentrate and change . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Rachel , no ! - Rachel , it 's me ! Control Rachel . Control the animal mind . Control , you can 't eat Marco . You guys , you have to control the animal brain . Whoa .. okay .. I think I 'm in control now . Run , run , run , run . Marco , are you in control ? Rachel , Marco , change back now . Okay , I 'm coming back . Whew .. that was wild . Oh man .. I feel like I ate a couple pounds of coffee . It was like having two minds : one animal and one human . And they 're fighting each other . The human mind is stronger . We just have to learn how to focus . - It 's not easy . No kidding.I just wanted to sink my teeth into your soft furry rat neck . That 's what all the girls say . We got to be careful though guys . That 's right . Elfangor said no more than two hours . We have to remember why we 're doing this . It 's to help us fight the yeerks . Thanks for reminding me perrito . - You 're welcome rat man . Alright , we 've all done it . - Hold on , Tobias hasn 't . I forgot about Tobias . Sorry Tobias . This is totally uncool . What if he freaks and turns us all in . He wouldn 't do that . - How do you know ? We just met the guy last night . For all we know he could be working for the yeerks right now . If he was , he would have turned us in already . Where could he have gone ? Does anyone know where he lives ? - He said he didn 't have parents . He 's kind of a strange guy , that 's for sure . What if he went back for the disk without us ? So .. what should we do ? Yeah , what should we do , oh great leader ? Since when am I the leader ? You just are . Well I guess .. uh .. I guess we 'll have to get Elfangor 's disk back first . You 're given this to me ? - Don 't you want it ? I want it , but you said if I ever touched it again , you 'd kill me . How come you 're giving it to me ? I don 't know . I guess it 's because you 're my little sister . Where are you going ? Yeah . - What 's wrong with it ? Come on dad . Try it . Oh thanks buddy , but you know what ? I 'm really not that hungry . Come on dad , don 't you want to grow up to be big and strong ? Okay .. well look at this . I didn 't know you knew how to cook . Man , I can cook . I 'll be right back . What 's up . - Let 's go . We 're suppose to meet up in five minutes . Yeah I know . Just let me grab my stuff . You know what ? Wait here . I 'll be right there . Hey Jeremy . I 'll be back dad . - Where are you going ? Me and the guys are doing kind of a scavenger hunt . That 's too bad . They 're going to be showing the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers . Hey , I 'll tape it for you if you show me how to program this vcr . Hello ? You 're an engineer . You can 't program a vcr ? You 're so ... I 'll be back pops . Don 't worry about it . You 're beautiful . All right , let 's get some of it down here . Excuse me , but am I the only one here who can see this Hork-Bajir footprint ? Will somebody fill it in before it makes the front page ? Alright guys . Let 's get to it . Any sign of Tobias ? - Nothing . Rachel , see if you can find that disk . - Okay . It 's not the sight , so much as the sound that gets me . Wait , you look too good to be a stray . Wait . Watch it Marco . - Better . Guys , leave me alone . I 'm just trying to help . - Yeah , right . Let 's speed it up . Visser Three wants this yard cleaned up tonight . She 's okay . I found it . Chapman 's practically standing on it . We 've got to move fast . Okay , I 'll help Cassie with the paint . Marco you ready ? - Yeah . When I give the signal , go . Good luck guys . I want everyone to look close to the ground . Search the entire area . What is it ? What 's that ? Over here ! Help ! They 're landing . Over here ! Help ! Help ! I don 't see a thing . Andalite ! Follow them . Hurry , hurry , come on ! I hope this thing 's worth it . Dig Jake , dig . I have to tell Visser Three . Hurry Jake . They 're here . Go Jake , go , go ! - I got it . Hurry Jake ! - No , not that way ! We 're trapped . - Over here ! I 've got two of them . I smell a promotion . Let 's go Rachel , run ! That was too close . Keep running until we get to the woods . The controllers are all over this place . Come on guys , it 's gotta be over here . I think we lost them . You got it ? You got the disk ? We got it . We got the disk . Yes . The controllers are still back there waiting for the andalites . It worked . That was great Cass . Hey , look . Hi . You saved us . We didn 't know what happened to you . Thanks . And you 'd do the same for me right ? We thought you were a controller . Why did you disappear ? Why didn 't you tell us you acquired the hawk ? I don 't know . - We were all scared . Yeah , but , I guess I was a bit scared that maybe I 'd like it too much . I know what you mean . Well thanks . We would have been dead meat without you . Where 's the disk ? Wow . - Weird . You think it works in a computer ? Maybe it 's a weapon . Maybe we could try it out on Jake 's computer . We gotta make sure nobody see it . OK . I 'll keep it overnight and we 'll try it tomorrow . All right ? Yeah , sure . Cool . Well I gotta go ... believe it or not , I got an algebra test tomorrow . Yeah , I 've got some homework as well . And I 've got a meet tomorrow . Hey do the cat on the balance beam and you 'll be sure to get a 10 . Cool . My name is Jake , but I guess that doesn 't matter anymore . Hey guys wait up ! Five normal kids against and army of ruthless alien slugs those yeerks don 't know what they 're in for .

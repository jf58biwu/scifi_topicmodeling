 [ woman ] Last time on the Fantastic Four , Ben Grimm is lured into a trap by the mysterious Madam Medusa . He is then captured by an evil inventor , the Wizard , and his fellow inventors , the Trapster and Hydroman . Once in the clutches of these Frightful Four , Ben is subjected to the Wizard 's id machine . This sinister device changes the Thing from a lovable blue-eyed hero to a virulent creature of hate , bent on destroying his best friend , Reed Richards . With the powerful Thing as an ally , the Wizard soon has the Fantastic Four in his clutches and Reed Richards seems doomed . Only the love of Alicia Masters can finally break the web of hate and bring the Thing back to his right mind . But the Torch has other things on his mind . He 's smitten with the beautiful Medusa . When Torch has the chance to capture her , he lets Medusa get away , which puts him in the hot seat with his buddies . And now part two of The Inhuman Saga . [ Reed ] Amazing ! Average hair diameter , 0.045 inches . And each strand has greater tensile strength , modulus of elasticity , and sheer resistance than a titanium iron wire of the same thick ... Whoa-ho-ho ! Wait ! Mind putting ' that into somethin ' resembling ' the King 's English ? What it means , Ben , is that I wish Johnny had not let Medusa escape . Enough 's enough , brother-in-law ! Reed . This hair sample proves she 's something more than human . I 'd simply like to know more about her . You ain 't the only one , Stretcho . I think Torchy here has the hots for that wacko redhead . Whoa ! You and Reed have been all over me about this for a week ! - Now just back off , you hear ! - Oh , touchy , touchy . Johnny , wait . Nice work , you two . Can 't you see he feels bad enough already ? Why don 't you lay off the kid ? " The kid . " That 's just what they all treat me like , a little kid . Even my own sister . Susie still thinks she has to fight my battles for me , just like when we were kids . - Whoa ! What the ... ? - Keep driving . If it isn 't the carrot-topped girl of my dreams . Just keep driving . Faster ! It 's a matter of my life and death . You can stow the blaster , Red . [ tires screech ] Any pretty lady who wants a little joyride in this buggy has just gotta ask . [ tires screech ] Yah ! It seems like this new super-padded exercise room is pretty good therapy , huh , Ben ? Yeah , nice cooking ' . You know , Stretcho . I been meaning to tell you . Well , you know , about ... what I almost did last week . - I know , Ben . - Yeah , well , I wasn 't myself . The Wizard messed with my mind . - I 'd never hurt you or Susie . - Aw , forget it , Ben . Friends never need to apologize . Especially best friends . [ grunts ] [ gasps ] Hey , isn 't it kinda amazing how this new hyper-elasticized fabric can absorb just about anything ? - [ rumbling ] - What the ... ? Comes with a built-in reverb , too , huh ? Hey , some bigfoot 's wrecking ' my rec room ! It 's walking right up the side of our building . But I can 't see who ... Ow ! Just as well , Stretcho . When I 'm done with our wacky wallwalker , there won 't be enough left for a positive I.D. Reed ! Our new building . Construction insurance ain 't gonna cover this kind of thing ! Bigfoot is copping ' our chopper . And he 's damaged the Fantasticar so we can 't follow ! Yeah , all our vehicles have " Trash Me " painted on them lately . Hey , ah , you mind cluein ' me in on what 's goin ' on ? [ spluttering ] Guess what , Red . Corny as this sounds , we 're outta gas . [ gasps ] - Is this a trap ? - Trap ? Lady , last time I looked , you 're the one holdin ' the blaster . You know , kidnapping ' me could land you in the slammer along with the Wizard and your other pals . But you really seem too nice , not to mention too pretty , for that . How 'd you get hooked up with those losers , anyhow ? Oh ! It seems like so long ago . I found myself in Paris , stealing just to stay alive . But when the French police had finally tracked me down , the Wizard arrived and distracted them long enough for me to escape . When the Wizard asked me to join what became the Frightful Four , I readily accepted . I felt I owed him that much . And I was tired of being so alone . You said you found yourself in Paris . - Where do you really come from ? - I ... I don 't know . I have no memory of anything before that . And yet I 've always sensed that someone is after me , following me everywhere , even here to America . Listen , why don 't you let me help ? Trust me . After all , I let you escape back at the warehouse . Let me escape ? Madam Medusa needs no help from an insolent youth ! Oh , so you 're copping ' that I 'm-just-a-kid attitude , too ? This kid 's gettin ' a little steamed at havin ' that blaster stuck in his face . The vacuum pellet temporarily drains the oxygen from around you , Torch . Strange . You deliberately missed me with your flame . Well , no matter . By the time you recover , I will be safely gone . Though we met as enemies , there is much kindness in you , Johnny Storm . [ thudding ] Medusa ! I 've waited too long , searched too far , to fail now ! No ! [ shrieks ] Who are you ? [ gasps ] Flame on ! I always liked hot cars but ... Hey ! Why don 't you consider putting the lady down , hammer toes ? Meddlesome human ! Your attempt to protect Medusa is futile ! Whoa ! - Stop ! - Gorgon takes orders from no one ! Hey , and now that buggy looks awfully familiar . Well , stolen gyrocopter or not , I should still be able to catch him unless he uses the new turbo-chargers I installed . Not another pellet ! I 'm gonna have to start takin ' out fire insurance ! Aaagh ! Gotta jump-start my flame . 10,000 volts oughta do it ! Lucky me brain-in-law Reed made our costumes insulated . Houston Control , we have ignition ! What ? - Gorg ... - Gorgon ! Yes , it is I , Medusa . Did you think you could flee Attilan and elude us for ever ? Attilan ? I don 't know of any Atti ... Wait ! Attilan ! It 's all coming back to me now . What happened before Paris . Who I am . Where I really come from . Oh , Gorgon ... Foolish human ! Trying to rescue you will only ensure his doom ! Flame 's still too weak to catch ' em ! But I can still sunburn those turbo-chargers with concentrated beams of ultraviolet rays ! - [ rattling ] - We 're losing power . Bingo ! Now , gotta pour it on ! Really feel the burn ! Torch ! No ! Don 't ! - Relax , Red . I won 't burn ya ! - Release me ! You don 't know what you 're doing . Yeah , it 's a good thing he never stomped his size 18s into our air-jet hangar . - Gorgon followed me around the world ... - Listen , lady ! You gotta trust me ! This kid 's gonna help you whether you want it or not . Aw , man . Those vacuum pellets really took some fuel outta my furnace . I may have to join Flame Losers Anonymous ! Reed ! Look ! Whoa , Susie . Nice driving ' . Course . I 'm the one who got you off training wheels , remember ? Ha , ha . Well , congratulations , shrimp ! You finally caught this carrot-topped crook ! And only one week behind schedule . Gee ! You don 't understand . I am not a criminal . - Release me or you will be ... - Destroyed ! Medusa ! Just can 't hold onto a gal , eh , junior ? Well , let Old Blue Eyes show you how heroes do it . - What ? That ugly creature ... - Ugly , huh ? We 'll see how pretty you look after I finish stuffin' those clodhoppers of yours into your mouth . Arrogant monster . Show some respect for the idol of millions ! [ snorts , grunts ] To battle Gorgon is futile , Ben Grimm ! His powerful kick can topple anything ! Well , I ain 't just any Thing , lady . I 'm the ever-lovin ' , blue-eyed , clobberin ' , flavored original ! The roof 's so torn up , we can 't land there ! But my force field can . Take the controls . - What is this ? - Agh ! - Never felt such force ... - Darling ! Now you did it ! You hurt Susie , you two-bit grapestomper . - Gorgon ! Wait ! - Relax , sister . This 'll only hurt him for a year or two . Idle threats do not impress Gorgon . You 're just in time for a little roof-rumblin ' . Oh , and some light clobberin ' . Stop all this destruction , Gorgon ! All this destruction is because of you . You who fled the Great Refuge to live among lowly humans . I didn 't flee . It was Maximus ' doing ! He erased my memory and sent me to the human world . Maximus the Mad ? Ah , now the puzzle makes sense . Well , I 'm glad you like a good puzzle , buddy . Because I 'm gonna rearrange your pieces ! Enough ! Medusa must be returned where she belongs ! It is forbidden for our race to mingle with mere humans . - Their race ? - Mere humans ? Ha , ha , ha . Pal , you better get your eyes checked ! - Wait , we should try to ... - Enough with you meddlers ! [ all scream ] - Thought I 'd take the express . - I 'm going to find Medusa ! Johnny , maybe Medusa doesn 't want to be found . Oh , she 'll change her tune once she gets to know me . Johnny , wait ! Your flame powers are still too weak . Think so ? Well , just watch my smoke ! Old hot-and-bothered just can 't seem to ... ¶ Burn that redhead out of his hair ¶ She is a fascinating woman . You don 't say . Oh , why in a purely scientific way , of course , darling . Oh , yes , of course . Okay , down , boys . We 'd better find that brother of mine before he gets in more trouble than he can burn his way out of . No sign of ' em down there . You 'd think with gunboats like his , Gorgon would stick out like a sore toe . Yes ! Ha , ha ! When you 're hot , you 're hot . Uh-oh , but I 'm not . I 'm still not up to full steam yet . I hate it when Reed 's right . Better save my strength . Who knows what could be hiding down there ? - [ gasps ] - Whoa ! A girl . And a real looker too . Hello . Are you lost ? - No , stay away ! - Hey , hey , chill ! I just want to talk . I 'm not gonna hurt you . Hey ! Whoa ! What happened ? Hey , where 'd you go ? Oh , man , Torch , you must be losin ' your touch . Beautiful , mysterious ladies keep slippin ' right through your fingers . No ! Go away ! They must not find you ! - They who ? - Goodbye . Hey ! What are you , some kinda pyromaniac ? Fire 's not the recommended way to get rid of me . - But how do you ... ? - You have hidden powers ! - You are one of us ! - Uh ... right ... One of you . That 's what I 've been trying to say . How wonderful . My name is Crystal . - What is yours ? - I 'm the Human Torch . But my friends call me Johnny . Johnny Storm . I would like to be your friend , Johnny Storm . No problem there ! Say , what are you doing all alone here down in this rundown place ? Oh , but I 'm not alone . Lockjaw 's with me ! Lockjaw , eh ? Is that like measles ? - [ sniffs ] - Oh ! Don 't be silly . Everyone knows Lockjaw ! - Isn 't he the sweetest ? - Yeah . Like sugar . What the ... ? Lockjaw thinks it 's time I returned home . Lockjaw thinks ... Hey , where 'd he go ? Oh , he 's always doing that . Come on . I 'd like you to meet my family . I get the feeling I 'm not in Kansas any more . Black Bolt made this place for us so we could live safely in this strange city while we searched for my sister . [ yelling ] Don 't tell me , that 's Black Bolt ? No . That 's my cousin Karnak . Shh ! He has the power to find the weakest point in any object . - And destroy it . - Among other talents . - Must come in ... handy . - This is Johnny Storm . - He too has a hidden power . - Put it there , Karnak . Hmm . Your center of gravity is about ... here ! [ laughs ] Please forgive my cousin . He likes to show off . - Oh , here are the others . - Gorgon ! Medusa ! You interfering fool ! Why can 't you leave us in peace , Torch ? Johnny ! You know my sister , Medusa ? Sister ? ! I should 've figured . What are you guys ? Some kind of race of super-powered beings ? Foolish child ! You know it is forbidden for Inhumans to mingle with outsiders . You got a problem , take it up with me ! The problem is you have discovered us ! And you cannot be allowed to live and tell about it ! - Johnny ! - Hey . No matter ! He cannot escape ! - No ! - You were deceived , Crystal . - He is not an Inhuman . - Do not let the boy be harmed ! - He once befriended me ! - Flame on ! No ! Gotta find Reed before those Inhumans can pull their disappearing act again ! He 's ... gone . When Black Bolt learns of this , his anger will be unimaginable ! Johnny 's belt signal seems to be coming from that deserted part of town . You can turn off that crackerjack prize of yours . Here comes the flying ' matchstick now ! Looks like he just won the lottery . I found Gorgon and Medusa . And Crystal , the most beautiful girl I 've ever seen . What ? You ditched the redhead already , lover boy ? She 's Medusa 's sister , you big brick . There 's a whole race of Inhumans down below . Inhumans . So that 's what they call themselves . We 're wastin ' time . Crystal could be gone by now . Crystal . Sounds like the only one gone is my baby brother . That 's where I blasted out . Their hiding place is down there . - You know what to do , Karnak . - The weakest point is here . Did you hear something ? It 's Gorgon and the other one 's Karnak ! Black Bolt ! The time has come ! And who 's this Black Bolt clown , Sparky ? I dunno . He 's the only one I haven 't met . Black Bolt , huh ? Well , la-di-dah ! Let 's see if he can handle an orange bolt ! Ha , ha . - He floored Ben with one punch . - But that 's impossible ! The Thing 's the strongest human alive . Well , maybe he 's just met the new number one .

Season 03 Episode 03 The first wave Translation and adaptation Florin Grizzly ( c ) thin Catrenul 77 , IX century . " The Emerald City arsenal , the less creative is great . " " Four horses will triumph end , born of the breath of the devil . " Emerald City of Seattle 's where they turned a deposit of ammunition in a laboratory Vio-Zor , a company specializing in microbiology . Mabus is the leader of an alien invasion of Earth . If he is the devil , mentioned in quatrain , then somehow Vio-Zor , part of our plans Gua destruction . Eddie upload a virus into the software Vio-Zor . Go to solve the problem and see what it does Vio-Zor . None . Designed to prevent the entry of unwanted organisms . It seems to me that I missed . - Jay Rollins , de la Turbo Software . - Dr Kelly , director programe Vio-Zor . I 'm afraid you have your image destroyed , Mr. Rollins . You know that I should take a veºnicie to answer the request ? We do our best to change this image , Dr. Kelly . Come on , Jagger , do not be so . We are talking about a rat , buddy . Tim was always weird . If you want to say that was completely uncertain , disagree . Gentlemen ? Mr. Rollins , they are Jagger and Dr. Samuels . Mr. Rollins came to improve the program . Great ! - Do not even look like a technician . - I have heard this many times . - You ism about Tim ? - No , but do not get your worry . Will appear . Hope this . When he comes , I hope to have a good explanation . Or is finished . This way , Mr. Rollins . Type is a rare rat . - I waited to many employees . - There is a saying in microbiology ... " What is important is only the size of the contract . " - You do what you do ? - Nothing sexy , unfortunately . We focus mainly on serums , vaccines , pesticides . The lab is here . - Serious equipment . - That decontamination chamber . UV lamps and antiviral protection . Army built this facility in the Gulf War , for biological weapons testing . After the war he took it , Vio-Zor . You do not have to worry about that will be infected ? For years , no longer used . We research level 2 only benign substances . Behold . The system suddenly stopped this morning . - Any idea what the problem is . - It is early to say , But if you want a shorter version , I would say it is a matter of code . Well , notifies me when you 're done . Eddie ? You 'd better be ready . - I can not always say the job of code . - Liniºteºte yourself . - Connecting the modem to the serial port . - In what ? How you learned to uses remote TV ? It 's back , Einstein . Hey , do you want to come here to do it yourself ? No kidding in respects that . You know how much I hate germs . - Gata . - Bingo . Welcome to Vio-Zor Research . So we start . Vio-Zor is related to USAMRID Research Center US military for infectious diseases . Programme Manager told me that nothing fatal here but not functional decontamination chamber . There were about something called Delta Wing . - What is Delta Wing ? - Well , not a babysitting agency . Must close , Eddie . Samuels , nu ? It seems that we have a big problem with all codes . - You 're one of us ? - What ? I asked ... if you are one of us . Are not we all know ? I knew myself . You technicians , trãiþi only . Yes , rat loved to sit on the computer for hours . - He who has not at work today ? - Yes . It is only in this fucking mausoleum , which is not obliged to follow the rules . And you do what you do , or ... We are specialists , man . Kelly is a great virologist , the guy has his rodents , Jagger is engaged in a cell . - In search of a cure for cancer . - What about you ? Samuels , dl Rollins are treabã , la fel ºi noi . Is it me or Kelly 's beautiful ! I know how you feel , my friend . - What are you doing here ? - You looking for . The error code is stopped , so it must be to see the main board . Samuels , Jagger , one of you to come immediately to the laboratory ? One îþi will show where the fuse panel . Meanwhile , I would be grateful if you get your 've never walking around the complex . - Oh , God ! - Is something wrong ? - Hey , what happened ? - Few samples . - They arrived Saturday and no longer . - Liniºteºte you , Doctor . I 've locked them Saturday . No one came by then , right ? - No one except you . - Hey , I was just looking switchboard . In addition , what I would do myself with some laboratory samples . - What is happening ? - Disappeared some samples . - What kind of evidence ? - Nothing important . Influenza viruses . - Why so tamtam ? - I was in the middle of the study . - I need samples . - Do not be nervous , Doctor . Maybe it has got rats in the main lab . - Has access to the safe . - ªobolanul , it would be close to him . Well , then go to check laboratory test . When I put my protective suit . I do not want to spend three weeks in bed because of the flu . Take it ! Take it from me ! Get it off me ! Get it off me ! Oh , God ! E rats ! What happened to him ? - Sounds like a serious viral infection . - What is this virus ? - Nothing here can produce it . - Oh , God ! - I have his blood on me , are infected ! - You have to go to hospital . - No ! You need to isolate him . - To isolate him ? What happened to him ? I do not know , but can not leave until we find out . Poth to sue me , Doc , because resign . He 's right . We can not leave . - For when you give orders ? - For now . I do not know what you want to do , man , but I have to go to hospital . We somehow isolate this building ? There is an isolation system . When is activated , we will be imprisoned for 12 hours . Uses it . Immediately ! For God 's sake , Kelly , no ! - Everything goes into the combustion chamber . - What gun ? The metal is easy to sterilize , but probably already know that . Take your clothes off . We must decontaminate . Who sent you ? Are you sure you did not come to fix computers . I was warned of this danger . I came to stop this . - Who you are ? - I ask questions . - What kind of virus killed the rat ? - I do not know . You said that you do not do experiments with lethal substances . We do not . - Then why have links with USAMRID ? - I do not know anything about a link . - Are program director ! - There are other people in this complex , sir. how you will call . I can not control everything . What is " delta wing " ? I do not know . Listen , I have nothing to hide . Is there any way that Jagger and Samuels they can somehow undermine the system ? This complex was built to survive during the war . Are un generator , filtru de aer ... We are here for some time . - Why are there 12 hours containment system ? - The idea army . If a viral rashes , enables disease control center to monitor this building when the contamination level 4 . - What level 4 ? - The ... lethal infection . - Stay motionless , Samuels . - How became ill so quickly ? Regardless of how it happened , it 's impossible . No virus do not develop so quickly . Dengue or Ebola No , none . Maybe it 's something new ? About an hour ago Erath a computer expert . You are now virologist ? - Try to calm down . - Calm down ? ªobolanul have throughout the body , covered with scabs and she tells me to calm down ! I feel like I have something in me and I do not want to be there . Do you know how it feels ? I asked Kelly and now I 'm asking you . What is " delta wing " ? How to know , for God 's sake ? I am an expert in immunodeficiency ... - Not a commando . - Who had access to cabinet ? Dr. Kelly ºi Tim . - Tim ? - ªobolanul . I told you that Tim Samuels would not be near the closet , even if they had access . - Why ? - Because Tim , cares more rats than research . If you ask me , I have nothing to do with these samples stolen . ªobolanii spread bubonic plague , XV century in Europe that shaved a quarter of the continent . Bail culprit ? Query rodents cursed ... If you are still alive . - Poth to identify it ? - I can not even find . - Maybe he 's hiding . - You say that viruses can hide ? You can hide , evolve , and even learn . I am surviving predators without equal . - It seems that I admire ? - Why not ? Viruses have occurred billions of years ago , only a few million people . Who are we to say that we are heirs of the earth . It 's not good . I need a sample to be separated from blood cells . Maybe then we will succeed to find a way to defeat . What about Tim ? Cells seem to me quite separate . Thin it . I 'll take a sample . - Who else is here besides us ? - None . Why ? - Someone moved the body . - It 's impossible . We are alone . - Well , when you move the single . - Do not be ridiculous . He 's dead , for God 's sake ! Look at him . - Oh no ! My costume ! - Decontamination room . You 'll have to check it if it 's broken . I thank God that resisted . Thank you that you took from me . It would have had to come sooner . In the state lies not able to tell us anything . We will not ever know that , right ? - He took blood samples from everyone ? - Try to isolate the virus ... - And then kill him . - It 's not right , man . - It would have to be in hospital . - I 'm sorry . I had no choice . Easy for you to say . You did not have full front rat blood . Are immunologist , Samuels . Viruses always spread by blood ? There is no " always " when it comes to viruses . Ebola began in African forests , growing and developing as until it reached critical mass point , and then suddenly turned the epidemic . The virus can spread through blood , bodily fluids ... - Even worn by animals . - Like ºobolanii ? Be sure of that . Have a nice day . Finally . That virus . - Hidden in blood cells of Tim ? - Multiply until they destroy ... Then expand and seek a new host . I never saw such a virus so quickly . Poth to identify it ? It could be something new . I need more time . No time ! You must learn what it is and how to rãspândeºte ! Waving gun will not cursed things will quickly ! All right . Continue . - Eddie , I am . - Foster , what the hell is going on there ? No time to get your explain . What Poth learn about " Delta Wing " ? Their files were encoded better in comparison with Eskimo 's Flying and Blizzard , but I managed to break them . - Tell . - " Delta Wing " is part of the CIA . - They specialize in biological weapons . - Let me guess ... " Vio-Zor " make tests " Delta Wing " ? Exact . See , infectious agent is classified under the code name " Revelation " which was sent from headquarters " Delta Wing " from Maryland to " Vio-Zor " . In quatrain write about it , the four rider . Maybe it 's about the 4 rider of the Apocalypse the " Book of Revelation " . " Four horses will triumph end , born of the breath of the devil " . Breath Breath devil ... the devil ... This este Foster , this e ? Who received the delivery , Eddie ? Someone has to sign it . - Do not write . - Okay . Thank you . Foster ? Foster ? Foster , why always close before we end the conversation . It is usually rude and disgusting . If you do it again might would have to kill you . You do not seem to be ill . It 's not like you started all this , right ? No no . I searched everywhere . You need to tell you something . Why not begin to tell me about " Apocalypse " . That killed Tim , right ? - No . - I 'm not lie ! Do not lie . Tell me the truth or I will scatter brain îþi . I got the virus " Revelation " from " Delta Wing " . They wanted me to test different properties . - Why ? - They believe that foreign terrorists ... - Can develop a similar type . - Liar ! - Tell the truth . I thought that doing a service to the country . - What you test exactly ? - Only chemical composition . - You tried to change the chemical composition . - Of course not . Infested , Kelly . I see things . And I entered not in contact with the blood of Tim . Someone did that " Revelation " to be infectious by air . ªtiu . We tested our blood . We all are infected . Extratereºtrii have hatched a plot to air to release a virus level 4 . Devil 's Breath ... Someone in the building took the cabinet and let him go . One of the symptoms of infection is misleading and paranoia . I would say that , extratereºtrii succeeded , too ? Shut your mouth ! You 're paranoid , you fool ! And me and Kelly are infected . I have nothing to do infection that ! And you , Snow Queen ? - Are you going to sit there ? - I brought " Revelation " in this lab And regret this decision , but I did not I be airborne . Someone did . There are ways to find out who is alien . My dear friend , ' re crazy , unstable and confusing . There is salt in this building ? - Salt ? - Yes , salt . - Why ? Thi hungry ? - Maybe you 're Gua . You 're sick Samuels . Sorry to spoil your fun , but I feel good . We have some food in the trash it . I 'm starving . - What the hell is going on ? - I do not know . Maybe the virus is weakened . - Is there a chance that he be immune ? - No , if human being . Hey , what about you ? Arãtaþi as three muºchetari on phenobarbital . Inveselithi-withdrawal . - When you 're blue , it 's something you can do . - Turns out ! If you 're sad , it 's a way to be happy ... - Please Samuels ... - In the event that you die with a smile on your face , I 'm the guy and here 's the place . - I feel great . - Check his blood again . Bitten me as a vampire doctor . I 'm all yours . Center for Disease Control send coded messages by USAMRID . When the doors are opened , will come as you say fish . - Nothing can stop the virus . - What would have to check on ... - Samuels , Jagger and Kelly ? - Nothing unusual . I checked birth certificates , driving licenses ... Everything is fine . Any of them could be an alien . Or not . Maybe alien virus made to is spread through the air and then disappeared . - Damn ! - Foster , we must do something . How , Eddie ! Tell me how ? If you go out , spread viruses and Gua will win . If supravieþuiesc until the door opens , are finished . In any case I will be a dead man . - You have your draw you understand ? - Foster ... Why not come out of hiding ajuþi to me and me at least once in life ! Dude , you have no right to ... What is it , Eddie ? You want to see me dead , take my role , have your name appear everywhere see ? That you , buddy ? Foster , ce ai pãþit ? It bothers me that my assistant is a strange 50 kg You may not throw any paper cranes ! Hi , frumosule ! This e nou ? - Foster ? - Te urãsc ! - Now I feel like this stuff ! - Stay away from me ! - Foster ... Foster , maybe they 're sick . - Shut your mouth ! Oh , man . - What are you doing here ? - I 'm looking for you . Try to find out what 's going on here , right ? What 's going on , Samuels ? I said that we are specialists . Each of us has a role in research . - No one can be under the sea . - Who knows ? Kelly ? She 's the one who puts it all together ? Kelly ? Yes , I heard her on the phone once referred to a secret passage that might go from here . But we will show it . Why do you think he will not ? What is it ? - You 're sick , Samuels . - You 're still infected . - O God ! You 're right . I do not feel well . Take it easy , Samuels . You 're one of them , right ? You had to know that ... From the moment you said the problem with the codes . We 're here to help . I ajuþi ? You know that 's the worst part ? Hunger . You have to eat . Why did you do that ? - Attack in waves . - The virus hidden in its cells ? Evolves . When I checked again worsened . - He went into the next phase . - Like cockroaches . There were cockroaches . Hallucinating . And I have seen them , just and Jagger . He called the CDC to keep abreast of our state . We can not leave out anyone to come here . We will release the virus . - What you need to do ? - To find a cure . How can we do that ? One of us is immune . That 's the answer . Damn ! Nobody 's immune to it ! - Cave sunt imuni . - Cave ? - Extratereºtrii . - They 're not responsible for it ! Think about that . You will find the virus and kill everyone else is scheduled to grow faster , kill faster . The company will go bankrupt . We take everything and already hit us . Even if I believe that for a second , what would make you trust me ? For that you have to trust someone . Kelly , come in the computer section . I think that you should see something . Jagger ? What 's this ? My boyfriend outdoors comes into your files And tries to find a way to prevent the spread of the virus . Or to release him . E Eddie . Foster 're okay ? Your friend can not come to the phone right now . He 's busy with death . - I did not trust him at all . - Extratereºtrii ? You could not invent something original ? We 'll close with Samuels , maybe he will think . I do not think so . - Samuels ... - S-a sinucis . But how ? He was tied . Not anymore . They snatched . Passing through a huge pain , decided to die burned ? It 's crazy . - It 's my fault . - How far will open the door ? ªase hours . - We expect . - If resisted for so long . What 's so funny ? We all know besides dying alien . More hallucinations . - Jagger , must lie . - No , I am going to take the laboratory plasma . Can blood transfusions that helps us slow down . Damn ! Someone is killed . Someone managed to modify the virus . - That 's halucinaþie ? - Who is the villain here , Foster ? Tu ? Eu ? Jagger ? Tim and Samuels are dead . - We will give money ? - I have a better idea . Blood tested again but this time i checked that immune . - You 're crazy . - And if not , Kelly ? If this virus ends up by killing millions of people ? Jagger , where are you ? Jagger ? Are . Help me please ! Help me ! Help ! Lord ! Miºcã ! We can not allow disease control center to open doors . In this building there is a security system . From there you can schedule a controlled explosion . We sterilize everything in the complex . - Including the virus ? - Everything . Let 's do it now as we think . However , we die . Virus to stop here . - I know you want to do . - What ? I try to pãcãleºti . - You 're the one who handled the virus . - Kelly , no . - It was you all along . - Listen ... - Do not do that . - It 's not your fault . Think about . If I created the virus that I would destroy him ? - Shut your mouth ! - Please , Kelly . We have only one chance . Let 's put an end together . Where you hurry ? Thank you . - Laboratory blood reserves . - Motherfucker ! Please . I do biological weapons to them used against you . All I have done is to work for mine . - Your species ? - It 's one of Gua . Yes , indeed there is an alien invasion , Victoria , and you helped her launch . I turned " Revelation " in an air-borne disease kills people , not the Gua . I tested it on Tim . And now I can say that has evolved to maximum potential . - That 's why you kept us alive . - Until now . Not enough air to start viral epidemic , but the lights once the door opens . So how Samuels said , " You 're fired . " Just and you ! He said that Gua are immune . Maybe we should use them blood sample to create a kind of antidote . All blood samples were infected , even his . Must have changed the files and the use of infected blood Samuelson . If his blood is immune Jagger could kill the virus . So , what happens ? We injected the blood of Jagger . Work . Killed virus . - How long before makes its effect ? - It will take some time . It 's a tunnel at the first level . At about 200 meters from the exit . Once they press the button , we 'll have 45 seconds . What about our clothes and skin ? Halfway is a decontamination room ... - Virus will not pass through it . - Do it . It initiates self-destruct system Come on ! 30 seconds before the explosion . - Let 's go ! No ! - Get out there ! - I can not . - Open the door ! - I got blood . - Why ? - Not enough . 20 seconds before the explosion . You 're the one who needs to survive . No ! 10 seconds before the explosion . - Go . - I have to keep lupþi . - 5 seconds until the explosion . No ! - Foster 're okay ? - Yes , I 'm fine . - How you expect ? - Eddie , I was pretty sick . Maybe I said some things you should not say . I have no idea what talk , man . Let 's get in the car . Do not touch anything , okay ? You know that I do not like germs . In the war that follows is not enough to fear the heavy artillery And nuclear weapons . Now up and the smallest microbe can become an angel of the dead . I know that Gua will use any means to lead to Armageddon . Dr. Kelly has agreed to investigate deadly biological weapons , and Gua , almost like he used against us . Since the limits of science and biology extend , do not forget the danger that awaits us with every step . Just as Einstein 's genius used and the others to create the atomic bomb , to We pray that the modern scientists they do not create a means to lead to our destruction .

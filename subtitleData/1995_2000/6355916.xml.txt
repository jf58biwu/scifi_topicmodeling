 Oi ! Easy ! Easy ! Steady up ! Hold on , mates . He 's almost up . That 's it . Give it a big pull ! That 's it . Don 't drop him now . Come on ! Pull him over ! Put your backs into it ! Come on ! There he goes . Lots of life in him . Give it up , Matey . Good for ya . That 's what you get for your trouble . - Maybe he 's just taking a long swim . - Yeah . Or a short flight . You an airman , Mate ? Oi ? No , he 's not dressed like an airman . What kind of uniform is that , then ? Sprechen sie deutsche , jah ? I say he 's a rat and we throw him overboard like a rat . Right . Let 's give him the heave-ho ! Hey ... How 's about another dip in the Atlantic , huh , dirty Jerry ? Even the sharks won 't eat him . Oi ! What you got to say for yourself , Jerry , before we throw you back in ? My name 's not Jerry . What 's that ? Eh ? My name 's Mulder . Fox Mulder . That a name ? Mulder ? I got ID in my pocket . " Fox Mulder , Federal Bureau of Investigation . " Sorry , mate , never heard of it ! - Never heard of it ? - Tell you what we do with foxes . Care to know ? You never heard of the FBI ? Why don 't you shut up , Jerry , before we change our minds here . - Where are you taking me ? - Where 'd you pick up that accent ? Probably in the Fuhrer 's Secret Service . Come on . - What are you talking about ? - I say we cut him open and see what color he bleeds . Dirty Jerry . Deutschland Uber Alles . " Deutschland Uber Alles " ? Wait a second . Oi , how 's about you shove a cork in it , mate . All right ? Eh ? What 's this about ? Found him in the water , sir . Don 't know nothing about him . I think he 's a German . Bring the prisoner in my room . Friend or foe ? - What ? - To what flag do you pledge allegiance ? I think there 's been a mistake . I think the mistake is mine . - Speak the truth , man . - This is the Queen Anne , isn 't it ? Hey , just about enough of that . I came looking for this ship . Say the word , Captain , I 'll make him the first of the rest . - Hold on a second . I think I can explain what 's going on . - It 's a ruse , Captain . What 's our current position ? - Cut the spy up . - I 'll tell you . I 'll tell you ... We 're two degrees above the 30th parallel . Sargasso Sea . Just above the Tropic of Cancer . 64 degrees West by Southwest . Off the Plantagenet bank 60 miles South-southwest off Bermuda . - How would I know that if I 'd been in the water ? - Aye , that 's a damn good question , lad . I 'm waiting for a damn good answer . Tell me I 'm wrong . Tell me that you haven 't been able to get accurate compass readings . That navigation 's been a real bitch . It 's because you 've been caught in something called " The Devil 's Triangle . " I can show you on the chart here . It goes from Bermuda down to Puerto Rico and back up to Florida . The Queen Anne is stuck here on the Eastern edge of it . You 've been caught in some kind of time warp . In some kind of limbo dimension and now you 've popped out the other side into 1998 . 1998 ? ! This man is mad . Let him tell it to the fishes . I 'm done fooling about , man . There 's a war on . And in it or no , I don 't plan to lose me mind nor me ship to the likes of a jackal like you . You can relax . There 's no war going on . The world is at peace . There 's a little trouble over at our White House but that 'll blow over , so to speak . Peace ? It 's September 3rd , 1939 , man ! Hitler has entered Poland . And we 've just been boarded by a bunch of his goose-stepping hooligans so don 't speak to me of peace , lad . Tell Mother England . No , no . It 's not September 3rd . It 's November 16th . Look . - Excuse me , captain . - Aye . Sir , the Germans , sir . They 've taken control of the bridge . Steering a course for their homeland . Not on the watch of captain Yip Harburg , they 're not . Lock the prisoner up in here . It 's okay . The war 's over . Let them take you to Germany . They make nice cars . This is unbelievable . Mayday , mayday . This is Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI . I 'm on the SS Queen Anne . Ship in distress . Mayday , mayday . The British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them that they are prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland a state of war would exist between us . No such undertaking has been received . Consequently , as of today , September 3 , 1939 this country is at war with Germany . Oh , sh ... Hello ? Hello ? Closing of places of entertainment : All cinemas , theatres and other places of entertainment are to be closed immediately until further notice . The evacuation of British children is going on smoothly and efficiently . The ministry of health says that great progress ... What the hell is going on ? Spender ? Hi . Excuse me . Scully ? I suggest you get your Nazi paws off me before you get one in the kisser . - Scully , it 's me , Mulder . - Oh , you speak English , do you ? Well , how 'd you like to see the stars on the American flag ? - I 'm not a Nazi . - Oh , sure . You just look like one , right ? I had to steal this uniform . Scully ? Here is the man you want . Halt ! Hande hoch ! Hande hoch ! He said , " Put your hands up . " You see , I told you . Yeah , you 're all big men now but wait until you get into Russia . Hope you fellas like the cold . Same to you , Adolf ! Turn this ship in the direction of Germany or we will remove you from the wheel , understood ? I 'll not give up this ship ! Show him what I mean . You can put me down , man , but I 'll not let go of this wheel so ' till we meet in hell ... Shoot him . No ! You ... Who is this man ? He beat up one of my people and stole his uniform . He is a spy . Where are the weapons ? No sprechen . You have the weapons on board , no ? I don 't speak Nazi . Shoot him also . Wait a minute . Why are you shooting me ? Why are you killing me ? What have I done ? I don 't understand what you 're asking me . Stop ! Don 't shoot ! This man is American . They say more people want to take part in the war ... Bring him under . Bring them all under . Skinner ? Where are they taking me ? Help me , Skinner ! What are you guys doing here ? - Mulder 's in trouble . - Big trouble . - What do you mean ? - Let 's take a walk . Okay , where are we going ? - The walls have ears . - I have ears . Will you tell me what 's going on ? - Mulder 's disappeared . - Disappeared from where ? From the national reconnaissance office 's lacrosse mid-latitude imaging radar satellite . - I don 't understand . What am I looking at ? - A whole lot of nothing . We pulled that down 45 minutes ago off the NRO satellite , which early this morning sent a picture of a ship which inexplicably appeared in the middle of the Atlantic . The SS Queen Anne which by all accounts vanished without a trace over sixty years ago . The Queen Anne ? The British luxury liner ? - That 's correct . - It was torpedoed by a German U-boat . - That 's one story . - There 's another ? Though her exact position was kept secret for fear spies might give her up to the Axis . It 's been reasonably determined that the Queen Anne was just south of the Plantagenet bank when she went missing . Less than sixty feet of water yet she 's never been found . - So you 're saying the Queen Anne just disappeared . - Into the Bermuda triangle . And reappeared this morning at 6 : 49 a.m. Eastern Standard Time . - That 's impossible . - Satellite doesn 't lie . - There 's nothing on here . - We gave the original images to Mulder ... - ... so he could use them as navigational aids . - He was in a hurry . - To get where ? - Out to the Queen Anne before anyone else got there first . - He 's gone out here ? - He went to Bermuda and chartered a powerboat out of Hamilton Harbor . We tracked him on the satellite for an hour and a half . Until a storm blew in and obscured all transmissions . - That 's what you 're holding . - What 's happened to him ? We can 't know that . Not without alternative tracking data . - Which is why we 're here . - Without good data , all we can do is wait ... - ... and hope for the best . - Yeah , but expect the worst . - Well , we have to get help . - Without a position he 's a needle in a haystack . What do you need ? Navy AWACS SLAR or SAR 100 K swath imaging . You 're going to have to find somebody at the Pentagon to get it . Wait for me downstairs . I need to speak with him . - Could you please take a seat ? - Is he in ? - Yes , he 's on his phone . - Sorry , this can 't wait . Sir ? Could you hold on a minute ? What is it , Agent Scully ? I just received some very disturbing information , sir . I need your help . I 'll call you back in five . - You can 't come rushing in here . - Sir , I couldn 't waste time ... - ... explaining myself to your assistant . - Tell me what is so urgent . It 's about Agent Mulder . He 's done something incredibly rash . - I can 't . - He may be lost at sea . - I can 't , Agent Scully . - You can 't what ? - I can 't help you . There 's nothing I can do . - This isn 't for me ; it 's for Agent Mulder . My hands are tied . I 'm not your direct superior any longer . - Don 't you want to know what this is about ? - No , I don 't . I don 't even what to hear it . - Sir , this is about a man 's life . - I 'm not allowed to have contact with you ... - ... any contact with either you or Mulder . - She walked right past me , sir . - You 're out of line , Scully . - No , sir , you 're out of line . I 'm sorry , but I 'm coming to you for help and I 've got nowhere else to go . I would hope that after everything that we have been through that you would at least have the courtesy and the decency and not to mention the respect to listen to what I have to say . Now , all I need is information . You don 't have to do anything else . Look , sir , if you know anybody at the Office of Naval Intelligence it would be of great help . I could lose my job , my pension , I could even be subject to legal action . Use your head , Scully . It 'll save your ass . Save your own ass , sir . You 'll save your head along with it . Sorry . Yes , sir , I 'll get those files and make that call and buzz you when I have him on the line . - I need a word with AD Kersh . - I 'm sorry , he 's not available . Assistant Director Kersh , may I please have a moment of your time ? A moment for what ? Uh , may I , sir ? Thank you . Sir , I need you to get me some information . I am not a liberty to say why but I can tell you it is of the utmost importance . Yes ? I , uh ... Sorry . I shouldn 't have come unannounced . May I see what you were going to show me , Agent Scully ? Uh ... It 's nothing , really . Good . What am I thinking ? What am I thinking ? Sorry . Come on , come on , come on , come on , come on . Answer the phone , Mulder . Answer the phone , answer the phone , answer the phone . The cellular customer you are trying to reach is not responding or is ... Damn . I want you to do me a favor . It 's not negotiable . Either you do it or I kill you . You understand ? - You okay , Agent Scully ? - No , I 'm not . I 'm a gun ready to go off so don 't test me , Spender . Don 't even think about trying to weasel me . What is it that you need ? Navy AWACS SLAR 100 K swath . South-southeast of Bermuda . I am looking for a boat , maybe a ship . 1939 luxury liner . - 1939 ? - Don 't ask too many questions . I don 't care what you do or who you do or who you have to grease , I need that information and I need it now . Are we clear on that ? Crystal . And , Agent Spender ... If you 're not back in a hurry I am going to hunt you down , and so help me God ... Right . Hello ? Agent Fowley ? Yes . I was looking for Agent Spender . I 'm sorry , he 's not here right now . Is there something I can help you with ? Yeah , Agent Scully just handed the Assistant Director a piece of paper with an intelligence system scribbled on it .. Yes ? Yes , sir ? Who is this ? - Oh , Agent Scully . - I was just , uh ... - I was sent to come get you . - Yeah , I was waiting for Agent Spender , he was , uh ... - I 'm supposed to pick up a delivery from him . - Agent Spender is with Assistant Director Kersh . That rat bastard ! Stupid ! Scully . Mulder ? Is that you ? No , I can 't ... I 'm on an elevator . Hold on , I 'll be off in a s ... Hold on . Hello ? No ... I can 't understand . I can 't ... - Was that you ? - Is it you ? I 've been trying to reach you . I got the information you needed . How ? Don 't even ask . - Sir , what you 've done ... - Is save Mulder 's ass . I know . And if you ever ask me to break policy or protocol I will have you written up , wrapped up and tossed out of the FBI for good . - Am I understood , Agent Scully ? - Yes . Yes . Did you get it ? Yeah . Oi ... American , right ? Saved your life , mate . Krauts don 't want no reason to bring you Yanks into the war . I got two words for you , buddy ... Pearl Harbor . What ? After Poland , Hitler 's on his way to Denmark , Holland and France with a few stops in between . The French all but roll over on us , the Italians seize their opportunity and the Japanese come through the back door . It 's a long , bloody story . It fortunately has a happy ending . - We win ? - Yeah , you come out on the side of history with no small amount of help from us . Not much to apologize over the next 50 years except for maybe the Spice Girls . Go on already ! Go ! Well ... According to our host this 'll be our new accommodations , lads . You speak German . What was that shouting about up there ? They got it in mind that we left America carrying arms to England . - Are we ? - Listen , she 's drawing 16 feet at 81,000 tons . We 're making 21 knots at full power . If we got munitions aboard this ship , mate , they don 't weigh but a few stone . But the Captain knew something . He wouldn 't give up the wheel . The Nazis boarded us after they intercepted a radio communication ... Some kind of code word they keep asking about . Thor 's Hammer . You know what that is , mate ? Who go there ? I said , " who goes there ? " Show your faces or we 'll bloody beat them to a stub . Put your irons down , boys . It 's your own crew , for God 's sake . What 're you doing down here ? We 're having a cup of tea . What 's it look like , you stupid swabbo ? - Then who 's steering the boat ? - Oh , just some blokes who answer to the name of Heil Hitler . You ever been to Germany , swabbo ? They 'll have a special affection for the likes of you . - Yeah , right . - Hey , this ship can 't go to Germany . - Make up your mind , mate . - They cant happen . I got news for you , you 're not carrying munitions . It 's something far more deadly . - Thor 's Hammer ? - Thor 's Hammer isn 't a weapon . It 's a man , a man who will help build a weapon , a bomb that 'll win the war for whoever has it . - And you 're telling me he 's aboard this ship ? - I saw him in the ballroom . His name is Thor 's Hammer . He has a plan to build a bomb . Goodbye , mates . What 's wrong with you ? ! Don 't you know there are spies everywhere ? ! Trust no one , mon ! Look , we 've got to stop this ship ... now ! All right , lads , let 's go ! Hey , hey , who 's in charge of this engine room ? Oi , you ! I 'm talking to you . Shut her down , man . We got to scuttle her now ! Put some piss into her , boys . Hey , you heard him ... kill the engines ! There 's no other way , swabbo . - You can 't get to Germany if you can 't steer . - Me overriding her . We steering a course for home . Have you looked at your compass ? You can 't get to England going the wrong bloody direction . We 're not going to England . We 're going to Jamaica . Yeah ! Listen , you steer her home , you bloody ruffo , to her home where she belongs ! Listen to me ! Listen to me ! You can 't take this ship to England . You 'll never make it . What are you talking about ? I 'm in charge of the wheel ! - There 's only one place she 's going , Yank . - Jamaica ! Yeah ! You can 't take the ship to Jamaica , either . The Germans will hunt you down no matter what course you steer . No ! No ! Hear it out . Hear it out . Hear it out . - And who you be , boy ? - My name 's Mulder . - He wants to go back to bloody America . - No , I want you to take this ship and turn it back around the way you came . No ! No ! - Bloody hell , we 're halfway home ! - You 've got to turn the ship around . - And what 's in that direction ? - The future . What ? Actually , the past . - Oh , well , I 'm convinced . - Well , I can explain it to you . You ! The American . You come with us , up here . Yes , come with ? Turn the ship around or Hitler rises , Germany wins and your children will never know what freedom is ! Stop ! Stop ! Stand still ! Stand still or I shoot ! Stand still ! Attention ! Get up ! There 's a scientist on board who can make a bomb . Who is this man ? I don 't know . Weapon ready . Tell him ... We will kill one passenger for every wrong answer . You will answer the question or we will begin killing passengers . Which one is the scientist ? I don 't know . Shoot him . Ask him how many people he will let die ? How many lives are you willing to sacrifice ? None . Then you have the answer . He hesitates to name him . Shoot again . Stop ! This man has no answers . You 're killing innocent people to learn that he knows nothing ! Shut up . Shut up and move away . Listen to me , you little weasel ... We have our next passenger , a lady . Aim the weapon at her . Kill her , if he does not answer the question . Answer the question . I 'll answer the question . Answer the question . That man is the scientist . Hey , Scully , you 're not going to believe this . Get up here . What ? The sky just cleared and there it was . Is it the Queen Anne ? That 's her . I don 't believe it . Seeing is believing . They 've got power . Maybe Mulder 's already on board . Let 's hope he is . You 're lying . - He 's telling the truth . - Shut up ! - Who is the scientist ? - I told you , this man is the scientist . Officer ! What is the man 's name ? John Brown . - Ask me again , and I 'll knock you down . - What 's his name ? ! Puddintame . Ask me again and I 'll tell you the same . Wait . Don 't shoot . - I 'm the scientist . - This man 's a liar . I 'm the scientist . Please ... tell them the truth before someone else has to die . - I don 't know this man . - Please don 't listen to her . She 's traveling with me to protect me . She works for the OSS . That 's great . I don 't see you did any better . Kill them first . Kill them all . What 'd he say ? Uh ... I think I know what he said . You learn fast . What 's happening ? The engines shut down . Hey ! Hey , what ? - Come with me . - Why should I ? Cause you 're the only one who can save this ship . Come on . Stand still ! Stand still . Or I will shoot you . Hands up ... Behind your heads . Do it ! Now what , Einstein ? Do it ! God bless America . Now get your asses out of here . Byers ? Langly ? Frohike ? Come on ... Come on ! There you guys are . - What are you doing ? ! - I 'm going to tell you how to save this ship . - Out here ? - I can 't stay . I got to get back to history . - What ? - And you got to rescue it . Wait . Listen to me . This ship 's been caught in something called the devil 's triangle . It 's some kind of time warp ... a rift in space . - Are you crazy ? - You know Einstein , right ? He predicts the theoretical possibility . He also predicts an atomic weapon that will destroy the world . Yeah ? So what ? If you don 't go back and convince the crew of this ship to turn this ship around and head back into the devil 's triangle everything Einstein predicted will become true except for the outcome of history . So , if I don 't turn this ship around ... ? In all likelihood , I won 't exist . And neither will you . Okay ... So , in case we never meet again ... I was expecting a left . Hey ! Mulder ? Mulder , it 's me . - Where am I ? - You 're in a hospital . - Lie still . - I feel ... Like hell . I don 't blame you . You 've been through the wringer , I 'd say . What happened to me ? You did something incredibly stupid . What did I do ? You went looking for a ship , Mulder . In the Bermuda Triangle . - Say that again ? - Gilligan awakes . You were there . - You were there , Scully . - He 's delirious . - And he was there , too . - Right ... Me and my dog Toto . - No , you were there with the Nazis . - Mulder , will you settle down ? It 's an order . Not that he takes orders ... - You saved the world , Scully . - Yeah ... You 're right . I did . - What kind of drugs is he on ? - I want some . No , no , no ... The Queen Anne ... I found it . You were there with Thor 's Hammer . I told you you had to turn the ship around and then I jumped overboard . Yeah , I bet you did . The boat that you were on was busted into a million pieces . And as for the Queen Anne it was nothing more than a ghost ship . No , no , no . You and I were on that ship , Scully . In 1939 . Get some rest , Mulder , 'cause when you get out of here I 'm going to kick your butt but good . I would 've never seen you again . But you believed me . In your dreams . Mulder , I want you to close your eyes and I want you to think to yourself " there 's no place like home . " Hey , Scully . Yes ? I love you . Oh , brother ...

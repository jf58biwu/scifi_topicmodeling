 Personal Log , Stardate 48546.2 . Our journey home is several weeks old now , and I have begun to notice in my crew , and in myself , a subtle change as the reality of our situation settles in . Here in the Delta Quadrant , we are virtually the entire family of man . We are more than a crew , and I must find a way to be more than a Captain to these people ... but it 's not clear to me exactly how to begin . At the Academy , we 're taught that a Captain is expected to maintain a certain distance . Until now , I have always been comfortable with that distance . Captain , I ... I didn 't realize there was an inspection scheduled . Not an inspection , Lieutenant . A stroll . We should have the warp drive up and running by 0900 hours . Recalibrating the reactant injectors is the only thing we have left to do . Carry on . Maybe this is just the way it works . Maybe the distance is necessary . Maybe more than ever now , they need me to be larger than life . I only wish I felt larger than life . Computer , delete last sentence . Gentlemen . As you were . So , has Neelix concocted anything interesting this morning ? There 's an ancient Chinese curse , Captain- - " May you live in interesting times . " Mealtime is always interesting now that Neelix is in the kitchen . We shouldn 't judge him too harshly . He is helping us conserve replicator energy . And I 'm sure the gastrointestinal problems will go away , as soon as our systems get used to his , uh ... gourmet touch . Well , see you at duty call . We should have asked her to join us . Ensigns don 't invite Captains to sit down . Why not ? Because they don 't . Well , what 's wrong with showing a little courtesy ? Captains don 't want courtesy . They want respect . That 's why they don 't get chummy with the lower ranks . Well , who else is she supposed to get chummy with out here ? There aren 't many other Captains and Admirals for her to talk to . If she wants to sit with us , she 'll ask us to join her . That 's the way it 's done . I think you 're working from an old rule book , Paris . Neelix ? Captain ! May I say , you look beautiful this morning . is that a new color lipstick ? No , no , it 's the same color I always wear . Well , perhaps it 's just the way the glow of the food heater lamps hits you , but you look wonderful . Not to suggest you don 't always look wonderful . Neelix , do we have any coffee left ? No , but we have something even better . I don 't want something even better , I want coffee . It 's made from a proteinaceous seed I discovered on an expedition ... Never mind . I 'll use one of my replicator rations for coffee . That would not be appropriate , Captain . I beg your pardon ? You need to set an example for the crew . Well , thank you for reminding me . You 're welcome . After all , if you want the crew to begin to accept natural food alternatives instead of further depleting our energy reserves , you need to encourage them by your own choices , don 't you ? Fine . Give me your even-better - than-coffee substitute . And how about some Takar loggerhead eggs with that this morning ? Just ... coffee . It 's a tiny bit richer blend than you 're used to , but you 'll learn to love it . Bridge to Janeway . On my way . Janeway out . Tomorrow maybe . Ah . Yes , Commander ? There was no need for you to come to the Bridge , Captain . Yes , there was . I just wanted to alert you to a nebula we 've picked up on long-range sensors . Put it on screen . Magnify . There are unusually high levels of omicron particles within this nebula , Captain . Are you thinking we could collect these omicron particles to provide an additional antimatter reserve , Lieutenant ? Precisely . Senior Bridge Officers , report for duty . Commander , set a new course . There 's coffee in that nebula . Exploring this nebula should raise some spirits around here , don 't you think , Commander ? No way to go but up . You 're closer to the crew than I am . How bad is it ? There 's a nuanka- - a period of mourning that everyone 's going through . It 's a natural reaction . I 'm worried about them . I wish we had a Counselor on board , but the nature of our mission didn 't require one . We talk to animals . It 's a Native American tradition . Animals ? Our own counselors . We 're taught that an animal guide accompanies us through life . Basically , it 's what Carl Jung thought he invented when he came up with his " active imagination " technique in 1932 , but we 'd been doing pretty much the same thing for centuries . is there a different animal guide for everyone ? Actually , yes . Let me guess . Yours is a bear . Why do you say that ? You strike me as the bear type . Thank you . The bear is a very powerful animal . It has great pokattah , but he 's not my animal guide . The creature that guides us doesn 't define who we are . It merely chooses to be with us . Okay. lf not a bear , then what ? I can 't tell you that . It would offend my animal guide if I spoke its name . But he guides you well ? Actually , it 's female . But yes , she usually guides me very well . Can one just choose her own animal guide ? It 's not quite that simple . Captain , we are approaching the perimeter of the nebula . Slow to one-third impulse . If you 're interested , I 'll be glad to teach you how to contact your animal guide . You 've got a date . Analysis , Mr. Kim . Seven AU 's in diameter . Sensors are picking up intermittent gamma and thermal emissions . Nothing our shields can 't handle . Mr. Paris , any problems for navigation ? I 'm showing mostly hydrogen , helium , and hydroxyl radicals . Some local dust nodules . I don 't see them giving us any trouble . Mr. Tuvok , can you find us a rich deposit of omicron particles in there ? A significant concentration appears to exist approximately 64 million kilometers inside the perimeter . Set coordinates . Aye , Captain . Engines at one-quarter impulse . Engage . I 've never seen anything like it . Tuvok to Kim . Mr. Kim , that is a comment we would prefer not to hear from a Senior Officer on the Bridge . It makes the Junior Officers nervous . Yes , sir . Density has increased to 42 percent . Cause ? Not sure . We seem to be drawing some interstellar dust toward us . Engineering , could the magnetic field from our impulse engines be attracting this dust ? It 's a good possibility , Captain . I 'm showing the dust with a return force ratio of 4.1 . Recommend we shut down impulse and go to thrusters . Acknowledged . Engage thrusters . Ahead slow . Density still increasing . Up by 70 percent now . Mr. Tuvok ? The level of resistance poses no danger to the hull at this time , Captain . How far to your omicron particle deposits ? 12,400 kilometers . Maintain course and ... Report ! We 're at a dead stop now . Shutting down thrusters . We seem to have encountered an energy barrier . is it natural or artificial ? We 're not reading any directed energy source down here , Captain . My guess is it 's a natural phenomenon . How far are we from the particles , Lieutenant ? Just over 7,000 kilometers . It 's conceivable this energy barrier is related to those particles . Mr. Kim , if you could get a transporter beam through the barrier ... Can 't do it , Captain . The thoron emissions of the barrier would interfere with the transporter signal . Ms. Torres , do we have enough power to take the ship through the barrier ? The barrier appears to be only 50 meters deep . A four-second burst at maximum thrusters ought to do it . All right . Maximum shields . Engage full thrusters for four seconds and then drop to one-quarter . Acknowledged . Engaging thrusters . What do you make of it , Mr. Tuvok ? I am unable to offer an identification , Captain . Kim to Tuvok . In other words , you 've never seen anything like it ? Oh , I promise not to tell the Junior Officers . Captain , the breach we just made , where we penetrated the field- - it just closed behind us . Kes ! Oh ! Now look what she 's gotten us into ! Do all nebulas look like that ? I wouldn 't know . I 'm smart enough to go around nebulas when I encounter them . These people are natural-born explorers , Neelix . These people are natural-born idiots if you ask me . They don 't appreciate what they have here . This ship is the match of any vessel within a hundred light years , and what do they do with it ? " Well , let 's see if we can 't find " some space anomaly today that might rip it apart ! " I don 't think the Captain is an idiot . She cares a great deal about her crew . You don 't care a great deal about your crew and introduce them to the specter of death at every opportunity . And I speak as a member of that crew now . I 'm not sure I would have wanted you to come along had I known that this is what we ... I think it 's wonderful . Wonderful ? If I were Captain , I 'd open every crack in the universe and peek inside , just like Captain Janeway does . I don 't deny the romantic ... quality of this sort of ... casting about . I wouldn 't exactly call it wonderful . Although ... it 's getting more wonderful by the minute . I 've never kissed anyone inside a nebula before . What did I tell you ? Red Alert . Whatever they are , they 're passing right through our shields . Try reversing the shield polarity . Mr. Tuvok ? They appear to be made up of a non-reactive material that our sensors do not recognize , Captain . Clarify Are we under attack ? Uncertain . There is no indication of directed fire . Torres to Bridge . Go ahead . These things are sticking to the hull . And I 'm showing a drain on our energy reserves . A drain ? Why would we be losing energy ? I 'm not sure , Captain . They seem to be drawing it right through the shield grid along the hull . We 've lost five percent of our energy reserves . Recommend we shut down all non-essential systems . Do it . Reversing shield polarity hasn 't had any effect . Energy reserves are down eight percent . This is not what I had in mind . Mr. Paris , take us back through the energy barrier and out of here . Reversing course . Full thrusters . Thrusters firing . We 're not penetrating the energy barrier this time . Sensors show a buildup of magneside dust along the outer rim of the barrier . Engineering , I need more power . We can 't go back to impulse , Captain . That 's how our problems started . Our best chance is to burn the aft thrusters beyond the recommended limits . Proceed . Acknowledged . Accelerating deuterium to rear thrusters . We have a complement of 38 photon torpedoes at our disposal , Captain . And no way to replace them after they 're gone . Aft thrusters at 105 percent . 1 15 percent . Barrier still holding . We need something else . Give me a two-second blast from the forward phaser bank . Firing phasers . The barrier is undamaged , Captain . Ready a photon . Mr. Paris , assuming we can breach the energy barrier , it 's likely to close as fast as the first time . I 'll be riding the tail of our torpedo , Captain . Torpedo is loaded . Align coordinates along ship 's heading . Coordinates set . Fire . 50,000 kilometers to the perimeter . I 'm having trouble navigating through the energy currents . It 's as thick as a Toarian ice storm out there . 35,000 kilometers to perimeter . Energy reserves are still falling . 15,000 kilometers . We 've cleared the central mass . Stand down Red Alert . Take us to 2,000 kilometers off the perimeter and hold position . Get a sample of that matter off the hull for Lieutenant Torres to analyze . I 'd like to know what it was that humbled every defense system on this ship . How much of our energy reserves did we lose , Ensign ? 1 1 percent , Captain . I 'm just going to have to give up coffee . That 's all there is to it . Dark enough for you ? What ? Get up , Harry . There 's something you got to see . See ? How 'd you get in here ? You 'd be surprised the things you learn in prison . MacAllister- - James Mooney MacAllister . The guy never slept . He 'd be studying his algorithms until dawn , and the only way I could get any sleep was to wear a mask . You could 've changed roommates . Are you kidding ? MacAllister got me through fourth year quantum chemistry . Besides , I got used to wearing it . Something about it that reminds me of being in the womb . Harry , in order to be reminded of something , you have to first ... I remember being in my mother 's womb . Right . I do . So what is it you have to show me ? Nothing that 's going to compare to that memory of your mother 's womb . Computer , activate holodeck program Paris-3 . Hey , it 's Tom . Welcome , Tom , welcome . Hey , Tom , how you doing ? What do you think , Harry ? What is it , a French bistro ? This is where l spent most of my second semester at the Academy . I chose the Starfleet base outside of Marseilles for my physical training . I always had a thing about the French . And the French always had a thing about you , Monsieur Thomas . And with a name like Paris , and a face like that , how could anyone resist , huh ? Sandrine , this is my friend , Harry Kim . Enchante . Sandrine owns the place . It 's been in her family over 600 years . Tommy . It 's about time . I 've been waiting for you . This is Ricky . I include her in all my holo-programs . - Hi . - Hi . Mmm ... Your friend the gigolo wouldn 't leave me alone . It 's what I do , Tom . Nothing personal . French father , Daliwakan mother . She just sits there and waits for you , huh ? Like a little puppy dog . I wouldn 't have it any other way . Oh , really ? I thought you liked your women with a little bite . Everyone knows about your bite , Sandrine . It 's when you start sucking blood they get scared . Monsieur , can I get you something to drink ? Just a cup of tea . Harry , this is France . Uh , break open a bottle of that ' 46 Saint Emilion you save behind the bar for me . I don 't like to drink this late at night . I get an acid heartburn . Harry , it 's holographic wine . It doesn 't give you acid . Try to get in the mood , huh ? Sorry . I learned a great deal that semester at the Academy . Most of it right here . Oui- - and most of it from me . I found this place just after my pocket was picked walking by the harbor . Somebody picked your pocket on Earth ? Oh , they just do it for tourists . They give it back . Most of the time . Nine ball in the corner pocket . You see that pool table , Harry ? The table at Sandrine 's at Marseilles has attracted the world 's greatest hustlers throughout the centuries . I thought it might be fun to program in some of the great players to shoot with . Eight ball in the cross side . Gaunt Gary , Ames Pool Hall , New York City , 1953 . They say that he hustled the great Willie Moscone himself . Moscone ? Was he some famous billiard player ? Game is pool , kid . Pool . I don 't suppose you 'd care to wager a fin on a game or two ? Oh , he 's not ready for you yet , Gary . Let me teach him a few tricks first . Watch out for him , kid . He can swallow your wallet without ever losing his smile . I 'll keep it in mind . What 's a fin ? I 'm not sure . Some old kind of Scandinavian currency . Come on . I 'll rack them up . You pick out a cue . Harry , this is my idea of home . My little piece of Earth out here in the Delta Quadrant . You shrug it off- - or you like to make the rest of us think you 're shrugging it off- - but you miss it , too , don 't you ? What ? Home . Your shot , Harry . Computer , activate emergency medical holographic program . Please state the nature of the medical emergency . Why do you always have to say that ? I can only speculate about my programmer 's motives . Perhaps he thought I might be summoned for ... important reasons . Under the circumstances , don 't you think you really ought to change your program ? Now , there 's an interesting concept- - a hologram that programs himself . What would I do with that ability ? Create a family , raise an army ... I know a little about holographic programming . I could probably reprogram you . That makes me feel particularly confident . Has anyone ever told you , you have a lousy attitude ? If you don 't like the doctor 's attitude , there 's a man sitting at a console in the Jupiter Station Holo-programming Center you can write to . His name is Zimmerman . He looks a lot like me , actually . Now , not that I don 't enjoy the repartee , but was there a reason you stopped in ? I need a second opinion on this . Who gave you the first opinion ? I gave it to myself . It 's a sample of residue we picked up in a nebula . A nebula ? What were we doing in a nebula ? No , wait , don 't tell me . We were investigating . That 's all we do around here . Why pretend we 're going home at all ? All we 're going to do is investigate every cubic millimeter of this Quadrant , aren 't we ? The molecules are isolinear . No polycyclic structures , but ... But this is what brought you to me , isn 't it ? The nucleogenic peptide bonds . is it some kind of phospholipid fiber ? And you were doing so well . Now ... I suspect it 's something far more interesting than that . Come in . Repair crews have degaussed the hull , Captain . Good . Let 's plan an 0700 departure . What 's this ? My medicine bundle . I 've never shown it to anyone before . After what you said this morning , I thought it was important to let you see . Will it help me find my animal guide ? Eventually , you 'll have to assemble your own medicine bundle , but this will allow me to assist you in your quest for a guide . Now ? Now . A blackbird 's wing ... a stone from the river ... an akoonah . " Akoonah " ? My ancestors used psychoactive herbs to assist their vision quests . Now they 're no longer necessary . Our scientists have found more modern ways to facilitate the search for animal guides . Place your hand on it . And concentrate on the stone . A-koo-chee-moya . We are far from the sacred places of our grandfathers . We are far from the bones of our people , but perhaps there is one powerful being who will embrace this woman and give her the answers she seeks . Allow your eyes to close . Breathe to feel the light in your belly and let it expand until the light is everywhere . Prepare yourself to leave this room and this ship , and return to a place where you were the most content and peaceful you have ever been . You can see all around you and hear the sounds of this place . I know this place . It 's ... You must not discuss with me what you see , or you will offend your animal guide . As you continue to look around , you will become aware of other life that shares this place with you . It will be the first animal you see . That is the one you will speak to . Do you see an animal ? Yes . Speak to it . What do I say ? You know what you want to ask . I 'm sorry . I should 've asked the computer for no interruptions . Come in . The Commander was introducing me to my animal guide . I hope that you have better luck with yours than I had with mine . B 'Elanna 's the only one I know who tried to kill her animal guide . I 'm sorry to interrupt , but the Doctor and I have come up with a rather surprising analysis of the matter left on the hull . It 's organic . Microscopic life-forms from the nebula . That 's not what I mean . The samples are clearly organic elements of a much larger life-form . It appears , Captain , that this nebula is not a nebula at all . I 'm curious , Captain . Exactly what are you looking for ? I need to know if we did serious harm to this life-form . Let 's see- - you ran your ship through it , fired phasers at it , and blew a hole in it with a photon torpedo . I 'd say it 's a pretty good chance that you ... Computer , mute audio . Isolate that concentration of omicron particles we were trying to get to . That would be right here . Mr. Tuvok ? I 'm afraid the concentration of particles is far lower than I originally observed . Furthermore , it appears that many of the particles have now moved outside the energy barrier . is it possible they 're leaking out through the breach we made ? That would be a logical conclusion . It 's also a logical conclusion that all of the phenomena we 've encountered were actually this life-form 's natural defense systems . The way the barrier was protecting the omicron particles almost suggests we were entering a vital organ . So , it seems very clear that we 've severely hurt an innocent life-form . How do we repair the harm we 've done ? Uh , Captain ? Computer , resume audio . How kind of you . You may be interested to know that the analysis of the organic sample suggested this life-form has the capacity to regenerate . The process may simply need a helping hand . Any ideas how we could stimulate regeneration ? Lieutenant Torres has the answer . I do ? You were the one who first observed that this life-form has a nucleogenic structure . If the life-form has a nucleogenic structure ... nucleonic radiation ought to assist its healing process . A nucleonic beam along the edges of the breach should theoretically promote regeneration . Bravo . Commander , take us to Yellow Alert and advise the crew that we 're going to reenter the life-form . Mr. Kim , review all systems in light of our first experience and see if you can provide new safeguards . Tuvok , your job is to find some modification of the shields that will hold off this life - form 's natural defense systems . We begin at 1300 hours . Dismissed . The bantan is a little on the spicy side . Kes grows them herself in the hydroponic garden . Don 't eat any of the little pink things and you 'll be fine . All personnel report to stations . Yellow Alert . Now what ? Neelix to Chakotay . We 're very busy up here , Neelix . What do you need ? This Yellow Alert business- - l was just starting ... Sorry . We found out that the nebula is actually a life-form and we 've got to go back in to repair some damage we did to it . Chakotay out . Go back in ? Hello ? Well , that 's it ! I 've had it ! Neelix ... No ! I 'm going to the Captain about this . Come in . Captain , I understand that this nebula we 've discovered is some kind of monster ? Not a monster , Neelix , but it is a life-form . Excuse me if I sound crazy , because someone may have been playing a joke on me , but you aren 't planning to take us back into the belly of this beast , are you ? No joke . Why ? Because we hurt it and we have to help it recover . I did not come on board this ship to be a veterinarian , Captain . And I thought you were a man of unlimited talents . I just reached my limit . So , if you don 't mind , Kes and I will wait on board my little vessel for you to return . All our crews are busy preparing for this mission . I 'm not pulling them off their duties to prepare your ship for launch , and I 'm not going to drop you off on the side of the road every time we hit a bump . When we 're finished , if you want to leave , that 's your business , but for the moment , find yourself a seat with a good view because , just like Jonah and the whale , you 're going in . is that final ? Dismissed . That 's a Starfleet expression for " get out . " Jonah ? Whale ? Approaching the perimeter . Disengage impulse engines . Impulse engines off-line . Engage thrusters , one-third . Thrusters engaged . Red Alert . Shields are up . Adaptive harmonics are operational . Density is already more than double what we encountered last time . EM hull pressure is approaching dangerous levels , Captain . Mr. Kim ? If my research is right , releasing positive ions through the nacelles should repel some of the dust out there . Without causing further harm to the creature ? I believe so , Captain . Very well . lon release confirmed . Ambient density is dropping . Hull pressure is decreasing also . Hold your course . 14,000 kilometers to the breach . I can see it . Magnify . Engineering , ready your nucleonic beam . Ready and awaiting your orders , Captain . Mr. Paris , bring us into position . Coming about 40 degrees . Report ! We 're being hit by some kind of multi-polar charges . They 're not like anything we saw the first time . Shields at 87 percent . Will they hold ? The polarity of each charge is rotating so quickly , the shields cannot compensate . We 've lost the rear driver coil assembly . lnertial dampers are off-line . I 'm losing control . Hold on ! Engineering , initiate emergency shutdown of all thrusters . Captain , the only way we can shut down all thrusters is to vent the deuterium into space . We can 't afford to lose all that fuel . We have no choice . Do it ! Acknowledged . Cutting thrusters . lnertial dampers are still off-line . Reset idf baseline at 3-0-0 and reinitialize . Field processors coming back on line . lnertial damping restored . All stop . Damage report . Electro-plasma leaks reported on Deck 14 . Repair crews are being dispatched . Otherwise , we seem to be in one piece . I believe the optical data network is down , Ensign . Yes , sir . I 'll get right on it . 14 injuries reported , Captain- - none serious . Have any idea where we are , Mr. Paris ? Approximately 70,000 kilometers from our former position- - deeper inside the creature than before . Let 's hope it has a slow digestive process . Yes , ma 'am . We need to get back to the wound without causing a response from its defense systems . Suggestions ? It seems to be leaving us alone now that we 've cut off all propulsion systems . Maybe that 's what cues it to respond . If I 'm right , we might be able to get back without engaging any engines . No engines ? We 've been reading these swirling energy currents since we first got here . When we thought it was a nebula , we weren 't looking for any pattern . We thought they were just random eddies . But now , I 'm wondering if these currents might be some kind of a circulatory system . Mr. Kim , are you showing omicron particles in these currents ? Affirmative , Captain . If the currents are distributing omicron energy throughout the life-form , the circulatory system might pass right by that wound . We could get in one of those currents and surf back . Use the reaction control thrusters in drift mode only , Mr. Paris . Aye , Captain . We 're on our way . Speed- - all of 200 kph . Time for refreshment . Ailis pate , Felada onion crisps , stuffed Cardaway leaves . I appreciate the thought , Neelix , but this is hardly the time . As the morale officer on this ship , I insist that a break in the workload is both healthy and necessary . Go on , Mr. Vulcan . It might even help you loosen up . Or not . May I ask when you became morale officer ? Oh , just a few minutes ago , when I sensed crew morale might be especially low . Mine certainly was . We were in a free fall at the time . Cooking always helps Neelix to unwind . Yes , and after we stabilized I certainly needed to unwind . So it seemed to me , I had a choice to either come up here and say , " l told you so " ... No . or to try to do something constructive to help out in my own humble manner . Try the stuffed Cardaway leaves . They 're irresistible . Now , as your new morale officer , I thought it might be fun for us all to sing a few songs together . Don 't push it , Neelix . Captain ? Well done , Mr. Paris . Well done , Mr. Paris . Take us gently out of the current . Stay in RCS drift mode . Aye , Captain . Ms. Torres , prepare your nucleonic beam . We 're ready down here , Captain . Let 's give the wound two doses to start . Five bursts at a two-second interval . Now . Analysis . Scanners are showing the regeneration rate up only .04 percent . I don 't know what we can hope to accomplish if this is the best we can do . The breach may simply be too large to seal . This is the Doctor speaking . Please activate your monitor to the emergency medical holographic channel . I believe I may have a suggestion that will help . Since no one had the courtesy to turn me off after my last consultation , I 've had the opportunity to observe your progress- - or lack of same . I believe a slight alteration of your treatment plan is necessary . As inspiration , I 've drawn on an ancient medical technique known as a suture . " Suture " ? Before the advent of laser technology , surgical fiber was used to stitch together a wound to allow it to heal naturally . How does that help us ? Your ship 's energy systems are compatible with this life-form 's omicron particles , are they not ? That 's right . Then it is very likely that this vessel could serve the life-form 's needs in much the same manner as a suture . By allowing the ship to serve as an energy conduit across the wound the life-form should be able to regenerate itself more rapidly . And how are we supposed to get the ship into the wound without getting the hell beat out of us again ? That 's your problem , not mine . Doctor out . That 's sort of like asking a hurt dog not to bite you while you tend to its wounds . You like dogs , Mr. Paris ? Yes , ma 'am . I always had a dog . I like dogs , too . When I had to clean out a cut on my dog 's leg , I needed to create a little diversion first to take her mind off it . Mr. Kim- - prepare a class-4 microprobe . Aye , Captain . Lieutenant , if I gave you a short burst from our thrusters , would it be enough for you to maneuver into the breach in ten seconds ? I 'd feel better if I had 20 . Once we launch that probe as a diversion , you might have ten , maybe even less than that . Ten sounds good . Mr. Kim , status ? Microprobe is loaded and ready . Set coordinates for launch at 160 mark 70 . Cut power after 500 meters . I don 't want to hurt this life-form again . Acknowledged . Engineering , I 'll need a one-second burst from our aft thrusters on my order . Standing by . Launch microprobe . Thrusters . Firing ! Reading mono-polar charges , high frequency . Shields at 7 5 percent and holding . Maintain position . Engineering , direct two nucleonic beams fore and aft- - parallel to the central axis of the ship . Acknowledged . Beam engaged . Captain , I 'm showing a rapid growth pattern along the wound . Regenerative matter approaching from both directions at just under 500 kilometers per hour . Hold position . Captain , the shields are only designed to withstand ... I 'm aware of that , Mr. Tuvok . Hold position ! Regenerative matter approaching . Range ... 30 kilometers- - fore and aft . Engineering , ready full thrusters . Mr. Paris ? Just tell me when . Regenerative matter at 20 kilometers . Fifteen ... ten ... Disengage nucleonic beam . Fire thrusters . Thrusters engaged . Now , Mr. Paris . 40,000 kilometers to the perimeter . 30,000 . The life-form 's regeneration rate is up 40 percent , Captain . Looks like it 's well on the way to closing that wound . We 've cleared the central mass . Captain 's Log , supplemental . We set out to augment our energy reserves and wound up depleting them by over 20 percent . As a result , we 've set a new course for a planet 14 light-years away that Neelix says might have compatible energy sources to offer us . It is out of our way , but circumstances offer few alternatives . So much for raising spirits . Turning in for the night , Captain ? Actually , I 'm going to talk to an animal and then turn in . Something Commander Chakotay taught me . Supposed to be quite therapeutic . You might want to ask him about it . I will . Captain ... What is it , Ensign ? Well , I don 't mean to be out of place , but if you 'd care to join us , you 'd be welcome . Join you where ? Come on , Tommy . Let 's get out of here . Easy , honey . I 'm setting the Indian up for the big hustle . But he 's beating you . Yeah , that 's exactly what he 's supposed to think , too . As you were . Well ... this is remarkable . Mr. Kim tells me this is your doing , Mr. Paris . Ah ... yeah . It 's just a little diversion , Captain . One always knows when a woman of good breeding enters a room . Ma cherie ... may I request your favorite song , so that we may dance , before I take you to my private felucca on the wharf and make passionate love to you ? Uh ... I 'm sorry . If I had some kind of warning that you were coming ... You would have changed it , and I would have missed all the fun . I just don 't know what the dolls see in a gigolo , do you ? Now , me , I got a whole different approach to women . Treat a lady like a tramp , and a tramp like a lady . Never fails . Paris , did you program this guy ? Yeah . Why ? He 's a pig , and so are you . Almost never . is this pool or billiards ? Uh , pool . Right . Pool 's the one with the pockets . Would you mind if I gave it a try ? Reculez-vous ! Give the handsome young woman some room . Tell me , does she have , uh , money ? Commander Chakotay , your stick ? It 's called a cue , Captain . Cue . All right . So what do we do ? Do I go first ? Solids . I saw that coming a mile away , didn 't you ? Ah , you 've got a lot to learn , jeune homme . But then ... I 've got a lot to teach . Eight ball in the side pocket . A-koo-chee-moya . We are far from the sacred places of our grandfathers , and from the bones of our people , but perhaps there is one powerful being who will embrace this good crew and give them the answer they seek .

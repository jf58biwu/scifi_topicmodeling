 ALGURES NA LUA COLÃ“NIA DO PRESIDENTE DITADOR MAC BEE Back to the Palace To the Palace ! Miss ... Yes Sir Does my mark looks like mud ? Mud Sir ? Yes ... Blue mud ... Yesterday during the funeral ... the coffin of my twin-brother was flooded by a blue mud the same color as my mark You had a nightmare sir My twin is not dead ? - Yes he 's dead - So ... Your mark is looking well - Is it getting bigger ? - No sir Quiet Napoleon - Is it smaller ? - No Sir Please measure it Everything is perfect . It hasn 't changed a bit Then I am right What doesn 't move outside Gets bigger inside Here ... This mark is like bugs digging unseen underground tunnels It wants me killed - But I am formally forbidding it - Of course Sir - I will make a blood test - A blood test ? You must analyse and measure The song ? - Miss ? - Yes Sir Is it painful to die ? Anikst Soloko ? Don 't think so Tykho Moon is alive You hear me ! Alive ! This abjection " Tykho Moon or the second life " Was published everywhere . Down there In America , in Finland , in Ethiopia , in the Balkans and even in France In french What does it mean They are speaking about him ... and he 's dead And not about me even if I am the one alive I want a biography too We don 't have a biographer Sir A ressurection is much better than a biography I don 't think that you trully understand We are talking about your donor Your donor ... You remember My donor , Tykho moon ... No ... So I was cheated Who cheated on me ? Who 's fooling me since twenty years Sir , these documents prove nothing And especially that he 's alive If my donor is alive , he must be healthy And if he is healthy , so I will be again Gentlemen ... The ressurection of Tykho Moon is a politico-economic matter And surgical The surgery of my body is a geopolitic matter We must verify the information It looks like a provocation of the new United Nations And the International Community I don 't care about the International Community Do I meddle with Democraties ? My donor is alive Your donor is dead And you will not be able to find him with this picture Yes I will , amplify the researches look everywhere ! There is in fact a trace , but we need time to explore it How long ? A little Is this all ? Maybe a little more - Maybe a little less ? - It is going to be difficult Try it anyway The trace of the donor is his histological identity Genetical ... We have this identity , and it is flawless It is our only chance to find him What are the odds ? - Excuse me sir ? - What are the odds ? Between Fifteen and Twenty ? I take it Fire ... Fire ! Fire ... fire ! What is this all about ? Who is this Tykho Moon ? - Take it easy Alvin - I am talking to your mother Exactly Who is this Tykho Moon ? Gobelski will answer you ... This Tykho Moon , was he an opponent ? We can put it that way . But he was especially the donor who saved your father 's life We took cerebral cells from him and it stopped the illness for twenty years According to surgeons , he could be a stockpile for organs ... blood ... cells For every Mac Bee The operation went quite well But a few days later the hospital was burned to the ground We found nothing but desintegrated bodies Nothing else Your father was safe , because we brought him back to the palace And the fire , was a criminal act of course ? We never knew And the heart the lungs ... We can maybe hit many targets with one stone No , You first need cerebral cells .. It is vital Only then , we will take care of organs We 'll start with the liver - But if ... - If what ? Napoleon is not the donor anymore , can I eat it ? If we 'll transplant you with the liver of Tykho Moon , he 'll have to stay alive - So he can give me the rest later - Exactly So he 'll have Napoleons liver and it 's heart He 'll be like the baboon Thanks to my transplants ... the pig have become a monkey And man will ... become a puppet Tykho Moon will be a puppet and I will become immortal I knew you 'd come It 's him , isn 't it ? And the one standing is you , carrying me I don 't know ... for you especially I 'll make him leave , and I 'll leave with him You forget about the blockade Konstantin there are no flights I 'll make sure that he never finds him , I 'll protect him I don 't want you to go out It is too dangerous and you are too fragile No mum , the Mac Bees are fragile .

With a little strenghtened uranium , and new organs : an eternity And for two ? Are there any containers for two , because there 's also my wife ?

She changed his identity And placed him on the other side of the wall , to save him . She kept the secret for twenty years ? The opponents of the regime were completely wiped out Tykho Moon was clandestine and almost forgotten And everyone was afraid of each other Eva Mac Bee knew perfectly how to increase the pressure At the right place , at the right time The Mac Bees have very welly studied the dictats of the last century I know , I was trained by them And who brought you next to Tykho moon Konstantin Mac Bee He wanted from me to protect him . He thinks ... - It 's here - Shall I hide behind ? It 's not necessary , they are searching Miss Lena Good reflexes . If one day you 'll ever need a job ...

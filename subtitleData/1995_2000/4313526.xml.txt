 Ah , perfection ! No , no , no , absolutely not , just get out of my face ! Don 't be a coward , you say you want to clean your teeth . Brush them ! I want to brush my teeth ! But to manually clean your teeth as you describe is highly inefficient . That 's too damn bad ! You 're not sticking that freakin 'maggot in my ... What 's it doing ? Cleaning all the excess bacteria and food particles . Never swallow the Dentic . Pilot , report ! This is Aeryn , I 'm in The Command , you 'd better get up here quickly . That 's kind of minty . - What is that ? - Best I can tell it 's asteroid debris . - Stay with it , Pilot . - Doing my very best . Asteroid debris does not move like that . Don 't tell me Moya 's got hiccups . You 're too close . Move away from it . The debris cloud isn 't our problem . That 's another ship . It doesn 't know we 're here , the debris is blocking their scan . Pilot , stay behind the debris . It 's scanning ? That ship is scanning ? Wait , does that mean it 's ... Peacekeeper ! It 's a scout ship , Crais 's eyes and ears and claws . It 's a Marauder ... Five man crew , highest level of training . Success measured by body count . Marauder changing course ! How fast can they ... how fast can they go ? Hatch Seven . Hatch Seven ? The thing 's a Hyundai ! Why don 't we stop playing ' hide and seek and just smoke ' em ? If they discover us , Crais will know exactly where to concentrate his search , and we cannot outrun a Command Carrier . D 'Argo 's right . Of course he is , Miss Sun , he 's been here longer . Stay with it , Pilot ... Steady . We 're no longer being scanned . They 're passing us by . Thank you for your help Officer Sun . We work together well , Pilot . Don 't see that every day . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe , on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life forms . Help me ! Listen , please , is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander Who can do everything ? I can 't ! I 'm just looking for a way home . Go on , get out of here ! Shoo ! Go ! Go home ! So those Marauders really shook you up . The ship is called a Marauder , the team onboard are Commandos . Like you ? - What , you 're worried they 'll come back ? - Unlikely . But not impossible ? Marauders follow a very strict search pattern . It 's a cross hatch star pattern , clean , efficient . No prey escapes ... Moya got lucky , simple as that . You ever serve on one ? My application for transfer was awaiting Crais ' approval when I got caught up in this , this little mutiny . I 'm sure your world has no force so ruthless , so disciplined . We call ' em line backers , or serial killers . Depends on whether they 're professional or amateur . Look , you 're not in this alone . Everybody on board has had their lives derailed from what they were gonna be . We 're stuck together , and as long as we are , we might as well be ... What ? Family ? Friends ? I want neither . Somebody 's got to be there when you need it . No offence , human ... but what could I possibly need from you ? I don 't know manners , a personality , stock tips . Darn it ! Some fapoota is going to pay for this ! Let me help you . Is that how you see yourself ? Mother always said I was the best looking . That 's why she had my older brothers banished . She said my face belonged on the imperial seal , but now , of course , it 's ruined . It 's more accurate than you think . Hey , what do you think you 're doing ? Hey , do you mind ? Is that how you see me ? It 's called a Spirit Painting . We Delvians do it for recreation . ... It 's rather rushed . It looks like Rygel the Great . Rygel the First , my most honoured ancestor . Obviously a part of his spirit resides within you . You had it so very easy . I 'm missing one of those little ... pointy things with the laser probes . Aren 't you hot ? No . Aeryn ! Crichton ! I 'm showing abnormal thermal fluctuations throughout the ship . Can you confirm Maintenance Bay reading ? I told you it was hot , by the door . D 'Argo , the giant ouiji board says optimum plus three . Feels like plus thirty . How long to fix it , D 'Argo ? Not long , once we isolate the cause . Well then stop talking and start isolating . You okay ? Yeah ! Metal splinter . We 're done here . Why is it still so hot ? Moya 's propulsion system is generating more heat than usual at this speed . Diagnostics is showing some sort of blockage in the vents preventing its discharge into space . Well what about the congelation coils ? All attempts to chill the ship are being over ridden by the heat build up . " Chill " being the operative word here ... It 's a little warmer , what 's the big deal ? Even shutting down every non-vital system , it 's going to hit optimum plus fifteen in six hours . Worse than morons , find the blockage , clear it ! Look , I 'll fix the damn problem myself . Stop . We 'll search together , tier by tier . Pilot , please assist in the narrowing process . On Luxa , this is a mild winter morning . Another reason Sebaceans hate his world This main valve controls the heat for all of Tier Seven . Great , we 'll just turn this sucker off . No , I knew that . It 's alright , there 's so much new information for you to assimilate . Sometimes the smaller things will elude you . Yeah , well , at least you get that , the others treat me like I 'm some kind of earth idiot . Granted , they 're not the most patient beings , but what did you expect ? I don 't know , a little slack , maybe ... You know , at least they know where they are , how things work . It takes me ten minutes to figure out how to open the door . You 'll need to develop some patience yourself ifyou expect to survive here . I 'm trying , ooh I am trying , but you know , with Aeryn and D 'Argo , it 's like everything 's a test . It 's like I 'm in some never ending frat hazing at Alien U. " Frat hazing " ... ? Next planet , I 'll rent you a copy of ' Animal House ' . John they 're soldiers . Win their respect . And exactly how do you do that ? I mean , short of cutting someone 's throat ? Actions . Actions speak to them Actions like tactical manoeuvres , defending the ship fixing the heat . Right ... Hey ... Thanks . There 's a lot more of these to check . Are you sure you 've got the hang of it now ? Oh yeah , just watch me spring into action . Look , I 'll , check the vents in the living quarters and meet you back on The Command . Tier five passage way clear , Pilot , ditto Zhaan and Rygel 's quarters , checking mine now . Anybody , anybody hear me ? Anybody ? D 'Argo here . Yeah , I ... I think I 've found our problem . What is it , Crichton ? What is it ? - Crichton ? - Bugs ! Stop wasting time , ship 's beetles don 't clog exhaust vents . Yeah , well they might if they 're two feet long ! Can someone tell me what these things are ? You need to capture one . Yeah , capture one , right . We 're on our way , whatever you do , don 't let them back in the vent . Between you and me , you guys can go anywhere you want . Okay , what 'd I just do ? Oh yeah ! I got it ! Kahlen kahlen vijania maessen yiahni ... You 're praying for this parasite ? We don 't know it 's a parasite . It was on board this ship uninvited . My concern too , Rygel . but if I can analyse its DNA , perhaps we can understand why it 's here . Well the others think there may be dozens of these things , even hundreds , throughout our living quarters . I believe Crichton 's supposition is correct . He said that they must have come aboard when the flock or swarm thing passed over us . Crichton ! It 's Crichton 's DNA ? My DNA ? How can that bug be carrying my DNA ? - Well that 's what the analyser 's saying . - Well analyse it again ! I intend to , but another specimen would be helpful , John . Alive this time , if possible . Oh yeah , no problem ! Hell , the damn things are related to me . What 's behind there ? Hey , what 's back there ? Ion Backwash Chamber , should be a giant empty room . The beetles have completely isolated it , all four entries are sealed . Pilot , we need that alternate entry ! I am still attempting access . Nothing can resist a Prism Laser Saw . Well , you better check the warranty cuz , 'cause this stuff ain 't budging . Zhaan says we gotta capture another bug , alive this time . She needs to check some unreliable data . The data 's not the only unreliable thing around here . What 's her problem ? - Sebacean Heat Delirium . - What ? Sebaceans lack the gland necessary to regulate extreme thermal increases . What , Crais and those other bastards chasing us are cold blooded ? Literally ? It 's a weakness not enough of them die from . Pilot , I will wait no longer ! How dare you cut into Moya without warning ! You had your chance . We have to get in there . Maybe you should lie down . No , I need to be left alone . Heat delirium ? As our cells overheat , the nervous system shuts down . First short term memory , then motor functions . The last to go is longterm memory . - Sounds like an ugly way to die . - We don 't die . Our body lives on in that state . It 's called the living death . It 's the only time we kill our own , from mercy . You see anything ? Another bulkhead ! My DNA , my DNA ... Great ! The giant space cockroaches are eating out the lights . Please tell me you made a mistake on your tests . There 's no way my DNA is inside those things . Zhaan , it 's making it hotter , not cooler . What the hell ... ? D 'Argo ? Rygel ? How do you say 'we 're screwed ' in your native tongue ? Zhaan just beat the crap out of me then spit up that blue snot the bugs use . She must have been infected or something when she ... Aeryn ? Aeryn ? You 're not sweating ? Oh ... that 's ... that 's heatstroke . Commander Crichton , she is initiating a thermal increase . Aeryn , you gotta stop . Aeryn , you 're only gonna ... Aeryn , no ! Oh ! Okay , hardball . Do not let her execute that command . Thanks a lot , Pilot , that 's a big help . Aeryn ! Stop ! Crichton ? What ... are you ... doing ? It was exactly like you , the way it felt , the way it moved , I mean , it felt real , alive ! It looked and acted totally alive , it was impossible to tell the difference . The fact that it was trying to sabotage the ship wasn 't a clue to you ? He had no reason to suspect , this is a perfect duplicate of Aeryn 's exterior , right down to the micron . Did it communicate ? Not a word . Neither did you , when you attacked me in the passageway . I was never in the passageway , John . No , the other you . This bug was in my room . It must have sampled something , hair , whatever . It was going to use my DNA to make a copy of me . The perfect camouflage ! The perfect army . If there are hundreds of these creatures on board ... Then we could be meeting our replicants at every turn . We will kill them all , on sight . And how will you tell us from them ? We will cut off the tip of our small finger for identification . How about something a little less permanent ? Look , I ... I don 't care about replicants . What we 've got to do is ... Wait ... What was I going to say ? I had something to say , I know I did ! We really need to lower the ship 's temperature . All the climate regulators have been sealed by the blue sludge . Can we find something , make something that 'll dissolve this blue gunk ? I 've certainly got enough to analyse . I 'm going to go work with Pilot ... I 'm fine ! Right , then all we have to do is find where they 're hiding . If you say the heat 's affected you , I won 't assume you 've lost your minds ! Those things are in there ! There you go ! That should scatter them long enough for you to get through . " Should " ? I 'll go when it 's more definite ... You 'll go now ! Luxan manners never fail to amaze me ! If we can 't turn the temperature down , isn 't there at least some way to ... stop it from ... Officer Sun ? I am a Peacekeeper , a Sebacean . Look . I can 't hold a weapon . I can 't hold a thought . I can 't hold a thought . It is strange to be so close to a Peacekeeper I do not fear ... That ... is a compliment ... The only thing I haven 't performed is a full propulsion shutdown . It would allow me to open the cargo doors to space . No It 's too dangerous , we leave ourselves open for attack . We 're already under attack . I can hear something ! What the juxt was that ? Just trying to scare whatever 's in there . Well , it worked ! We need to get the heat down . Really ? What a good idea ! Did you see the look on Aeryn 's face ? It 's like she was staring at her own death . Or hoping for it , with Sebacean Heat Delirium , death is preferable . You 've seen someone in this " living death " state ? Yes ... I 've seen Peacekeepers suffer as she does . They often beg for their own death . I cannot say I did not find the sight most enjoyable . You want her to die ? That 's not true ... She was one of them ... now she 's a comrade , like you . Now there 's a load of bull . You hate her , right ? You hate Peacekeepers , and you hate her , you want her to die . Listen , human ... everyone is frustrated . We 're all hot and we 're all going to be a lot better off if we stop this wasting time and just fix this blasted ship . Will you stop that ! Just find the problem , Rygel , and fast . The little wretch is doing the best he can . Yeah , and meanwhile , Aeryn 's melting away . Look , human , for what it is worth , the part of me that wants Aeryn to live is greater than the part of me that wants all Peacekeepers to die . It 's not worth much . Well , it 's all I 've got . A few degrees cooler , that 's all , I 'm sorry . Not your fault . I cannot reactivate the consumables refrigeration unit . I have no place to bring your core temperature down . Perhaps the others can think of a way to help you . Why would the others care ? My kind imprisoned them , I 'm sure they haven 't forgotten . Bad news , people , very bad news . What is it , Rygel ? Are you trying to get me killed ? Oh , of course you are , you sent me in here ... It 's hotter than squag , they 're building some kind of ... nest . Nest ? Too many letters for you , Luxan ? Try hive ! - They 're making us their home . - Then I 'm moving ! John ! D 'Argo ! I 've found a substance that dissolves the sealant , now we can take back control of the ... Zhaan ! D 'Argo ! Where the hell is the hole you bastards ! They 're after me ! Pilot report ! Where is Zhaan ? Unknown ... but Aeryn Sun is down here almost unconscious , I 'm afraid . Rygel ? Are you alright ? Rygel ? Rygel ? D 'Argo , what ... Can ... are you ... are you able to speak ? Man , this is freakin ' weird . Can you understand me ? Can you understand me ? You know my moves . ... and I know yours . That 's why Eddie Marx kicked your ass in the seventh grade . You fought fair ! Pilot , report ! Where is Zhaan ? Still no sign ... My scans do reveal a growing number of bipedal entities moving about the ship . Who knows how many more there are ? Infinite ! ... Minus one . How do I know that you are Crichton ? Because I 'm talking , and the replicants don 't do that . If they could , they wouldn 't tell you that these markings , they 're useless . They instantly adapt to whatever they see . Where 's Rygel ? Where 's Zhaan ? There 's signs of a struggle in the lab , we cannot find her . Did we pass the obstacle test ? I don 't want to fail commando training . We can do nothing else , those invaders are isolating us . We 've gotta find Zhaan , we 've gotta stick together . The yotz with Zhaan ! What about me ? Rygel , where are you ? Back where I started from , if you must know . If I sit perfectly still , they don 't advance . Yet when I move ... they get disagreeable . Right ... don 't move . If we ever survive this , Luxan ... you must become my advisor Fa-pu-ta ! What 's going on in there ? Nothing of concern , unless you count the fact that this thing 's spitting out replicants like a Bellian yard rat . They 've already won , why do they need more of us ? Help me ! I can 't ... I can 't get this stinger out , it 's pumping some kind of venom into me . - I 'll cut it out ! - Noo ! Zhaan ? I am Monarch of the Drak . Drak ? These are my aggregate ... You attack me during my Genesis . and you must die . What the hell is Genesis ? You ask the wrong warrior . - Wait ! - This is one of them ! No , it 's the real Zhaan , she 's talking . The Xeroxes can 't do that ! - What have you done to our friend ? - I use her for my voice . She will die when you die , to save Genesis . Genesis ? The nest ? The nest . The nest ? The nest ... Is this some sort of spawning ... and you 're the ... you 're the Queen ? Life must continue . You live in space ... freezing space , but you need warmth to lay your eggs , or ... or to give birth . Only to give birth . So when you 're finished , you 'll go back to space ? That is our cycle ... Why do you threaten us ? Threaten you ? They didn 't attack until I killed that first bug in my room . We started this damn war ! It is still a war , either we die fighting them or we die from the heat . We didn 't know , we didn 't mean to harm you . We didn 't mean to harm you . How much time do you need to complete your cycle ? - Time ? - Time , yes . They don 't know time . Is your cycle near the beginning or is it near the end ? I have birthed half my young . Half ? That 's good ... Half is ... but does it need to be this hot ? Warm propels the emergence . Your habitat is capable of even greater warmth , but it resists . Tell me , why it does this ? Because it 's a living being ... A host ... and this heat is very bad for our habitat . We must strike before she decides to strike . You are enemy ! If you keep it this warm , our habitat will die ... and there will be no heat ... and all of your young will die . What the yotz kind of deal is that ? Best we could do ! Yeah , another reason I should handle all negotiations . Just don 't worry ! It 's only a couple more hours . I can 't stay here for a few more hours ! I think this thing is salivating and my body has functions ! Stay put ! As long as we don 't move until Genesis is over ... she 'll keep the heat down , and we shouldn 't see any more replicants ... only baby Draks . What do they eat ? I think we caught it in time , any longer at that level , and she would have suffered permanent damage . Let her rest , John . She needs to recover some strength before she 's aggravated again . How about you ? I can still sense her , deep inside . What was that like ? Like we 're imprisoned in this room with the rest of the ship just out of reach . I was within my own mind , yet I couldn 't reach past to think or feel what I wanted . I 'm glad you 're safe , Zhaan . Now you 've struck this truce , we 're all safe . - You feeling better ? - No ... - How much longer ? - I don 't know . We didn 't cover the life cycle ... of deep space insects at JFK High . Lieutenant Melkor ! Officier Sun ! How fortunate for you to be spared the punishment of a Captain Crais court martial . Something is wrong here , sir . This ship is floating dead in space with its cargo doors wide open . Our scans show her propulsion systems as fully operational ... Why ? When we secure the rest of the ship you will have your answers . Lieutenant ! Stand fast , Luxan ! Our objective is The Command . Advance pattern Decca , shoot to kill is your order . She 's cranked up the heat again . Why ? Weapons fire on board . - Weapons fire ? - What ? Moya 's neural links have been badly affected by the heat . I believe it came from the maintenance bay . I 'm picking up five unidentified life forms , and a ship in the Transport Hangar , the Marauder . It must be the Monarch , she thinks that we 've broken the deal . Lieutenant ! Another Luxan ! Steady , Sergeant ! This transport was only carrying one Luxan ! Enemy rear ! Monarch ! Speak with me ! We aren 't the ones attacking you ! Speak with me , dammit ! - It 's up to you . - Aeryn , I know I 'm trying to ... Before the living death takes hold , you have to be prepared to kill me . - Promise . - No , not a chance . You said I 'm not alone ... A friend would do this for me , family would do it , swiftly . The heat , sir ? The prisoners have done this , it 's their only defence . But what 's this sealant ? We must resist . We must retreat ! I 'll attribute that to Heat Delirium , Officer . The Command is this way , move ! I can 't do this ! I can 't ! We don 't have a choice . Do you know what you 're asking me ? Do you realise how ... how hideous this thing is ? You wanted to negotiate now is your chance . Ask him what Rygel the First would do ? Rygel ? Zhaan wants to ... Rygel ? What 's happening ? I am Rygel , sixteenth of my lineage , Dominar of the Hynerian Empire At once your equal , and your humble petitioner , requesting an audience . What 's happening ? Rygel ? Rygel , come in ! Come in , Rygel ! He has to be there ! - That is enough , he is gone . - Look , it was my idea to send him in there . And it failed , but we are still alive . He 's right . Zhaan , what do you think ? - Monarch ? - Silence . You have to listen to me , those people out there they only look like us , they ... - Silence ! - I will not be silent ! You 're killing us for no reason ! I have communed with your sovereign , he is most agreeable , I trust him . Rygel is not my sovereign ! He is today ! Then you know we wouldn 't hurt you ? I know all . These creatures , whatever they are , are no real threat to us . - We continue forward . - Sir ! Crichton . What the ... ? Locked in this room , we can 't help you , Let us out . We can stop them . I will allow the thermal to lower . No ! Wait ! Do it . Don 't lower the heat , crank it up . I 'll look after her ... Go ! - It 's just you and me . - Actually , it is just me and you . Aeryn ... I feel the living death . No ... now hold on ... I won 't let it happen . It 's not your choice ... Remember your promise . - Move ! - No ! - Pilot . - Yes ? More pressure ... Colder water . Living death ... Crichton ... Promise ! Sir ! Shoot them ! Shoot them all ! Promise ! ... Promise ! Crichton ! Did you ever have one of those days ... when life just ain 't what you thought it was going to be ? I killed you ! I 'm still here . What ... what kind of creature are you ? That 's a good question ... It 's too bad Crais didn 't ask that before he declared war on me . - Crichton ! Out of the way ! - No , D 'Argo ! This one 's mine . We got two choices here , Peacekeeper ... You can stick around ... and find out how hot it 's going to get ... or you can return to your Captain Crais . Crichton ! You would let us leave ? Tell him ... he picked the wrong species to screw around with . If he wants a fight , fine ... Look around ... Take a good look around . Multiply that by thousands . Let 's get you back to your ship . I believe the human Crichton gave you a choice . Go ahead ! Use your blade ... Next time Crais sees my face , his crew will be dead and he 'll be staring up from a pool of his own blood . A brave gamble , Crichton . You wouldn 't have let him skewer me ? Right ? You risked Aeryn Sun 's life ... I would still have preferred killing them on the spot . This way , there 's a chance Crais 'll catch a hint and leave us alone . A small chance . Big fella ! You look refreshed . Yes , well , a three hour trinkas bath will do that for you ... I had blue crud way up in places you don 't want to know about . You did a hell of a job today . Yes , well , there 's a lot of Rygel the First in here . You know , if I had new clothes of cray-spun shimmer weave the resemblance would startle you . I 'm pleased to report that the temperature is now at Optimum . That 's good news for Aeryn . Where is she ? I believe on the terrace . The Draks are leaving , Monarch wishes a final word with us . We are pleased ... Genesis is concluded . That pleases us too , Monarch . We are also pleased by the encounter between us . Well , I think I can speak for all of us when I ... We shall not meet again , Great Ruler . Don 't worry , this one will last me a lifetime . They 'll be gone soon . So remarkable ! Easy now , just lean on me . Yes , I know I can . Home sweet home . I 'll be fine from here . I must say you handled yourself like quite a man of action today . Yeah , I 'm getting the hang of a few things . - Of course when I do ... - Things change and you find you 're more confused than you were before . Yeah , pretty much . Time and patience . - Is that your answer for everything ? - Yes , because it 's always the right answer Okay , how does time and patience answer this ? We see the Draks , or we saw them , as pests , something to be stepped on and crushed . We were ignorant . Well , I definitely pulverised one on sight and I would have done the same thing to the Dentic and those germ bugs that you injected me with when I first came on board . The translator microbes . Yeah , those guys , but see , you see them as good ... We 've learned to work with them . Isn 't that the same where you come from ? I guess ... I mean , some people keep pets that others would just as soon eat . If you 're asking for a distinction , I think it 's often unclear . Moya is alive and she 's our protector , but she 's also our servant , she relies on us ... and we rely on her , it 's a mutual symbiotic relationship . So ... who lives and dies in your world ... is as arbitrary as it is in mine . The answer is reverence for all living beings ... - Which may come with ... - Time , and patience . Yes , John . I get the feeling you 're going to get the hang of things soon . Remember me ? Didn 't we meet at a party a few years back ? Some of what happened I can 't recall , but almost everything else has come back . How 're the shakes ? I 'll be fine . You know ... I always thought that lesser life forms were useless , just something to be squashed . Yeah ... it 's humbling when you realise that . You 're not talking about the Draks , are you ? Fine ... Well on behalf of lesser life forms everywhere , I accept the ... compliment . Could you have kept your promise ? You know , all things considered , there are worse ways to end a day .

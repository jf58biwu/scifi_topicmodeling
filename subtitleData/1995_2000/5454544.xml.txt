Routine scans from last week . Are you okay , Sydney ? Broots , can I trust you ? Absolutely . I told you about the dream I keep having about Miss Parker , didn 't I ? I need your help to find a person . Her name is Michelle Lucca . Okay . This is every thing I remember about her . Broots , this is important to me . Please be secretive . Okay , Sydney . You know you can count on me . Hate to break up the coffee clutch . But Broots is needed on sublevel five right away . Oh , okay . Do the course . Everything okay , Syd ? Fine , Miss Parker , fine . In a hurry , Broots ? Oh , hi . What ? I want the paper Sydney gave you . - You 're listening at the door ? - It was an accident . Call the cop . The paper ! Michelle Lucca . Dr. Pavlov has been drooling ever since he found that note from Jarod . Do exactly what 's Sydney asked . Okay . If Sydney 's protecting Jarod for some reason , I need to know about it . You got it ? Yeah . Oh , and Broots . I can 't wait to hear about that dream of yours . And we are clear . What did the hell you shoot that , Mooney ? Cleveland ? Are you okay ? Yeah . I need some air . What 's with him ? I don 't know . Nice choice of simulation scenario , Jarod . Well , Simulation is sort of my speciality . You and Cook , you show some ... shooting . Just back up the team . What 's up ? I really drop the ball back there . Maybe the simulation was a little too close the home . Maybe it reminded you the day you got shot . The day Dan Lang was killed . It 's only been two weeks . I was like I was living that again . ... was going off . Dan screaming , pain cutting into my leg . Classic syndromes of post-traumatic stress . Have you talked to someone ? I am doing mandatory search since the department shrink . I just can 't get it out of my head . Stress can be triggered by a number of factors . Anger . Fear . Guilty . Guilty ? About how Dan Lang died to save your life . Look , Your physical wounds are healing . Maybe it 's time to start dealing with your emotional ones . It will heal when I catch the man that murdered my partner . We run the simulations to hold our technical skills . Same thing can work for healing emotions . Well , we got a call about butch bank robbery . The suspect drove three blocks and abandoned his car and broke into a roller rink . Lang and I made entry there . Just behind those lockers . We moved to our breaches but we were pinned by gunfire coming from the box . Up there . I had Lang 's ... then I was hit in the leg and went down . Dan stood between me and the shooter just kept firing . It sounded like we were in the middle of a war . Stevens and Cook were taking a cover position over there . You could see them ? I didn 't have to . It 's standard technical procedure . Anyway , the next thing I knew , Lang was shot and went down . That 's when I saw the shooter . He stood open to the light . White man , six feet , .. build , goatee and in a baseball cap . Son of the bitch knew what he was doing too . They found powder of M1-32 shell casings . Armor-piercing rounds Cop killers . Tore off Lang 's vest like paper . They call us the Turbo Squad . Pistons in the same engine . If we don 't fire at the right time , that engine breaks down . People die . - Anything on this Michelle Lucca ? - No on Michelle Lucca . Yes on Michelle Stamatis . Married and living in New York state . But that 's not the screwy part . - What is that surprised me ? - Well , there is absolutely no record of Michelle Lucca ever have existed before moving to Albany in 1974 . No drivers licences , no birth certificate , nothing . Broots . Look deeper . Then you can give Sydney her address but nothing else . We need to find that note Jarod left Sydney in the cabin . I am sure he hid it pretty well . You haven 't seen it , have you ? Broots ? No way , no . Miss Parker , this woman obviously means a lot to Sydney . Your point ? Whatever happens with respecting someone 's privacy ? Look , I know how much you care about Sydney . How the old goat 's even going on me a little . But this might have something to do with Jarod . And that , is what 's important . This is central dispatched T-14 . Suspects invaded a roller rink in 21B shore road . He is armed and dangerous , over . This is Lang . Officer Mooney and I abandoned the building . Officer Stevens and Cook have taken flank positions . Over . Copy entry , keep this channel 11 of T14 , over . Request immediately backup , officer down . Repeat T14 ? Lang was hit ! Officer down ... Copy officer down . Backup in road , over . Response , T14 , over . Officer Lang , please respond . Officer Lang , this is dispatch , please respond . This is Lang . I can 't , I can 't feel my legs . Daniel , talk to me . Stay with me . The ambulance is on the way . This 's so cold . I am so cold . Daniel , stay with me . Please tell my boys , tell Jordan and Cody , daddy loves them . You can tell them that yourself , Daniel . Just hang on . Daniel ? Oh , My God ! Daniel , stay with me . Please tell my boys , tell Jordan and Cody , daddy loves them . Ceramics figurines with vegetation for hair . Chia pets . Pets ? Yeah . I never have much for green thumb and animals hate me . It seems like a logical solution . I am Jarod . Dan Lang 's replacement . I don 't think it 's possible to replace a man like lieutenant Lang . No . You were working dispatch on the night lieutenant Lang was killed . I was the last person speak to him . It must be very difficult for you . Considering how you and Dan felt about each other . What ? You two were in love . I heard the dispatch tape . I could hear it in your voice , the way you spoke to each other . It must be very comforting for Dan . To have you there until the end . Daniel lost his wife just a year ago . Since then , it 's just been him and the boys . You were close to his sons ? Yeah , very . The only family they have left , are Daniel 's parents in Seattle . I have been tried to contact them about taking custody of Jordan and Cody . Trouble is they 've been travelling in Europe for over a month . I am really gonna miss those kids . It 's difficult , losing people that we love . Yeah . I haven 't even cleaned out his locker yet . It sounds silly . It makes he seems a final . So real . I don 't want to forget him . I want to do something , you know , make a difference . At least I want to get this cop killer bullet off the street . Did Dan happen to mention anyone , who might be supplying that type of ammunition in street ? He did mention a man named Petrovka . Vladimir Petrovka , a local Russian connected to the Moscow Maffia . Interpol thinks he might be responsible for smuggling cop killer ammunitions in States . Among other things . That 's definitely him . I remember hearing his name a lot just before Daniel made up his mind to leave the team . Daniel was planning to leave Turbo Squad ? Yeah , it was strange . The last few weeks before the shooting , he became so distant as if he knew something was gonna happen . That is strange . He said he was leaving Turbo because he was burnt out . But , I think it was because of the boys . Jordan and Cody were the world of him . Now they may not have anybody . Michelle Lucca , the more I look , the less I find . I access ClA , fbi and ... He is not there . Interpol files . None of them have any record of her having ever existed prior to 1974 . so , I got the thinking , who else could wipe out a person 's past so efficiently ? - She worked for the Center . - Got information , Miss Parker . She was the clinical psychologist to work very closely with Sydney on the pretender project . She is beautiful , isn 't she ? Figure out how this connects to that note Jarod left . I 'll get on this right away , then . You are hiding something , Broots . What ? I think you heard me . I promised Sydney he can trust me . - And you feel like you 're lying to him , right ? - Yes . So , by giving me the rest of what you know , it doesn 't make you any more despicable than you are really are . Right ? Right . Let 's go in my office . Jordan and Cody remain with ... , but ... respective considering they lost their father . I understand that . The boys ' grandparents might take custody . And apparently they are out of the country . We 're still trying to make a contact . What happens if they 'are unable to take custody ? What happens to Jordan and Cody then ? Statistically older children particularly ones with emotional scars are very difficult to place . If I ever left here , would anybody want me ? Let 's ... You must be good at this game . Would you like to play ? Whatever . You are a S.W.A.T. Yes , I am . So , did you know our dad ? No , but I hear he was a great guy . Do you guys remember anything strange happening before your father 's accident ? He yelled one night . - Yelled ? - At the men . Me and Cody 've gone to bed and we woke up when we heard them fighting . - Did you see these men ? - No , but we can hear them . Dad was real mad . He kept telling them that he didn 't want to be involved and that they should leave . It was a few nights before ... you know . Are you okay ? Everyday before he went to work , he said nothing would happen to him . He promised . Cody , Your father died of saving another police officer . There is nothing more heroic than that . This is so wrong . Sydney should be entitled to a private life . Keep looking . He was poped around here when I was here before him . I got it . What ? Oh God ! Oh , Miss Parker . - Sydney , we were just ... - Just looking for you because I need your report on the surveillance scans . - I 'll put them on your desk . - Thank you . - Any news , Broots ? - Almost . Give me that ! It is a birth certificate . Michelle Lucca is named as the mother but there is no one here as the father . Sydney . I was in the cover position near the back breaches with officer Cook when we heard gunfire . We immediately returned the fire . I was hit almost immediately . That 's when Dan , I mean Officer Lang began to return fire . The next thing I knew he was down . And I can see the shooter , the guy with goatee and baseball cap looking right at me . Felt like the fire fight lasted twenty minutes . When we stop firing , we heard another weapon , sounded like one of our MP5 nine mm coming from the breaches in front of us . Felt like the fire fight lasted twenty minutes . Felt like the fire fight lasted ... Felt like the fire fight ... Felt like the fire fight ... I can 't believe that buddy reopened the roller rink that haven 't fixed the damage . Liz , what kind of weapons were Mooney and Lang carrying the day of shooting ? 9 mm hand guns . Stevens and Cook ? - M16 assault rifles , standard team issue . - Right . Going to fire ... I can 't feel my legs . Daniel , oh my god . I am sorry . I shouldn 't have brought you here . Why did you ask about the weapons ? Because maybe Mooney and Lang didn 't have a back up after at all . What are you talking about ? Stevens and Cook were right behind them . Were they ? Cook said there was a fire fight . Yeah , so ? So there were such a vicious exchange of gun fire , why there aren 't more bullet holes . And why are all these bullet holes exact same size ? You lost me . An M16 slot leaves slightly smaller bullet hole than 9 mm . It 's not something you would notice unless you 're looking for it . And none of these bullet holes come from the assault weapon . Stevens and Cook are expert marksman . I 've seen them shoot . That box is only thirty yards away . Yet they miss their target . Why is that ? You 're saying that they never fired at the shooter . I am saying that maybe , just maybe , who 's never shooting in the first place . Then who killed Daniel ? Maybe ¡ ­ Stevens and Cook . The birth certificate is from 1974 for a boy named Nicholas . He was born about eight months after Michelle Lucca left the Center . ... thinking what to do with that part of his enemy . Now he gets a son out there . That 's just why we should leave him alone . Give the moral ... , Broots . I wouldn 't want anyone from the Center getting involved my daughter 's life . We have to back off , Miss Parker . For Sydney show some testosterone ... you . Must be ... water . Would you put that away ? The Center made Michelle disappeared . Don 't , don 't you think they 've done enough to Sydney ? I told you this isn 't about Sydney . It 's about Jarod . If you say that , I just wonder if you believe it . " Night Vision " A voice from beyond the grave . This lieutenant Daniel B. Lang . Badge number 44562 . The date is March 4 . The time is eleven eighteen PM . My location is 570 Franklin Avenue . I am currently on observations of Officer Stevens , Cooke and Mooney with one fled from here , Petrovka . the known criminal with ties to the Russian Maffia . And convictions on weapons and drug charges . This is the second meeting which I have witnessed the exchange of money . I plan to turn this surveillance tape over to the District Attorney 's office as soon as I collect enough evidence . I just hope I can stop this before anybody concerned . You may have been too late , Dan . But I won 't be . Nick , you 're ... When I returned to the Center , your desk has been cleared out , your project reassigned , and your apartment was empty . You left without a trace . I had only this . Jet 'aime . Michelle , if you loved me , how could you leave without saying goodbye ? Because I loved you . I received a copy of a birth certificate . A boy named Nicholas , born eight months after you left . No father listed . Michelle . Am I the father ? Sydney . Well , am I ? Do you remember that Easter weekend we spent at the cabin ? After a few weeks I got up one morning , I wasn 't feeling very well . So I made an appointment with my doctor . You were pregnant . I was so excited . For me , for us . I rushed to Blue Cove to tell you . When I got to the Center , I was stopped . By whom ? By a man that I 've never even seen before . I don 't know how . But somehow he knew about our child . He gave me a choice , Sydney . The Center would relocate me , set up a substantial trust fund for Nicholas if ¡ ­ I promise never to see you , speak with you again . And if you refused ? He said you would be in a terrible accident . He said the Center couldn 't take a chance that you 're becoming distracted . compromising your objectivity towards the pretender project . Sydney , I was afraid . After I left and Nicholas was born . I met someone . And got married . He raised our child as his own . We chose never to tell him the truth . We can tell him now . At what cost ? He is such a bright , splendid young man with a great future . He is going to be a teacher like you . And he is going to be back in any minute now . I have to go . I hope you understand , Sydney . At least this time , we can say goodbye . Sydney . The inscription on the watch , I meant it . Forever . I found this in a box full of case files . Vladimir Petrovka . - He was arrested two years ago by ¡ ­ - Stevens , Cook and Mooney ? That 's when Petrovka began his relationship with the Turbo Squad . This is before Daniel joined the team . Petrovka got off on a technicality . Now Stevens and the others get paid to tip the Petrovka off about raids . Their father found out and confronted them . That must the fight the boys overheard . He was going to turn them in . So they killed him . It 's not over , Liz . Not yet . Going somewhere ? I saw the birth certificate , Sydney . Michelle said the Center threatened to have me killed if I ever found out about my son . She was told to leave . They stole my life , Parker . Just like they stole Jarod 's . - And Angelo 's and ¡ ­ - Mine ? If you leave now , then you 'll never find out who did this . You 're not really gonna leave , are you , Sydney ? Apparently not . If you knew about the birth certificate , why didn 't you confront me ? Everyone deserves a life . Even you . So what the hell couldn 't you hit the 45 ? Get out of here . I don 't want you to talk about my target . - I was talking about your target . - Oh , no , man . I was talking about your 45 , too . Alright , we 'll meet at technical region in the morning . - We 'll just have to prove it . - Yeah .

Mooney , cover our flank . Yes , sir . - I don 't like this . - Neither do I. Let 's go . Ready ? Go . Jarod , this is Stevens . Respond . Respond , damn it . That 's an order ! - Where did he go ? - I 'll take care of him later . Keep your eyes open . Move on . Hold your fire . It 's a damn target . What is this ? He is not going down . I am shooting straight at him Blanks . They are blanks . Somebody switched the armor . Who the hell are you ? You know me . I am the man each of you created . The shooter in a baseball cap with a goatee . The man you made up to cover for the murder of Dan Lang . What are you talking about ? Lieutenant Lange found about your little pay offs from Petrovka . When he confronted you , you killed him with armor piercing shells . Cop killers . It just so happens , I brought some with me tonight . - Stop . - You set up Lang , didn 't you ? - It was Stevens idea . - Shut up , Mooney . You left two boys without a father , for what ? For money ? Better hope you don 't miss . We 'll blow you away just like we did to Lang . Did you get all that , Liz ? Every last word . You got the switch ... this one , didn 't you ? What are you gonna do , Jarod ? Shoot me ? If I go , you go . It is over , Stevens . He , he is right . It 's gonna enough killing , Stevens . - I 'm glad they finally got the hold of Dan 's parents . - Yeah . They 'll take the boys back to Seattle . They seem like very nice people . Jordan and Cody are going to miss you . The Lang said I can visit anytime I want it . I just wish they are living closer . Got a lot of ... tell them about their father . You could always move there . And do what ? It 's not like they need another dispatcher in Seattle . Oh , it 's funny you should mention that . Because I put a call into the Seattle PD , and just so happen they 're looking for a good person to fill a recently vacated switchboard position . So if you want the job , starting in two weeks . Thank you . Oh , no . Thank you . For what ? Making sure those kids knew that someone cares about them . - Are you here going home ? - Grandpa and grandma have a farm . With real horses . Real horses , wow . Listen ¡ ­ - Will you make me a promise ? - What ? No matter how busy you are , how crazy your life is getting in the future , always remember , that your dad loved you very much . You promise ? Promise . Promise . Where is Syd ? I haven 't seen him all the morning . He said he had something important to do at Albany . Hey , look , Miss Parker . Don 't . Back off . Hey , look . It 's chia me . Little less hair than I am used to . Well , like I said before , you never look better . Nice job . See you next time , okay ? Erica , I was gonna talk to you about the ... principles . I think you essays could be a little bit more in depth . Maybe you could look at the third chapter , okay ? There is no job more important than teaching . That 's what they keep telling me . Enjoy your life . It passes so quickly . I 'm sorry . Do I know you from somewhere ? I am afraid you don 't . This is Sydney . Did you find your son ? Yes , I did . Did you remember a long time ago , I asked you if a family would ever want me ? I do . I thought it took blood to bond people . But I 've learned it also takes something else . It takes love .

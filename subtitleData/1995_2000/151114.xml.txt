 Executive Producer Hiroshi Kobayashi Screenplay By Shozin Fukui Directed by Shozin Fukui Your management has gotten sloppy . I 'm sorry . The development work is taking all of my attention now . Save your excuses Motomiya . Tell me about Hitotsubashi 's progress . You owe me the monthly report . The Digital Direct Drive and the unit eat up all of our time . We haven 't had to much time for a report on D.D.D. This is not an approved project . I 've warned you twice now Continue and I 'll be forced to scrap your budget . Wait a minute Mr. Tanizaki . Forget D.D.D. We 're making great progress using ether . Shut up Shimika . Only applying D.D.D. And ether together will produce results . Are the side effects of ether under control Shimika ? Not completely . But if you give us a few more test subjects ... Isn 't that Motomiya 's task ? I 'm getting him all the guinea pigs I can find . But I 'm running out very soon . You wear them out too quickly . Only high doses have any effect . Normal people show no reaction . They must have a certain talent . Are you ordering me to find them ? What sort of talent ? To develop their power . But D.D.D. And ether are what enhances their power . Enough ! Your quarrels bore me . Next time we will show you results . Ether is the key ... Good morning . It 's me Kiku . I 've been delayed by some business . You 're so cute . Yes , I have to get my passport . I also finished yesterday 's account . Yes , we will meet at Ikebukuro 's . Okay ... goodbye . Wrapping the body cuts off the skin perspiration causing low oxygen supply and reduced brain function . This induces an ideal REM state . A noise emitted from a giant speaker accelerates the brain while the Digital Direct Drive mounted on his head shows a fixation of the eye movement . It 's not at all like an acid trip . - Combining the Unit with sound is the ideal brain destroyer . But fundamentally different from the effect of ether . So what do you suggest ? - It 's psychic Hitotsubashi . Not very specific are you . Akari . - It 's ready Hitotsubashi . Have you done it again ? - I had to . To make him behave . Don 't excite him before testing . How often must I tell you . - They 're not toys . Look . He 's terrific . - I 'm excited myself . You never learn . - He got mad at me again . Never mind . The effects of my tape easily outstrips his anxiety . He stinks . Look at the puss oozing out of him . We 'll probably catch some kind of disease . They 're hard enough to procure . Stir it thoroughly . Wow , heavy . Do we really need to inject so much of the drug . It mixes the ether and the sedative varying the ether concentration . Let 's start . Here comes the ether . You injected to much ! He bloody exploded you fool ! Where will we get a new subject ? Shut up ! You only have yourself to blame . I told you it was heavy . Do you like it ? Impressive . - How did you get it ? It wasn 't easy . - I 'm sure it wasn 't . Cost me a fortune too . You must keep it a secret . Film gives it such a real feeling . I 'll make you a telecine copy . Great ! I have nothing like it in my collection . Superb isn 't it ? - How did you do it ? By injecting a sedative each day . The body builds up resistance and the effect of the drug wears off . He went totally berserk . I 'm done or if my medical superiors find out ... I took a chance using ether . I 've never seen a man blow his mind before . You 're so brutal sometimes Motomiya . That 's why I succeeded . - Where was this ? Before I was using medical staff . It was pointless to stay there . We 're really a long way from finding ether 's full potential . What about Shimiko ? You plan to steal his research ? This is a sponsored project . The sponsor likes Shimika . To begin with ; ether is psychic research . Let 's increase the concentration we 're giving him . You mean Shimika ? Does he know ? Just his sense of the past has vanished ! Awesome stuff ! Just one week till your wedding . - I didn 't expect it so soon . I wanted to work a bit more . You couldn 't keep him waiting much longer . I 've trained my successor . - Thank you . Please go to the Centre to settle the accounts . The management is sloppy so half a day will do . Yesterday it was decided to terminate the current project . Tell them to vacate the Centre this week . Doesn 't Shimika deserve better ? That 's no longer your business . It 's been decided by HQ . Excuse me . Let me know when you 're done . I 'll pick you up . Thank you for coming . Is the data ready ? - No ... not everything . I only have half a day . - That 's tough . I hear your getting married . Congratulations . Will you be quitting your position ? Yes , this is my last job so I hope to finish it smoothly . Naturally . HQ will terminate the project after the accounts are settled . You must vacate this week . - Wait a minute . The D.D.D. Is almost finished . Allow us a final meeting . - My job is only to inform you . I cannot arrange an appointment . What about the ether ? Give us a subject to show them ! - Impossible . Hold it ! Not so fast ! Your own incompetence put you into this mess ! This is a fine mess you got us into . This will ruin my reputation . - You supplied inferior subjects . And your silly D.D.D. Research . - What the fuck is D.D.D. Anyway ? It 's got a lot better ring to it then your ether . Ether smacks of alchemy . - Exactly . Listen here Shimika . You do nothing but argue . I designed the Unit and continued to work on the sound loop for torturing . This was my ether project ! Without me you wouldn 't be here ! That 's over as of now Shimika . What ? ! Just the side effects Shimika . Remember , you blew your brains out ? You 've turned into a downright ether junkie ! From now on , we claim the ether research results . You 're done punk . Motomiya ! My body itches . It 's itching so much , I can 't stop scratching . Bugs ... bugs ? There 's bugs all over ! One ... no two ... I get it . There 's millions ... no billions . There they are ... and there ! I 'm itching all over . Even the air is full of bugs ! I can 't breathe . It 's so cold ... How 's Shimiko ? - He 's immune to the sedative . So we must give him more ether . We should fix the books first . Most of the money went to the D.D.D. We must get results before we leave . The project isn 't over yet . The new sound . Gimme a shot ! More ... more ! Hello . It 's taking longer then expected . Thanks . No picture after all . Did my passport picture look a little odd ? Okay , I understand . I 'll ring you when I 'm finally there . Bye . It feels so good . Gimme another shot . Gross . Torture gets him high as a kite . Rectal absorption works faster . Anybody here ? What 's going on ? Let me go ! In the end torture sways the results . The high-tech is only marginal . Better stick to low-tech stuff . Although ether is powerful . Sound blows away the brain . The sound of rubber on rubber saturates the whole place . Though the sounds is superb , it left an indefinable melancholy . That psychic power it must have been caused ... by the Rubber Unit . It has to be developed further . The trapezius . The deltoid . The triceps . The biceps . The greater pectoral . The rectus abdominus . You 're weird Motomiya . Why is Hitotsubashi doing ether ? He thinks it makes you psychic . I first developed psychic power . I am psychic . You 're the muscle monster . Do you like Hitotsubashi ? Yes ... but he likes you . Hello . Your name ? - Kiku . What is this place ? Why am I going through this ? I 'm to be married soon . I only came to do my job . This whole thing is crazy ! I can 't stand it anymore ! Let me out ! Stop this nonsense ! Shimika ... We 'll escape together . You won 't get away that easy . The side effects have started . Stay away ! I 'll suck your brains out and fuck your empty head . Shimika ! He 's experiencing the big shut eye now . Fuck off ! Love , love , love , love ... I 'm injecting him with the usual mix but Shimika 's strong . He comes round faster each time . - The side effects have started . Don 't nag about trivialities . He 's only addicted to the drug . Trivialities get out of control . How about the sponsor ? As long as we keep Kiku hostage they can 't throw us out . And I just finished this new Unit and time 's running out . - That 's why I 'm in a hurry . We 'll blow Kiku 's brains out too . If we have proof of psychic powers we 're home free . - And then what ? I don 't have a clue . Still ... let 's blow her brains out first . You 'll never get away with this . The sponsor will never allow it . Stop right now ! - Shut up you bitch ! I hate you bitchy girls . - You stinking bastard . What ? - Stop it ! You 're hurting me ! Akari ! Tie her up right now ! Shut up or you 'll wake Shimika ! Everything 's running nicely ! Shut it off ! That 's too high . - So what ? I hate that bitches guts ! You 're out of bounds . - I don 't give a shit . Don 't interfere with my work . The eyeballs have fixated ! Let 's begin . Look ... they started moving again . Mental activity can 't restart that fast . The equipment must be broken . Not with this high grade LCD . Stop blaming me ! Everything you touch falls apart or starts malfunctioning ! What 's happening ? ! The sound has reversed ! Motomiya ! Don 't go near Shimika ! Why won 't it switch off ? It 's the wiring of the Unit . Shimika ... Shimika ... Shimika ... Fuck ! It 's blowing my mind Shimika ! Rectal injection for instant effect . The Unit was wasted on you . You tried to steal my research ! You fucking bitch ! Motomiya ! You 're going to kill him Shimika ! Motomiya ! So he had some psychic power after all . Moto ... I didn 't know you were a team . What right do you have to take what 's dear to me ! Watch what you say ? Your power is just an accident . What 's that ? - I know why . And there 's more kill me if you dare ! The Unit I made is what gave you this power ! You 'll get what you asked for ! You 're a slave to ether ! Gimme ether ! It 's the side effects . How do you like it ? Can you stand the dizziness ? You want ether ? It 's a legitimate killing with your100 % pure ether . Akari ! It 's been a long time since I 've had good grub . Shimika ! ... Shimika ! ... Shimika ! ... This is crazy ! I 'm sure that was 100 % pure ether . It was enough to blow him away . Where 's the film ? What 's happening ? Shimika ! You 've got to see this ! Maybe you forgot after blowing your mind ! Stop hiding and watch . This is what blew you away ! This is your ultimate masterpiece Shimika ! Dynamite Drug Diamond . What 's this about a masterpiece ? Just watch ... watch ! - I only see your pathetic face . Without the Unit you shouldn 't have any power ! Come out Shimika ! Stop it . Her body is my catalyst . I 'll show you our alliance of faith . The genesis of kings and queens . I 've gotten rid of Hilo Subashi , Motomiya and Akari . But no sign of Shimika and Kiku . They have the ether and the Unit . We must find them . I 'm not sure . But if Shimika 's memory returns , we 're in big trouble . Yes , I fully understand . I 'll continue my search . I must find them . If that film comes out into the open , I 'm done for . My eyes ! They started spinning ! Kiku , I can 't stand it . Gimme the stuff to make me feel good ! You had to much . It 's killing you . - Give it to me ! If that 's what you want ... freak ! The Unit ... quick ... I 'll buy some groceries . You can 't survive on ether alone . Kiku ! Born in 1969 by a caesarean and kept alive in an incubator where mind first gained control over my body and my rejected existence turned to the world of medicine ! I stumbled upon a chemical wizard who soothed my nerves ! Awakened to the mind blowing thrill , I overcame hatred for the flesh . Blowing , exploding eyeballs fixating ! Now and hereafter are alike . That 's all there is to say ! Stop it ! - I can 't control the power ! Restrain yourself ! Shimika ! Shimika ... Shimika ... Shimika ... Shimika ! Don 't abandon me . I can 't stand it . It 's not fair . All arrows point to Tanizaki . An eye for an eye .

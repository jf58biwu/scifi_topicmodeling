TELL ME WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT . HE ... HAS ... COME BACK . WHO HAS COME BACK ? COME BACK FOR WHAT ? FOR GENERATIONS WE 'VE BEEN TRYING TO FORGET WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE REMEBERED ... PREPARED ... PRAYED . OH , GOD , PLEASE . IT ALL BEGAN OVER 100 YEARS AGO WHEN THE GOODMANS FOUNDED THIS TOWN . THEY CAME WEST LOOKING FOR A BETTER LIFE , AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED HERE , THEY FOUND MORE HARDSHIP . DROUGHT ... FROST ... PESTILENCE ... THE GROUND WAS HARD , SOIL VOID OF NUTRIMENTS . PEOPLE WERE STARVING . OLD ... OLD SILAS GOODMAN WAS THEIR SPIRITUAL LEADER . THE PEOPLE CAME TO HIM AND ASKED FOR HIS HELP , BUT THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO . AND THEN THIS STRANGER CAME . HE WAS A MAN OF MAGIC ... A MAN OF EVIL . IN HANFORD HE SAW A LAND OF OPPORTUNITY . HE CAME TO SILAS AND OFFERED HIM A SOLUTION , A BARGAIN . HE WOULD MAKE THE EARTH FERTILE , THE WELLS RUN RICH , THE WEATHER TEMPERATE , THE CROPS GROW BOUNTIFUL . THE PRICE WAS SIMPLE . IN THIS TOWN , THE WARLOCK WOULD HAVE COMPLETE FREEDOM , FREEDOM FROM PERSECUTION , FREEDOM TO DO AS HE LIKED . FREEDOM . AT FIRST ALL WENT WELL . THE TOWN PROSPERED . AND THE WARLOCK 'S PRESENCE SEEMED HARMLESS , BUT SILAS GOODMAN WAS A GOD-FEARING MAN . HE KNEW HE HAD MADE A PACT WITH THE DEVIL ... A DEVIL HE COULD NOT CONTROL . THE WARLOCK WAS A HEDONIST OF THE FIRST ORDER . HE TOOK OVER THE TOWN , NOT BY FORCE BUT BY PLEASURE . HE LURED THE YOUNG GIRLS INTO WITCHES ' SABBATHS , WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE NOTHING WILD ORGIES . HE EVEN SEDUCED SILAS ' OWN DAUGHTER . SILAS DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO STOP THIS ... NO MATTER THE PRICE ... AND STOLE HIS BOOK OF MAGIC SPELLS ... AND TURNED HIS OWN MAGIC AGAINST HIM . ONE NIGHT SILAS DRUGGED THE WARLOCK . AT DAWN SILAS AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE DRAGGED THE DEMON OUT TO THE FIELD . THEY 'D CUT A STONE SLAB THAT WOULD SEAL HIS TOMB . THEY CHOPPED A PATH DEEP INTO THE CORN . WHEN THE WARLOCK REALIZED WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN , HE STARTED TO SCREAM AND THREATEN ... EVEN AS THEY LASHED HIM TO THE CROSS , AND CRUCIFIED HIM . IT TOOK THE WARLOCK TWO SCREAMING DAYS TO FINALLY DIE . OUR PEOPLE BURNED THE BODY , PUT HIS CHARRED BONES INTO THE SPECIAL CASKET , BURYING THEM DEEP INTO THE GROUND . AS LONG AS THE BONES REMAINED UNDISTURBED , THE PEOPLE OF HANFORD WOULD BE ASSURED RICH HARVEST FOR ALL TIME . EACH GENERATION WOULD ERECT A SCARECROW AS A REMINDER . OUR ANCESTORS THOUGHT THIS TOMB WAS SEALED FOREVER , BUT NOW SOMEHOW THE WARLOCK 'S SPIRIT HAS ESCAPED , AS IF WE 'D BROUGHT THE EVIL ON OURSELVES . SO HOW DO WE STOP IT ? THE SECRET IS IN HIS BOOK OF SPELLS . IT WAS GIVEN TO YOUR FATHER AS FIRST-BORN OF OUR GENERATION . WHAT HE 'S DONE WITH IT , I DON 'T NOW . THE SPELL THAT WOULD DESTROY THE WARLOCK IS IN THAT BOOK . OK , DILLON , YOU BETTER GET HIM HOME . I 'M GOING TO MY FATHER 'S AND FIND THE BOOK I 'LL GET YOUR UNCLE HOME , AND YOU BE CAREFUL . THADDEUS , TELL ME . WHAT 'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF HE FINDS THE BOOK ? HE CAN REUNITE HIS SPIRIT WITH FLESH . HE WILL BECOME HUMAN AGAIN . IF THAT HAPPENS , NO ONE ... NO ONE CAN STOP HIS POWER . NO ONE . JESUS ! WHERE 'S MY BOOK ? NO ! WHERE IS MY BOOK ? GO FUCK YOURSELF . I WANT YOU TO SYMPATHIZE WITH ME . I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO BE ME . NO . YOU MOTHERFUCKER ! THADDEUS ? THADDEUS , IS THAT YOU ?

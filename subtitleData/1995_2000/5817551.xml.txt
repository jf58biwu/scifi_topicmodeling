 Come , come on ! Please ! Please ! Please ! Aziz . Aziz . Aziz , light ! Aziz , light . Good . We start again . " When the three planets are in eclipse , the black hole , like a door , is open . Evil comes ... spreading terror and chaos . " See the snake , Billy ? The ultimate evil . - Make sure you get the snake . - Yes , I 've got your snakes . I got all the snakes . So when is the snake act supposed to occur ? Well , if this is the five ... and this is the one ... Every 5000 years . So I 've got some time , then . You bring them water . Good boy . I will take it to them . Go with God . Be safe from evil . You see here these different peoples , or symbols of people ... gathering together the four elements of life : water , fire , earth , air ... around a fifth one . A fifth ... element . Forgive me , lord . They already know too much . Father . How are you today ? - Well , billy , well . You have some glasses ? - Of course . Father , I 'm so glad to see you . It 's the most extraordinary thing . I mean , look . It 's the greatest find in history . You must be parched . Oh , yes , yes . I 'm sorry . It 's like a battle plan . Here , the good . Here , the evil . And here , a weapon against evil . I 'm going to be famous . Then ... then let us ... Let us toast to your fame . To fame . Salute . You can 't drink a toast with water . Billy , in my sack , the grappa . This I don 't understand . This could be something ... prehistoric . I don 't know . But wait . Here . Look , look . They 're here . This man ... this perfect being . I know this is the key . I know it . This divine light they talk about . What is divine light ? Aziz , light ! Much better . Thank you Aziz . My lord . Father , this is the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen . Don 't you think ... ? Are you German ? Lord , I know he was about to discover everything . But there is no worry . I was there in time . Priest , you and those before you ... have served us well . But war is coming . Stones not safe on Earth anymore . This ... is really amazing . The fifth element . Take the stones . My lord ... if you take the weapon , we 'll be defenceless when evil returns . In 300 years , when evil returns ... so shall we . Oh , professor . Professor . Don 't move ! I have a gun ! Please , understand . They are our friends . Friends ? Father , they 've killed the professor ! They 're monsters ! I 'll explain everything . - You 're with them ? - Look at me . Look , I am your friend . - No , Father . - Billy , look at me ! Please , put the gun down . No ! Billy , no ! Hurry ! The wall is closing ! Here is your mission now : Pass your knowledge to the next priest as it was passed on to you . I will do as you command , but please , hurry , you still have time . Time not important . Only life important . I will fulfil my mission ! You can count on me ! I will pass the knowledge until your return . - Anything yet ? - No , sir . - Not even a temperature ? - The thermo-analysers have jammed . One shows a million degrees , the others minus 5000 . Let 's see it . It 's taking shape . Send out a probe . Ladies and gentlemen , the president of the Federated Territories . On air with General Staedert in 30 seconds . I saved this seat for you , Father . President on the line . We 're in position , Mr. President . I 'll have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes . Just the facts , General . There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as yet . All the calibres are overshot . We 're initiating thermonucleatic imaging . So , what you 're saying is , you don 't know what this is . Not yet sir . All we know is , it just keeps getting bigger . Recommendation ? My philosophy , Mr. President , is shoot first and ask questions later . I don 't like uninvited guests . - All right , then , Staedert ... - Mr. President ? Priest Vito Cornelius , expert of astreophenomenon . I have a different theory to offer you , sir . You have 20 seconds . Imagine for a moment that this ... thing is not anything that can be identified ... because it prefers not to be . Wherever there is life , it brings death ... - because it is evil . Absolute evil . - One more reason to shoot first . Evil begets evil , Mr. President . Shooting will only make it stronger . Probe will attain its objective in five seconds . Growth rate is at 27 percent . Your theory is interesting , Father but we don 't have time to go into that right now . Time is of no importance , Mr. President . Only life is important . You 're right . That 's exactly what we 'll do . We 'll protect the life of 200 billion of my fellow citizens . General , you may fire when ready . Up-front loading of a 120-ZR missile . Marker lights on the objective . Its structure has just solidified on the surface . I think it 's anticipating the attack . Anticipation denotes intelligence . The most terrible intelligence imaginable , Mr. President . 120 's loaded . The ship is in combat formation . Missiles are loaded Mr. President . - Staedert . - Yes , sir . - I have a doubt . - I don 't , Mr. President . Staedert . What happened ? Staedert , can you hear me ? Staedert , what happened Staedert ? - Did you destroy it ? - I 'm about to , sir . The planet has increased in diameter by 200 percent . It 's moving towards the ship . What do we have that 's bigger than 240 ? Nothing , sir . Staedert , do you hear me ? Get out of there . I don 't want an incident . Do you hear me , Staedert ? Get out of there . Can you hear me , Staedert ? Do you understand ? Listen . This is the president . That 's an order . Do you understand me ? Do you hear me ? Get out of there ! Good God ! Four a day . I 'm trying . To quit is my goal . I 'm up . All right , I 'm up . God . Hey , dog brain , Finger here . - Hi , sweetie . - I love you too , Major . You haven 't called me that since basic training . - I was talking to the cat . - Oh , yeah , I forgot ... you prefer your cat to the real thing . At least the cat comes back . You still pining for that two-timing slut ? Forget about her man . There 's millions of them out there . I don 't want a million women . I just want one . The perfect one . - It don 't exist , major . - Yeah , I know . - What ? - I just found a picture of you . - How do I look ? - Like shit . Must be an old picture . Listen , bring me your hack for a six-month overhaul . - Negative . - ASAP . I don 't need one . Who sat next to you for 1000 missions ? I know how you drive . Finger , I drive a cab now , not a space fighter . Okay , so tell me . How many points you got left on your license ? Major , how many points ? At least 50 . You know what ? You gotta learn to lie better . See you tonight . Welcome to paradise . Welcome to Fhloston Paradise . This is Ruby Rhod , your main man , and I 'll tell you live at 5 ... the name of the winner of the super-green Gemini Croquette Contest ! The winner will go with me for two days to Fhloston Paradise . So tune in to Radio Cosmos . Don 't watch all day , sweetie . It 'll rot your brain . For a perfect world . - Give me the cash . - Been here long ? Yeah , long enough . Come on , give me the cash . Is that a Z-140 ? Alleviated titanium . Neurocharged assault model . Good thing for me it 's not loaded . - What do you mean , it 's not loaded ? - You have to ... push that little yellow button to load it . Take your time . You want me to ... ? There you go . Give me the cash ! That 's a very dangerous gun . Maybe you better let me hang on to this one for you . You don 't mind , do you ? You sure ? No . Take it . I don 't need it . That 's a very nice hat . You like it ? God ! Please enter your license . Yes , yes , just a minute . Welcome on board , Mr. Dallas . Good morning . Sleep well ? Me too . - I had a horrible nightmare . - Propulsion 2-X-4 . You have five points left on your license . Yeah , thank you for reminding me . Have a nice day . Why not ? You have 48 hours . That 's the length of time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions . - And then ? - Then it will be too late . The goal of this thing is not to fight over money or power ... but to exterminate life . All forms of life . So what you 're telling me , Father , there 's nothing that can stop this . There is only one thing . The Mondoshawan have in their possession the only weapon to defeat evil . Four elements ... gathered around a fifth ... supreme being , the ultimate warrior , created to protect life . Together they produce what the ancients called the Light of Creation . Able to bring life to the farthest reaches of the universe . But if evil stands there ... Then what ? Then light turns to dark . Life to death ... forever . Sir , there 's a Mondoshawan spaceship at the frontier requesting permission to enter our territory . Give it permission to enter our territory with our warmest regards . Thank you . Permission to enter granted . Showtime . We are lost . Aknot , we are connected to Earth . Mr. Zorg 's office . It 's Aknot . I 'm so glad to hear you , Aknot . The mission is accomplished . You 'll have what you asked for in a few hours . Good . I 'll meet you at my factory . The attack was launched by two unregistered warships . Close all borders and declare a state of general alert . Try to make contact the Mondoshawans . We owe them an explanation . Three hundred years of waiting , for nothing . Father , you should go home now , get some rest . No . The Mondoshawan ... I am their contact on Earth . They will come for me . Father , this is government business now . I 'll keep you informed . The rescue team has reported from the Mondoshawan crash site . Any survivors ? Only one . Is that what you call a survivor ? A few cells still alive . It 's more than I need . - Have you at least identified it ? - We tried , but the computer went off the charts . You see , normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groups ... which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself . This has 200,000 memo groups . - Sounds like a freak of nature to me . - Yeah , can 't wait to meet him . You okay , General ? Over here . Excuse me . Okay General , I want to show you something here . This is a normal human DNA chain , okay ? You , me , anybody , right ? Watch this . The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours . There 's simply more of them , tightly packed with infinite genetic knowledge . Almost like this being was engineered . - Is there any danger ? - No . We put it through the cellular hygiene detector . The cell is , for lack of a better word ... perfect . Okay , go ahead . Mr. Perfect better be polite . Otherwise , I turn him into cat food . Activate it . Tissue processing . Ten seconds to ultraviolet protection . This is the last phase . The cells are bombarded by slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body to react to protect itself . That means growing skin . Wonderful . Reconstruction complete . Remove the shield . I told you . Perfect . Thermal bandages . I 'd like to take a few pictures ... for the archives . - What 's she saying ? - Don 't know . Activate the phonic detector . Is that thing solid ? - Unbreakable . - Good . If you want out ... you 're going to have to learn to develop those communication skills . General alert . Perfect . Ladder on 18 . Two men with me . The rest in the main ventilation . Okay sir . This way . Okay lady , stay calm . This is the police . There 's nowhere else to go . So you 're gonna slowly turn around and put your hands on the floor . Do you understand me ? She doesn 't . I think we need a flying unit here . This is the police . This is the police . We are processing your identification . Please put your arms up and follow our instructions . She has no file . She dove off . You just had an accident . Yes , I know I just had an accident , you daffy bastard ! You have one point left on your license . Look out ! No , no ! Left ! I can 't believe it . Shit . Any survivors ? Hi . Are you okay ? Boom . Boom . Yeah , I understand " boom " . Bada boom . Big . Big bada boom . Big ... bada big boom . Big boom . - Yeah , big bada boom . - Bada boom . Big boom . Big bada boom . You 're lucky you 're not dead . This is a police control . Please keep your hands on the wheel . You have an unauthorized passenger in your vehicle . We are going to arrest her . Thank you for your cooperation . Sorry , honey . Looks like this is your ride . Open the door . Better do what they say . Sorry . " Please ... - " help . " - I 've only got one point left on my license and I need that to get back to the garage and get the cab a six-month overhaul . You understand ? Can you please open the passenger door ? Please ... help . I can 't . I repeat ... can you please open your passenger door . Yeah , yeah , sure . Why not ? Thank you for your cooperation . Help . Finger 's gonna kill me . Emergency ! Emergency ! One point has been removed from ... Yes , I know ! This is so stupid . All units assist in pursuit of yellow cab , level 2 . Unit 47 , we 're on the way ... as soon as we finish lunch . Two golden menus . Thank you . I 'm too old , too tired and too hungry to go chasing some hot rod . Thank you so much . And I 'm definitely too thirsty . Look out ! We got lucky . If they don 't chase you after a mile , they don 't chase you . Maybe it 's two miles . Hang on . Look , lady , I only speak two languages : English and bad English ! Run an ID . Don 't get me wrong . I 'm all for conversation , but maybe you can just shut up for a minute ! - I got nothing . He 's got a scan blocker . - Means he 's a car thief . Blast him . I don 't know what you did to piss these guys off ... but they are really pissed off ! Hold on ! Okay , we 're safe for a while . You want to play it soft ? I 'll play it soft . You want to play it hard ? Let 's play it hard . If we make it to the fog , we 'll be all right . If we make the fog . How do they expect us to find anything in this shit ? We 're just going to wait here for a little while until things quiet down , if you don 't mind . Hey ! Shit . You okay ? Priest . You don 't need a priest , you just need a doctor . You 'll be alright . - Vito Cornelius . - What ? Priest . Yes ? I 'm looking for a priest . The weddings are one floor down , my son . Congratulations . She 's not my bride . She 's my fare . She 's looking for a priest named Vito Cornelius . The phone book said he lived here . Yes , that 's me , but I don 't know who she is . Nobody does who she is . No file , no ID , nothing . She 's got a tattoo on this arm here . Ta ... Tattoo ? F-Fifth ... element . Finger 's gonna kill me . - Hey ! Wake up ! - Who are you ? I brought the girl , remember ? The redhead . She just dropped in on me . Started speaking this bizarre language . It 's not bizarre . It 's the divine language . The ancient language ... It 's spoken throughout the universe before time was time . - He 's a she . - You noticed that . Yes . - It 's a miracle . - Miracle she 's not dead . Yeah , we 've not a moment to lose . Wake her up . But gently , because this woman is mankind 's most precious possession . She is perfect . Perfect . More dignified . Hey , lady ... wake up . You 're right , you 're right . I shouldn 't have done that . I shouldn 't have done that . I was wrong to kiss you . He said to wake you gently . You 're right . Just thought you might remember me from the cab . Remember ? " Bada boom " ? - " Big bada boom " ? - Boom ? Boom . Big bada boom . In the cab . Here , look . I drive a cab . This is me . Korben Dallas . Korben . You understand ? Here . Take it , go ahead . You can call me when you learn how to English . Just kidding . Kidding . You ... What is your name ? You . Korben . Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat . Good . That whole thing 's your name ? Do you have ... a shorter name ? Short . Korben Dallas . Leeloo . Korben , Leeloo . Leeloo , Korben . - You 're sure she 's a supreme being ? - Absolutely sure . Old friends . Yeah , you 're right . Listen , do you think you could ask if I get the gun back , please ? . - What 's your name ? - Korben Dallas . Thank you Mr. Dallas for all your help . Thank you so much . You 've been so kind , but now the girl needs some rest . Because she 's been on a long trip . Yes , I know . I was there when she landed . Wait , wait , Father . She said something I didn 't understand . I didn 't understand any of it . - What does " ekto gamat " mean ? - " Never without my permission . " That 's what I thought . I shouldn 't have kissed her . Oh , no . I 'm so sorry . I forgot your food . How about some nice Thai food to apologize ? Yeah , yeah , hold on . What ? Buddy , I 'm waiting all day here . - Finger . - Where is the cab ? - Car 's running fine . Purring like a kitten . - Fine . What " fine " ? I know you , Dallas . " Fine " ain 't in your vocabulary . If you mind , you can tell your old buddy Finger what happened . What ? You save the planet ? You dinged the fender again . That 's it , right ? You dinged the goddamn fender . Finger , I was on my way over to see you , and a big fare fell in my lap . You know , one of these really big fares you just can 't resist . How big ? Five-nine ... blue eyes ... long legs , great skin . You know . Perfect . I see . And this perfect fare , she got a name ? Yeah . Leeloo . What 's she doing ? Learning our history , the last 5000 years that she 's missed . She 's been asleep for quite a while , you know . Father , I know she 's been through a lot , but we don 't have much time . Yes , you 're right . Chicken . Good . Chicken . I 'm really sorry to interrupt you , but ... the case ... with the stones ... where is it ? Stolen ? Who in God 's name would do such a thing ? Excuse me , sir . The council is worried about the economy heating up . They wondered if it 'd be possible to fire 500,000 ? I thought maybe from one of the smaller companies , where noone would notice . Like one of the cab companies ? Fire one million . But 500,000 ... One million . Fine , sir . Sorry to have disturbed you . It 's ... It 's for the Supreme ... Oh sorry . I didn 't know your size , and I found you this make-up box . You just put it like that . Yes , there was a man with a limp ... came here about a month ago asking about the stones . He said he was an art dealer . What was his name ? I 'm so bad with names . - They really make her ... - Perfect , I know . What did she say ? She says she knows exactly where they are . My dear Aknot , how about those two planes you borrowed ? Aknot , is that you ? What an ugly face . It doesn 't suit you . Take it off . That 's better . Never be ashamed of who you are . You 're warriors . Be proud . So what if the federal government scattered your people to the wind . What doesn 't kill you makes you stronger . Your time for revenge is at hand . Voilà , the ZF-1 . It 's light . The handle 's adjustable for easy carrying . Good for righties and lefties . Breaks down into four parts , undetectable by x-ray . Ideal for quick , discreet interventions . A word on firepower : Titanium recharger , 3000-round clip with bursts of 3 to 300 . With the replay button , another Zorg invention , it 's even easier . One shot ... and the replay sends every following shot to the same location . And to finish the job , all the Zorg oldies but goldies . Rocket launcher . Arrow launcher with exploding or poisonous gas heads . Very practical . Our famous net launcher . The always-efficient flamethrower . My favourite . And for the grand finale , the all-new ice-cube system . Four full crates delivered right on time . And what about you , my dear Aknot ? Did you bring me what I asked you for ? Yes . Magnificent . This ... This case is empty . - What do you mean , empty ? - Empty ... the opposite of full . This case is supposed to be full ! Anyone care to explain ? The Guardians gave the stones to someone they could trust . Who took another route . She 's supposed to contact this person ... in a hotel . And she 's looking for the address . Easy . Dot . It 's Planet Fhloston , in the Angel Constellation . - We 're saved . - I 'm screwed . You asked for a case . We brought you a case . A case with four stones in it ! Not one or two or three , but four ! Four stones ! But what the hell am I supposed to do with an empty case ? We are warriors , not merchants . But you can still count ! It 's easy . Look at my fingers . Four stones , four crates . Zero stones , zero crates ! Pack everything up ! We 're out of here ! We risked our lives . I believe a little compensation is in order . So you are merchants after all . Leave him one crate for the cause . I don 't like warriors . Too narrow-minded , no subtlety ... and worse , they fight for hopeless causes , honour . Honour 's killed millions of people . Hasn 't saved a single one . I 'll tell you what I do like though : a killer . A dyed-in-the-wool killer , cold-blooded , clean , methodical and thorough . Now a real killer when he had picked up the ZF-1 ... would 've immediately asked about the red button on the bottom of the gun . Bring me the priest . I got it . Everything here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise ... - and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel . - Good work , my son . Now all we 've got to do is to find a way of getting there . It won 't be easy . There 's a big charity ball in Fhloston tomorrow . The flights are full for months , and with all the celebrities the hotel will be guarded like a fortress . But there must be a way of getting there . I 'll get it . Weddings ? Not really . - Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you . - Mister who ? Mr. Zorg . Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel ... Zorg . It 's nice to see you again , Father . Ah ! I remember you now . The so-called art dealer . I 'm glad you got your memory back , because you 're gonna need it . Where are the stones ? I don 't know . And even if I did know , I wouldn 't tell somebody like you . Why ? - What 's wrong with me ? - I try to serve life . But you only ... seem to want to destroy it . Father ... you 're so wrong . Let me explain . Life , which you so nobly serve ... comes from destruction , disorder and chaos . Now , take this empty glass . Here it is . Peaceful , serene , boring . But if it is ... destroyed ... Look at all these little things . So busy now . Notice how each one is useful . What a lovely ballet ensues , so full of form and colour . Now , think about all those people that created them . Technicians , engineers . Hundreds of people who will be able to feed their children tonight ... so those children can grow up big and strong and have children of their own ... and so on and so forth . Thus adding to the great chain ... of life . Water . Fruit . You see , Father , by creating a little destruction ... A cherry . I 'm , in fact , encouraging life . In reality , you and I are in the same business . Cheers . Where 's the robot to pat you on the back ? Or the engineer ? Or their children , maybe ? There , you see now how all your so-called power counts for nothing ? How your entire empire of destruction comes crashing down ... all because of one little cherry . You saved my life ... and in return , I 'll spare yours ... for now . You 're a monster , Zorg . I know . Torture who you have to , the president , I don 't care . Just bring me those stones . You have one hour . It 's gobbling up all the communication satellites in the galaxy . Why in the hell is it eating up all the satellites ? We 're working on it , Mr. President . I managed to contact the Mondoshawan . They deplore the incident but accept our apologies . And the stones ? Did you find their wreckage ? - The stones weren 't on board the ship . - What do you mean ? The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the human race . They gave the stones to someone they do trust . Her name is Plavalaguna . She 's a diva . She 's going to sing at a charity ball in Fhloston Paradise in a few hours . She has the stones with her . The Mondoshawans will help . All we have to do is send someone to get the stones . Excellent . I want this operation to be discreet as possible . No troops . No big operation . I want your best man to go undercover . I have the perfect one . - You got a message . - Yeah . Not gonna open it ? Could be important . Like the last two I got were important . First one was from my wife telling me she 's leaving . The second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving with my wife . That is bad luck . But grandfather say : " It never rain every day . " This is good news , guaranteed . I bet you lunch . Okay . Come on . " You are fired . " Oh , I 'm sorry . At least I won lunch . Good philosophy . See good in bad . I like . - Hello . - Korben , sweetheart . You got broken fingers ? You can 't punch my number ? - Hi , Mom . - Seventeen messages . And don 't tell me your machine is broken again . Those things are good for 1000 years . Mr. Kim , you should go . This 'll take a minute . You wouldn 't even feed your white pussycat a croquette , who you obviously love more than me . - She didn 't breast-feed you . I did . - Goodbye , Mr. Dallas . Good fortune for you . Your girl just hung up on me . Oh Christ . I 'll never be a grandmother . - It could bring you good luck ! - Yeah , sure . Korben , you know how my poor body 's failing me . You have to take me on this trip . What are you talking about ? Oh I get it . You wanna make your only mother beg , is that it ? No , I don 't want to make you beg , all I want is an explanation . Look , I just got in . I just smashed my cab . I lost my job . I got mugged . Besides that , everything 's peachy . Thanks for asking . Now , would you settle down and explain this to me calmly . Oh so you don 't know you won a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two for 10 days ? And I suppose you 're just gonna leave me on the lunar surface to freeze my ass off . If I 'd won a trip , I 'd know about it . Someone would 've notified me . Korban , they 've been blaring your name out on the radio for the last hour , you big ape . I 'll call you back . General Munro , how nice to see you in the 5000 block . Nice apartment , major . Like you 've settled into a wonderful life . Heard you lost your job . You heard that ? Don 't worry . I 'll get another job . Don 't bother . We have one for you . " Major Dallas , you 've been selected for a mission of the utmost importance . " - What mission ? - To save the world . " You leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise . " Retrieve four stones from the diva Plavalaguna and bring them back with the utmost discretion possible . " - Any questions ? - Yeah , just one . Why me ? - I retired six months ago , do you remember ? - Three reasons . One , as a member of the Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federate Army ... you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed in this mission . Two , of all the members in your unit , you 're the most highly decorated . - And he third one ? - Of all the members of your unit ... you 're the only one left alive . - You check your messages ? - No , I 've had enough good news for one day . Might be important . You 're a winner ! You 've won the annual Gemini Contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two . Here are your tickets . You rigged the contest ? Congratulations . You couldn 't think of anything a little more discreet ? Old tricks are the best tricks . Major Iceborg will accompany you as your wife . I am not going . Why not ? Excuse me , General . Who is it ? Who is it ? - My wife . - You remarried ? Yes . No . I just met this girl , but I 'm gonna marry her . I love her , but she hates the military . She knows that the military ruined my last marriage and she can 't have anything to do with it . If she sees you guys here , she 's gonna kill me . - Major ... Major ! - You gotta hide somewhere . You 've gotta help me . You just gotta hide somewhere . We 'd love to help , but I mean there 's only one door , where can we hide ? - Major , we don 't have time for this . - It 's just for one minute . You have no idea how much you 're helping me . No idea ... You have no idea . - I 'm going to be happily married . - Major ! Major ! Major ! - What ? - The three of us won 't fit in there . Sure you will . Major ! Hey ! You 're on my foot . Major ! Major ! I 'm really sorry to have to resort to these methods , Mr. Wallace ... - Dallas . - Dallas . But ... we heard about your good luck on the radio and we need your tickets for Fhloston . Is this the way priests use their paid vacations ? - We 're not gonna go on vacation . We 're on a mission . - What kind of mission ? We have to save the world , my son . - You 're gonna save the world ? - Yes ! Watch down there . Down there . This is a police control . This is not an exercise . Come on , get in . For one minute , all right ? Just stay here for one minute . I promise . - This is a police control . - Don 't touch anything . This is not an exercise . Can you please spread your legs ... and place your hands in the yellow circles . - What are you doing ? - I 'm gonna save your ass so you can save the world . Yeah , but I ... I think this is the door . There 's no name and no number . Let 's see it . Sir , are you classified as human ? Negative . I am a meat Popsicle . I found him . Mr. Korben Dallas ? Sir , can you put your hands in the yellow circles , please ? Smoke you ! Wrong answer . The police control is now terminated . Thank you for your cooperation . Have a nice day . Okay , we got the guy . Wasn 't easy , but we bagged him . - Thanks for the tip . - Glad to be of help , my friend . The guy 's just been arrested for uranium smuggling . Everything is going as planned . All I have to do now is go to the airport , take his place ... and I 'll be in Fhloston in less than four hours . Don 't come back without the stones . Korben Dallas . We got him . Perfect . Akanit , take command . Go to Fhloston and get the stones . If Zorg really wants them ... he 'll have to negotiate . Revenge is at hand . Oh , I am so sorry . I forgot about the autowash . There 's an autowash in that shower . I 'm so sorry . Autowash . Autowash , yes . Autowash , in the shower . You know , it 's funny . I 've met you twice today . Both times , you 've ended up in my arms . It 's my lucky day . L-L-Lucky day . Yeah . Did you hear something ? Cornelius . Autowash . - I 'm so sorry . - I don 't need your help . - Want a cup of coffee ? - Yes , please . Autowash . Coffee 's not really my speciality . But you must drink a lot of coffee , being a priest . I know . I know . I 'm not proud of what I did . I had no choice . I 'll take the mission . - Did you get them ? - Yeah . Good . - " Leeloo Dallas . " - " Multi-pass . " " Korben David Dallas . " Perfect . No no , I can 't possibly be your husband . I 'm too old . Now , David is ... in great shape . He 'll protect you . Now , please , go to the diva , collect the stones and meet me at the temple . Now . Yes . Okay . Final call for Fhloston Paradise . Last call for Fhloston Paradise . Hurry up .

 How long are we on this one , Q-Ball ? A little more than five days . At least it looks like San Francisco . We 've been down that road before . " Longer library hours " ? What 's that ? Tchaikovsky ? - I 'm impressed , Mr. Brown . - I know all the longhairs . If you 're gonna play the game , you 've got to appreciate the greats . Check it out . It 's Albert . Hey , look , up there . Boy : Mr. Mallory ? Excuse me . Can I get your autograph ? Uh ... - Can I have your autograph too , please ? - Sure . Make it out to Sigmund . " Sigmund . " I want to be in the academic decathlon just like you . You 're the greatest scientist in the world , Quinn . Professor Arturo , you too . My mom 's one of your biggest fans . - She is ? - She 's got all your textbooks . She has ? I 'm next ! I 'm next ! Are you guys anybody ? - I don 't know . Are we ? - I don 't know . - You guys are the greatest ! - Thank you ! Professor , I 've heard all your tapes ! Really great to see you here . - I wonder what 's going on ? - I don 't know . You 've been an inspiration to all of us ! Excuse me . What 's all this excitement about ? It 's Quinn and Maxie , lady . What ? Quinn Mallory ? Mr. " All-America , " Mr. " All-Everything " ! That 's Max Arturo with him . Where have you people been ? They 're " The Sliders . " Sliders ? Let 's get out of here . Let 's get to them . Okay , I 'll get to everyone . I have to go . I 'm sorry . We 're sorry , everybody . Please don 't go . Hell of a reception . Reminds me of the first time I played the Apollo . " Little Rembrandt and the Shandells , " back in the early ' 70s . Are you guys all right ? They act like I 'm some academic superstar . We evidently have arrived on a world where they regard intellectual achievement with the same adulation that we confer on movie stars or sports heroes . Rather sensible if you ask me . Did you hear what they were calling you ? - You 're " The Sliders . " - What ? Mr. " All-World " Quinn Mallory and Professor Arturo . You 're supposed to have slid a couple of months ago . - They actually referred to us as The Sliders ? - Yes . Guys , you know what this means ? If we 're sliders , my double 's got to have built a sliding machine . Driver , 4159 Blue Jay Way . And hurry . - Your house ? - My house . If the system 's here , we won 't have to reconfigure the timer ... we can autoset the system . We 're going home ! What if you could find brand new worlds right here on Earth , where anything is possible ? Same planet , different dimension . I found the gateway . - Is that your mom ? - I hope not . Mr. Mallory , what a surprise . I wasn 't expecting you back . Mr. Arturo ? Hello . I 'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage . Dana Bingham , with Bay Point Realty . Mr. Mallory asked me to put his house on the market . Of course it would 've sold a long time ago , if you hadn 't been asking such a big price . - Where have you two been ? - Mrs. Bingham ... ? Is my mom here ? I wouldn 't know . I haven 't been in touch with her since she was forced to move back east . Right . We haven 't moved the furniture out yet , have we ? Always testing me , aren 't you ? No , you said you wanted to preserve it for the estate sale . I wonder if you 'd excuse us , just for the moment ? Thank you . Bizarre to the point of lunacy . Bank foreclosures ? Estate sales ? How 's that possible if you 're a superstar ? Home sweet home . Hey , Quinn ! Look ... you 're on the " Weeties " box . " Breakfast of Geniuses . " If you 've got all these endorsements , how come you 're so broke ? How 's he supposed to know ? He 's not him . Maybe I 'm missing something . I don 't know . How come you 're always asking stupid questions ? Please be here . Please be here . What is all this stuff ? No way . Don 't give up hope , Mr. Mallory . It 's probably in a lab at the university . Hey , check this out . It 's like a shrine . " All-American Academic Excellence , Quinn Mallory . " " Most Valuable Player , California High School Academic Championship . " " TV Physicist of the Year " ? Hey , check this out . - " The Dream Team " ? - Let me see . It seems to me we have two options . We can either avoid all contact with this world , and thus , perhaps miss the possibility that they have the technology to get us home safely . Or ... ? We can assume the identities of our doubles . At least until we find a sliding machine . Quinn , maybe that 's the solution . You could just be this Quinn . We can poke around . I 'm sure we can find the equipment in no time . If we find a machine , could you fix it so it takes us back home ? It 's the best chance we 've had since we started . Well , Mr. Mallory , it 's up to you . - I can 't believe it . - It 's Quinn . - And Professor Arturo . - They 're back ! Professor Arturo . You 're back from your slide . And Quinn Mallory ! I 'm surprised your return wasn 't on the news . We 're trying to avoid publicity at the moment . There are still kinks in the prototype that we have to iron out . I thought I 'd check in with the office . But , your office is back there . No , that 's the chairman 's office . You 're still the chairman . Professor Wertz wouldn 't dare try to move in while you were on sabbatical . Oh , I don 't suppose he would . So good to see you , my dear fellow . - You 'll have to excuse us now . - Sure . Hi . Professor Arturo , welcome back . - How was the slide ? - A rousing success . Everyone 's been wondering about you . Oh , how nice . Excuse me . Here , I 'll get it . Wow . Yes , well ... I do have excellent taste . Don 't get too attached to it . We leave in five days . If we 're lucky , less . Maybe there 's information about a lab in these files . I 'll check these . It feels weird going through some stranger 's stuff . - Ah-ha . - Anything ? Yes . A phone bill with my home address and phone number . Try it . Maybe it 's current . Hello ? Oh , hello ... is this Maximillian Arturo 's residence ? Max , is that you ? - Why 'd you hang up ? - There 's a woman in my house . Well , maybe she knows something . - Hello ? - So ... you are back . Let 's get out of here ! Excuse me ... Mr. Mallory , the word is out all over campus . They want you down at practice . Practice ? Yes , practice . Coach : This is a mindgame . Being smart isn 't enough . You have to be fast , focused . Name the four nucleotides that comprise DNA ! Adenine , cytosine , thymine , guanine ! Name the five major geological eras . Archean , Proterozoic , Paleozoic , Mesozoic , Cenozoic ! Elementary particles ... Wilson ? Hadrons ... leptons ... Coach : Wilson , what 's the matter with you ? It 's Mallory . Mallory ! You son of a bitch ! I bend the rules for you till they look like a pretzel , then you desert me for one of your experiments . You 're a sight for sore eyes . Thank God you 're here , kid . Take five , boys , while I chat with your captain . Let 's talk . You can catch your teammates later . What 's the matter , Wilson ? Disappointed ? Hey , " superstar . " How 's it going , man ? How 's it feel to be back , Quinn ? Great ... is this my locker ? It 's right where it ought to be . I got to hand it to you , Quinn . Anybody who pulls a vanishing act for half the season , and shows up in time for finals , the coach would have his head for lunch . The coach smells a championship . Hey , Wilson , looks like you 're on the bench , pal . Knock it off . Wilson subbed for you while you were gone . Hello , it 's Wilson . Let me speak to him . I don 't care what he 's doing . Tell him it 's important . Joey , guess who didn 't take your threat seriously ? Quinn Mallory . Look , do us both a favor ... take care of the problem . Unbelievable . Could you turn that down , please ? I 'm trying to concentrate . Oh , sure , man . No problem . That book any help ? This has got to be one of the weirdest games ever invented . You 've got to answer these questions while you run around carrying this ball and the other team tries to tag you . And the scoring is insane . If you answer the questions right and don 't get tagged , you win one of these squares on the floor . It 's like " Go " or " Othello , " ... capture the right square , you can take over several of ' em . The team with the most amount of squares wins the game . That seems easy enough . It 's not . There 's this whole strategy about which squares to go for . Apparently you can win or lose a bunch of ' em at one time , depending on where you are on the court . Commentator : But the biggest story in the tournament has been the surprising return of Cal 's Quinn Mallory . Yeah , well , keep reading . These guys are talking about you . ... Cal a two-point favorite . And that 's from being an early seven-point underdog to Harvard in the Mindgame tournament . Usually , one player wouldn 't cause such a dramatic shift in the early line in a game . But this is Quinn Mallory we 're talking about , Ron . Unbelievable . Everybody expects me to be Wayne Gretzky , except I don 't know how to skate . Well , you better think of something . I have . I 'm taking a powder . They 're gonna have to play Harvard without me . Wait a minute . We agreed . You have to infiltrate your double 's life until we can find the sliding system . That 's easy for you to say ... you 're not gonna be the one making a fool of yourself on television . It 's too late . They all think you 're here . If you don 't show up , they 'll come looking for you . We have to find the sliding system , Quinn . It 's our only hope . ... a veteran of many tournaments ... with Mallory 's return , he could be looking at his first ever national title . Professor , there you are . Did you find what you were looking for in the lab ? There you are . Where are my files on cosmic wormholes ... the Einstein-Podolsky - Rosen Bridge , and the ... sliding machine ? Sliding machine ? You never gave me those . You keep them on your home computer . - Ah , yes , of course . - You have a couple of messages . Your agent says , " Welcome back . " He 's hired a public relations liaison to fend off the calls and media inquiries . And there 's a young woman in your office . She says you know what it 's about . You 've been a naughty boy , Arturo . I have ? Oh yes ... you 've been playing hard to get . - Not any longer , I assure you . - You can say that again . I 'm a process server . You 're being sued for divorce . You play , you pay . Ciao . Announcer : It 's the National Semifinals of " Mindgame . " Today 's showdown between the Eggheads of the University of California and the Crimson of Harvard is brought to you by Weeties ... " The breakfast of geniuses , " and Nikke ... " Just think it . " And now , from the " Mindfield " at Berkeley , here are Ron Pitts and Tom Jackson . A big test today , for Cal , Tom . The first game since the return of everybody 's All-American , Quinn Mallory . But I don 't think Mallory will have much of an impact . Harvard knows that he likes to go for those vital outside squares . Jackson : Harvard tags really well . If he 's lost a bit of what he had due to the layoff , they won 't let him get to the outside . Pitts : In a few seconds we 'll see the strategy against him . Remember , the winner of this game goes on to meet MIT in the finals . Player : Let 's go ! Now at center court , the captains are out for the toss . Player : Watch your left side . Referee : Captains , this is for the opening possession . 100 scientists surveyed , top three answers on the board . Here we go . Name a feature of relativity . No absolute time . Answer , please . - All right , Quinn ! - Yes , possession ! Way to go ! Way to go ! Player : Stick around there . - Watch him . - And the question : What is the Linnaean system of classification for flora and fauna ? You got it ! Cover him ! Pitts : Defense is always tough on the first play . You never know what square the offense is trying to capture . Pitts : A surprise ... Harvard quick on the offense this time . Nice spin move by Harvard . Did you see that ? They juked right by Mallory . Where 's his court sense ? Quinn took his own man out of the play . Pitts : He never even got near the tag , Tom . On the replay , you can see Quinn is way outside his zone with tons of ground to make up . Jackson : If he 's gonna let Harvard run all over without forcing a pass , Cal may as well pack up their briefcases and go home . You 're right , but you 've got to give him credit . He definitely looks like the Ivy League " Player of the Year . " What happened ? How do I know ? What do you think , Professor ? - Hmm ? - Professor ? Let him be , girl . He 's going through a divorce . It 's not a joke , I 'm afraid , Mr. Brown . - I know the woman concerned . - What ? The Arturo of this world is being sued for divorce by a Christina Fox ... I imagine she 's the same Christina Fox that I knew in graduate school . May I see ? - Were you in love with her ? - She was my late wife . We were only married for a few years . What happened ? She died of a brain aneurysm at the age of 27 . She was the one great love of my life . Pitts : Mallory is tagged out . He never saw it coming . Time out . Time out . Pitts : Tom , a great play but it probably came too late , as Coach Almquist is calling his last time out . Coach : Come on , guys . There is still plenty of time left . Try and draw the foul if you can . Coach , I 'm fresh . Let me get out there . Sit down , Wilson . I need square 31 . I 'm counting on you , kid . Go get ' em . Pitts : Harvard , all game long , they 've been sure , steady , 21 seconds left on the clock , I gotta believe they think they have this game in hand . Well , Cal 's only hope is to get square 31 , so you 're gonna see Harvard go into a " prevent " defense . And don 't forget Quinn Mallory . This guy has really been a disappointment all game long ... I don 't get it . How can Cal win when they 're behind by 20 points , and 32 seconds left to play ? California has squares six , seven , and 36 . If they can win square 31 they 'd outflank Harvard in three directions ... pick up an additional 11 squares ... a 22-point swing , just enough to win . They 're never gonna get in there . Harvard 's gonna be all over square 31 . But it ain 't over until the fat lady closes the book . From softest to hardest , what is the MOH 's scale of mineral hardness ? Talc , gypsum ... Calcite , fluorite ... Apatite , orthoclase , quartz ... Topaz , corundum ... Pitts : They 've completed the answer to capture square 31 . Mallory with the ball ... and he makes it ! Unbelievable , Tom . This is a miracle . We have just seen a miracle . Cal gets the win . It 's a miracle . Last time I looked at that board it was red all over . Square 31 ... Mallory 's there . What happened ? Jackson : It was Mallory carrying his team on his back , at the end of this game . Playing like the Mallory of old . Pitts : They needed square 31 . They give it to their man , Mallory ... He did it ! How much did he win by ? I don 't know . What difference does it make ? A big difference . I got Harvard plus the points . You bet on a game that you don 't understand ? You 're an idiot . Professor , he ... Where did he go ? Let him go . He 'll come home when he 's ready . - Jackson : He showed up at the right time . - Pitts : He sure did . You were so incredible . How 'd you figure it out ? It 's not like I had a choice . - What 's his problem ? - He bet against you . Are you kidding ? Is that true ? You said you were clueless . How was I supposed to know you would pull it off in the clutch ? - How much did we lose ? - Oh-hh ... Rembrandt , how much did we lose ? - Rembrandt ? - All of it . - All of it ? - Look at it this way ... things can 't get any worse , right ? Thug : Belated welcome home , Mr. Mallory . - Who are you ? - Friends of friends . Wilson ? I 'm confused , Quinn . Mr. Wilson has brought to my attention that you 've chosen not to honor your commitments . Your little superstar here skips out on a million bucks in gambling debts and I am not a happy man . " Desperanti desparanda faciunt . " Say what ? " Desperate men do desperate deeds . " Hold it ! A million bucks ? What is your problem ? Cognitive dissonance ? Fortunately , I 'm an enlightened man . I 'm giving you one more chance . I want MIT to win the finals . You vouchsafe that outcome , and I 'll absolve the million bucks you owe me . If he throws the championship tomorrow , you 'll erase his debt ? It 's either that or he doesn 't play . What if I say no ? I will be very disappointed . And then ... you , my fine young superstar , will be mors maxime . - " Mors maxime " ? - Mors ... mortis ... dead ! As in very . Let 's go . - Wait here . - Driver : Sure . Christina ... What are you doing here ? I 'm not sure . I just wanted to see you . Okay , you 've seen me . - Wait ! - No , damn it , Maximillian . My divorce lawyer says I shouldn 't have any contact with you . This is so strange . Are you all right ? You look terrible . And you look every bit as beautiful as the day we met . Oh , I have so much to explain to you . How do I get through this barrier of hostility ? Christina , I need your help . Oh , here we go again . A master manipulator . " Me , me , me . " What happened , Max ? One of your starry-eyed co-eds move on to someone smarter ? - No ! - Then what ? You must have some ulterior motive . But I 've never ... Oh ... Clearly I have done you great wrong . Oh , that 's ... that 's very good , Max . Very contrite . This " little boy lost " routine ? It 's old . It 's tired . And most of all , my dear , I don 't believe it anymore . You went to see her ? Are you crazy ? I had no choice . Oh , I told myself I was just going along to glean information about the sliding machine , but ... ah , the moment I saw her . Professor , I don 't mean to sound callous ... I understand how this must really hurt you ... but this woman is not your wife . She is my Christina , alive . Absurd as it may seem , I feel I might have a second chance with her . You 're thinking of staying ? She probably wouldn 't have anything to do with me . I mean , how do I explain to her that I am not her Arturo , but I am Arturo nonetheless ? Boy , talk about never really knowing a person . - I beg your pardon ? - Not you ... me . I had no idea that you were such a romantic . And I had no idea that I would have the opportunity . - Where are you going ? - I don 't know ... the woods or something . I 'm not waiting around for those leg breakers to come back . What about the sliding system ? What sliding system ? We 've been to every laboratory on campus . Nobody knows anything . Nobody 's seen anything . Got to be some serious hush-hush . On the contrary . Our doubles are such scoundrels - the whole thing could be a hoax . - A hoax ? But if they didn 't slide , then where 'd they go ? You want my opinion ? I think my double is in Europe with his mistress , having first cleaned out the joint bank account . And we know that Mr. Mallory 's double has a good reason for disappearing . Incredible . We 're supposed to be in some elevated super-intellectual society . Everything 's just as twisted as it is back home . Worse . Intellectual refinement 's one thing , Moral refinement 's something different . Man , I knew getting involved on this world was a bad idea . Oh , sure ... Mr. " 20 / 20 hindsight . " Look , don 't start on me now , girl . You guys can argue about it all you want . Quinn , wait . Quinn , wait . Hi , is Quinn Mallory here ? What do you want , Boyer ? What 's your story , Mallory ? You missed practice . Yeah , well , something came up . Coach is going nuclear . He sent me to bring you back . Look , tell Coach I 'm off the team . Same old Mallory ... Mr. " I Don 't Care About Anybody Else . " After everything Coach did for you ? The stunt you pulled , now you 're gonna cost him the championship ? I 'm not going to be your messenger boy , " superstar . " If you want to break his heart , you 're going to have to do it yourself . Coach ! Why weren 't you at the practice ? I 'm not gonna play in the championship . I don 't know what else to say . Nobody 's had it any easier than you , Mallory . All the times that I coddled you and covered for you ... days when you came in drunk and worse ... you disappear for a month on " personal business . " Did I rag on you ? I wouldn 't be much help out there . I haven 't been myself lately . Well , you had a bad game . It happens . But you made up for it in the final seconds . Why do you make it so hard for yourself and everybody else ? All the great ones were worth the headaches ... Hawking , Sagan ... they were players . You have a chance to make a place for yourself in that pantheon . What do I need to do to get through to you ? It 's not your fault . Athletes today , all you see is dollar signs , endorsements , TV contracts . Nobody cares about the game anymore . I had a chance to win the championship and go out on the top . What do you want me to say ? I 'm a jerk . Go . Get out of my sight . I 'm sorry , Coach . I really am . Quinn Mallory , a word with you ? Who are you ? Special Agent O 'Brian . My partner , Bob Cannon . FBI . If you guys are going to arrest me , let 's just get it over with , okay ? You 'd be doing me a favor . We 're FBI , we 're not in the favor-doing business . " Everybody 's All-America . " All of those kids worship the ground you walk on . You make me sick . I 'll say it again , I 'm not who you think I am . Who do you think you 're toying with , bright boy ? Wait a minute . What do you guys have on me ? We know the whole story , son . Tax evasion , gambling debts , point shaving . All right , look . You want to be heros ? Get your pictures in the paper ? What if I told you I was just a tiny fish in a big stinking cesspool ? You give me a little , I 'll make your careers . How good of you to come . My lawyer would kill me if she knew I was doing this . She need never know . - Just coffee , please . - Make that two . Oh really ? Not your customary vodka and orange juice ? I 'm trying to cut down . You said you had something to tell me . Yes , I do . And where to begin ? Christina , I am not the man that you think I am . For that individual who 's hurt you so much , I am sorely embarrassed and deeply ashamed . What are you trying to say , Max ? You were ... you are the most important thing in the world to me . Your happiness means absolutely everything . And if there is any way ... that we can forget what 's happened and find our way back to the joy that we knew ... - Oh , Max , I ... - I want you to delay this divorce . This is the last thing I expected to hear . Look ... I have to go away for a while . There are one or two things I have to sort out . - Your work again ? - No , no , no , please . I do have some problems to solve , but they 're not physics problems . Oh , Christina ... if you have any feeling left for me , I beg you , give me one more chance . All right , boys . This is for the championship . It 's all on the line . Everything you worked for . MIT is fast and smart . We can 't afford to fall behind too early . All : U ... Cal ! - I appreciate it , kid . - No problem . Announcer : By satellite , to 123 countries around the globe , it 's the 27th National Finals of " Mindgame . " Today 's championship contest is between The University of California Eggheads , and the Beavers of MIT . And now , here are Ron Pitts , and Tom Jackson ! This is what it 's all about . The noise , the adrenaline . I 've been there myself , and I can tell you it 's hard right now to stay calm . Pitts : We 're seconds away from the toss-up to start the NCAA Mindgame Championship . Referee : Captains , this is for the opening possession . 100 scientists surveyed , top three answers on the board . Name a common characteristic of string theory . - Multiple dimensions . - Answer , please . Mallory hits the " Multiple Dimensions " with authority . Yeah , but it was only a second answer . - Referee : MIT can try . - Infinite density . - Referee : Answer , please . - That was a good answer ! Pitts : Mallory looks like he really didn 't buy that top answer . Jackson : It doesn 't matter as long as he 's up on defense . I did like the way he came out firing . He looks like the Quinn Mallory of old . Referee : In the human head , what are the 12 cranial nerves ? Olfactory , optic , oculomotor . Pitts : Quinn makes the tag , stopping MIT . This looks like the Quinn Mallory from before his layoff . Referee : Name the four heaviest chemical elements . Fermium ... Mendelevium ... Nobelium ... Lawrencium . - Pitts : Great score by Mallory . - Referee : Time out , red . Is he trying to win ? I don 't know . What about his deal with Joey Fountain and the mob ? Like you , I 'm a man of science , and a slider . You inhabit a world which esteems the intellect . I inhabit a world that all too often appears to despise it . You have wealth , success ... fame ... and a wife that loves you . And yet , despite all of this , you are a fool . There was a Christina in my world , too . And when she died , I discovered that I 'd lost everything that gave my life any meaning . If you lose your Christina , I promise you , your life will lose its meaning , too . Don 't let that happen , my dear alter-ego . You are , after all , far too intelligent for that . Oh ... I saw your light on . Why aren 't you at the big game ? I have to leave town again , Lydia . - I want you to do me a favor . - Of course . The instant I return , make sure that I see this tape . Certainly . I 'm running late . Goodbye . You have been absolutely wonderful . I will not forget you . Referee : What is Pi to 13 places ? Pitts : It 's Mallory with Cal 's run yet again . Three-point-one-four ... Pitts : He could go all the way . There he goes . ... one , five , nine , two , six , five ... Unbelievable . Mallory 's playing like a man possessed . Jackson : MIT can do nothing to stop Quinn . ... eight , nine ... seven . Pitts : What a move . Did you see that ? He carried Pi out to enough places , I think . Jackson : He sure did , in full speed . Pitts : That 's frustration right there , right ? If you 're MIT , you 've got to be wondering what is going on ... what just hit you . The best defense in the nation is no match for Mallory on this particular evening . He 's a guy on fire . Shake it off ! Shake it off ! - Shake it off . - Foul . Personal violation . Loss of square , red . - Time out ! - Referee : Time out , blue . How much time ? - Almost finished . - I mean , till we slide ? I told the Professor we 'd meet him on the roof at a quarter to 10 : 00 . God bless you , boys . You 've played harder than I 've ever seen anyone play tonight . Quinn 's unconscious out there . You all right ? I 'm wiped , Coach . I 'm seeing spots . - Wilson : Coach , I 'm ready . - Get in there . Jackson : Mallory stays on the bench and Wilson is in the game ? Not a good idea , Coach . The fix is in . - What ? - Trust me . Wilson , get back here . Boyer , in for Mallory . Pitts : It appears as though ... Boyer will come in for Wilson . I 'm not so sure I understand Cal 's strategy here . Uh-oh . Let 's go . - What 's going on ? - I said trust me , all right ? Keep Wilson out of the game . Come on , for God 's sake . He 's a dead man . Hey , you guys can 't go on the court ! Pitts : What is this ? Three men have walked onto the court . - Move it ! Out of the way ! - They 're chasing Quinn Mallory . Tom ... they 've chased Quinn Mallory right off the court . Referee : Get off the court ! Quinn , hurry ! Go ! Go ! Whoa ! - Get out of the way ! - Thug : Get him ! Stop him ! Grab him ! Grab him ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Move it ! Come on , hurry up ! Over here . 30 seconds ! Hold it ! This is sweet . This is gonna be worth the million bucks . Drop the gun . FBI . - Drop the guns . - What is this ? You set me up ? - Professor ... ? - Three , two , one . Fountain : What 's he doing ? Slide for your lives ! Geronimo ! " Vie carenis , ennundum . " - Where 'd he go ? - They disappeared ! " Vie carenis , ennundum " ? What is that ? - Latin . - What 's that mean ? " So long , suckers . "

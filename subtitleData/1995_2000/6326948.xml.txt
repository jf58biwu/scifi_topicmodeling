Do you know anything about unusual health problems that you have your grandmother ? - No . - Any problem of arrhythmia , circulation and metabolism decrease in your family history ? Not that I know of . Your grandmother was a travel writer . From any of his travels , brought about ancient amulet , talisman or a crystal ? I have no idea .

Therefore we transferred the patient in a government facility . I thought we were here , Gordon Lightfoot concert of this week . Minutes ! We can not allow that man to find out what happened to his grandmother . Oldham us take the case . It 's grandson , damn . He is entitled to see . Listen , if you are Oldham , I learn by heart alone , all 14 verses " Epava " de Edmund Fitzgerald . " The legend lives on from the Chippewa down at the big lake ... - Which is said Gitche gum . " - I know how hot this , Simon . - Tonight , in my hotel room ? - I 'll bring the wine , do not worry . They found it so . They continued to generate epidermis cells , but without light , melanocytes they have ceased to pigmentation . Looks like an albino . The eyes are red because they have lost their color . What you see below are the blood vessels . You said that they found it in concrete , how could you survive ? That means that you think of explanation , beyond science ? Not necessarily . Similar abnormalities occurred in nature . Living creatures recovered from stone blocks . Maybe it 's hard to believe you , but I 'm sure we find - Scientific explanation for this . - I do not know . - I know the feeling . - Like stone , concrete seems robust , but there are cracks through which water can pass , oxygen , even nutrients . Grandma body could absorb these elements . Well , it 's kind fetched , but even if I thought , explain this to me ... My grandmother disappeared 55 years ago . In addition to loss of pigmentation , aging does not seem to be any single day . Because freezing conditions were similar , maybe went through a similar to hibernation . That 's why extremely low heart rate - And slowing metabolism . - Is that hair and nails have grown . You answered all ? I know from experience , not everything can be explained scientifically . But you ? What do you think ? Natural History Museum exhibited with a live frog ... Freed of magnesium and limestone block , 7.5 meters below ground level . Based on the formation of rocks , a geologist said that the frog must have had 6,000 years . What do you mean ? We do not know what happened to Francesca Dutton . Do not know who buried her in the subway . - Or if it was a freak accident . - Or even how he survived . There is no word out . We could use your help . Are you really ? Mama always said ... I never thought you were dead . Mind if I sit down ? You 're described as mother , only a little more beautiful . You remember my mother ... Patricia ? It would have been here today ... - But he died two years ago . - Died ? - Patricia , my baby ... - For cancer . He had a happy life . I was born on me . I 'm Jack . I am your nephew . My nephew ? But you 're an adult . My child was only six years old when ... - Where am I ? - In a hospital in New York . Remember what happened to you ? If I remember ? - How long has it been ? - 55 years . That much ? It was dark ... I could not move ... Only cold and noise . The earth trembled again . It was underground . You were buried underground tunnel . I was sure it was hell . I just memories . But in darkness and loneliness , everything is deleted . So that it seemed nothing deleted . Then I became nothing . Just an empty soul . You 're safe . You will not go back there . It was too much . I 'll let you rest , but first I need to know , what happened . Who did this ? No . No . - What ? - It may still be there . You know what he meant by " It may still be there " ? No I do not know . You made contact . And it is a start . - Can you come tomorrow ? - Yes . Maybe I could tonight , take home some of your files . - I check something about the case . - We can not afford that , Jack . - I thought you wanted my help . - We want , but you have approval . I already risked much , leaving you in . Can you tell me at least , what they learned forensics ? The clothing was completely decomposed . There were a hairpin and a coin from 1942 , in concrete . Probably was once her pocket . Nothing else ? No other evidence ? - Only one . - Verb , is confidential . I want to ask my grandmother about it . I found it in concrete . We can not determine in which metal is or how to use . Well , what have you found ? A silver sphere , Eddie , from those used by Gua , to retain consciousness before transferring it into our bodies . - Are you sure ? - Without a doubt . It means that Francesca is one of them . He 's in custody . I captured a live alien , Foster . No , Eddie , do not . I saw the pain and confusion . I felt insulation . I am sure that human suffering . It was terrible to pretend I was her nephew . Foster , remember . Gua are very experienced players . I know I know . Just ... It looked like a victim . One that was stolen life . An experimental subject , just like me . We are coming , Eddie . National Missing Agency has evidence of the existence - Aliens , but still does not know . - Can you trust them , Foster ? Something I like the verb . Wait , Foster , my paranoia crazy . And you have not taken your medicine ? Funny , amigo , but want to go to the National Agency , and say ... " Hey , hi . I 'm Trackbacks general , Cade Foster . " I have proof of the existence of extraterrestrials . " What , compete in ... - The American criminal sucker ? - Relax , I will not say that . First one to help them find out what happened to Francesca . Her body had adapted Gua , in order to survive . Jack Dutton , poliţia Philadelphia . I do not know , but those of Missing Persons Agency said ... I know , verbs agents and Simon . We cooperate in this investigation . - Can you show me where she was found ? - Sure . - Who built the tunnel ? - Company " Ellroy and McMurric " . - The company exist ? - No , it was closed in 1970 . Both owners are long dead . This is the place . Well , what happened to it ? Have you heard ? No . What is the composition of the concrete ? I 'm not paid to do such things , only to demolish . Have you noticed anything unusual here ? The concrete looks a little soft , perhaps . It is easily broken . I think the old . Listen , I gotta get back to work . I received the results of laboratory analysis ... A glimpse of the tunnel wall . - Concrete worry you . - Very funny . What am I looking ? The concrete contains limestone , which makes it softer , but in concrete limestone has been buried , Francesca Dutton , exceeds the standard , with almost 200 % . Therefore , it was buried in a block of limestone . In the vault , for more than half a century . It 's a wonder that the tunnel did not fall over it . - But why tracing ? - I have a theory ... According to ancient legend , is a wandering soul . A blade in the 19th century , hit a block of limestone with her staff ... And a salamander crawled up trying to breathe . Lama made a kind of Tibetan yoga , which is called " fova " . This implies reincarnation . Salamandra was , in fact , a man expelled from a Buddhist version of hell . Lama was forced to release the man from his prison limestone ... - To release the soul . - I do not understand . I understand . You say that the block of limestone , a trap for the human soul . Exact . If a person is buried alive in limestone , her soul would be blocked . There might reincarnate , to go to heaven , hell ... or wherever you think it goes . You 'd be trapped in the body . Maybe you have the power to survive . Francesca said she felt like an empty soul . This could be an experiment regarding human preservation . Forget cryogenics . Gua can keep human body for centuries , until they need . Good job , Eddie . Good morning . Did you sleep well ? Apparently not . I dreamed about you . Really ? It 's the first dream I had , after a long period of time . After a while I lost images . Looks of things ... and people . Last night when I closed my eyes , I saw your face . Francesca , I want to help . - I ? - Can not help me . Can you tell me who if buried . Why buried ? They tried to prevent your soul to escape ? What did he say ? - You like me or her ? - Like you . We are many . Save the others . - Who ? - Two more . Bury me . I do not know where they are . We must help them . What the hell do ? I do not like that . What game play , Jack ? - I do not play anything . - Then show us what he wrote . It 's a secret between grandparents and grandchildren . Listen , I understand what happens here , like you . We 'll share information , but only - If you help your investigation . - You know I can not . Well , then deals each . You will not see Grandma , if not collaborate . - Any luck ? - James Jeffries Reed , director of the bank . New Haven , Connecticut disappeared in 1945 and Olivia Quinn , professor at the University of Los Angeles . Very beautiful at that time . Francesca was right . There were 2 subjects . And I 'm buried somewhere . We compared the biographical data . I see no connection between the three . I 'm not surprised . I did not know any of the 116 subjects in my experiment . - The question is , how do we find them ? - Have you heard of GPR system ? Of course . Maybe . Well , sir smart , tell me your secret . Georadar , transmit pulses of electromagnetic energy reflected , targets in the basement or other solids . - Good . - I used when I was a thief . You 'd be surprised what people buried in their farms . Sounds good , but in this country is a lot of concrete . Cheers . I hope you will not need luck , Eddie . Francesca was born in New York , was found in the subway in Manhattan . If Gua , decided to bury the other subjects in their home towns . I 'll check building permits , to see how big concrete buildings were raised in 1945 . Los Angeles is too high . Let 's start with New Haven . JJ Reed 's hometown . It is near . Oh man ! The huge area ? It will take forever , Foster . This is the last place . At least it 's less than the Convention Center . Thank God . I just got out of there . Why Colectable check Convention ? Collect Pez ? Did you see those toys , the 200 people Pez ? I wanted to smash skulls . Especially Papa Smurf . - It 's harassing me . - I do not know Eddie , I like Pez . You help me . Where could it be ? I do not know . The walls are probably brick . Foundation . Look , it looks like a pool . Concrete foundation , it may be in the tiles . - Do not see anything ? - No not yet . Wait , Eddie . I picture . Right here . Yes . Anything ? Damn ! It is alive . You did a good job , but you shared discovery with us ? I was generous . But you ? Try to breathe easy . You 're out of here . Work with us . See what pull grandfather . Our records show you . You can get involved in the investigation . Did you find anything interesting about your grandmother ? I read her stories travel . At the end of the Second World War , was going to visit northern Italy . Never got . Her life was so full that he spent eternity in darkness . I 'm surprised not crazy . Not greater sadness when you retire in poverty , than when I was happy . J.J ... Sunt Josie Simon . How are you ? You must drink . Leave me alone ! A little gratitude would be nice . Any luck with the other names on the list , Olivia Quinn ? Five of our teams seek in Los Angeles . I use a deep radar , all buildings constructed in 1945 . How many were built in that year ? If you do not include housing , 17555 . We do not know how to narrow your search . Metro and school were built by different manufacturers . - I said ... get out ! - Needful care , JJ , or you die . I suggest you eat something , if you do not want your body to be lowered into a hole again . This time , it would be forever . - It 's hard . - Oh , yes . Comes ... You know , this mirrors hardly inspires confidence . I would like to speak privately with grandma . Maybe they do talk . I think I could arrange . Oh yes , there 's more . I found a link between these three victims , in some old customs documents . It seems that Francesca Dutton , JJ Reed and Olivia Quinn were in India , about the same time in 1944 . A year before he disappeared . - You were wrong , buddy . - What do you mean ? You said there was no connection between the victims . Verb checked at customs and found one . The customs ? I know , that , sooner or later ... - Damn ! - Must be a step forward Eddie . - Okay , okay , I know . - I have to go . Finally we 're alone , no one spying on us . - I have to tell you something . - I know . You 're not my nephew . How do you know ? - You said you 're like me . - A subject . - Subject ? - In an experiment alien . Aliens ? That strangers ? No , that is , beings from another planet . I know it 's hard to believe . - What you experiment conducted ? - Test the human will . - I killed the woman I loved . - Sorry . But you ? - What have studied ? Do you know ? - No , you know ? I experimented on us . Do not know much . It could explore a way to preserve our bodies . Francesca Simon must tell them verbally . Please . We aim bastards for over a year , but I need help to prove what I know . I will , but not without the support of others . Without their approval , those people will think I 'm crazy . We need to find Olivia . How do you know about the others ? Oliva and JJ ? Together we have been subjects . But you knew before . You were together in India . I was in the Himalayas So I met . They travel writer . Did you know that ? I read your stories . They were great . Can not wait to see the world again . Francesca , something else . Police found a silver sphere in concrete . - Where were buried . - I know nothing about it . This este ? Recipient alien consciousness . Based on what I saw , so get on their planet . - There are many ? - What ? Aliens ? There are many on Earth ? From what I know , a few thousand . What did he say ? Francesca was the subject of an alien experiment . Now go somewhere . We talk to us ? No , until we find the topic 3 of the experiment , Olivia . Hold on . Illusion alien is a shared psychosis - Because of the extremely long isolation ... - Spare me ! Have you found a woman , rock after 55 years . If vo explain it this way , then you 're wrong . - Verb ? - He 's right , Simon . Excuse me . It 's not the right time . I found a link between the first two victims . - A new connection . - Tell . The places where they were found , were designed by the same architect . Frederick Lansing . - And ... lives in New York . - Good job , buddy . Feds sure your contractors said they checked the subway and schools , but do you think were going to check and architect , right ? Well ? Of course not . - I know how to find Olivia Quinn . - How ? We 'll ask the man who buried her . Let 's see what he has to say Mr. Lansing . Get out of here pigs , or I 'll break your stomach . Mr. Lansing , we are federal agents . Please open the door . Special Agent Simon from the National Agency of the Disappeared . He is my partner , Agent minutes . Well , sit down . What do you want ? - Can we come in ? - Not until I find out what it is . I found two people in concrete structures that you designed 50 years ago . - I 'm alive . - Could you explain , Mr. Lansing ? Just did not you released ? God help us . Come , come . Do not enter with shoes on carpet . Remove them . Kidding ? My wife , myself , Francesca Dutton and JJ Reed , for the first time in Kathmandu . - In the Himalayas ? - It was the fashionable thing that you could do , if you had money . I had . Your wife was Olivia . Four of us have become fast friends , but it all went wrong when I left an adventure in the jungle Đặng Ba Pass . What happened ? I found something that I thought was a meteor . It was broken . Shiny silver balls were everywhere . Shine like Christmas decorations . I have not touched anything , of course . Others wanted souvenirs . So each took one . In the days that followed , watched their bodies are changing inside . Do you think they were possessed by an entity . An alien entity . I do not know , but we headed towards the monastery of Dolpa Piks . A Hindu priest looked at my companions and somehow recognized her demons . He told them captured in stone . It was the only way to prevent their souls reincarnate , from wearing evil in their future bodies . So you 've buried your buildings . I had no choice , but now ... You fools , I 've released . You have no idea what you 've done . Where is Mr. Lansing ? Your wife , Olivia . Tell us the location . No ! I will not release the evil . You have to put them back . You must ! I do not agree . I had to put him in custody Frederick Lansing . It 's a scary old . Not going anywhere . You 're a cop , Jack . What do you think about leaving the freedom of the alleged criminal ? - I agree with the verb . - Why am I not surprised ? Frederick did not kill anyone . Try to stop the first wave . What do you mean ? Francesca told the truth about one thing . There aliens . But I was wrong about her . He 's one of them . Spheres that you found Frederick , like the one you showed me a the subway , are containers for alien consciousness . How do you know that ? I saw someone touching her when shone . And possessed . Perhaps as originally inhabited earth . Planted areas , the meteorites that have fallen on the planet . When they found people were possessed by extraterrestrial beings . There are now more sophisticated . Transferred consciences genetic clones created . You 're not a cop , Jack . Who are you ? Francesca and JJ disappeared . I must warn Frederick Lansing . Leave me alone ! I go back . - Back ! - No , you back verbally . - Simon , what the hell is going on ? - Drop the gun , verb . - You must be joking ... - Throw it . It 's on their side , verbally . Simon ? " And later that night , when the lights go out ... The wreck came Edmund Fitzgerald . " Who are you ? How did you hear about us ? Catch him ! Este Olivia ! Thanks , buddy . So Olivia was Frederick 's house all the time . - She was his wife . - What poetic . He loved her . I think she wanted to keep her close to him . When I was in sixth grade , my turtle turtle , Shelley died . I put in an empty jar of peanut butter . - It 's still here somewhere . - I missed the best chance , Eddie . - When people begin to believe ? - We have supporters , Foster . Verba was one of them . There are others that you helped in the last year and a half . One day will gather , and will rise in unison . Minutes were a friend . The best chance we had , Gua to convince authorities there , but at least I know I am not alone fighting against them . There are others out there . Frederick Lansing , he discovered fifty years ago . I pray to end up better than him . Translation and adaptation Florin ( c ) thin

 High commanders log : it 's been days since harrys been missing and I 'm damned if I know where he is . Here 's what I do know . Harry ran across Vicki Dubcek 's ex-boyfriend . I 'm lookin for a scrawny little runt . There are a few of those around here . Come on ! Harry 's gone ! Harry 's gone ! We know ! Shut up ! Before we knew it that crazed redneck dragged Harry off . I can only pray , he kept his mouth shut . Incoming message from the big giant head ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! You goin ' hulk on me ? ! Remember , your human bodies are property of the big giant head and can be revoked at any time . Hot diggety damn ! This ain 't no normal runt ! I got me a bona fide freak ! There could be money in this . Oh , yeah ! Where could he be ? Where ? Ladies and gentlemen , Garvin 's gallery of apparitions and curiosities is proud to present ... Hargo the alien . People of earth ... I come in peace . I am Hargo . Just Hargo . Where I come from , we don 't have last names , which makes it really difficult , because on my planet , Hargo is a really popular name . Much like your bob . W-wait a second , you guys . Did I mention that I come in peeeee- - incoming message from the big giant head ! Our records continue to indicate that you have failed to file your status report . Immediate response mandatory .

[ Cheering ] All right , bye . Ok , I 've made an appointment with the psychic . She 's gonna tell us where Harry is . Great . Let 's go . Wait , wait . Now , if she 's so psychic , why doesn 't she just use her powers to win the lottery or something ? Because psychics are not in it for the money , Tommy . They are here to help people . See , that 's why they stay on the line as long as you need them . You guys , we 're wasting time . Come on , Dick ! Let 's go . We 're going to a psychic . We 're going to a psychic ? Why ? To help find Harry . Harry 's missing ? Why didn 't anybody tell me ? ! Uh , ' cause you knew ? I most certainly did not ! Let 's get going ! Where are my car keys ? They 're in your hand . Ah , found them . Now we can go . All right , let 's get moving . Come on , Harry ! Dick ... Harry 's missing . What ? ! My god ! Well , why are we all just sitting around ? ! We gotta go find Harry ! We 're going to the psychic for help . Good idea . I 'll give you a ride . Where are my car keys ? Check your hand , Dick ! Ah . Here they are . Come on , let 's go . Harry ! I 'm gonna go borrow mama 's el Camino . Dick ? Um , are you Ok ? I 'm fine . Wait ! You don 't think that this is some sort of punishment from the big giant head for not sending in the status report ? Oh , please ! Did you hear that , Harry ? Harry ? Harry ! D-oh ! Great ! Harry 's run off with my car keys ! [ Knock on door ] Yeah . Garvin , can I talk to you for a minute ? Hargo , have a seat . Look , I 'm afraid that somewhere along the line , you 've got the mistaken impression that I- - ha ha ha ... am an alien . And I 'm not . Of course you 're not , kid , but here 's the magic . You make me believe . Hmm . Well , thanks , but if it 's all the same to you , I 'd just as soon go home . It would be fun , wouldn 't it- - oh , darn the luck . I just remembered , that 's a no-can-do . I 've got a signed contract , my friend . Wait a second . I don 't remember signing any contract . Yeah , but your former associate randy lefornier did . Yeah ... yeah ... here 's the deal . See , he 's not so much my former associate as much as he 's my former kidnapper . Yeah , and I 'm sure that my family 's worried about me . Your family ? Where are they ? I don 't know . But they 're not here , are they ? If they cared about you , wouldn 't they come looking for you ? Well , they probably are looking . I don 't think so . I bet they put up posters . I know for a fact they have not ! Those bastards ! I hate them as well . But you have a new family now , Hargo . A family that understands your talent , a family that 's going to harness that talent for profit . My profit ? Slow down . You 're going to be big , Hargo , so big it scares me . Well , what , like flipper boy big ? Human pincushion big . I 'm sensing ... that someone you love is missing . How did you know that ? You told her on the phone . Did you bring me a lock of his hair ? Uh , no , ma 'am , I didn 't , but I 've got some letters of his and , uh , this is my wonderbra . It 's his sleep toy . Here 's a picture of him . Oh , yes , yes . I 'm getting some very strong vibrations from these . Wait a minute . I 've seen this guy . Here we go . She 's havin a vision . No , no , I 'm not . I saw this guy at the Lapine county fair . You saw him in your head . No , no . I saw him at the fair . He 's working there . Well , why don 't you lay out some cards and you can tell us more . Wait ! No , no , no . She doesn 't need to lay out cards . We can go get Harry . Come on ! Well . Tommy , I guess you were right . This woman is Nothin ' but a sham . Thank you . You 've really been a big help . Bitch . Losing my memory , bah ! I found the university with no trouble at all . Good afternoon , Dr. Solomon . And a fine afternoon it is , Gwen . Excuse me ? What ? Oh , sorry . Eh , how do you pronounce your name ? Nina . Yeah , I know that . This isn 't my lipstick . That 's not your desk . I know that ! I was just looking for my lipstick . Oh , hi , Dick . Hi , there , pretty lady . Is there any news about Harry ? News ? What 's the last news you heard ? That he 's still missing . Who 's missing ? Harry ! I know that . Now , uh , if you 'll excuse me , I have an appointment . You can 't get out that way . I know that . [ Crash ] Hi , guys . Hey , Hargo . Kudos on your performance tonight , Hargo . Well , thank you , giganticus . That 's nice to hear , comin ' from the man that I would consider to be king . Well , even the tallest man in the world will stoop to pay a compliment when it 's so well-deserved . Oh , get outta here , ya nutball . You 're gonna make me cry . We know where Harry is ! We know where Harry is ! We know where Harry is ! Ok . We need to go to the Lapine county fair . How 's Dick ? Oh , not so good . I thought he could use some fresh air , so I sent him down to the old town road to pick up strawberries . Wow . You 're back quick . [ As henry Fonda ] You want to know why I came back so fast ? I got to the end of our driveway , and I couldn 't remember which way to go . I went into our backyard , and nothing looked familiar to me . Not one damn tree . Scared me half to death . Snap out of it , ya old poop . All right . Now get his jacket . We got to roll . Mary : Dick ? Dick ... I know how hard this has been on all of you , so I made you a casserole . What stinks ? It 's got onions . I can 't have onions . Come on , Dick . We gotta get going . Get going ? ! What , you know where Harry is ? If I did , will ya take that stink pot outta here ? Hey , mama made us a sackful of sandwiches for the trip . Now , you be careful at that fair . The moonshine , the mutant pigs , the ex-cons runnin ' the rides . You 're not gonna wanna come back home . Sally ! What 's the big emergency ? Don , we need to go to the Lapine county fair , and Dick lost the keys to the car ! I 'd love to go . No . There 's no room for you . We just need to borrow your squad car . You can 't just take that car ! It belongs to the cit- - hey , can we use the siren ? Come on ! Only if you 're going over 80 ! I 'mafraid of Virginia Woolf ! Me ! How long do you think they 'll be gone ? Well , usually when they take the squad car , it 's 5 , 6 hours . And they think we 're just gonna sit here and wait . Well ... that 's what I usually do . All right , he 's not in the arcade . Oh , damn ! How are we supposed to find Harry in this sea of blubber and B.O. ? ! Well , all I know is , I 'm gonna find me a good psychic . Not one that just ... recognizes people . Hey , where did Dick go ? Oh , great ! I told you we should have tied him to a tree ! Guess your weight for $ 1.00 . $ 1.00 . Guess your weight ? Oh , all right , young man , you got a deal . 205 . Step on the scale , please . Ah . 205 , right on the button . I 'll be . Ha ha . Guess your weight for $ 1.00 . $ 1.00 . Guess your weight . Well , you 're on . Ok . 205 . Step on the scale , please . You are good . Guess your weight ? This should be interesting . How much ? $ 5.00 . You got a customer . [ Music plays ] Harry ? ! Harry ? ! People of earth , I am Hargo the alien . Oh ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Oh , my god ! Oh , my god ! We are from a superior race . Our brains are far more evolved than yours . Why don 't we just grab him ? Good idea , bonehead ! Then we create even more of a scene . I 'm sorry ! We visited your tiny little planet thousands of years ago and built the towering pyramids ! What ? We didn 't build the pyramids . We killed the dinosaurs . We killed the dinosaurs ? Didn 't we ? Oh , whatever . We come in peace . And only- - [ Babbling ] Incoming message from the big giant head ! Oh , no ! My god ! This is a good show . It reminds me of George gobel . Stage one of brain shutdown is complete . Amygdaloid nucleus and thalamus will be disabled next unless your high commander files his status report . Transmission ending in 3 ... 2 ... 1- - ah-choo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Vicki : oh , man ! Isn 't this great ? ! My boyfriend is the king of the freaks , man ! Oh , yeah , baby , I 'm watchin ' you ! You 're lookin ' good up there ! You 're lookin ' good ! They are a strange family . So strange . You know , they have a litter box . But no cat . Ok , how about this ? Dick saves his toenail clippings and puts them in a shredder 'cause he 's afraid of being cloned . So odd . So very ... very odd . Why do we put up with ' em ? Well , I know why you do , Don . I mean , how often does a super model fall into your lap ? You won the lottery . No offense . No . None taken . But you 've got to admit , you 've got lucky , too . Excuse me ? Come on , admit it , you 're a lonely schoolmarm in a one-horse town , when along comes a crazy cowpoke sniffing ' around your petticoat . Did Dick tell you about our gunsmoke game ? No . We don 't have one . Look , let us in . You think you scare me ? You people look like ... ants to me . Harry : let ' em in , giganticus . Well , if it isn 't the poor relations . I knew you 'd come around as soon as you found out I was a star . Oh , hello , Vicki . Harry , I 've always longed for a life in show business . The big crowds , the bright lights . And you know what 's funny ? I don 't even mind the stench of manure . Well , well , well , if it isn 't Vicki Dubcek . Long time , no see . Ha ha ha ha ! I 'm afraid that you have the wrong Vicki Dubcek . Nope . Haven 't changed a bit . [ Nervous laughter ] [ Sobbing ] Look , Harry , Dick is in trouble . His brain is going , and you 're our only hope ! You have to send in that status report ! No ! You can 't boss me around anymore . You--you people didn 't even put up posters ! No ! I call the shots now . Look , Harry- - silence ! It 's Hargo the alien to you . Is there a problem here , Hargo ? No . I think we 're through . Hey , you 're a tall , cool drink of water . Let me ask you something . Can you eat glass ? Yes , I can . And no , I won 't . Ah . So you 're the little menace who keeps leaving your tricycle in my driveway . Next time , you 're not getting it back . Ah , it 's not your fault . You 've got lousy parents . I should have known they would have brought in the big guns . Mr. Tip-tip , could you give us a moment alone ? Maybe you could go get a mint . Look , Dick , you can just save your breath , Ok ? I can 't answer the big giant head . 'Cause if I do , then he 'll stop contacting me . And then my act is over . I 'm finished . No . I 'm lookin ' out for me . Who are you ? Oh , don 't give me that ! Come on . I 'm just the same guy I always was , only smarter . I don 't know who you are . Why , because I 'm living for myself for a change ? Who the hell are you ? You want to know who I am ? I 'll tell ya who I am ! I don 't know anymore , Dick ! I don 't know ! Now you 're hurting me . I know . I 've been selfish . What have I been thinkin ' ? [ Hargo show music plays ] Pardon me , Dick , but I 've got a show to do . That 's a magnificent sweater . Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! People of earth , I am Hargo the alien . No . That 's my dentist . Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! I come from a galaxy far , far- - y 'know , I 'd like to try something a little different tonight , if I could . Now , you 've all seen the big giant head call me . But you haven 't seen me call the big giant head . Let 's call him , shall we ? [ Disappointed murmuring ] No . It 'll be great . I 'm just gonna make a little phone call- - transmission line 's open for the big giant head . Wh-why is he changing the act ? That act was gold ! Your status report has been received . Ah-choo ! Harry ! Dick ! What are you doing up there ? ! Get off that stage this instant ! He 's back ! And he 's pissed . What a loss . Hey , shut up ! Shut up ! Give him a break ! After all the joy he 's brought into your dismal lives , you ingrates ! Harry ! Oh ! Harry ! We 're so glad you 're back ! Glad you 're safe , man . Thanks . Why the hell am I wearing a diaper ? ! [ Noise downstairs ] That must be them . Ok , let 's get this thing straight . We are not gonna let them keep dragging us into their insanity . Damn right ! This magnificent rottweiler 's taking off the choke chain starting right now ! Follow my lead . Hey , Don . Sally . Miss me ? Don ! Aw , shut up ! Hey ! Harry 's back ! In the house ! Harry , where were you ? ! Oh , it 's a long story . Hey , you know what ? You and I ought to take a shower . 'Cause you smell like a monkey . [ Making monkey noises ] [ Squealing ] Tommy , where was Harry ? A freak show . You know , bearded ladies , Siamese twins--the usual . Why won 't anyone tell me anything ? ! I 'm sorry , Mary . Things have been a little crazy , and I haven 't exactly been myself . I hope you can forgive me . Well , Dick , I--I don 't think I can . What do you say you and I go down to blascott 's ? I 'll tell you the whole story over a warm glass of brandy . Oh , that sounds nice . Great . Let me just change out of this diaper , huh ? Harry , I couldn 't help but notice the way that bearded lady was lookin ' at you . Tell me the truth . Did anything happen between the two of you ? Vicki , a man gets awful lonely on the road . And I can 't say that I wasn 't tempted . But every time I came close , there was just one thing that I couldn 't get out of my mind . Oh , Harry . Me ? No . She had a beard .

All for allowing us the privilege of introducing you to Vinylright siding , The thousand-Year siding that never needs painting or maintenance . Manufactured in America from- - Hello ? Manufactured in America from space-Age polymers , It beautifies while it protects , while it- - While it- - Hello ? Hello ? Mrs. Loach , Listen very carefully . It 's here ! sir , agents Mulder and Scully are here . Send them in . - Sir ? - Agents , have a seat . I need you to go to Chicago as soon as possible ... To perform a threat assessment . A threat assessment for whom ? Vinylright . They make siding . Their telemarketing hub in oak brook was the focus ... Of an anonymous audiotaped manifesto , one which threatened violence . Apparently , several years back , they had an incident in another office , A disgruntled employee with a gun . They feel they can 't be too careful . Why can 't the Chicago field office take care of it ? Because I prefer you did . Because the manifesto contains bizarre overtones , Claims of a paranormal nature ? It speaks of a monster stalking employees . Your insight into such claims should aid ... In assessing the threat , if any , posed by this person . Monsters . I 'm your boy . Must have done something to piss him off . What do you mean ? Get stuck with this jerk-Off assignment . Or have I finally reached that magic point in my career ... Where every time somebody sees Bigfoot ... Or the virgin Mary on a tortilla , I get called out of my basement warren to offer my special insight on the matter . You 're saying " I " a lot . I heard " we . " Nor do I assume that this case is just a waste of our time . Not yours , anyway . There 's no reason both of us should go to Chicago . I 'll take care of it . Mulder ! I 'm monster boy , right ? This was forwarded to us by a local radio station . Whoever sent it wanted them to play it over and over again , 24 hours a day . They elected not to . attention , people of Illinois . This is a warning of the utmost urgency . At Vinylright , 12340 Wabash Terrace in Oak Brook , there is a monster- - An evil one that preys on the people there . But they can 't see it because it hides in the light . I see it . I know where to look . I can 't be the only one . We all must hunt it down and kill it . Because if we don 't , It will take us all . you recognize the voice ? We have 96 employees . Anyway , I 'm hoping it 's not one of our people . But I don 't know who else it would be . Your company had a violent incident in its recent history ? We have a plant in Kansas City . Back in ' 94 , one of the warehouse guys came in with a gun , threatened everybody . I think it was over a woman . May I borrow the tape ? Keep it . So , I know our home office has to call you guys for insurance reasons . But this is probably just a crank , right ? Some guy making a joke ? It 's best to err on the side of caution . Can you hire security for the building ? If you think we need to . I 'm also conducting my own internal investigation- - Interviewing employees , seeing if they 're happy . Use your best judgment . I 'll be in touch . Scully . Hi , it 's me . I need you to check on something . What ? It 's a phrase- - " Hiding in the light . " It 's on this tape that I 'm looking into . - The case that 's a total waste of time ? - Yes , And I didn 't say that it wasn 't . " To hide in the light " or " hiding in the light " - - Some form of that . I think it 's in an old case file somewhere that I 've got hidden away . Which one ? There 's hundreds . I 'm not sure , but I appreciate it . " Hiding in the light . " Nancy Aaronson , come to my office , please . Uh-Oh . Now I did it . Nancy . Yeah ? Nancy Aaronson , come to my office , please . What , Gary ? Don 't . Don 't what ? Gary , I love you , buddy , But you 're really , really weird . Dial and smile , Gary . Mark Backus , come to my office , please . Mark Backus , come to my office , please . See ? Nothing to it . He just wants to say hi to everybody . He 's going alphabetically . Hey , Gary . Gary Lambert . ... Wabash terrace in oak brook , there is a monster , An evil one , that preys on the people there . But they can 't see it because it hides in the light . I see it . I know where to look . I can 't be the only one . Urgency . At Vinylright , 12340 Wabash terrace in oak brook , There is a monster , an evil one that preys on the people there . But they can 't see it because it hides in the light . I see it . I know where to look . I can 't be the only one . We all must hunt it down and kill it . Because if we don 't , It will take us all . Mulder . " hiding in the light . " That was a phrase spoken by one Jerrold Resnick ... To a Lakeland , Florida , police investigator ... On august 9 , 1992 . What was he describing ? Well , Mr. Resnick was a deacon of his local church . And apparently he was concerned that ... There was an evil presence amongst his parishioners , And that he alone was aware of that fact . He was trying to warn them ? Not as such . He showed up for mass one Sunday with four handguns . He began wounding people , saying , " The afflicted ones wouldn 't bleed . " He committed suicide a week later in his cell . Scully , at the risk of you telling me " I told you so , " I think it 's time for you to get down here and help me . I told you so . Hello ? Hello ? who are you ? Who 's the Agent in charge ? Agent rice . Tall guy in the suit . I 'm Scully , Agent Mulder 's partner . What can you tell me ? Not much . TV news got the call . That man 's voice told them they were gonna need to broadcast a stunning revelation . Since then , we keep ringing the phones , but nobody answers . - Who 's inside ? - We can 't be sure of the total . It happened over lunch hour , so it could have been worse . The lot 's only got 18 cars in it . One of them 's a rental , registered to an Agent Mulder . - We 're about to try him on his cell phone . - No . Not until we get a clearer idea of the situation . There 's a small cafeteria in the building . We think our guy 's got everyone barricaded . He couldn 't have picked a better spot . One door , no windows . We 're not gonna get a clearer idea of the situation unless someone in there talks to us . If you make a phone call right now , it could compromise Agent Mulder . Sir , we need to find another way . move ! Now get down . Down . Everybody stop crying . Just shut up ! Everybody needs to be afraid of him . He 's the one that 's out to get you . I 'm protecting you . Gary , what are you talking about ? Shut up ! I 'm not addressing you . I 'm addressing the actual people over here , okay ? I 'm not talking to you ... Or you or you ! Why should we be afraid of Mr. Pincus , Gary ? I 'd really like to hear what you have to say . Who are you , anyway ? My name is Mulder . You said that already . What are you doing here ? - Applying for a job . - oh , man . Did you come to the wrong place . I get that . Why should we be afraid of Mr. Pincus , Gary ? Because he 's a monster . Only you can 't see that ... Because he 's clouded all your minds . But he means to take us all , One by one . Harvest our souls . Make us into his zombies . Robots made out of meat . God almighty . Gary , I want to believe that you 're protecting us , but , uh , I 'm kind of afraid of that rifle . It makes it hard for us actual people to concentrate on what you 're saying . Why are you talking to me like I 'm a three-Year-Old ? Don 't act like you understand what I 'm talking about , Because you don 't . But you will . Shh ! Everybody hold their breath . Oh , you sons of bitches . Oh , Gary ! What are you doing ? - Gary ? shots fired . Shots fired . Everybody , hold your fire ! What 's going on ? he made us . He 's shooting . Sounds like an ak . We got to find out what the hell 's going on in that building . I 'm calling your partner . No ! If it was safe to do so , he would have called us already . Agent Scully , we don 't have a lot of options here . It 's just my cell phone . Let me get it . Put your hands behind your head . F.B.I. ? You happy now ? Huh ? You want to mess with me some more ? hello ? Hello ? Is anybody on the line ? We heard gunfire . Is everyone all right ? I just shot a zombie . Everybody thinks I killed him , but I didn 't . - Who am I speaking to ? - The guy that 's gonna start killing actual people ... If you don 't put me on the damn TV ! I think he just shot a hostage . Who ? He 's still asking for his 15 minutes of fame . Give it to him . Get it out of sight . You want to know why it jumped at me like that ? It 's not an " it , " Gary . It 's a " he . " It 's a man you just killed . - What was his name ? - Mark Backus . Wrong ! It stopped being Mark Backus when he turned it into a zombie . And then he instructed it by means of mental telepathy to attack me . And so I shot it . I had no choice . But it doesn 't matter , because it was already dead . He wants us all like that . Insects , not people . Mindless drones . He wants to take away who we are . To control us , So we 'll be his eyes and ears ... And spy on each other and help him do his dirty work . Gary , if I 'm the monster , What do you need these people for ? Why don 't you just let ' em all go ? You just wait till I put you on TV . Then they 'll see what you are . Answer the phone , Gary . Dial and smile . okay . We 're sending you the cameraman now . Just stay calm . Finally . Let 's do it . Warren , that is exactly what we 're hearing . All you people put your butts against the door . Hurry it up . Go ! You . Get over by the camera . Move it ! ... momentarily to an actual live feed- - This person or people may have something important to say . See who 's getting hurt if you bust down this door ? Apparently , so far there 's been very little communication ... - Between the police and the people inside the building . - Is he getting this ? Yeah . Closed circuit is bouncing it right back into the building . He thinks he 's gonna be a star . All right . Show us the room . what are you doing ? hold on . My battery cable 's twisted . Well , untwist it ! And hurry the hell up ! There ! Right there ! The exterior wall 's clear . Entry team into position . Lie down on the floor . Do it ! all right . Put me on . Okay . We 're gonna cut inside . Yes , here it is . Here we go . People of America , A monster walks among you . Go , pan over . Get up . - Now I 'll show it to you . - No , Gary . - Get out of the way . - Don 't do this . Get out of the way . Don 't do this , Gary . - Get out of the way ! - Put down the rifle . Get out of the way now ! There ! Look at it ! Look at it ! See ? line up against the wall ! Now you know . You look exhausted . No , I 'm fine . Agent rice has the situation in hand . Let 's get you out of here . Mulder ? I can 't begin to thank you . I owe you my life . We all do . Do you have any idea why he fixated on you the way he did ? No . Not at all . I feel like I barely even knew the man . I mean , I try to be a good guy to work for . You mentioned another incident with another employee ... At a plant in Kansas City in 1994 ? - Yes . - Were you at that plant at that time ? I wasn 't there when it happened , but yeah . Didn 't I mention that ? What about Lakeland , Florida ? Have you ever lived there ? I 've been there . I have relatives there . Is there anything else ? Uh , no , Mr. Pincus . Thank you very much for your patience . What 's going on ? I don 't know . - Mulder , why didn 't you take the day off ? - Close the door . There was a reason the phrase " hiding in the light " seemed so familiar to me . I found it or variations of it in five other X-Files . " Hiding in plain view , " " hiding in the open , " " lurking in the open " - - All to describe some manifestation of evil ... Which goes unnoticed by everyone except the claimant in each case . Have you slept ? Seven cities in all , dating back ten years . Vinylright has offices within 50 miles of four of those cities . Greg Pincus has worked for Vinylright for guess for how long ? Ten years . What exactly is it that you think you have here ? What if Gary Lambert was right ? - Mulder , you 're not serious . - Just bear with me for a moment . I mean , what if such a creature existed that could camouflage itself ... By clouding the minds of its victims ? There are antecedents for it in nature right in the insect world . Mantis , for instance . They 're said to be able to hypnotize their prey . No . What if it could induce a visual hallucination ? A sort of temporary conversion disorder ? What you 're describing would be more like some kind of ... Visual agnosia , An inability to recognize what 's before one 's eyes . Only Gary Lambert could see through it somehow , as could the others . Maybe because of some heightened adrenaline level , Or maybe just because he knew where to look somehow . Mulder , he was disturbed . Yeah , but did he see it because he was disturbed , Or was he disturbed because he saw it ? He was mentally ill . This monster was a- - Was a sick fantasy , A product of his dementia . I saw it too . Does that make me disturbed ? Demented ? Does that make me sick too ? No . No , I mean , this kind of thing is not uncommon . You- - You went through a terrible ordeal . And sometimes people in close associations ... Under tense conditions can- - The delusions of one can be passed on to the other . Folie a deux ? It 's not that , Scully . It 's not Helsinki syndrome either . What I saw was real , and there may be a way to prove it . How ? Lambert pointed out certain individuals he said had been victimized by Pincus . Turned into zombies . The man he shot , Backus , was one of them . If you could autopsy the body- - No . No , absolutely not . Scully , if this is all in my mind , as you say it is , I would be very grateful if you would prove that . Mulder , I am not going to serve the delusions of Gary Lambert , A madman , by giving credence to them . Then I 'll prove it without you . Mulder- - what are we looking for ? I 'll know it when I see it . What 's this about ? Lambert was tracking his boss 's movements over the years . Stalking him . Gathering evidence . What is it ? Did you see her ? Did you see where she went ? Who ? You mind telling me what 's going on here ? Sir ? You wanted to see me ? Yes , I was hoping you could give me some insight into Agent Mulder 's recent behavior . Sir ? Why is he back in Illinois ? I thought that case was closed . Agent Mulder believes that there may be a connection ... Between the oak brook incident and several other cases . But you elected not to join him . The Chicago field office has been in contact with him . They describe his behavior as being erratic . To the best of my knowledge , Agent Mulder is currently working ... On a legitimate investigation . I will join him in Illinois immediately . Don 't you have an autopsy to do first ? This body Mulder sent to Quantico . Mark Backus , the shooting victim . You 're scheduled to do an examination . - Or didn 't you know that ? - I 'll get right on it , sir . Is there something you want to tell me , Scully ? No , sir . let 's start with the photos . In fact , let 's just do photos . External exam only . This guy came an awful long way just to have his picture taken . Knock yourself out . Case number 986522 . Mark Backus , 45-Year-Old Caucasian male . There are three one-Centimeter gunshot entry wounds ... On the left anterior chest wall ... - With some burn stippling present . - Come on , Mulder . Judging from the corpse 's resolved rigor and fixed lividity , As well as the decompositional bloating , I 'd place the time of death between 48 and 72 hours . No . This man died late yesterday afternoon . Are you sure ? Absolutely . It sure looks to me like he 's been dead longer than that . I want to do that too . Suddenly I became aware of this ... presence . And I could feel it creeping toward me . It was terrifying . The next thing I knew , this madman 's inside my house . He breaks my window , kicks in the door , And the whole time he 's screaming about monsters- - I mean , even worse than Gary . Miss Starns , I apologize for this incident . I assure you it will receive my utmost attention . Why don 't you take the rest of the week , Gretchen ? Thank you , Mr. Pincus . That man has no business carrying a gun , if you ask me . - You got to her , too , didn 't you ? - Agent Mulder- - I was too late . You changed her somehow . You infected her . Agent Mulder , think very carefully about the next words that come out of your mouth . Once again , I apologize . Oh , there 's no need . I 'm well aware of the stress Agent Mulder 's been under , And I 'm , uh- - Well , I still consider him a hero . Which is why I want to handle this privately . We appreciate that . For my part , I 'm happy to let this entire matter drop . I 'm sure I can persuade Miss Starns to do the same , Provided Agent Mulder is amenable . You don 't see what 's going on here . I 'm afraid I do . Lambert knew your secret . He knew you were sucking the humanity ... Out of these people , feeding on them . Agent Mulder , that 's enough . I don 't want to hear another word out of you . If you care about your career , then you 'll knock this crap off . Because I guarantee I will not stand for another second of this abuse . Do you understand me- - Get out of the way ! Get out of here ! No ! Stop it ! Look at him ! Look at him ! Stop it . five years together , Scully . You must have seen this coming . Did you examine Backus 's body ? What did you find ? More or less what we thought we 'd find . More or less ? What is that supposed to mean ? The body showed signs of decomposition beyond what we expected to find . Which in and of itself means nothing , really . Time of death is notoriously hard to quantify . Or that Lambert was telling the truth , and that man was dead before he was gunned down . No , Mulder . Scully , when that monster , Pincus , whatever the hell you want to call it , When he attacked that woman last night , he did something to the back of her neck . He bit her there , or he injected something in there . There 's got to be evidence of that . You gotta check for that . Mulder , the case is over . There 's no more evidence to be gathered . There 's only my hope that you 'll be able to see past this delusion . You ... have to be willing to see . I wish it were that simple . Scully , you have to believe me . Nobody else on this whole damn planet does or ever will . You 're my one in five billion . Well , you just made it . I was about to ship him . Full autopsy this time ? No . Let 's flip him . Flip him over ? Yep . Give me a hand . We can do without these , huh ? What do you say ? Sorry . there we go . Sleep tight . Don 't let the bedbugs bite . Nurse ! Nurse ! Nurse ! It 's here ! Nurse ! It 's here ! It 's here ! It 's at the window ! - What 's here ? - There is something- - There is something at the window , and it 's trying to get in here . Please unstrap me so that I can stop it . Sir- - Sir , we 're three floors up . There 's nothing at the window . Just ... un-Undo my straps so that I can check . I can show you- - No , don 't ! No ! Just , please- - Please . See ? Nothing 's gonna get you . Okay . Just , uh- - Just untie me anyway , please . What are you doing ? You just need some fresh air . I can 't be running in here all night , okay ? Help ! Somebody help ! Very sorry , but it is after hours , and Mr. Mulder is resting . I 'll have to ask you to come back in the morning . I 've come a long way , and I know he wants to see me , so what do you say ? I 'm sorry , really . It 's hospital policy . help ! - Help ! Agent Scully , I have to say I 'm at a bit of a loss here . Do I infer correctly from this that you believe there 's some ... Merit to Agent Mulder 's claims ? I believe that Agent Mulder is mentally sound ... And fit for duty . Aside from that belief , I can only present to you ... The few hard facts that I 've been able to gather- - That , as per Agent Mulder 's assertions , A toxin has been found to have been injected into the spine ... Of the shooting victim , Mark Backus . As of yet , we 've been unable to identify it . Furthermore , Gregory Pincus has apparently disappeared without a trace , Along with half a dozen other key witnesses ... Integral to this investigation , Among them Agent Mulder 's nurse at the hospital ... And several of Vinylright employees . Men and women described by Mulder as zombies . I personally can vouch for the fact that ... There was an intruder in Agent Mulder 's hospital room . Describe this intruder . It was dark . You must 've gotten a glimpse . What did you see ? What did you tell him ? The truth , as well as I understand it . which is ? Folie a deux- - A madness shared by two . Mr. Jacox , let me take a few moments to tell you ... About the advantages of weather right replacement windows . They keep down high heating and cooling costs . They beautify- - They beautify and add value to your home as well as- - Mr. Jacox ! it 's here ! I made this !

 [ Coyote Howling ] [ Engine Running ] How strong are you ? Test me . [ Alarm Clock Ringing ] [ Electronic Voice ] You have mail . [ Typing ] [ Insects Buzzing ] Morning . I 'm new in town , and I was supposed to meet a friend . I was wondering if you gentlemen might have seen him . Look , I don 't mean to interrupt your game , but it would be nice if you at least looked at me . They can 't hear you . - Excuse me ? - Those are the Mitchell brothers . They 're deaf as posts . They said , " Looks like " " Looks like it 's gonna be another hot day . " - You speak sign language . - Deputy Miller . - Jarod - Barber . We don 't get many visitors to Dry River , Mr. Barber . What brings you to town ? Well , actually , I 'm here to meet a friend . Maybe you 've seen him . He 's 50-something , distinguished-looking . - Distinguished . - Mm-hmm . I 'd remember him , wouldn 't I ? I think I 've probably taken up enough of your time , Deputy . Have a nice day . I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to ask you to stick around a while longer . - Excuse me ? - You 're gonna have to come with me , sir . And why would I want to do that ? Because if you don 't , I 'm going to have to kill you . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . So much for anonymous tips aboutJarod . Well , the - the guy said we 'd find what we wanted right here . If we were looking for urban blight and the overwhelming stench of urine ... he was right on the money . Think we 're being led astray ? Thank you , Sherlock . Pink . Oh . I let Debbie do the laundry . She ... kinda got the colors mixed with the whites . And I don 't want to hurt her feelings . Don 't let her cut the grass . I want our team to sweep the area . I want everything within a 50-foot radius brought back to the Centre . Miss Parker . There 's something here you should see . [ Sydney ] Parker , are you all right ? Your mother 's identification card . And the expiration date has been changed . It seems Jarod has cultivated a darker sense of humor since we last spoke . Did I miss something ? The new expiration date - it 's the same day her mother was killed . [ Jarod ] Everyone who 's arrested has the privilege of making one phone call . You 're not under arrest . You 're being detained for questioning . - About what ? - Sheriff Delmont will explain it all to you when he gets back . - This is crazy . - Just go with the flow ... and nobody 'll get hurt . Ms. Miller , come quick . It 's J.R. J.R. ? What happened ? We were tossing around the football , and he just passed out . - Go get Dr. Craner . - He 's gone to Tucson for the day . We 've gotJ.R. inside the church , but he 's out cold . I have some medical training . This is my son we 're talking about . I can help . [ Siren Wailing ] J.R. ? You kids get back . Get back . J.R. , honey ? Sweetie , can you hear me ? - J.R. ? - He 's in shock . - He 's still breathing . - Oh , he 's hypoglycemic . When was the last time he ate ? Um , he had , uh , cereal for breakfast , three , four hours ago . - Only water since he was here . - Wake up . ! - Is he gonna be okay ? - J.R. ? Come on , honey . What do you think you 're doing ? I need to stabilize his blood sugar . I 'm gonna stick this in your mouth . I want you to let it dissolve , okay ? Good boy . - Mom ? - Oh ! [ Laughs ] It 's okay , honey . It 's okay . Everything 's gonna be okay . - How is he feeling ? - Better . He has a heart condition . I noticed the bluish tint to his fingertips and his lips . I 'd say by the looks of it , it 's congenital . You have a very sick boy . - Are you a doctor ? - Not at the moment . - [ Sighs ] - Why hasn 't he had a heart transplant ? [ Vehicle Approaching ] - [ Vehicle Door Opens , Closes ] - Because he 's on a waiting list . Because he has AB-negative blood , which is very rare . It only happens in certain families . One in 300,000 . I know . I have it too . This is the guy ? [ Sydney ] I may have found Jarod . I received this e-mail from him today . Hmm . And you say you didn 't send this refuge message toJarod ? If I had , would I be showing it to you ? That 's a good point . What is this Dry River place anyway ? According to the computer , there 's a Dry River in southwest Arizona . [ Auto-Dialing ] This is Parker . Have the jet prepared . Well , get it out of the hangar . Forget it ! - Book me a seat on the next commercial flight to - - [ Snapping Fingers ] - Phoenix . - Phoenix . And I 'll pick up the ticket at the gate . Uh , well , you 're going alone ? I 'm a big girl , Broots . Have this stuff analyzed by Cousin It . - Angelo ? - I don 't like dead ends , Sydney . Especially when they concern my mother . - Hold this . - Then he helped J.R. back to the squad car ... - and we brought him back here . - A touching story . Sheriff , he had every opportunity to escape . But he didn 't even think about running . - What 's your point ? - He helped save my son . Surely , there 's another way we can handle this . There 's not . You did a decent thing for the boy , and I 'm grateful . But if you give me one second of trouble , I 'm gonna shoot you dead . - You understand me ? - Completely . All right , let 's go . It 's a lucky thing I showed up here today . Your deputy has a pretty sick boy on her hands . He could 've died . It must be difficult watching someone you love suffer like that . What about you , Sheriff ? Do you have any family ? I think it 's gonna be a whole lot easier if you and I don 't get to know each other . Get out . Let 's go . Go straight . Move ! Go right over there . Stay there . Let 's go . [ Growling , Barking ] Go on . - Somebody cut themselves ? - Sit down over there . Look , it 's pretty obvious by the way I 've been treated that something terrible has happened . Why don 't you tell me what it is ? - I can 't . - Why not ? [ Man ] Because I won 't let him . - Lyle . - Gone but not forgotten . And ... so it begins . [ Broots ] This is all the stuff brought in from the dead-end street . Y - You think he 'll be able to help ? Empaths possess such finely tuned instincts , Broots ... they can 't be hurried or discouraged . [ Sniffs ] - Or grossed out , apparently . - I thinkJarod believes ... the initial refuge signal to be authentic . Add to that the , uh , phony tip on his recent whereabouts ... and it becomes clear that someone has lured him to Arizona . [ Clattering ] Jarod could be in serious trouble . I believe he is . The question is from whom ? Angelo , could you give it a rest already ? Wait . - He can 't pick it up . - Hmm . Why ? The person Angelo is empathing ... doesn 't have a thumb . - How long have I been out ? - A couple hours . Ooh , that 'll be a good one . - You sent the message . - You really are a genius . How did you find out about refuge ? You forget . Before I found myself thumbless in the desert ... I was head rat at the cheese factory . You may have taken off with the D.S.A. ' s ... but I had access to surveillance videos of every conversation you and Sydney ever had . I wish you could 've seen your face when you first saw me . [ Laughs ] It was priceless . Your thumb looks pretty bad . If you don 't take care of it , you could lose the whole hand . It 'll be fine . You seem to have captured loyal support from the locals . Sheriff Delmont ? Afraid his involvement ... has less to do with loyalty then it does survival . - I don 't follow . - My first acquisition after arriving in this little oasis ... was securing some leverage in the form of Mrs. Delmont . [ Straining ] You kidnapped his wife . And buried her in the desert . She 's currently being fed oxygen ... supplied by a five-horsepower gas generator ... which with an adapted fuel capacity of 15 gallons ... - should run for about - - Sixteen hours . Sixteen - Give or take a few minutes . As I check my watch , she should have life support remaining ... in the area of seven hours and 20 minutes . Oh ! You 'll appreciate this . She 's pregnant . Guess about ... six months . So , you see , our good sheriff is in no position to be anything but cooperative . You 're insane . Psychological diagnosis can be really subjective . - What do you want ? - Isn 't it obvious ? I want everything . - [ Ringing ] - [ Woman On P.A. ] If you are returning a vehicle ... - please park your car in the blue zone . - What ? - Lyle is alive . - What did you say ? Angelo had a severe reaction to one of the objects ... brought in from the dead-end street . I am certain Lyle is behind all of this . We 've been over this , Sydney . Lyle is dead . I shot him point-blank in the chest . - Think about it . - Sydney , y-you were there . Do you remember when they pulled his body from the river ? It was never positively identified , Parker . Lyle faked his death as a teenager . He just did it again . Parker ? Parker ? Look , you got what you wanted . Let the woman go . - Not until I finalize negotiations . - Negotiations ? The Triumvirate is preparing to meet to choose my permanent replacement . I intend to make that vote unnecessary . Now , where 's a clip-on tie when you need one ? You really think that the Centre 's gonna ... let you just walk right in there like nothing 's happened ? I bring back their golden boy , and it 's business as usual . First there 'll have to be changes made , obstacles removed . - Like Sydney and Miss Parker ? - Among others . How long do you think it 's going to be before someone decides to remove you ? Nothing 's forever . However , there is a way that we can assure our power base . - We ? - With your brains and my leadership skills ... there isn 't anything we couldn 't accomplish . - I can be your friend , Jarod . - Like you were my friend when you tried to stop my heart . [ Screaming ] Why did you try to kill me ? Hey . I just got a call from my deputy . She says there 's a tall , dark brunette woman ... asking questions about someone named Jarod and a man with a missing thumb . Parker . And this was going so well . Nothing 's forever . If you ever want to see that wife of yours again , get rid of her . Now . I believe there are two very dangerous men here in Dry River . - You a cop ? - I work for a private corporation . And we 've been tracking these men for some time . Have you seen them ? Those people dead ? Murdered , execution style . - And that one ? - Jarod . He has a history of mental illness . I 've been instructed by his family to bring him home . - I haven 't seen him . - Sheriff , my information is certain . [ Sheriff Delmont ] Dry River 's a small town , ma 'am . - I 'm sorry , but I can 't help you . - Is everything all right ? Oh , everything 's fine , J.R. - Hello . - Hello . - How you doing , buddy ? - A little tired . That 's why you need to rest . Come on . I 'll make you something to eat . Nice kid . What 's the matter with him anyway ? He 's dying . - We have to call somebody . - Who ? - The F.B.I. , the state police - - And accomplish what ? Have you seen this picture ? The man is a cold-blooded killer . - He 's got my wife buried in the desert . - But we can 't just stand - If this psycho even thinks that I 'm crossing him , Linda and the baby are dead . [ Jarod ] This really doesn 't surprise me . What 's that ? This " rising from the dead " game you keep playing . You pulled the same scam in high school . Only back then , you got really creative . You murdered your best friend . Then you set your own father up to take the fall . What do you know about my father ? I know that he 's rotting in a jail cell ... serving a life sentence for a crime you committed . - He got what he deserved . - What about your mom ? Did she deserve what she got ? Did I tell you I went to visit her ? Very nice lady . Only she seems a touched confused . Seems she was , uh , trying to feed a couple of dogs that didn 't really exist . You should not have gone there . She kept your bedroom just the way you left it . It 's all very cozy . One more word and you die . You kill me ... and you have nothing to bargain with . [ Coughs ] Which brings us to step two of the process . Look , I hate to throw a wrench in your plans ... - but it 's against the law to impersonate a doctor . - [ Laughs ] Now that 's funny . I 'm going to need something more substantial than photographs ... to demonstrate my resolve to the Triumvirate . - An offering , if you will . - An offering ? You should consider yourself fortunate . You 'll be asleep when I cut off your thumb . No . Miss Parker ? She 's gone . She showed me a picture of you with a bunch of murdered people . Casualties of war . Is there something else ? I want my wife back ! You said when you had what you wanted , you 'd let her go . You ever seen a human being suffocate ? It 's not an easy way to die . Now , your family has slightly less than three hours of life remaining . Unless , of course , you want to arrest me . [ Vehicle Approaching ] - It 's Parker . - She followed me . Get rid of her . Now . This is private prop - - Whoa ! - [ Exhales ] Sheriff . I know they 're here . Like I said , Miss Parker , I don 't know what you 're talking about . Then how did you know my name ? I never mentioned it . I don 't know what he 's holding over your head , Sheriff ... but trust me , it will not end well for anyone . I can help you if you just let me . - I wish I could do that . - [ Cocks ] You 're under arrest for trespassing . Hand over the weapon . Please ... don 't do this . Don 't fight the medication . There 's nothing you can do to stop it now . Please . No . [ Groans ] - Raines said you were dead . - Not hardly . They said ... you were dead . Not hardly , big brother . Sydney , this was just delivered for you . - Who 's it from ? - Receiving . What is it ? Jesus . Who could 've taken these ? I decide who lives or dies . I decide who lives or dies . I decide who lives or dies . I decide who lives or dies . I decide who lives or dies . - I decide who lives or dies . - Kyle . - I decide who lives or dies . - Jarod 's brother 's alive too ? - [ Auto-Dialing ] - This is turning into Night of the Living Dead . Hi , this is Sydney . I need seats on the next flight out to Arizona . And get the , uh , Centre helicopter ready for immediate takeoff in Phoenix . [ Angelo Muttering ] I decide who lives or dies ! I decide who lives or dies . I thought you 'd never wake up . Kyle ? I thought you were dead . - Yeah , that was the idea . - [ Groans ] I saw you in the van . I - I saw it explode . No ! You saw the van explode , but I wasn 't inside it . When you escaped , I was able to crawl out ... and fire a shot into the fuel tank . My leg was injured , so I made my way up to the highway and caught a ride out . - How did you find me ? - I 've been following Parker and the others for months ... - hoping they 'd lead me back to you . - My thumb ... and the rest of me is so glad you did . Jarod , have you learned anything else about our parents ? Um - Sydney gave me this . His brother gave it to him before he died . Our father 's name ? I don 't know . I can 't believe - Where have you been ? In the shadows , waiting , watching . Now that we 're together again , I can finish this . Finish what ? I sent a package of photographs that 'll bring the others here soon . It 's almost over , brother . We 'll start with Lyle . - Kyle , what happened to him ? - He tripped and hit his head . - We 've less than an hour . - What are you talking about ? Lyle kidnapped a woman and buried her alive somewhere out in the desert . We have less than an hour before her air supply runs out . Jarod , we can 't leave now . This is our chance to end this once and for all . - And we 'll start with him . - Did you hear what I said ? There is a woman and her unborn baby buried alive somewhere out in the desert . And if we work together , we can save their lives . Lyle and the others deserve to die . And if they do , what chance do we ever have of finding our parents ? Look , I know you 're angry ... but there 's more important things in life than vengeance . Let me show you how good it feels to save a life instead of trying to destroy one . Kyle . We 'll need to know where he buried her , right ? Relax , brother . This is what I do . I hope you like meat loaf . I live for it . The sheriff said your son is sick . He has a heart condition , yeah . I 'm sorry . He seemed like a really nice young man . Yes , he is . - You have to let me out . - I told you I can 't do that . You know , my mother died when I was almost your son 's age . And I know how hard it is to lose someone that you care about . That 's why I promise you that the sheriff ... and anyone else Lyle has involved in this mess ... will die unless I walk out of here . - You don 't understand . - I understand perfectly , Deputy . I think you need to get out there and take another good look at those pictures ... because that is exactly what will happen unless you prevent it . - You don 't know what he - - What ? What ? He 's gotten the sheriff 's wife buried alive out in the desert . Then we don 't have much time , do we ? We must be close to the place . Kill the motors . [ Motor Whirring ] There 's a generator . It 's coming from just over that rise . Come on . Down there . [ Motor Sputters , Stops ] [ Kyle ] There it is . It 's out of fuel . Hurry . - Find the feeding tube . - Got it . Dig . [ Muffled Yells ] - [ Strains ] It 's sealed tight . - Watch it . Hurry . There can 't be much air left in there . [ Hisses ] Easy . Okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Okay . Okay . Oh , God ! Thank you . [ Sobbing ] It 's okay . Y-You 're safe now . You 're safe now . [ Fluttering ] [ Metal Clanging ] Going somewhere , slick ? Miss Parker , how nice to see you again . I wish I could say the same . What happened to you ? Jarod 's little brother wanted some information . Kyle is here ? We negotiated . I lost . Doesn 't anybody ever really die anymore ? You left that envelope on that sign . What gave me away ? Jarod 's a pain in the ass , but he 's not heartless . That 's for my mother , and this is for me . [ Barking ] You - [ Groans ] God , you 're beautiful when you 're angry . Oh ! [ Laughs ] Oh , my God . ! - Oh , God ! - Oh ! Oh , my God . Are you all right ? I was so scared . - Where is he ? - We left him chained up at the compound . I 'm gonna sit you down , okay ? You 're gonna be all right now , okay ? - What are you gonna do ? - What do you think ? Sheriff , wait . Let us handle it . - The man almost killed my family . - Which is exactly why ... you need to get your wife and baby to a hospital and make sure they 're okay . - [ Rifle Cocks ] - No . Now , you boys be careful . Don 't worry , Sheriff . I 'm no hero . [ Sydney On Radio ] The sheriff said the foundry is on the edge of town . - He 's not in the trailer . - And not anywhere in the building . [ Sighs ] He 's gone . Which means he 's out there . Somewhere . Let 's head back to the hospital . I want to see how the sheriff 's wife is doing . You were right , you know ? About what ? About how it feels to help someone . When that woman grabbed me after I saved her life and thanked me - [ Exhales ] It was like nothing I had ever felt before . I 've been angry for so long , so bull of rage and revenge ... I 'd forgotten what it was like ... to care about someone . That 's all going to change ... now that we 're together . I promise . Come on . Let 's go . Oh , this is beautiful . ! It 's just one big , happy family , isn 't it ? It 's the end of the line , Lyle . There 's no place left for you to run . I 'm disappointed in you , Jarod . You know me better than that . If there 's one thing I don 't do easy , it 's die . Drop the cannon , kid . - Shoot him , you moron ! - Shut up ! Stay back , or I put a very large hole in big brother . - Kyle . - Threats and pain ... that 's all you 've ever offered us . You stole our lives , and you killed our spirit . Now you think you can threaten us with death . It doesn 't matter , Lyle , because we never made a difference anyway . I 'll kill him . I swear I will . And then I 'll kill you . Don 't do this , Kyle . [ Kyle ] By the way , Lyle ... how 's that knife wound ? [ Groans ] [ Indistinct Murmuring ] You stay with me , little brother . I 'm gonna get you to a hospital . It 's too late , Jarod . Don 't you say that . Look at me . Come on . Just-Just think . Think about all the good times we 're gonna have together . I 'm sorry , Jarod . For what ? For everything . No . It 's time to come home now , Jarod . Where 's Lyle ? We 'll find him . All right , nobody move ! Mister , I - I don 't know who you are ... but I figured I owe you at least one " get out of jail free " card . There are two of us , Sheriff . What 's to say we won 't shoot you right now ? Well , mostly because this is a 10-gauge pump action shotgun ... that will pretty much cut anything in half that it 's aimed at . And right now , it 's aimed at you , lady . Jarod - I 'm sorry . Where will you be taking him ? Someplace where he can make a difference . [ Woman Over P.A. ] Trauma team to I.C.U. on Six West . Trauma team to I.C.U. on Six West . How is he , Doctor ? How 's my son ? Just fine . The new heart is functioning on its own . And barring complications , your boy should live a long and happy life . Oh , thank you . It was a stroke of luck we were able to find a donor to match your son 's blood type . Whoever that donor was , he 's a godsend . I don 't know about that , Doc , but he was a hero . [ Laughing ] Good for you , little brother . Good for you .

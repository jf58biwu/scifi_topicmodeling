 If there are no further motions , the superior court of the state of pennsylvania declares case number bd-237 closed . That 's why i suggested you file the joint summary with a joint petition because ... Thank you . My pleasure . Oh . All right . Okay . Okay . Sure . Excuse me . ? The mid twenty joys ? ? Around a heart that 's black and blue tattooed love boys ? No way . ? I tore my knees up getting to you ' cause i needed ? Here . ? To find out what the thing was for , been reading ? ? But , man , the time came to explore ? Thanks . ? I went apewire ? ? ' cause i thought ? ? Like i like it little tease ? ? But i didn 't mean it ? ? But you mess with the goods , doll and you gotta pay , yeah ? Anthese unknown craft ? Where were the majority sighted ? On route home , me , others , walk on the minefield by base . Long black car drive up , no door handle , no window . No persons drive . We run . Mines , explosion , but ... no sound . Nothin ' . Silent . You said others . Are any of them with you in america ? Yes . Three of us ... Can you verify ... Difficult . K.g.b. Still have much power . Yes . We are each mentioned ... Hello ? Hello . Mrs. Denunzio , hi . This is ed jerse over at fuller and siegel . How are you this morning ? Yeah , ed , the kids , you know . I understand . I just wanted to call and let you in on a stock ... That 's going public next week . It 's so hard after the holidays . Don 't hit her with that ! I mean it ! I 'm sorry . What ? A company in tucson called cryo-cord ... has achieved an amazing advancement in the technology of cryogenics . Uh-hmm . Stem cells from the blood of an umbilical cord ... may be transplanted in the treatment of many life - threatening diseases such as ... Loser . Such as ? What ? Diseases such as ? Before that . What did you say ? I didn 't say nothing . You were talking . the stock they bought is always going to come around . All right , then i just punch it up here ? Say it to my face . Right to my face . Now that i 'm in front of you , call me a loser to my face ! - Calm down . Trash her desk ! Why don 't you go home , ed ? We 'll discuss this later . I made a last-ditch effort to get out of it , but the bureau is holding fast to its federal employees vacation policy . I haven 't taken a day off in four years , so either i take a week vacation now , or they start not paying me for eight weeks ' vacation time . I don 't like it , but i got to do it . I got to pay the rent . I got to eat . Part of me can 't help thinking this is just another way to get me out of here . But it is only a week , and you 'll be here to keep an eye on things for me , so ... here 's a few things for you to keep an eye on while i 'm gone . Why don 't i have a desk ? What do you mean ? - I always assumed that that was your area . - Back there . We 'll have them send down another desk , and there won 't be any room to move around here , but we can put them close together , face-to-face . Maybe we can play some battleship . What is it you want me to keep an eye on ? That contact we met last night at the wall , who had the distinction of being present for a first . That being you abandoning me during questioning . In the future , i 'll make sure that all those people being interviewed ... provide you with a multimedia laser show to keep your interest maintained . In any case , his name is vsevlod pudovkin . He 's a russian immigrant with a doctorate in astronautical engineering . He and other contacts worked at a military space center in the republic of karelia . They smuggled out reverse engineered reports of two alien craft ... which crashed and were retrieved from the sea of barents . And these reports are for sale ? At a high price , yeah . Mm-hmm . Have you confirmed the identity of these individuals ? That 's your assignment while i 'm gone . I want you to run an i.n.s. Check and a bureau n.c.i.c. Check on these individuals , all of whom now reside in the little russia section of philadelphia . I 've also made arrangements for travel so you can administer eye-to-eye surveillance ... on their activities . - I 'm not going . - What do you mean ? Your contact , while interesting in the context of science fiction , was , at least in my memory , recounting a poorly veiled synopsis ... of an episode of rocky and bullwinkle . " Eenie , meenie , chili beanie , the spirits are about to speak " ? Rocky and bullwinkle are looking for an upsidasium mine . Boris badenov alters the road signs , which causes them to walk onto a secret military base , where they are picked up by a car with no windows and no door locks , and there are silent explosions from a compound called hushaboom . So you 're refusing an assignment based on the adventures of moose and squirrel ? Refusing an assignment ? That makes it sound like you 're my superior . Do what you want . Don 't go to philadelphia . But let me remind you i worked my ass off to get these files reopened . You were just assigned . This work is my life . And it 's become mine . - You don 't want it to be ? - This isn 't about you . Oh , maybe it is indirectly . I don 't know . I feel like i 've lost sight of myself , mulder . It 's hard to see , let alone find in the darkness of covert locations . I wish i could say that we 're going in circles , but we 're not . We 're going in an endless line . Two steps forwards and three steps back , while my own life is ... standing still . Maybe it 's good that we get away from each other for a while . - Where will you be ? - Ironically enough , it 's personal . It 's a ... place i always wanted to go , what i anticipate to be a spiritual journey . I hope to discover something about myself . Maybe you should do the same . Yes , mrs . Shimatsuno . Ma 'am , what if i swore to you it would never happen again ? I just would like another chance . I need another chance , mrs . Shimatsuno . Well , that stock i recommended ... virtual gambling ... is up . Mm-hmm ! Mm-hmm . Right . I understand . Thank you for your time . Good-bye . " Thank you for your time . " If you were any kind of man , you would have told her to kiss your ass . But no . Another woman sticks it to ya . Ain 't that right , eddie ? Hey ! I can hear you down there ! Stop it ! Knock it off ! I can hear you ! Be quiet down there ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Knock it off ! I can hear you ! ? I go downtown and roam around ? ? But every street i walk i find another dead end ? ? I 'm on my own ? You hear that ? It 's you , ed . It 's all about you ! ? To pretend ? Knock it off ! ? I know there 's someone just waitin ' somewhere ? ? I look around for her but she 's just not there ? ? Doesn 't somebody want to be wanted ? Good evening . My name is hannah , and this is spencer . Have you ever imagined what it would be like ... - do you hear that ? - ? Doesn 't somebody want ? Downstairs . What i hear is the confusing and troubling sound of over ... she 's trying to drive me crazy . Oh . We just talked to miss schilling , and i don 't believe she would ... somehow ... she knows what i 'm thinking . I don 't want to feel it , but they know , like psychics or something or an implant thing , trying to drive me crazy . They 've even programmed the tv to criticize me . ? Find my way ? There . You hear it ? There ! There ! There ! We 'll come back some other time . Mmm , mmm , mmm . You see ? Even the jehovah witness babe won 't waste her time on you . No woman would . And you just sit and take it . Take it like a man . ? Just like me ? Hey , what are you doing ? Get out of here . i 'm no different from anybody else . Get out of my apartment ! I 'm going to call the cops ! i start each day and end each night . No ! No ! Please ! Get out ! It gets really lonely all by myself . Now where is love , and who is love ? I got to know . ? Doesn 't somebody want to be wanted like me ? ? Where are you ? ? Doesn 't somebody want to be wanted like me ? ? Just like me ? ? Doesn 't somebody want to be wanted like me ? ? Where are you ? ? Doesn 't somebody want to be wanted like me ? Attaboy , lover . From now on , i 'm your right-hand gal . You and me . As long as i 'm with you , no one will ever hurt you . Never again ! Oh , hey , scully , it 's me . I 'm just calling to see how you 're doing . Give me a call on my cell when you get a chance . Just let me know where you 're at . Just watch yourself , all right ? That 's not my problem . You don 't understand . You did good work . Very nice . It 's just like in the window . But ... so what ? Why do you want to cover it ? Listen , friend , everyone gets tattoo they deserve . What if you don 't cover the whole thing ? Just the eyes and the mouth . Even if i say yes , it 's too soon . Skin must heal . I 'll pay you anything . Miss ? Miss ? You . You like this on his arm ? Wow . Uh ... Eddie ? The , uh ... the color ... the red on the lips ... it 's extraordinary . Something i find in soviet prison . I tell him everyone gets tattoo they deserve . Beautiful , cheap , thought over ... I thought i was your girl . Tattoo reflect on body what lies in person 's soul . you 'd break my heart over a cheap redhead ? Get them in prison ? Yes , used the sewing needle , paper clip . You talk to her , and i 'm gonna be bad ! Ink is burned shoe leather , charcoal shavings , urine . I find grasses grow in prison yard , rye and such . Only use now , on that tattoo . Svo . Pardon me . You look . Mm-hmm . Thank you . Mind some advice from a stranger ? Make sure you 've thought it over before you get it done . You didn 't get the tattoo you deserve ? Mine was , uh , too impulsive . Never say never ? Yeah . Sometimes i wish i were that impulsive . Careful what you wish for . There 's more fashionable places in the city . How did you end up here ? I 'm in town visiting my aunt in the neighborhood . How about you ? There 's a real crummy bar across the street . It 's good for when you 're feelin ' down , and i was kind of down last week , and , uh ... so it wasn 't so much impulsive as it was hammered ? Have you , um , seen much of philadelphia ? No . There 's a couple of really nice restaurants by the river , if you 're interested . I 'd like that . But , um , i , uh , i 'm leaving tonight . Ah . Uh , if you 're ever in town again ... that 's my home number . I work there mainly . - Hello ? - Scully ? - Mulder , what 's wrong ? - Nothing 's wrong . I 'm at that special place , and i wanted to share it with you . You know that elvis bought all the furniture in just 30 minutes ? - How did you know where i was ? - I checked where we always stay in philadelphia . I knew you wouldn 't abandon me . How 's the case going ? I 've handed it over to the philadelphia bureau . The philadelphia bureau ? They don 't know or care about the x files . What are you doing ? Mulder , there is no x file . Your contact is connected to the vorovskoi mir . Extortion , credit fraud , cons . He is nothing but a swindler . How do you know ? What do you mean , how do i know ? You assigned me the background check . I did as told , as always . Hold off until i get there , okay ? - You don 't think i 'm capable ? - Of course i believe you 're capable . It 's just that in this case i need you to ... it 's not just in this case , mulder . What 's the agent 's name in philadelphia ? It is over . Done . Pudovkin is out of our hands . Look , mulder , i have to go . What , you got a date or something ? Y-you 're kidding ? I have everything under control . I will talk to you later . Isn 't it better this way , baby ? Me and you alone ? Women are so petty , jealous , controlling . That bitch today would have been just like all the others . Hello ? Um , hi . Ed jerse , please . This is him . It 's dana . We met today . My flight was canceled because of this storm , and i was just wondering if i could take you up on dinner . I think it 's worth fighting a little snow . One thing , my ... my car is in the shop . We 'll have to meet . I could pick you up . Give me an hour ? Good . Well , i 'll see you then . Go ahead . Treat yourself . This girl is a real doll . But beauty 's only skin deep , baby . I go all the way to the bone . Miss schilling ? Huh . She said she 'd be here . I don 't understand . Miss schilling ? Hi . Hi . I 'm , uh , early . The storm 's not so bad . It 's supposed to get bad later tonight . Come on in . I 'll be ready in a second . at least we can forego the " what a nice place you have " formalities . Ed , i , uh ... i don 't go out very much . I think the last time i went on a date was to seeglengarry glen ross , and the characters in the movie had a much better time . Ed , you 're bleeding . Oh , uh , it 's just the damn tattoo . Here . I 'm a doctor . Do you want me to take a look at it ? No , it 's okay . It 's been nothin ' but trouble . I hope you like this place . I made reservations . Ed ... the , uh ... the crummy bar you told me about ... take me there . Hey ! So what makes this place a good place to go when you 're feeling down ? It 's kind of ... everyone here looks like their problems are worse than mine . Makes me feel good about myself . Yeah , but you can 't tell what 's going on in somebody 's head just by looking at them . They 're probably thinking we 're the ones that are screwed up . Are we ? Who knows ? I mean , sometimes i , uh ... i 've always gone around in this , uh ... this circle . It usually starts when an authoritative ... or controlling figure comes into my life . And part of me likes it , needs it , wants the approval . But then at a certain point , along the way , i just , you know ... okay , um ... my father was a navy captain . I worshipped ... i worship the sea that he sailed on . And when i was 13 or so , i went through this thing , where i would sneak out of my parents ' house ... and smoke my mother 's cigarettes . And i did it because i knew that if he found out , he would kill me . And then along the way , there are other fathers . Sounds a little like your time has come around again . I want things more like a straight line , and i don 't ever want to go backward . That 's why i got the tattoo i deserve . It marked a moment , a feeling , a memorial of something i never want to have happen again . I want to see it . You know , dana , just ' cause i marked the moment , wanting to go forward , doesn 't mean that it worked . I want to see it . Come on . It 's all scabbed up . That 's okay . If you 're so curious , get your own . She wants the same red , like mine . It 's really bad out . Look , the weather and a few drinks under your belt , i 'd feel better if you stayed here . Hey . I 'm not up to anything . I just want you to be safe . I 'll take the couch . The tattoo hurt at all ? Yeah , um , it feels weird . I , uh , i can 't see it . L ... but i feel different . It 's like , uh ... i don 't know how i feel about that . Yeah . It looks all right . Ed , you 're bleeding again . Will you let me take a look at it ? I am a doctor . He said this could happen . Ed , it looks burned . Get her hands off of me ! Those are bad thoughts you 're having , baby . You kiss her , and she 's dead . Adams inn . Dana scully , please . Thank you . I 'll ring . I 'm sorry , sir . There 's no answer in that room . Thank you . Good morning . I 'm detective gouveia . This is detective smith . May we speak with edward jerse ? Uh , i 'm sorry . He 's not in . I don 't know where he is . - Were you here the night before last ? - No . Can i help you with something ? I 'm with the bureau . The resident downstairs , kaye schilling , was reported missing . Some blood was found in her apartment , not hers . It had some abnormalities . Such as ? Look , i have a background in forensic medicine . I assure you anything you divulge will be held under the strictest confidence . A preliminary toxicology report found this substance in the blood stains . The blood type was a , and hers was o . May i ? Here 's our card . We 'd appreciate mr . Jerse giving us a call when he returns . And if he doesn 't , we will . Okay . Federal bureau of investigation . Yeah , fox mulder , please . One moment . Oh . Good morning . What 's wrong ? Ed , sit down . Some detectives were here . The woman in the apartment downstairs was reported missing . They found blood , and i believe , circumstantially , it may be yours . I was helping her move in , and i cut myself . You need to tell that to the detectives . But what i 'm also afraid of , and this concerns both of us , is that an ergot alkaloid was found in the blood , which is why i think it may have been yours . Ergot is a parasite that lives off of rye and related grasses . Svo said that he used rye somehow in his ink . If this is true , we may be subject to hallucinogenic ergotism . Aural , visual hallucinations , dangerous and unlikely behavior . We need to go to the hospital to be tested . I don 't need that , dana . It 's such a relief to be able to tell someone . I hear it , dana , in my head , only deeper . It 's more than just some chemical reaction . She talks to me . She hates women . My wife , my boss , you . She 's so jealous , dana . She makes me do things i don 't want to . But she controls me . But i believe that you made her go away . We need to get help . I 'm gonna go into the other room , and i 'm gonna come back , and we are gonna go together . Mmm-mmm ? Who 'd she call ? Who 'd she call , eddie ? Come on ! Aren 't you just dying to know ? Federal bureau of investigation . Dana scully , please . Dana scully , please . One moment . All right , let 's go . Never again ! Another woman in my bed ? Burn the sheets , lover . Burn her . Burn her ! Come on , baby . Come on , baby ! Do it for me . Ow ! - This isn 't you , ed ! Go on , eddie ! - Get control of yourself . - Ah , but it 's good to lose control . - Take control ! - Do it for me , eddie ! Do it ! No ! Welcome back . You look a lot better than you did in the hospital . And congratulations for making a personal appearance in the x files for the second time . It 's a world record . Ed jerse is in custody at the st . John 's burn center in philadelphia . Traces of ergot were found in his bloodstream , as in yours , but not to the degree that should cause hallucinogenic ergotism . He 'll undergo psychiatric evaluation after recovering from burn trauma . Comrade svo has been shut down ... and is under investigation for having connections to my friend pudovkin . Case closed on boris badenov , which is really a shame , because i was thinking of having an n.y. Tattooed on my ass ... to commemorate the yankees world series victory . Better late than never , huh ? The , uh ... field office in dallas is , uh , receiving reports of an image of a missing child ... appearing on a blank billboard outside of arlington . So ... all this because I ... because i didn 't get you a desk ? Not everything is about you , mulder . This is my life . Yes , but it 's ... I made this !

SCULLY : I know . butthe threatwas called ... into thefederal building across the street . MULDER : I thinkthat 's covered . SCULLY : When a terrorist bombthreat is called in ... the rational purpose of providing that information ... is to allow us tofind the bomb . The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror . if you 'd study the statistics ... you 'dfind a model behavioral patternfor almost every case ... where a threat has turned up an explosive device ... and if we don 't act in accordance with that data ... if you ignore it . as we have done ... the chances are greatthat if there actually is a bomb ... we might notfind it . Lives could be lost . Mulder ... Mulder ? MULDER : Boom . Jesus . Mulder . Whatever happened to playing a hunch . Scully ? The element of surprise . random acts of unpredictability . if wefail to anticipate the unforeseen ... or expectthe unexpected ... in a universe of infinite possibilities ... we mayfind ourselves atthe mercy of anyone ... or anything that cannot be programmed. categorized ... or easily referenced .

CASSIDY : ln light of Waco and Ruby Ridge ... there is a heightened need ... atthe attorney general 's office to place responsibility ... as early as possiblefor the catastrophic destruction ... of public property and lives due to terrorist activities . Many details are still unclear ... butwe 're under some pressure from the attorney general ... to accurately describe what happened ... so that she can issue a public statement . We know now thatfive people died in the explosion . Special- - Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud ... who was trying to diffuse the bomb ... threefiremenfrom Dallas . and a young boy . MULDER : Excuse me . Thefiremen and the young boy . they werefound in the building ? Agent Mulder . since you weren 't able ... to be on time forthis hearing ... I 'd like you to step outside ... so we can hearAgent Scully 's version of thefacts ... so that she will not be paid the same disrespect . We were told the building was clear . You 'll getyourturn . Please step outside . SKINNER : Sit down . They 're still talking to Scully . MULDER : Aboutwhat ? They 're asking her for a narrative ... tofind outwhy she was in the wrong building . MULDER : She was with me . You don 't see what 's going on here. do you ? There 's $ 45 million worth of damage to the city of Dallas . Lives have been lost . No suspects have been named . So the story that 's being shaped ... is thatthis could have been prevented . They wantto blame us ? Agent Mulder . you and I both know ... that if it looks bad . it 's badforthe fbi . Blame has to be assigned somewhere . if they want somebody to blame . then blame me . Agent Scully doesn 't deserve this . She 's in there now saying the same thing aboutyou . No . I breached protocol . I broke contactwith the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone . Agent Scully says she ordered you out of the building . - You wanted to go back in . - No . [ Door opens ] SCULLY : They 're askingforyou. sir . SKINNER : Thankyou . MULDER : Whateveryou told them . you don 't have to protect me . SCULLY : I only told the truth . They 're trying to divide us . We can 't letthem . Mulder.they have divided us . They 're splitting us up . What are you talking about ? I have a meeting with O.P.R. day aftertomorrow ... for remediation and reassignment . MULDER : They put us together . Because they wanted me to invalidate ... your investigations into the paranormal ... but I think this goes deeperthan that now . MULDER : This is not aboutyou . They 're doing this to me . They 're not doing this . Mulder . I left behind a career in medicine ... because I thought I could make a difference atthe fbi ... but it hasn 't turned outthatway ... and now if they were to transfer me to Omaha ... or Cleveland or somefield office ... itjust doesn 't hold the interestfor me ... that it once did . Not afterwhat I 've seen and done . You 're quitting . Maybe you should askwhether your heart 's still in it.too. SKINNER : Agent Mulder.you 're up . I 'm sorry . Mulder . Good luck . BARMAID : I 'd say this exceeds your minimum daily requirement . BARMAID : Whoa . You 've gotto train forthat kind of heavy lifting . Poopy day ? BARMAID : So ... what do you do ? What do I do ? Mm-hmm . I 'm the keyfigure ... in an ongoing government charade : The piotto conceal the truth ... aboutthe existence of extraterrestrials . It 's a global conspiracy . actually ... with key players in the highest levels of power ... that reaches down into the lives ... of every man.woman. and child on this planet . So. of course . no one believes me . I 'm an annoyance to my superiors ... a joke to my peers . They call me Spooky . Spooky Mulder ... whose sister was abducted by aliens ... when he was just a kid ... and he chases little green men with a badge and a gun ... shouting to the heavens or anyone who will listen ... thatthefix is in and thatthe sky isfalling ... and when it hits ... it 's gonna be the shitstorm of all time . Well ... I would say that about does it . Spooky . Does what ? Well . looks like 86 is your lucky number . You know . one is the loneliest number . [ Belches ] Hello ? - Hello ! - Sorry . [ Urinating ] KURTZWEIL : That official FBI business ? MULDER : What ? KURTZWEIL : Betthe bureau 's accusing you ... of the same thing in Dallas : Standing around holding youryank ... while bombs are exploding . Do I know you ? No. but I 've been watching your careerfor a good while ... backwhen you were just a promising young agent ... Before that . MULDER : You come out here for a reason ? KURTZWEIL : Yeah . I did . My name is Kurtzweil- - Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil . MULDER : I know that name ? I 'm an oldfriend of yourfather 's . KURTZWEIL : Atthe Department of State ... we were whatyou might call fellow travelers ... but his disenchantment outlasted mine . Right . [ Zip ] How 'd youfind me ? I heard you come in here now and again . Figured you 'd need a little drinky tonight . MULDER : You a reporter ? KURTZWEIL : I 'm a doctor . I mentioned that . Ob-gyn . MULDER : You got somethin ' to say ... you got until I can hail a cab . KURTZWEIL : There 's something you don 't know ... aboutthe bombing in Dallas . MULDER : What 's that ? KURTZWEIL : S.A.C. Darius Michaud nevertried ... or intended to diffuse that bomb . MULDER : He just let it explode in hisface. huh ? KURTZWEIL : What 's the question no one 's asking ? Why that building ? Why notthefederal building ? Thefederal building was too well guarded . KURTZWEIL : No . They put the bomb in that building ... because it did have federal offices there . The Federal Emergency ManagementAgency ... had a provisional medical quarantine office there ... which is where the bodies werefound ... butthat 's the thing . the thing you didn 't know ... the thing you 'd neverthinkto check : Those people were already dead . Before the bombwent off ? That 's what I 'm saying . Darius Michaud was a 22-year veteran of the bureau . Michaud was a patriot . The people he was loyal to know theirway around Dallas . They blew that building to hide something ... maybe even something they couldn 't predict . You 're telling me they blew up that entire building ... justto hide the bodies of thosefiremen ? And one little boy . I thinkyou 'refull of shit . Do you ? Arlington. please . Actually.you know . let 's go to Georgetown . Let 's go to Georgetown . [ Knock on door ] [ Knocking ] I woke you . Did I wake you ? SCULLY : No . MULDER : Why not ? It 's 3 : 00 in the morning . SCULLY : Are you drunk . Mulder ? I was until about 20 minutes ago.yeah. SCULLY : Was that before or afteryou decided to come here ? MULDER : What exactly are you implying ? Go home . Mulder . No . Get dressed . - It 's late . - Get dressed . What are you doing ? Just get dressed . and I 'll explain on the way . MAN : Nitrogen ? SECOND MAN : Two point seven seven . FIRST MAN : Methane ? SECOND MAN : Zero ... [ Loud electrical humming ] You 've got something to show me . BRONSCHWEIG : We broughtthe atmosphere down tofreezing ... in orderto control the development ... which is like nothing we 've ever seen . CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN : Brought on by what ? BRONSCHWEIG : Heat . I think . The coincident invasion of a host--thefireman- - and an environment ... that raised his body temperature above 98.6 . This man 's still alive . Technically and biologically . but he 'll never recover . CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN : How can this be ? BRONSCHWEIG : The developing organism ... is using his life energy . digesting bone and tissue . We 've just slowed the process . Do you want us to destroy this one.too ... before it gestates ? CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN : No . No . We need to try ourvaccine on it . And if it 's unsuccessful ? Burn it like the others . I.D. andflooryou 're visiting . MULDER : We 're going down to the morgue . That area is off-limits except to authorized medical personnel . On whose orders ? General McAddie . General McAddie requested our coming down here . We were awakened at3 a.m. and told to get here immediately . I don 't know anything aboutthat . MULDER : Call General McAddie . GUARD : I don 't have the number . MULDER : Call the switchboard . They 'll patch you through . Jesus.you don 't know the switchboard number ? I 'm calling my C.O. We don 't have time to dick around ... while you demonstrate your ignorance . The order came directly from General McAddie . Call him . We 'll conduct our business while you confirm authorization . GUARD : Why don 'tyou head down . and I 'll confirm authorization ? MULDER : Thankyou . Why is the morgue suddenly off-limits ... on the orders of a general ? SCULLY : This is one of thefiremen who died in Dallas ? MULDER : According to the toe tag . SCULLY : And you 're lookingfor ... MULDER : Cause of death . SCULLY : I can tell you that without even looking at him . " Concussive organfailure ... " due to proximal exposure to source andflying debris . " Mulder.this man 's already been autopsied . You can tell by the way he 's been wrapped and dressed . MULDER : Does thisfit the description you just read ? SCULLY : Oh. my God . This man 's tissue . Mulder . MULDER : It 's like jelly . SCULLY : There 's been some kind of cellular breakdown . SCULLY : God. it 's completely edematous . And there 's been no autopsy performed here . No Y-incision. no internal exam . MULDER : You mean the cause of death in that report isfalse ? Thatthis man didn 't die from an explosion ... orfromflying debris ? I can 'ttell you what killed this man . I 'm not sure anybody else could claim to. either . SCULLY : Mulder . you knew before we got here ... this man didn 't die atthe bomb site . MULDER : I 'd been told as much . SCULLY : You 're saying this is a cover-up ? Of what ? MULDER : I don 't know ... but I 've a hunch whatyou 'llfind ... won 't be anything that 's easy to categorize or reference . SCULLY : This is going to take some time . Somebody 's going tofigure out sooner or later ... thatwe 're not supposed to be here . We 're being blamed forthis man 's death . I 'd like to know what he died of . Wouldn 'tyou ? MULDER : I thinkthat 's it up here . DISPATCHER : Boy . Lincoln . Charles.three. seven. one . [ Voices overwalkie-talkie ] MAN : Anything else ?

DETECTIVE : You lookingfor him for some other reason ? MULDER : Yeah . I had an appointment for a pelvic examination . DETECTIVE : You want a call if we turn upthis Kurtzweil ? MULDER : Don 't bother . KURTZWEIL : See this crap ? Somebody knows I 'm talking to you . MULDER : Not according to the men in blue . KURTZWEIL : What now. kiddie porn again ? Sexual battery of a patient ? They wantto discredityou forwhat ? Because I 'm a dangerous man . Because I know too much aboutthe truth . That end-of-the-world . apocalyptic garbage you write ? You know my work ? - I was right about Dallas . - How were you right ? Are youfamiliar with the Hanta virus ? Yeah . Itwas a deadly virus spread byfield mice ... in the southwestern United States several years ago . According to the newspaper ... FEMA was called outto manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus . Are youfamiliarwith what ... the Federal Emergency Management Agency 's real power is ? FEMA allows the White House ... to suspend constitutional government ... upon declaration of a national emergency . Think aboutthat . What is an agency with such broad. sweeping power ... doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas ? MULDER : ltwasn 't such a small outbreak . No . I 'm saying itwasn 'tthe Hanta virus . Whatwas it ? [ Siren ] MULDER : Whatwas it ? KURTZWEIL : When we were young men in the military ... yourfather and I were recruited for a project . They told us itwas biological warfare. a virus . MULDER : What killed those men ? What killed them I won 't even write about . We have no context forwhat killed those men ... or any appreciation ... of the scale which itwill be unleashed in thefuture . MULDER : A plague ? KURTZWEIL : A plague to end all plagues . A silentweaponfor a quietwar . The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism ... forwhich the men who will bring it on still have no cure . They 've been working on this for 50 years . While the rest of the world were fighting gooks and commies ... these men have been secretly negotiating ... a planned Armageddon . Negotiating with whom ? I thinkyou know . KURTZWEIL : The timetable has been set . It 'll happen on a holiday ... when people are awayfrom their homes . The presidentwill declare a state of emergency ... atwhich time all government ... allfederal agencies will come underthe power ... of the Federal Emergency ManagementAgency- - FEMA ... the secret government . And they call me paranoid . Go backto Dallas . Agent Mulder. and dig . Orwe 'llfind out along with the rest of the country ... when it 's too late . [ Door opens ] [ Cell phone rings ] MULDER : Scully. it 's me . [ Whispers ] Yeah ? MULDER : Why are you whispering ? SCULLY : I can 't really talk right now . What did youfind ? SCULLY : Evidence of a massive infection . What kind of infection ? SCULLY : I don 't know . All right . listen to me . I 'm going home and booking myself on aflightto Dallas . - I 'll getyou a ticket.too. - Mulder-- I need you there with me . I need your expertise . Mulder . I 've got a hearing tomorrow . You 'll be back in time ... and maybe with evidence that 'll blow it away . Mulder . I can 't . I 'm pastthe point of common sense here . MULDER : It 's not common sense . [ Footsteps approaching ] MULDER : Can you--Are you there ? Scully ? [ Beep ] Scully ? [ Tapping telephone plunger ] MAN : I 'm afraid you 're looking for a needle in a haystack . This explosion was so devastating ... there hasn 't been much that we 've been able to puttogether . MULDER : I 'm looking for anything unusual . Maybe something from the FEMA offices ... where those bodies werefound ? MAN : We weren 't expecting tofind those remains ... and we sentthem off to Washington . MULDER : Anythingfrom those offices not sentto D.C. yet ? MAN : Bonefragments turned up in the siftthis morning . We thought we had anotherfatality ... butwefound out FEMA gotthem from an archeological site . Have you examined them ? MAN : No . Justfossils . I 'd like herto examine them . if you don 't mind . MAN : Let me see if I can find whatyou 're lookingfor . MULDER : I thoughtyou weren 't coming . SCULLY : I wasn 't planning on it ... after spending half an hour in cold storage this morning ... but I got a better look at blood and tissue samples ... I tookfrom thefireman . What did youfind ? SCULLY : Something I couldn 't show to anybody else ... without causing the kind of attention I 'd like to avoid . Butwhatthose men were infected with ... contains a protein code that I 've never seen before . What it did to them . it did extremelyfast . How was it contracted ? SCULLY : That I don 't know . Unless it can respond to conventional treatment ... it could be a serious health threat . MAN : Like I said . these are justfossils . They weren 't nearthe blast center. so they won 'ttell much . MULDER : Right . Why don 'tyou checkthis out ? You said you knew where these werefound ? MAN : Show you on the map . [ Laughter ] I want all of these settings checked and recalibrated . I want a steady minus two degrees Celsius ... throughoutthe transfer of the body ... after I 've administered the vaccine . MAN : Go ahead and move the body .

They 're waiting in the library. sir . STRUGHOLD : We were beginning to worry . Some of us have traveled sofar . and you are the lastto arrive . I 'm sorry . My grandsonfell and broke his leg . While we 've been made to wait ... we watched surveillance tapes which have raised more concerns . More concerns than what ? We 've beenforced to reassess our role in colonization ... by newfacts of biology which have presented themselves . MAN : The virus has mutated . Into what ? A new extraterrestrial biological entity . My God ! The geometry of mass infection ... presents certain conceptual reevaluationsfor us ... about our place in their colonization . This isn 't colonization . This is spontaneous repopulation . All ourwork ... if it 's true . they 've been using us all along . We 've been laboring under a lie . SECOND MAN : Could be an isolated case . WELL-MANICURED MAN : How can we know ? STRUGHOLD : We 're going to tell them whatwefound ... whatwe 've learned ... by turning over a body infected with the gestating organism . In hope of what ? Learning that it 's true ? Thatwe are nothing but digestives ... forthe creation of a new race of alien lifeforms ? By cooperating now ... we are but beggars to our own demise . STRUGHOLD : Cooperation 's the only chance of saving ourselves . SMOKER : They still need us to carry outtheir preparations . STRUGHOLD : We 'll continue to use them as they do us ... if only to playfor more time to continue work ... on ourvaccine . My lateness mightjust as well have been absence . A course has already been taken . There are complications . Mulder saw one of the infected bodies ... thatwe destroyed in Dallas . He 's gone backthere again . Someone has tipped him . Who ? Kurtzweil.we think . No one believes Kurtzweil or his books . He 's a toiler. a crank . Mulder believes him . Then Kurtzweil must be removed . As must Mulder . Kill Mulder.we take the risk ... of turning one man 's quest into a crusade . Then you musttake away what he holds mostvaluable ... thatwith which he can 't live without . I don 't know . Mulder . I don 't see any evidence of an archeological ... or any other kind of a dig site . This is where he marked on the map ... where he said thosefossils were unearthed . MULDER : You 're sure thosefossils were infected ... with the same virus you saw atthe morgue ? SCULLY : Both sets of bones were porous ... as if the virus or causative microbe were decomposing it . And you 've never seen thatvirus before ? No . Look atthat . MULDER : That look like new grass to you ? SCULLY : Looks prett green forthis climate . MULDER : Uh-huh . MULDER : The ground 's dry about an inch down . This was laid recently . The equipment looks brand-new.too. MULDER : No irrigation system . Somebody 's covering theirtracks . MULDER : Hey ! MULDER : Hey . SCULLY : You boys live around here ? BOY : Yeah . MULDER : You seen anybody digging overthere ? BOY : We 're not supposed to talk about it . SCULLY : Not supposed to talk about it ? Who told you that ? SECOND BOY : Nobody . MULDER : Nobody ? Same nobody that built that playground ? Nobody buy you those new bikes.too ? I thinkyou bettertell us . BOY : We don 't even know you . SCULLY : We 're FBI agents . BOY : You 're not FBI agents . MULDER : How do you know ? 'Cause y 'all look like door-to-door salesmen . MULDER : Hey.you wantto buy a badge ? SECOND BOY : They all left an hour ago . THIRD BOY : Going thatway . MULDER : Unmarked tankertrucks . What are archeologists hauling out in tankertrucks ? I don 't know . Mulder . MULDER : Where are they going with it ? SCULLY : We need to answerthat if we 're going tofind them . [ Tires squeal ] MULDER : What are my choices ? SCULLY : About 100 miles of nothing in both directions . MULDER : Which way you thinkthey went ? SCULLY : You gottwo choices . One of them 's wrong . MULDER : I thinkthey went left . SCULLY : I don 't know why . I thinkthey went right . [ Tapping steering wheel ] [ Tires squeal ] MULDER : Five years together . How many times I been wrong ? MULDER : Never . MULDER : Not driving. anyway . [ Leaves engine running ] MULDER : I was right aboutthe bomb . SCULLY : This is great . This isfitting . What ? I have to be in Washington . D.C. in 11 hoursfor a hearing ... and the outcome might possibly affect ... one of the biggest decisions of my life ... and here I am in Nowhere.Texas. chasing phantom tankertrucks . MULDER : Nottankertrucks . We 're chasing evidence . Of what exactly ? That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off to hide something ... bodies infected with a virus you yourself detected . Mulder.they haul oil in tankertrucks . They haul gas in tankertrucks . They do not haul viruses in tankertrucks . Well.they may be hauling a virus in these tankertrucks . What do you mean ? Mulder ?

Yeah. on the Texas border . Some kind of experiment . Something they excavated was broughtthere in tankertrucks . What ? I 'm not sure . A virus . I think . And I also have reason to believe that ... there may have been some involvement ... by Special Agent in Charge Michaud . CASSIDY : Those are very serious allegations . Yes . I know . - You saw this experiment ? - Yeah. butwe were chased off . What did it look like ? There were bees. corn crops . CASSIDY : You have conclusive evidence of this ... something to tie your claim to the crime ? Not completely conclusive .

I debated whether or not even to tell you in person- - We are close to something here ! We 're on the verge . You 're on the verge . Please don 't do this to me . Afterwhatyou saw last night and all you 've seen ... you can justwalk away ? I have . I did . It 's done . I need you on this . You don 't need me . You never have . I 've just held you back . I gotta go . You wantto tell yourself that so you can quit ... with a clear conscience . you can . Butyou 're wrong . Why did they assign me to you in thefirst place ? To debunkyourwork . To rein you in . to shutyou down . Butyou saved me . As difficult and asfrustrating as it 's been sometimes ... your goddamn strict rationalism and science ... have saved me a thousand times over . You kept me honest . You made me a whole person . MULDER : I owe you everything ... Scully. and you owe me nothing . I don 't know if I wantto do this alone . I don 't even know if I can . And if I quit now.they win . SCULLY : Ow ! Jesus . MULDER : I 'm sorry . No . Something stung me . It must have gotten in your shirt . Mulder ... MULDER : Huh ? Something 's wrong . What ? I 'm having lancinating pain in ... MULDER : What ? ... my chest . Ohh ! Scully . My motorfunctions are being affected . My pulse is thready . And I have a ... afunny taste in the back of my throat . I thinkyou 're going into anaphylactic shock . No . I have no allergies . WOMAN : Emergency dispatch . This is Special Agent Fox Mulder . I have an emergency . An agent 's down . PARAMEDIC : Can you hear me ? Can you say your name ? She 's got constriction in the throat and larynx . Passages are open . OK . let 's get her in the van right away . Look out . Comin ' through . Watch your back . MULDER : She had afunny taste in herthroat ... but she 's not allergic to bee stings . The bee that stung her might have been carrying a virus . PARAMEDIC : A virus ? MULDER : Yeah . Tell the doctor . PARAMEDIC : Radio in an allergic reaction . MULDER : No. a virus . And I wantto go with you ! What hospital ? l- - What hospital are you taking herto ? [ Siren approaches ] - What are you doing ? - Reading his chart . - Put it down . - When I 'm ready . - You two shut up . - I think he 's waking . LANGLY : He 's coming to . FROHIKE : Hey . Mulder . Mulder . Oh . God . Cowardly Lion . Scarecrow. and ... Toto . MULDER : What am I doing here ? BYERS : A bullet glanced off yourtemporal plate . LANGLY : Three centimeters left . and we 'd all be playing harps . FROHIKE : You 've been unconscious since you got here . Where 's Scully ? BYERS : We know you called 911 ... butthat call must have been intercepted . FROHIKE : Scully had a reaction to an Africanized honey bee ... wefound in your hall . MULDER : I gotta go lookfor her . SKINNER : Mulder. easy. easy . You 're staying right here . MULDER : You don 't understand . It 's connected to Dallas . SKINNER : Where is she ? I 'll look . MULDER : I don 't know . but I know someone who might . You leave here unprotected . howfarwill you get ? Howfarwill they letyou get ? They 'll know if you walk out . LANGLY : What can we do ? You can strip Byers naked . What ? I need your clothes . It 's Mulder . WELL-MANICURED MAN : Dr. Kurtzweil. isn 't it ? Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil ? WELL-MANICURED MAN : Mr. Mulder . What happened to Kurtzweil ? He 's come and gone . I wantto know where Scully is . The location of Agent Scully and the means to save her life . Please . What is it ? A weakvaccine againstthe virus Agent Scully 's infected with . It must be administered within 96 hours . That leaves you little time to reach those coordinates . You 're lying . No ... though I have no means to prove otherwise . The virus is extraterrestrial . We know very little about it ... exceptthat itwas the original inhabitant of this planet . A virus ? WELL-MANICURED MAN : What is a virus ... but a colonizingforce that cannot be defeated ? Living in a cave. underground ... until it mutates and attacks . This is whatyou 've been conspiring to conceal ? A disease ? No ! For God 's sake . you 've got it all backwards . AIDS.the Ebola virus- - on an evolutionary scale . they are newborns . This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs . What do you mean.walked ? Your aliens.Agent Mulder . Your little green men ... arrived here millions of years ago . Those that didn 't leave ... have been lying dormant underground ... since the last lce Age ... in theform of an evolved pathogen ... waiting to be reconstituted by the alien race ... when it comes to colonize the planet ... using us as hosts . Againstthis . we have no defense . Nothing but a weakvaccine . Do you see why itwas kept secret ? Why. even the best men . men like yourfather ... could not letthe truth be known . Until Dallas ... we believed the virus would simply control us ... that mass infection would make us a slave race . You can imagine our surprise when they began to gestate . My group has been working cooperatively ... with the alien colonists ... facilitating programs like the one you saw ... to give us access to the virus ... in hope thatwe might be able secretly to develop a cure . To save your own asses . Survival is the ultimate ideology . Yourfatherwisely refused to believe this . But he sacrificed my sister . He letthem take Samantha . Without a vaccination ... the only true survivors of the viral holocaust ... will be those immune to it- - human-alien clones . He allowed your sister to be abducted ... to be taken to a cloning program for one reason . So she would survive ... as a genetic hybrid . Yourfather chose hope over selfishness . Hope.the onlyfuture he had . his children . His hopeforyou ... was thatyou would uncover the truth aboutthe project ... thatyou would stop it ... thatyou wouldfightthefuture . Why are you telling me this ? Forthe sake of my own children . Once it 's learned what I 've told you ... my life will be over . Where is Dr. Kurtzweil ? I 'd like to get out of the car now . Stopthe car ! Driver . The men I workwith will stop at nothing ... to clearthe wayforwhat they believe is their stake ... in the inevitablefuture . I was ordered to kill Dr. Kurtzweil ... as I was ordered to kill you . Ugh . Trust no one . Mr. Mulder . Get out of the car . Why ? The upholstery 's already ruined . Get out of the car ! You have precious little time . WELL-MANICURED MAN : What I 've given you ... the alien colonists don 'tyet know exists . The vaccine you hold ... is the only defense againstthe virus . It 's introduction into an alien environment ... may have the powerto destroy the delicate plans ... we have so assiduously protected ... forthe last 50 years . MULDER : What do you mean . may have ? Find Agent Scully . Only then will you realize ... the scope and grandeur of the project . WELL-MANICURED MAN : Go ! Go now ! [ Stops motor ] Ohh . [ Deep hollow whistling ] [ Ominous creaking noises ] Oh. shit . Aah ! CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN : Secure the station . I want everybody else down below . if you 're not armed . arm yourselves . We may have a breach . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Come on. move. move ! Let 's go ! Scully ? [ Alarm buzzers ] There 's a contaminant in the system . Mulder has the vaccine . [ Gagging ] Breathe . Scully. can you breathe ? SCULLY : Cold . I 'm cold . MULDER : I 'll getyou out of there . [ Shouting ] CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN : Abandon your posts ! Evacuate ! [ Computer beeping ] [ Men yelling ] MAN : What 's happened ? CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN : It 's all going to hell ! - What about Mulder ? - He 'll never make it . [ Alarm buzzers ] Go ! Move ' em out ! [ Both grunting ] [ Scully coughing ] We gotto keep moving . Come on . I can 't . I can 't . Yeah.you can . Scully. reach up and grabthatvent . [ Growling ] Grabthe vent ! Scully ? [ Growling ] Jeez. breathe ! Breathe. breathe. breathe . - [ Gasps ] - Huh ? [ Coughing ] Breathe in . Breathe in . Breathe ! Mulder . I had you big time . Move it . Oh ! Pull ! Come on ! Pull ! Mulder . Keep moving . SCULLY : Ohh . MULDER : Go . Go. come on ! MULDER : Almostthere . Keep going ! [ Screeching ] [ Ice creaking ] [ Rumbling ] Scully.you gotto see this . Scully . CASSIDY : ln light of the report I 've got before me ... and the narrative I 'm now hearing ... my official report is incomplete ... pending these newfacts I 'm being asked to reconcile . Agent Scully.though there 's now direct evidence ... that afederal agent may have been involved in the bombing ... the other events you 've laid down here are ... too incredible on their own ... and quitefrankly . implausible in their connection . What is ityoufind incredible ? Well.where would you like me to start ? So many of the events described in your report defy belief . Antarctica is a long way from Dallas.Agent Scully . I can 't submit a report to the attorney general ... that alleges the links you 've made here . Bees and corn crops do not quitefall under ... the rubric of domestic terrorism . No.they don 't . CASSIDY : Most of what lfind in here ... is lacking a coherent picture of any organization ... with an attributable motive . I realize the ordeal you 've endured ... has clearly affected you ... though the holes in your account leave us with little choice ... butto delete these references ... to ourfinal report to the Justice Department ... until which time hard evidence becomes available ... thatwould give us cause to pursue such an investigation . I don 't believe the FBI currently has ... an investigative unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand . MULDER : There 's an interesting work offiction on page 24 . Mysteriously . our names have been omitted . They 're burying this thing . They 're just gonna dig a new hole and cover it up . I told O.P.R. everything I know . What I experienced.the virus- - how it 's spread by the bees from pollen in transgenic crops . Wasting yourtime . They 'll never believe you . Not unless your story can be programmed ... categorized . or easily referenced . SCULLY : We 'll go overtheir heads . No. no . How many times have we been here before ? Right here . so close to the truth . And now.with what we 've seen and whatwe know ... to be back atthe beginning with nothing ? This is different . No. it isn 't . You were rightto wantto quit and to leave me . You should get asfar away from me as you can . I 'm not gonna watch you die for my hollow personal cause . MULDER : Go be a doctor . Go be a doctor while you still can . I can 't . I won 't . I 'll be a doctor. but my work is here with you now . Thatvirus that I was exposed to- - whatever it is. it has a cure . You held it in your hand . How many other lives can we save ? Look ... if I quit now ... they win . [ Man speaking Tunisian ] Oh.you look hot and miserable . Why have you traveled all this way ? - We have business to discuss . - You have regular channels . This involves Mulder . Ahh.that name . Again and again . He 's seen more than he should . What has he seen ? Of the whole . he has seen but pieces . He 's determined now ... reinvested . He 's but one man . One man alone cannotfightthefuture . Yesterday ... I received this . [ Acoustic rock and roll playing ] FOO FIGHTERS : [ Singing ] Tonight . I 'm tangled ... in my blanket of clouds ... dreamin ' aloud . Things justwon 't do withoutyou ... matter offact . Ohh-ohh-ohh ... I 'm on your back . I 'm on your back . Ohh-ohh-ohh ... I 'm on your back . if you 'd accept surrender ... I 'll give up some more . Weren 'tyou adored ? I cannot be withoutyou ... matter offact . Ohh-ohh-ohh ... I 'm on your back . if you walk out on me ... I 'm walking afteryou . if you walk out on me ... I 'm walking after ... you . Another heart is cracked ... in two . I 'm on your back . Uh-huh . I cannot be withoutyou ... matter offact . Ohh-ohh-ohh ... I 'm on your back . I 'm on your back . Ohh-ohh-ohh ... I 'm on your back . if you walk out on me ... I 'm walking afteryou . if you walk out on me ... I 'm walking after ... you .

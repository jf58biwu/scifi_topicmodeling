 SIR , BEFORE YOU GO INTO YOUR MEETING , I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT MR. JONES IS HERE FROM THE BUREAU OF TELEPATH INTEGRATION . THE SAME MR. JONES FROM 6 MONTHS AGO ? HE GETS AROUND , DOESN 'T HE ? WELL , THEY 'RE ALL CALLED MR. JONES . IT 'S THEIR WAY OF MAKING THE EXAMINATION LESS PERSONAL . HOW COULD IT NOT BE PERSONAL ? HE CRAWLS INSIDE YOUR HEAD AND ROOTS AROUND LOOKING FOR DIRT . BUT ONLY ONE TELEPATH CAN WATCHDOG ANOTHER . IT 'S LIKE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF A POLICE FORCE . PROMOTION AND ADVANCEMENT ARE TIED TO FINDING OTHER PEOPLE BREAKING THE RULES , OR , IN MY CASE , POKING THROUGH OTHER PEOPLES ' MINDS WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION . ANYWAY , THAT 'S THE TRADEOFF WE MAKE FOR BEING ABLE TO LIVE AND WORK BESIDE NORMALS . THAT 'S A MOOT POINT . HE 'S COMING TO MY QUARTERS AT 1800 HOURS . STANDARD PROCEDURE DEEP SCANS TO MAKE SURE I 'M NOT VIOLATING THE NEW RULES FOR TELEPATHS . I DON 'T NEED SOMEONE LIKE HIM TO TELL ME THAT YOU CAN BE TRUSTED NOT TO GO SNOOPING AROUND IN SOMEBODY ELSE 'S MIND . AND I WOULDN 'T . NOT INTENTIONALLY . BUT YOU SEE , WHEN THE SENATE DISBANDED THE PSI CORPS , THERE WERE CONCERNS THAT ACCIDENTAL SCANS WERE INEVITABLE ONCE TELEPATHS WERE INTEGRATED BACK INTO NORMAL COMMUNITIES . IF THERE 'S ANYTHING I CAN DO , IF YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO HIM ON YOUR BEHALF- - NO , NO , THANK YOU . I APPRECIATE THAT , BUT IT 'S JUST HIM , ME ... AND THE RULES . ALL RIGHT . ALL RIGHT . GOOD LUCK . GOOD LUCK . SO ASIDE FROM THE MORSEDDI , THERE 'S NOTHING ELSE TO INVESTIGATE IN THIS SECTOR , UNLESS ... ANYONE ELSE HAS A SUGGESTION . YES . YES . ACTUALLY , I HAVE ONE . ACTUALLY , I HAVE ONE . THIS RIGHT HERE . THIS RIGHT HERE . TO THE UNTRAINED EYE , JUST ANOTHER ROCK , BUT IN REALITY , A PART OF A MUCH GREATER WHOLE . BUT IN REALITY , A PART OF A MUCH GREATER WHOLE . IT TOOK ME YEARS TO FIND IT . OTHERS OF MY ORDER HAVE SPENT THEIR ENTIRE LIVES SEARCHING FOR IT . THESE COORDINATES WILL GUIDE US TO A PRECISE LOCATION IN HYPERSPACE NORMALLY HIDDEN FROM PRYING EYES . NORMALLY HIDDEN FROM PRYING EYES . SO ... SHALL WE GO ? GO WHERE ? THE WELL OF FOREVER . IT 'S A FOCAL POINT OF IMMENSE POWER LIKE STONEHENGE OR THE ORACLE AT DELPHI ON EARTH . OR THE ORACLE AT DELPHI ON EARTH . THE WELL IS POWERFUL BECAUSE IT DRAWS ITS ESSENCE FROM HYPERSPACE . FOR CENTURIES , WIZARDS HAVE SOUGHT OUT CROSSROADS BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT THE POINT WHERE POWERFUL ENERGIES INTERSECT . THERE IS NO GREATER CROSSROADS ... THAN HYPERSPACE . MY PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT TO AVOID CROSSROADS . ALSO BEACHES , CLIFFS , PITS , CAVERNS ... AND WELLS . WHERE DO YOU GO ON VACATION , ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM ? ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM ? YOU FEAR THESE PLACES BECAUSE THEY 'RE NOT ENTIRELY ONE THING OR ANOTHER , BUT TO A MAGE , SUCH A PLACE IS AN OPEN BOOK FULL OF ANSWERS FOR THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO LISTEN . FOR THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO LISTEN . THIS BOOK MAY BE VERY USEFUL TO US IN OUR SEARCH TO FIND A CURE FOR THE DRAKH PLAGUE . FOR THE DRAKH PLAGUE . IT WILL TAKE US SEVERAL DAYS TO GET THERE ... BUT I 'M CERTAIN IT WILL BE WORTH THE RISK . SO YOU HAVE A MAGIC ROCK THAT PROVIDES YOU WITH A MYSTICAL PLACE THAT IS A METAPHORICAL BOOK THAT GIVES YOU ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVEN 'T ASKED YET , AND YOU WANT US TO SPEND DAYS IN HYPERSPACE BASED ON THAT ? BASED ON THAT ? EVEN IF YOUR INFORMATION IS CORRECT , THOSE COORDINATES ARE DAYS OUTSIDE KNOWN HYPERSPACE ROUTES . NO ONE IS STUPID ENOUGH TO TRAVEL THAT FAR OFF THE BEACON . WE COULD WIND UP 40 LIGHT-YEARS FROM ANY KNOWN SYSTEM . NOT IF MY SHIP 'S NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEMS ARE MERGED WITH THEEXCALIBUR 'S . IF YOUR SHIP CAN FIND IT , WHY DO YOU NEED US ? MY INSTRUMENTS MAY BE MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN YOURS , BUT MY SHIP CANNOT MANEUVER IN THE STRONG GRAVITATIONAL CURRENTS THAT FAR OUT . I NEED THEEXCALIBUR . I NEED THEEXCALIBUR . ALL RIGHT , SINCE WE 'VE GOT NOTHING ELSE ON THE BOARDS , WE 'LL TAKE A LOOK , BUT IN DEFERENCE TO COMMON SENSE AND MR. EILERSON 'S CONCERNS , WHICH SOMEHOW ENDED UP THE SAME THING FOR A CHANGE ... IF WE GET TO THE LOCATION AND THERE 'S NOTHING THERE , WE 'LL TURN AROUND AND HEAD BACK . DEAL ? FAIR ENOUGH . I 'LL MAKE READY MY SHIP FOR THE NAVIGATIONAL MERGE . GALEN . HAS ANYONE ELSE EVER FOUND THIS WELL OF FOREVER ? ABSOLUTELY . IT 'S JUST THAT NO ONE HAS EVER RETURNED . IT 'S JUST THAT NO ONE HAS EVER RETURNED . CONSIDER IT AN ADVENTURE . CONSIDER IT AN ADVENTURE . MATTHEW GIDEON , CAPTAIN . ATTACHED TO THE EARTH ALLIANCE STARSHIPEXCALIBUR . ATTACHED TO THE EARTH ALLIANCE STARSHIPEXCALIBUR . TO FIND A CURE TO THE DRAKH PLAGUE BEFORE IT WIPES OUT ALL LIFE ON EARTH . BEFORE IT WIPES OUT ALL LIFE ON EARTH . ANYWHERE I HAVE TO . ANYWHERE I HAVE TO . CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS .

Galen : DISPLAY ALL SYSTEMS ON THEEXCALIBUR . ISOLATE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS . ISOLATE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS . [ BEEP ] [ BEEP ] READY TO PERFORM NAVIGATIONAL MERGE . Man : GO AHEAD . Man : GO AHEAD . LOOK AT THAT . LOOK AT THAT . HIS SHIP CAN PICK UP THE FAINTEST SIGNAL AND AMPLIFY IT TO USABLE FORM . NO WONDER TECHNOMAGES ARE NEVER SEEN IN HYPERSPACE . THEY CAN TRAVEL COMPLETELY OFF THE BEACON . I 'D LOVE TO GET A LOOK INSIDE THAT THING , SEE HOW SHE DOES WHAT SHE DOES . YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE ? WE CAN TRY . WE 'LL HAVE TO BACKCHECK THE CONNECTIONS FROM TIME TO TIME , MAKE SURE IT 'S ALL WORKING PROPERLY . AND WE CAN LOOK BACK A LITTLE FURTHER , JUST TO BE THOROUGH . EXCELLENT IDEA , LIEUTENANT . BECAUSE ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I WENT ALONG WITH THIS WAS THE CHANCE TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT SHIP OF HIS . I 'LL GET ON IT FIRST THING . RIGHT NOW , I HAVE TO GO . RIGHT NOW , I HAVE TO GO . TIME TO SEE MR. JONES . OF COURSE . OF COURSE . CAPTAIN , YOU HAVE A MINUTE ? SURE . PULL UP A CHAIR . I 'LL DEAL YOU IN . SURE . PULL UP A CHAIR . I 'LL DEAL YOU IN . SO , WHAT 'S ON YOUR MIND ? GALEN . LET ME GUESS . YOU DON 'T THINK HE CAN BE TRUSTED . WELL ... YOU KNOW , I WAS TAUGHT 2 THINGS GROWING UP . ONE--DON 'T GO LOOKING FOR TROUBLE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF IT . IN THIS RESPECT , HE IS HIDING SOMETHING FROM US . I CAN FEEL IT . I SUSPECT YOU CAN , AS WELL . YEAH . CARDS ? YEAH . CARDS ? DEALER TAKES 2 . DEALER TAKES 2 . DOESN 'T THAT BOTHER YOU ? WE 'VE ALL GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE , DUREENA . WE 'VE ALL GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE , DUREENA . STRAIGHT . STRAIGHT . QUEEN-HIGH . WHAT 'S THE SECOND THING YOU WERE TAUGHT ? WHAT 'S THE SECOND THING YOU WERE TAUGHT ? NEVER GAMBLE WITH A THIEF . NEVER GAMBLE WITH A THIEF . THAT 'S A GOOD TRICK , CONSIDERING ONE OF THE CARDS THAT I TOSSED AWAY WAS THE QUEEN OF HEARTS . WAS THE QUEEN OF HEARTS . SHOW ME HOW TO DO THAT SOMEDAY ? IF WE LIVE THAT LONG . IF WE LIVE THAT LONG . BY THE WAY , WHERE 'S LIEUTENANT MATHESON ? IN HIS QUARTERS WITH HIS GUEST . I HEARD . IS HE OK ? IS HE OK ? I DON 'T KNOW . I DON 'T KNOW . I NOTICED WE JUMPED SHORTLY AFTER I ARRIVED . I HOPE WE 'RE NOT GOING TOO FAR OFF THE BEATEN TRACK . I HOPE WE 'RE NOT GOING TOO FAR OFF THE BEATEN TRACK . A LITTLE . BUT WE 'LL DROP YOU OFF AT A RENDEZVOUS POINT AS SOON AS WE 'RE DONE . IT 'LL BE A FEW DAYS . IT 'LL BE A FEW DAYS . YOU KNOW , LIEUTENANT , YOU 'VE BECOME SOMETHING OF A ROLE MODEL TO A NUMBER OF TELEPATHS BACK HOME . MANY OF THEM HAVE DREAMED OF BEING CAREER MILITARY . YOU 'RE THE FIRST TO HAVE A REAL SHOT AT IT . SO YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO BE EVEN MORE STRICT ... EVEN MORE THOROUGH , GIVEN YOUR POSITION . YES , SIR . I UNDER- - YES , SIR . I UNDER- - JUST TRY AND RELAX . NO ONE LIKES DEEP SCANS . THEY 'RE PAINFUL ... UNCOMFORTABLE . [ BREATHING PAINFULLY ] SOMETIMES EVEN EMBARRASSING . BUT ... NECESSARY . BUT ... NECESSARY . THE WELL OF FOREVER ? THE WELL OF FOREVER ? INTERESTING DESTINATION . SIR . SIR . THAT 'S DUTY-RELATED INFORMATION- - IT CONCERNS ME BECAUSE I 'M HERE WHILE ALL OF IT 'S GOING ON . SO I 'M MAKING AN EXCEPTION . DAMN IT . YOU HAVE NO RIGHT . UH ... UH ... MY JOB GIVES ME THE RIGHT . MY JOB GIVES ME THE RIGHT . AT THE MOMENT , YOU WOULD DO WELL TO BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUTYOURJOB , LIEUTENANT ... BECAUSE I CAN SEE MORE THAN A FEW MISTAKES YOU 'VE MADE ALONG THE WAY . YOU 'VE MADE ALONG THE WAY . YES ... MOST DISTURBING , INDEED . MOST DISTURBING , INDEED . [ SOUND AT DOOR ] ENTER . ENTER . WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO YOUR QUARTERS ? I MADE IT THE RIGHT SIZE . I DON 'T KNOW WHY EVERYBODY ELSE ALWAYS MAKES THINGS HUGE . THIS IS THE WAY I LIKE IT- - NICE AND SMALL . HAVE A SEAT . HAVE A SEAT . THANK YOU . THANK YOU . MMHH ! MMHH ! YOU 'VE BEEN KEEPING TO YOURSELF SINCE WE JUMPED . YOU 'VE BEEN KEEPING TO YOURSELF SINCE WE JUMPED . USUALLY PEOPLE ONLY WORRY WHERE I AM BECAUSE THEY 'RE AFRAID THEIR VALUABLES WILL DISAPPEAR . [ CHUCKLES ] THAT 'S NOT SOMETHING THAT TROUBLES ME . [ CHUCKLES ] THAT 'S NOT SOMETHING THAT TROUBLES ME . GALEN ... IF YOU TRUST ME , WHY WON 'T YOU TELL ME WHERE WE 'RE GOING ? I SAID- - NO . YOU SAID THAT THIS PLACE HOLDS ANSWERS . THAT DOESN 'T TELL ME ANYTHING . DO YOU THINK I 'M HIDING THINGS FROM YOU ? DO YOU THINK I 'M HIDING THINGS FROM YOU ? GIDEON SAYS WE ALL HAVE THINGS TO HIDE . DOES HE ? HOW UNFORTUNATE . I WAS HOPING HE 'D COME FURTHER THAN THAT . OH , NOT THAT IT ISN 'T TRUE , OF COURSE . IT 'S JUST THAT ONE SIMPLY DOESN 'T HAVE TO SAY IT . IT 'S JUST THAT ONE SIMPLY DOESN 'T HAVE TO SAY IT . GALEN , I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAID . I WOULD LOVE TO TRUST YOU . JUST GIVE ME A REASON . JUST GIVE ME A REASON . WHAT IS THIS WELL OF FOREVER ? WHAT IS THIS WELL OF FOREVER ? [ SIGHS ] IT IS A GREAT MONUMENT . IT 'S A PLACE WHERE RACES THROUGH THE AGES HAVE BROUGHT OFFERINGS . IT 'S A SACRED ... SPIRITUAL PLACE . AND WHEN WE FIND IT , YOU WILL HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS YOU REQUIRE . YOU ONLY HAVE TO LISTEN ... AND ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS . AND ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS . MATTHEW WAS RIGHT . WE ALL HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE ... AND WE ALL HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL . WE ALL HAVE A SECRET NAME . WE ALL HAVE A QUESTION ... WE ALL HAVE A QUESTION ... ONE QUESTION THAT UNLOCKS OUR HEARTS . ONE QUESTION THAT UNLOCKS OUR HEARTS . WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION , GALEN ? WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION , GALEN ? WHY ? WHY ? LIEUTENANT . YOU ALL RIGHT ? HE RIPPED RIGHT THROUGH MY BRAIN . HE GOT OUR DESTINATION , EVERYTHING . WHAT ? CAN HE DO THAT ? HE HAS DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO GO ANYWHERE HE NEEDS TO . BUT HE DIDN 'T NEED TO . IT WAS A VIOLATION OF PRIVACY , OF- - IT WAS A VIOLATION OF PRIVACY , OF- - I 'M SORRY , CAPTAIN . I SHOULDN 'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING . IT 'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM . IT 'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM . WE 'RE PICKING UP SOMETHING ON THE LONG-RANGE SCANNERS . IS IT THIS SO-CALLED WELL OF FOREVER ? [ BEEPING ] I DON 'T THINK SO . I DON 'T THINK SO . I 'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE . IPX HAS HAD SOME UNSUBSTANTIATED REPORTS ABOUT LIFE FORMS SPOTTED OUT HERE , BUT WE 'VE NEVER HAD ANY PROOF . THIS IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY . WE 'LL SEND OUT MINICAMS . WE 'LL GET CLOSEUPS . NOT UNTIL WE FINISH OUR SCANS . WE CAN 'T RISK HAVING THEM NOTICE US IF THEY POSE A THREAT . THEY 'RE CALLED THE FENN . THEY 'RE CALLED THE FENN . THEY 'RE BARELY SENTIENT . DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM ? THEY 'RE DRIFTERS . THEY 'RE ATTRACTED TO BRIGHT , SHINY OBJECTS . BUT THEY LOSE INTEREST QUICKLY . THEY WON 'T DO ANYTHING IF WE STOP ENGINES AND JUST DRIFT THROUGH THEM QUIETLY . YOU 'RE SURE ? YOU 'RE SURE ? YES , OF COURSE . YES , OF COURSE . STOP ENGINES . STOP ENGINES . STATUS ? ONE OF THE CREATURES HAS LATCHED ONTO US AND IS REELING US IN . GALEN ? UM , WELL , THEY 'RE PROBABLY JUST ... CURIOUS , THAT 'S ALL . PLAY DEAD . WHAT IF WE 'RE LUNCH ? I 'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEM CONSUMING A SHIP . [ SHIP CREAKS ] [ SHIP CREAKS ] I THINK IT 'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WE 'RE NOT BEING CONSUMED , BUT IT 'S CERTAINLY AN ODD , CHEWING RHYTHM . IF IT 'S NOT EATING US , WHAT 'S IT DOING ? IF IT 'S NOT EATING US , WHAT 'S IT DOING ? NO , IT 'S NOT ! IT 'S MATING WITH US ? IT 'S MATING WITH US ? WELL , IT 'S NOT EXACTLY THE FIRST CONTACT SITUATION THAT I 'D ENVISIONED , BUT ... I WANT IT OFF MY SHIP . I WANT IT OFF MY SHIP RIGHT NOW . NAVIGATION , FULL POWER TO THRUSTERS . THRUSTERS ? LOOK , CAPTAIN , YOU 'RE GIVING IT ALL THE WRONG SIGNALS . ENGINES TO FULL . PULL US AWAY . ENGINES TO FULL . PULL US AWAY . ANY , UH , DAMAGE ? NO , SIR . " JUST DRIFT THROUGH THEM . " GALEN , IF THAT THING HAS GOTTEN ANYTHING ON MY SHIP , I- - LOOKS LIKE HE DIDN 'T STICK AROUND FOR THE PILLOW TALK . CAPTAIN , THE LONGER WE 'RE OUT HERE , THE WORSE THINGS COULD GET . THE WORSE THINGS COULD GET . WHAT IF THERE ARE MORE DANGEROUS LIFE FORMS OUT HERE ? IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO ASSUME THAT THERE 'S ONLY ONE LIFE FORM IN HYPERSPACE . BASED ON AN OCEAN MODEL , WE MIGHT HAVE JUST SEEN THE LOWEST LEVEL OF THE FOOD CHAIN . THE LOWEST LEVEL OF THE FOOD CHAIN . SO WHAT HAPPENED UP HERE ? OH , NOTHING MAJOR . JUST A FEW PESKY LIFE FORMS GETTING FRESH WITH MY SHIP . GETTING FRESH WITH MY SHIP . ANY SIGN OF OUR DESTINATION ? NONE . SCANNERS ARE TOTALLY DEAD . I 'M STARTING TO WONDER IF YOU 'RE RIGHT . MAYBE THIS WAS A MISTAKE . PROBABLY . BUT I DON 'T THINK WE SHOULD TURN BACK , NOT YET . YOU SAID THAT YOU AVOID SITUATIONS WHERE YOU DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF IT OR WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE . WHAT CHANGED THAT ? GALEN SAYS THIS IS IMPORTANT , THAT IT MEANS SOMETHING TO HIM . LOOK , I DON 'T LIKE HAVING TO TRUST ANYONE , BECAUSE I 'M ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED , BUT JUST ONCE I 'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT I COULD ACTUALLY TRUST SOMEONE , THAT FOR AT LEAST ONE PERSON , EVERYTHING WASN 'T ABOUT MONEY OR POWER . THAT 'S A BENEFIT ? THAT 'S A BENEFIT ? FOR ME IT COULD BE . AND THE CONSEQUENCE ? THAT WE 'LL DIE OUT HERE , BUT I 'M USED TO THAT . LOOK , WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHEN WE DIE , ONLY HOW AND WHY AND IN WHAT CAUSE . ALL RIGHT ... I 'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER DAY . I OWE GALEN THAT MUCH ... AND YOU , TOO . IF WE DON 'T FIND IT BY THEN , WE TURN AROUND AND GO HOME . WE TURN AROUND AND GO HOME . [ BEEP ] YES ? CAPTAIN , WE 'LL REACH OUR DESTINATION IN A FEW HOURS . PRELIMINARY SCANS OF THE AREA SHOW NOTHING THERE . COULD IT BE HIDING BEHIND SOME HYPERSPACE BUBBLE OR SHIELDING ? NEGATIVE . BETWEEN GALEN 'S FLYER AND OUR OWN ENHANCEMENTS , WE HAVE ENOUGH TECHNOLOGY TO DETECT THAT KIND OF SHIELDING . THERE 'S NOTHING THERE , SIR . THANKS FOR THE BAD NEWS . END . END . I WAS JUST COMING TO SEE YOU . YES . I KNOW . YOU 'VE JUST HEARD THERE IS NOTHING AT OUR DESTINATION . THEN YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO GO BACK NOW . I 'VE PUT MY SHIP AND MY CREW AT RISK COMING ALL THIS WAY . I CAN 'T JUSTIFY- - I 'M AFRAID GOING BACK ... IS NOT AN OPTION . GALEN , WE HAVE GONE OUT OF OUR WAY FOR YOU . WE HAVE TO TURN AROUND BEFORE WE GO TOO FAR OUT AND SOMETHING GOES WRONG . I STILL HAVE CONTROL OF THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEMS THROUGH MY SHIP . WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ? IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO CHANGE COURSE UNTIL I TURN CONTROL OF THE SHIP OVER TO YOU AGAIN . THAT 'S MUTINY . THE WELL IS HERE SOMEWHERE . WE CANNOT GO BACK UNTIL WE FIND IT . THE SHIP IS NOT ENTIRELY UNDER YOUR CONTROL , MATTHEW . UNDER YOUR CONTROL , MATTHEW . I AM SORRY . I AM SORRY . DON 'T YOU WALK AWAY FROM ME ! WHY THE HELL ARE YOU DOING THIS ? THE WELL MAY HAVE SHIFTED IN HYPERSPACE OVER THE YEARS . MY SHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY COMPENSATE AND PLOT A NEW COURSE . YOU CANNOT INTERFERE . THE INTERFACE BETWEEN MY SHIP AND THEEXCALIBUR IS VERY DELICATE . IF YOU TAMPER WITH IT BEFORE WE REACH OUR DESTINATION , WE WILL BE LOST OUT HERE . I DIDN 'T ASK YOU HOW YOU SCREWED ME . I ASKED YOU WHY . THERE 'S THAT QUESTION AGAIN . YOU AGREED TO TURN AROUND IF THERE WAS NOTHING HERE . YOU DELIBERATELY PROGRAMMED THIS IN CASE YOU WERE WRONG AND IT WASN 'T HERE SO YOU 'D FORCE US TO KEEP LOOKING . YOU ONCE TOLD ME YOU CONSIDERED THEEXCALIBUR YOUR FAMILY . YOU TOLD ME THAT WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT YOU TRUSTED . WHAT COULD POSSIBLY MAKE YOU BETRAY THAT ? WHAT COULD POSSIBLY MAKE YOU BETRAY THAT ? A PROMISE ... ONE THAT I MUST KEEP ... NO MATTER THE COST . NO MATTER THE COST . GALEN ... IF YOU TAKE CONTROL OF MY SHIP , EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU DO AFTER TODAY ... YOU DO ALONE . YOU DO ALONE . IT WON 'T BE THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE BEEN ALONE . IT WON 'T BE THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE BEEN ALONE . CAPTAIN , DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT ? NOT REALLY . THEN I SUGGEST YOU MAKE ONE . IT 'S ABOUT LIEUTENANT MATHESON . IT 'S ABOUT LIEUTENANT MATHESON . I WANTED YOU TO KNOW I 'VE COMPLETED MY SCAN , AND I FOUND SOME ... GRAY AREAS . MAYBE YOU JUST FOUND WHAT YOU WANTED TO FIND . MAYBE YOU 'RE JUST A LITTLE TOO EAGER FOR THAT NEXT PROMOTION . HE HAS USED HIS ABILITIES TO SENSE EMOTIONS ON THE PART OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COME THROUGH HERE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS , CAUGHT THE RANDOM , STRAY THOUGHT . NO SERIOUS BREACHES OF CONDUCT , BUT ENOUGH THAT HE MAY BE RECALLED FOR FURTHER QUESTIONING AND TRAINING . I CAN 'T ALLOW THAT . HE 'S NEEDED HERE . HE IS ANSWERABLE ONLY TO ME . HE IS ANSWERABLE TO THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON METASENSORY ABILITIES FIRST ... ABOVE EVEN YOU , CAPTAIN . IN ANYONE ELSE THESE WOULD BE SMALL ENOUGH TO OVERLOOK , BUT LIEUTENANT MATHESON HAS A HIGHER REQUIREMENT . THAT SOUNDS LIKE DISCRIMINATION TO ME , HOLDING ONE PERSON TO A HIGHER STANDARD THAN THE REST ? IT IS WHAT IS . YOU CANNOT FIGHT WHAT IS . YOU CANNOT FIGHT WHAT IS . CAPTAIN , YOU KNOW THE TEST WE 'VE BEEN RUNNING , THE ONE TRACING THE MERGE FROM GALEN 'S FLYER BACK TO HIS SHIP ? WELL , I TRIED ONE LAST TIME TO BREACH HIS DEFENSES , FIGURING IF I COULD GET IN , WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET BACK CONTROL OF OUR SHIP . I WAS LOCKED OUT BY SOME KIND OF MANUAL CONTROL . HE SHUT THAT DOWN AND THEN SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN . HE KNOWS WE WERE SNOOPING . YES , I 'M SURE HE DOES . ALL RIGHT , LET IT GO . WE 'RE NOT GONNA GET ANYWHERE . ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS WAIT . ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS WAIT . CAPTAIN ... WHAT IF WE DO FIND SOMETHING OUT THERE ? WE 'LL SEND OUT E.V.A. TEAMS AND INVESTIGATE , WHATEVER IT IS . WHY , YOU WANT TO HEAD THE EXPEDITION ? LISTEN , IF YOU 'VE NEVER BEEN INTO HYPERSPACE BEFORE , YOU SHOULD GO . IT 'S AMAZING . IT 'S NOTHING LIKE BEING IN NORMAL SPACE . I WISH I COULD , BUT EXPOSURE TO HYPERSPACE INCREASES A TELEPATH 'S ABILITIES . THE LONGER THE EXPOSURE , THE GREATER THE EFFECT . IN HERE THE SHIELDING ON THE SHIP HELPS KEEP OUT MOST OF THE TELEPATHIC BOOST , BUT IF I GO OUTSIDE , EVEN IN AN E.V.A. SUIT , THERE 'S NO TELLING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN . I COULD CASUALLY SCAN ALL OF YOU WITH JUST A GLANCE . AND SINCE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS PREVENT ANYONE FROM GOING INTO HYPERSPACE ALONE , I GUESS I 'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT IT 'S LIKE . I GUESS THERE 'S ALWAYS A PRICE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING . I GUESS THERE 'S ALWAYS A PRICE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING . COMING UP ON A DENSE HYPERSPACE VEIL , CAPTAIN . COMING UP ON A DENSE HYPERSPACE VEIL , CAPTAIN . SHIP IS BEGINNING TO SLOW . RETROS FIRING . RETROS FIRING . WE 'RE THERE . WE 'RE THERE . I FELT THE SHIP COME TO A STOP , AND NO ONE- - OH , MY GOD . IT 'S TRUE--SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN HYPERSPACE . IT 'S INCREDIBLE . SCANNER READOUTS ARE HAZY , BUT IT APPEARS TO HAVE A SELF-CONTAINED ATMOSPHERE BUBBLE . ALL RIGHT , GALEN , WE FOUND IT . WE 'LL DO THIS SLOWLY . STAND BY TO DROP PROBES- - GALEN ? CAPTAIN ... THERE . CAPTAIN ... THERE . ALL RIGHT , I 'M GOING AFTER HIM . THE REST OF YOU , STAY PUT . YOU CAN 'T EXPECT ME- - IF HE TRIES TO LEAVE THE BRIDGE , RESTRAIN HIM . LIEUTENANT , THIS IS A MAJOR DISCOVERY . IT CAN 'T HURT TO RUN SURFACE SCANS WHILE HE 'S OUT THERE . AT LEAST FIND OUT ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE , GRAVITY , TEMPERATURE ... WE 'LL GIVE HIM THE HEADS-UP ... FOR HIS OWN GOOD . FOR HIS OWN GOOD . WHERE 'S THE CAPTAIN ? HE 'S DOWN THERE . WE 'RE JUST GETTING INITIAL READOUTS . YOU WON 'T BELIEVE THIS . STEEL , IRON , NICKEL , DEURIDIUM HYBRID ALLOYS , ALL WORTH MILLIONS ACROSS KNOWN SPACE . BUT THAT 'S NOT ALL . THE ENTIRE CORE IS PURE , SOLID QUANTIUM 40 . THAT ALONE IS WORTH BILLIONS TO ANY JUMPGATE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY . AND ABOVE THAT- - GOLD , PRECIOUS METALS , ALL VEINED THROUGH THOSE UPPER STRATA , WHOLE CAVERNS OF JEWELS AND METALS ... IT 'S A TREASURE TROVE . DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT A FIND LIKE THIS IS WORTH ? NO . NO , IT 'S NOT A TREASURE TROVE , AT LEAST NOT THE WAY YOU MEAN IT . WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE DAMN MINERAL SCANNER FOR HALF A MINUTE AND LOOK AT IT . FOR HALF A MINUTE AND LOOK AT IT . THAT IS NOT A TREASURE TROVE . IT 'S A MAUSOLEUM . THOSE CAVERNS AND MONOLITHS ARE GRAVESTONES THAT MARK THE PASSING OF A HIGHLY ADVANCED RACE OR CULTURE . ON MY WORLD WE LAID OUR CHIEFTAINS TO REST AT CROSSROADS , AS THIS IS A CROSSROAD , IN BURIAL MOUNDS THAT RESEMBLE THESE . THE GEMS , PRECIOUS METALS , AND ARTIFACTS WERE PROBABLY LEFT HERE BY THOSE FEW WHO KNEW HOW TO FIND THIS PLACE . OVER THE CENTURIES , NEW GRAVE SITES AND OFFERINGS BURIED THE OLDER ONES , LAYER AFTER LAYER OF IT . IT 'S A PLACE OF GLORY , A PLACE OF MEMORY ... MOST OF ALL , A PLACE- - A PLACE OF GOOD-BYES . YES . WELL , AS I SAID , AT THE VERY LEAST , THE FIND OF A LIFETIME . THE FIND OF A LIFETIME . NOW WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT 'S GOING ON ? NOW WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT 'S GOING ON ? HER NAME WAS ISABEL ... AND SHE WAS THE BEST OF US . EVERY TECHNOMAGE KNOWS THE 14 WORDS THAT WILL MAKE SOMEONE FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU FOREVER , BUT SHE ONLY NEEDED ONE . WHAT WORD ? " HELLO . " " HELLO . " SHE WOULD SIT ACROSS FROM ME ON COLD NIGHTS IN THE STUDY , HER TINY FRAME LOST IN AN ENORMOUS OVERSTUFFED CHAIR , HER FEET CURLED BENEATH HER . IN MY DREAMS I STILL REMEMBER THE PATTERN OF RUNES HAND-STITCHED TO THE HEM OF HER GOWN ... EVEN THOUGH I NEVER REALLY STUDIED THEM . EVEN THOUGH I NEVER REALLY STUDIED THEM . AT NIGHT WHEN I READ ALONE , I STILL HEAR HER SIGHING OVER PASSAGES ON THE PAGES WHICH TROUBLED HER . WE SPENT THE NIGHTS IN STUDY LIKE THAT . SOMETIMES NEVER SAYING A WORD ... AND NEVER NEEDING TO . AND NEVER NEEDING TO . SHE WAS YOUR WIFE ? SHE WAS YOUR WIFE ? NO . NOT IN THOSE TERMS . IT 'S DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT DEFINE OUR ORDER , BUT SHE WAS MY LOVE ... TO THE BREADTH AND DEPTH THAT MY SOUL CAN REACH . AND SECOND TO THIS PLACE , I WAS HERS . SHE SPENT HER LIFE SEARCHING FOR THIS . IT WAS HER DREAM , AND BECAUSE I LOVED HER , IT BECAME MINE , TOO . AFTER I ... LOST HER , I DEVOTED MY LIFE TO FINDING IT . YOU PUT US THROUGH ALL THIS JUST BECAUSE OF A PROMISE TO FIND THIS PLACE ? NOT JUST TO FIND IT . I PROMISED HER THAT SOMEHOW , SOMEDAY , WHATEVER THE COST ... WHATEVER THE COST ... I WOULD TAKE HER HERE TO REST . I WOULD TAKE HER HERE TO REST . IF YOU UNDERSTAND AT ALL , THEN YOU WILL LET ME FINISH IT . THEN YOU WILL LET ME FINISH IT . CARE NO MORE TO CLOTHE AND EAT ... TO THEE THE REED IS AS THE OAK . THE SCEPTER , LEARNING , PHYSIC MUST ... ALL FOLLOW THIS AND COME TO DUST . ALL LOVERS YOUNG , ALL LOVERS MUST ... CONSIGN TO THEE AND COME TO DUST . CONSIGN TO THEE AND COME TO DUST . WELL , NATURALLY , IPX IS GOING TO WANT A CUT OF THIS . THE HELL WITH IPX . JUST BECAUSE YOU WORK FOR THEM DOESN 'T GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO COME IN AND DESECRATE THIS PLACE . DESECRATE ? YES , DESECRATE . I FULLY INTEND TO KEEP THE SITE PRESERVED IN ITS NATURAL STATE AFTER WE MOVE IT TO THE RUSSIAN CONSORTIUM MUSEUM FOR XENOSTUDIES . ABSOLUTELY NOT . THESE ARE THE FINAL RESTING PLACES OF TECHNOMAGES , WISE MEN , WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE ? WHOEVER- - SET COURSE FOR THE LAST KNOWN HYPERSPACE BEACON AND TURN US AWAY . WHAT ? IF WE 'RE JUST GOING TO LEAVE , THEN WHY DID WE COME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE ? MAX , JUST SHUT UP , ALL RIGHT ? MAX , JUST SHUT UP , ALL RIGHT ? GALEN , THIS WAS YOUR IDEA . YOU BROUGHT US HERE . YOU KNOW HOW VALUABLE THIS PLACE IS . SAY SOMETHING . SAY SOMETHING . GOOD-BYE . GOOD-BYE . DUREENA , YOU BUSY ? NOT TERRIBLY . WHAT ? I 'VE BEEN THINKING ... I NEED SOMEONE TO DO A FAVOR FOR ME , SOMEONE ABSOLUTELY SINGLE-MINDED . WELL , IT 'S NOT FOR ME , ACTUALLY . FOR LIEUTENANT MATHESON . NAME IT . NAME IT . CAPTAIN- - W-W-WAIT A SECOND . WHAT IS IT TODAY ? IS MY OFFICE SUDDENLY GRAND CENTRAL STATION ? I WANTED TO WARN YOU- - THERE 'S A BOMB ONBOARD . DON 'T BE RIDICULOUS . IT 'S ATTACHED TO THE JUMP ENGINE , SET TO GO OFF ANY TIME NOW . SHE 'S WILLING TO KILL ALL OF US TO GET REVENGE FOR SOMETHING OR OTHER . AND HOW DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS ? WELL , I- - WELL , I- - LET ME SEE IF I CAN PICK YOUR BRAIN FOR A CHANGE . YOU GOT THIS FROM THE THOUGHTS OF A WOMAN THAT YOU SAW IN THE BULLET CAR . HOW COULD- - HER NAME IS DUREENA , AND I 'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE FOCUS ON REVENGE AND DEATH AS COMPLETELY AS SHE CAN WHEN SHE SETS HER MIND TO IT . LIEUTENANT MATHESON TOLD ME THAT YOU PROBED PART OF HIS MIND TO FIND OUT WHERE WE WERE GOING . A SMALL INFRACTION , BECAUSE YOU HAD YOUR OWN REASONS FOR IT , SO I FIGURED THAT YOU 'D HAVE EVEN MORE REASON TO PROTECT YOUR OWN SKIN . TO PROTECT YOUR OWN SKIN . YOU SAID CERTAIN PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD ? WHAT IS THE STANDARD FOR A WATCHMAN LIKE YOU , MR. JONES ? OR MORE TO THE POINT , WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES ? OR MORE TO THE POINT , WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES ? YOU FORGET ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW ... AND I 'LL FORGET ALL ABOUT THIS . AND I 'LL FORGET ALL ABOUT THIS . DEAL ? DEAL ? SIR , WE 'VE PICKED UP AN OPEN AIRLOCK ON DECK 14 . SHOULD I ALERT SECURITY ? SHOULD I ALERT SECURITY ? NO . THAT 'S ALL RIGHT . JUST KEEP DRIVING . JUST KEEP DRIVING . BEAUTIFUL ... BEAUTIFUL ... I 'M LEAVING AGAIN FOR A WHILE . I WANTED TO KNOW IF I SHOULD BOTHER COMING BACK AGAIN . YOU HIJACKED MY SHIP , GALEN . YOU BETRAYED MY TRUST . WHAT HIGHER INSULT COULD YOU PAY TO A FRIEND ? YOU DIDN 'T EVEN TRUST ME ENOUGH TO TELL ME THE TRUTH ABOUT WHY WE WERE GOING . IF I HAD , YOU WOULDN 'T HAVE COME . YOU DON 'T KNOW THAT . BECAUSE YOU DIDN 'T TRUST ME ENOUGH TO TELL ME , YOU NEVER WILL . I ADMIT THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE PUT MY PRIVATE AGENDA BEFORE THE MISSION , BUT YOU DID THE SAME . YOU ONLY WENT ALONG WITH THIS BECAUSE IT GAVE YOU THE CHANCE TO EXAMINE THE TECHNOLOGY OF MY SHIP . YOU , TOO , WERE FOLLOWING YOUR OWN AGENDA . NEITHER OF US CAN CLAIM ALTRUISM TODAY . Computer : [ BEEP ] 5 MILES COMPLETE . Computer : [ BEEP ] 5 MILES COMPLETE . YOU SAVED MY LIFE 10 YEARS AGO , GALEN , AND SEVERAL TIMES SINCE . I OWE YOU . FURTHER , YOUR IMPORTANCE TO THE MISSION FAR OUTWEIGHS THE OFFENSE , SO I 'M NOT GONNA PUT IT ON THE RECORD , BUT ... SO I 'M NOT GONNA PUT IT ON THE RECORD , BUT ... IT WAS WRONG . ON A CERTAIN LEVEL , PERHAPS . BUT ON A HIGHER ONE , I FULFILLED A PROMISE . I FULFILLED A PROMISE . AND I GIVE YOU ANOTHER- - I WILL NEVER AGAIN BETRAY YOUR TRUST . IF I HONORED ONE VOW , THEN YOU KNOW THAT I WILL KEEP THIS ONE . THEN YOU KNOW THAT I WILL KEEP THIS ONE . I CARRIED OUT HER LAST REQUEST , HONORED HER MEMORY . IF IT WERE YOU , WOULDN 'T YOU DO THE SAME ? I 'VE ALREADY MADE THAT PROMISE ... TIMES 300 . I 'VE ALREADY MADE THAT PROMISE ... TIMES 300 . HAVE YOU KEPT IT ? HAVE YOU KEPT IT ? NO . NOT YET . NO . NOT YET . THEN WHEN THE TIME COMES , I WILL HELP YOU KEEP YOURS ... AS YOU HAVE HELPED ME KEEP MINE . PERHAPS THEN WE CAN BOTH FORGIVE OURSELVES OUR COMMON CRIME . OUR COMMON CRIME . WHAT CRIME ? WHAT CRIME ? BEING ALIVE . BEING ALIVE . I AM LEAVING FOR A WHILE . YOU SAID THE WELL OF FOREVER WAS AN OPEN BOOK FULL OF ANSWERS FOR THOSE WHO LISTEN . WELL , WE WERE THERE , GALEN . WHERE ARE THE ANSWERS ? WHERE ARE THE ANSWERS ? FOR MAX EILERSON , THE QUESTION WAS , " IS THERE ANYTHING IN ALL THE UNIVERSE THAT I CANNOT HAVE ? " DOWNLOAD THE COORDINATES OF THE WELL INTO MY PERSONAL LOG ... AND DOWNLOAD THE BRIDGE VIDEO RECORDS OF THIS SUBJECT . Computer : UNABLE TO COMPLY . TECHNOSTATIC DISARRAY HAS ERASED ALL OF YOUR PRIMARY SOURCE INFORMATION . Galen : THAT ANSWER IS BEING DELIVERED ... CLEARLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY . LIEUTENANT MATHESON , HE WOULD HAVE HAD HIS ANSWER , TOO , HAD HE GONE TO THE WELL WITH GIDEON . MATTHEW DID RECEIVE HIS ANSWER ... BUT BECAUSE HE WAS NOT LISTENING , HE WILL HAVE TO LOOK ELSEWHERE . HE WILL HAVE TO LOOK ELSEWHERE . WHAT ABOUT ME ? WHAT ABOUT ME ? YOU ... SHOULD LEARN TO BE MORE CAREFUL WHEN TALKING IN FRONT OF AN OPEN CHANNEL TO MY SHIP . LOOK , I DON 'T LIKE HAVING TO TRUST ANYBODY , BECAUSE I 'M ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED , BUT JUST ONCE I 'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT I COULD ACTUALLY TRUST SOMEONE , THAT FOR AT LEAST ONE PERSON EVERYTHING ISN 'T ABOUT MONEY OR POWER . EVERYTHING ISN 'T ABOUT MONEY OR POWER . I THINK YOU 'VE RECEIVED THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION , DUREENA . THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION , DUREENA . MAYBE . MAYBE . BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR QUESTION , GALEN ? DID YOU FIND YOUR ANSWER TO WHY ? DID YOU FIND YOUR ANSWER TO WHY ? THAT ONE ... MAY TAKE A LITTLE LONGER . MAY TAKE A LITTLE LONGER .

 ( low hissing ) ( snoring ) ( elevator bell dings ) Miss Redmond ? ( elevator bell dings ) Miss Redmond . ( knocking ) Miss Redmond . ( British accent ) : She can 't hear you . The old darling 's deaf as a post . What 's the problem ? She 's got gas . She 's got what ? No , I mean , I can smell gas . Oh . Miss Redmond ! Good Lord , you 're right . Come on , Doris , darling , wake up . GARY : Come on , Doris . Come on , dear . You left the gas on . GARY : Wake up . Last week , it was the water , poor old duck . Miss Redmond , please open the door , would you ? Hey , where you going ? Hey ... Mi ... Miss ... All right , now , if you want to go down to the street , I may need your help in a minute . ( groans ) ( hissing ) ( snoring ) ( murmuring ) ( onlookers murmuring ) ( sighs ) Once more into the breach , dear friends . ( crowd murmuring in concern ) ( hissing ) ( sighs ) Doris , dear , it 's Clive . Come on . You and I are going for a little ride . DORIS : What are you doing ? ( Clive grunting ) Oh , sorry , we haven 't ... we haven 't got a moment to lose . One spark could set this whole thing off . What are you doing ? CLIVE : Come on , let 's go- - hurry , hurry . ( crowd murmuring ) ( explosion ) ( crowd screaming , gasping ) MAN : Did you get that ? Did you get that ? MAN 2 : Relax- - I 'm getting it , I 'm getting it . ( Clive grunting ) That was amazing . Pretty easy , really . Well , you ... you saved her life . MAN : Yeah , it 's going to be on all the news channels . Yeah , let 's hope it doesn 't end mine . Huh ? ( theme music playing ) CHUCK : What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * * * * ( radio chimes ) RADIOCASTER : Good morning , Chicago . It 's another cold one out there . Forecast is freezing temperatures , ( cat meowing ) and 90 % chance of more snow tonight . ( newspaper thuds against door ) Ooh , it 's going to be a cold one ... ( broadcast stops ) ( purrs ) " Hero killed in hit and run . " ( tires screeching ) Great- - now I get to save yesterday 's hero . I 'm out of here . CHUCK : Wait a minute . What about more pressing issues in the world ? Like what ? Like this painting and scraping , which you were supposed to help me with . Yeah , well , yesterday , I had to stop a woman from blowing up . And-and now this guy that helps me , he 's here in the paper again . Don 't you think that 's kind of strange ? Oh , yeah- - humanity first . Leave all the chores to Fishman . Look , I 'll help you with the painting later . Right now , I got to deal with Clive , uh ... Harbison . Sun-Times . Thanks , buddy . Gotcha , you little limey ! ( chuckles ) Oh , hello , it 's you . Yeah , I 'm sorry , old man . I 'm fresh out of heroics today . What are you doing- - you moving ? That 's very perceptive of you . Oh , that 's ... that 's good . That 's good- - you should move . You should move on in life . That 's very healthy . Matter of fact , you know what I think ? I think that you should start moving right now . Are you daft ? I 'm waiting for a removal van . Yeah , but it 's cold outside , and you ... you don 't want to catch a cold . ( chuckles ) Call this cold ? You should try a Scottish grass moor at dawn . Ah ! ( tires squealing ) Move it ! Coming through ! Here we go , baby . ( chuckles ) Oh , bloody hell . ( tires squealing ) Come on , run , you idiot ! Whoa ! This way . Whoa ! Go in there ! Whoa ! ( tires squealing ) MAN : Open the damn door ! Open it ! I think this is what they call an extreme example of road rage . I got you now , Clive ! You 're not getting away from me now ! ( gun firing ) I got you , you lousy little limey punk ! ( grunting ) ( gun firing ) Hold those doors ! ( gun firing ) ( screaming , gunfire ricochets ) Whoa , hold that bus ! Hey ! Hey , open those doors ! I 'm going to get your number ! CLIVE : Funny little lad . ( sighs ) Spot of courage ? No . You don 't mind if I do , eh ? Well ... I 'm indebted to you , Mr. , uh ... Hobson- - Gary Hobson . Ah , well , tell me something , Mr. Hobson . How is it you always seem to manage to turn up at the moment du crise , as it were . Uh ... forget about that . Who was that guy ? Never saw him before in my life . Uh-huh . Look , uh ... can I trust you , old man ? Have you , uh ... have you ever heard of the acronym MI6 ? Military intelligence , espionage . Obviously , I can 't divulge any details . Suffice it to say that in my chosen line of work , one tends to make enemies along the way . You 're a spy ? Shh . Officially , I 'm supposed to deny that . Unbelievable . ( laughs ) It is rather , isn 't it ? No , no , what I mean is I don 't believe a word you just said . Oh . Perhaps that 's just as well , for both our sake . So , where are you going to go now ? Oh , I 'm ... I 'm going to follow procedure . You know , go to ground , disappear . And what ... what about all your belongings ? Oh , casualties of war . We rehearse for that sort of eventuality , Hobson . And on no account should you blame yourself for what happened . Blame myself ? Yes , for exposing me , blowing my cover , destroying months of laborious effort . You weren 't to know . Don 't give it another thought ... oh . My stop . ( bell ringing ) Blast . Ha ! I seem to have mislaid my wallet . Oh , well . C 'est la guerre . Hey , wait . CHUCK : You invited him here ? GARY : Yep . He 's staying with you ? ( Clive singing in other room ) Yeah . Gare , how many times have I told you , don 't get involved ? Look , you can catch them , but you can 't cook them . Look , the guy doesn 't have a job , he-he 's out of money , he doesn 't have anywhere to go , he ... Look , people are trying to kill him , and I 'm responsible . Oh , there you go again , putting the whole world on your shoulders . A tree gets cut down in the rain forest , and it 's your fault . Do you even know who this guy is ? You don 't really believe he 's a spy , do you ? No , I don 't believe he 's a spy . I-I-I see the guy twice in the last two days . That 's a little bit more than a coincidence , don 't you think ? Yeah , it 's a coincidence , but Gare , everything is a c ... ( door opening ) CLIVE : Oh , hello . Wouldn 't happen to have a washing machine handy , would you ? Huh ? Well ... Thank you . Uh , Gary , you ... Huh ? Oh , uh , Clive Harbison , this is Chuck , uh , Fishman . Oh . The co-manager of the bar downstairs . Oh , delighted . Never met a bar manager I didn 't like . On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , huh ? I beg your pardon ? Look , he ... he can be trusted . Keep it under your hat . Oh , absolutely . I think , if you don 't mind , I 'll pop downstairs for a quick pick-me-up . Can I get you chaps anything ? No , thank you . Oh , all right . Um , Mr. Harbison , how long do we have the honor of your presence ? Oh , uh , two weeks at the outside . Just a question of laying low till everything calms down . ( laughs ) Oh , don 't worry , I have no intention of imposing . On hangers , please , and , uh , no starch . ( British accent ) : Righto . You can rest easy , Mr. Phelps . Your heart 's going to do just fine . What do you mean ? The museum isn 't interested in your painting . What ? Why not ? Because it 's a fake . Not a bad job , either , but ... A fake ? It can 't be . One , the brushwork is too studied . This is a laborious copy . Laistre painted in broad , vibrant strokes . Especially in contrast to the Eutra school , which was so popular at the time . Two , the canvas is of a manufacturer that wasn 't available until the 1800s . Laistre died in 1660 . And three , I happen to have seen the original of this painting . It hangs in a private collection outside Paris . Oh . I know it may be small comfort , Mr. Phelps , but many educated collectors are taken in by forgeries . That 's why the Guggenheim hired me . You 're sure ? Positive . ( indistinct newscast plays nearby ) If the painting gave your father pleasure , then it 's done its job . I 'm sorry to disappoint you . I 'll see myself out . ANCHOR : ... with a fascinating human interest story . REPORTER : Local resident Clive Harbison scaled down an eight-story building to break into the apartment of Mrs. Doris Redmond , then helped her down , saving her from a gas explosion . The apartment burst into flames seconds after Mr. Harbison carried her to safety . Show a little imagination . Imagination ? You- - you want red ceilings , peach walls , and white molding ? It 's a statement . A statement ? Yeah , it makes a statement , all right . " Get out of here fast . " And what would you know about that ? It even sounds disgusting , Chuck . I must say , your beef , absolutely first class . Mmm . No mad cows here . Hello . What 's all this ? Yeah , well , see , I am trying to redecorate , but I am getting no help from these two Philistines . What 'd you have in mind ? You know , something bold , something splashy . Tell you what . Why don 't you let me have a stab at it , hmm ? I mean , least I can do , under the circs . You paint ? I dabble . Oh ! Besides ... I 've never been one to trade on the kindness of strangers . Hey , some people sing for their suppers . Why don 't you let me paint for mine ? ( elevator bell dings ) All right , let 's see now . 1204 ... 1204 ... Hmm . Here we go . ( humming ) ( lock clicks ) Okay . Open sesame . Flown the coop , huh ? Smart guy . Very smart . ( thump ) You can run , but you cannot hide . GARY : Look , can 't this wait ? CHUCK : You 'll want to see this , believe me . The guy was up all night painting it . Now , listen , I 've got things I gotta do here , Chuck . Voil√† . Mm-hmm . GARY : He did all that ? Some dabbler , huh ? Pretty darn talented . So you 're an artist ? Oh , no , no , I 'm not an artist . No , my talent lies more in the realm of imitation , rather than creation . You know , you have a real gift . You can make a lot of money at this . ( laughs ) The world of commerce had a different opinion , so I turned my talents in a different direction . So , what about the , uh- - the spy thing ? Look , you 've all been very kind . I-I was just trying to find some way of repaying you , that 's all . Let 's-let 's just leave it at that , shall we ? And , uh , who was that guy yesterday ? The one that tried to kill you ? Um , uh , a business associate . Well , a former business associate . We had a bit of a falling out . Well , Gary and I have a falling out every day , but I don 't try and run him over with my car . Yes , well , Marty 's got rather a hot temper , but I wouldn 't worry about him . I mean , his-his bark is a lot worse than his bite . ( bullet casings pinging ) ( chuckles ) Dead meat . CHUCK : One minute I got peach and white moldings , and the next , I 'm looking at the Sistine Chapel . MARISSA : Gotta hand it to him- - the man 's got talent . CHUCK : Yeah , a regular Renaissance man . Hey , where the hell have you been ? A chicken truck . What ? Chicken truck ? At the- - a school bus ran into a chicken truck , and the chicken truck , it- - it 's a long story . ( hearty laughter nearby ) Where 's Clive ? Oh , he 's in the kitchen teaching Mario how to make crepes Suzette . Crepes Suzette ? MARISSA : Yeah , they 're really good . Turns out he 's a gourmet cook , too . You know , I think I might get used to this guy . Really ? MARTY : Gary Hobson ? Read about you in the paper the other day . Where is he ? Who ? You know who . CHUCK : Hey , shorty , we 're closed , so why don 't you get on out of here , huh ? Really ? Uh , come to think of it , now we 're open . Do you like crepes Suzette ? MARTY : No . Hey , what 's going on , guys ? Where is he ? GARY : I-I-I-I don 't know . I ... ( stammers ) ... I don 't even really know who he is even . Hmm . All right , I know you 're here , you limey piece of ... Clive . Faye ! ( grunts ) Oh ! Ow ! You don 't want to get between me and Clive , you got me ? 'Cause I can 't be responsible for who gets caught in the crossfire . Could be you . Could be him . It could be her . We understand each other ? GARY : Well , now wait a second ... MARTY : Good . I 'll be back . Let me guess . That was Marty . Marty . Faye , if you 'll just let me explain ... Do I have to hit you again ? I will , I swear . ( muffled grunting ) ( muffled grunting ) ( moans ) Let me go . Could we talk about this inside ? ( sighs ) I wish Crumb were here . He 'd know what to do . Well , can we contact him ? Uh , no , you can 't , because Crumb is on a river in Montana . Sleeping in tents . CLIVE : How the devil did you find me ? I went looking for Gary Hobson . The paper said he assisted you . Oh . Hello , Clive . Hi . Uh , Charles , Gary , Marissa , um- - I have a friend to introduce . This lovely young thing ... ( gasps ) ... is Faye Davis . CHUCK : I gotta hand it to you , Clive . You got a devoted bunch of friends . FAYE : I am not his friend . Nor am I a young thing . Listen to me , you patronizing , double-dealing four-flusher , you will finish what you started , or I 'll see you behind bars , I swear it . Faye ... Don 't " Faye " me . Faye ... You 've got till Friday . Faye ... If that painting isn 't back where it belongs , I will find you and personally nail your sorry hide to the wall . Nice meeting you . Lovely woman . ( door slams ) Absolutely no sense of humor . You want to explain ? Oh , now listen , Hobbers ... No , no . Wait a second . Don 't-don 't call me Hobbers either . Let me tell you something . The last two days , I 've had a gun stuck in my nose , I 've been shot at and almost ran over . So now , why don 't you try to explain right now ? I suppose you 're right . Yeah . And the-the truth , Clive . The whole , and , uh , nothing but- - so help me God . Oh , Lord , but that woman can hit . We 're waiting . Oh , yes . Right . Well , um , let me take you back to London . The swinging ' 60s . Home of penniless young art student Clive Harbison . Night in , night out , he would toil diligently in his Chelsea studio to hone his craft- - to summon forth art from the chaos . His paintings were received politely , but something was missing . All too quickly he recognized his own limitations . No fresh ideas , no originality . His real gift was for mimicry . In copying the masters , it was as if the spirit of the artist entered into him . He could reproduce their works with uncanny accuracy and understanding . And once that gift was recognized , our young hero 's life took a- - a somewhat unusual turn . Many a man 's vices have been nothing worse than good qualities run wild . So it was with the brilliant new art thief , who came to be known as the Chameleon . CHUCK : Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Let me get this straight . You steal a famous painting , you replace it with a copy , and no one ever found out ? Well , in some cases , the curators know , but they 're too embarrassed to admit they 've got a forgery on their walls . So , how 'd you get mixed up with Marty ? Marty , yes . Well , despite his boorish manners , Marty Jarmisch was plugged in to a certain strata of modern day robber barons , who would gladly overpay for a piece of artwork they could never publicly display or even acknowledge . Well , what about your conscience ? Didn 't that bother you ? My conscience ? Um , yes , well , it tugged a bit ... on occasions . But I was young , Marissa . Intoxicated with the good life . Besides , I figured if my copies were fooling the experts , then the public wasn 't really losing out . Anyway , what were my sins compared with those who were underwriting my career ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . So then what happened , Clive ? Yeah , well , all good things come to an end . And one hot summer night in Torremolinos , Marty blundered . In a rare fit of generosity , he made a gift to a dark lady of his acquaintance- - a watercolor by Goya ... What 's this ? ... recently liberated by yours truly from a nearby villa . What 's this ? What- - Unfortunately , the police were onto the theft , and caught him red-handed . Poor Marty . He took the fall , instead of me . Ah , the vicissitudes of fortune . Mmm . How the wheel turns . Somehow , the years passed , and I found myself in Chicago , where a local businessman who 'd made an illegal fortune through insider trading , expressed keen interest in a Vincent Van Gogh he 'd long admired . In the course of researching the assignment , I met a young woman by the name of Faye Davis , recently employed as a curator of the museum . Drawn together by a mutual interest in art , we soon developed a warm friendship . Faye knew nothing of my chosen profession . I pulled off the Van Gogh job without a hitch . Unfortunately , I hadn 't counted on Faye 's expertise . She detected the forgery , put two and two together , and came up with me . We talked things over ... No , don 't throw that ! ... and I solemnly undertook to mend my ways . To wit , to return the painting , give up crime , and make an honest woman out of Faye . Or perhaps I should say , allow her to make an honest man out of me . MARISSA : So , you were gonna marry her ? What else could I do ? I 'd finally met my match . CHUCK : But you got cold feet . Uh , well , not exactly . So , she got cold feet . If you 'd just let me finish . Let him finish . Finish . CLIVE : I set out to retrieve the van Gogh from its new owner . I told Faye to meet me at the museum at midnight , when who should come crawling out of the upholstery , but ... Say good-bye , Clive ! ... my old pal . ( gun clicks ) Somewhat the worse for wear after three years in a Spanish prison , Marty was in an extremely truculent state of mind . Yes . Anyway , my quick wit saved mefrom a grizzly fate . I had to disappear double quick , and Faye- - poor Faye- - was left in the lurch , feeling betrayed and abandoned . So you never contacted her ? What can I say that she 'd ever believe ? Hell hath no fury , and all that . Besides , I figured that fate was trying to tell me something . That it was too late to change . You know , once a thief ... And-And so ... so how long ago was this , Clive ? Three years . Yeah , I laid low in a variety of countries . Finally made it back here to the one place I figured they wouldn 't look for me- - the scene of the crime . I made a living painting portraits . Children , mostly . I was beginning to think I 'd put my past behind me . And then we ran into each other . Yes , well , no regrets there . Saving Doris is one of the few acts I can look back on with unabashed pride . I should be grateful to you , old man . Let me get this straight . This museum has your Van Gogh . So where is Van Gogh 's Van Gogh ? Well , actually , not very far from here , in a private home . So , now what ? Oh , I would have thought that was obvious . I retrieve the picture , and I replace it in the museum . It 's either that or face the fury of Faye Davis , which is a fate I 'd rather avoid . Hmm . So , you 're gon ... You 're gonna steal that painting ? In a nutshell , yes . And not to worry , Hobbers . I may be out of practice , but this larceny business is like riding a bicycle . Ah . Ooh , I 'd better go . A lot of work to do . Hmm . ( British accent ) : Not to worry , Hobbers . ( meowing ) How many times I told you , this is my chair ? ( trains rattling in distance ) " Thief mauled by guard dogs . Arrested . " ( barking ) MARISSA : You don 't want to help him ? GARY : Help him ? The guy 's a crook . But a nice crook . He has a good heart , Gary . He just went down the wrong road for a while . He went down the ... He 's been down the same wrong road for 20 years now . But it was for a good cause . Yeah . Something like , uh , stealing from the rich to enlighten the poor . MARISSA : Look , you 'd be giving him a chance to redeem himself , to start over again , and do something with his life . Redeem ... What you two want me to do is , you want me , with a known felon , to break into a private residence and steal a painting ! A stolen painting that was illegally obtained by a guy who made millions cheating in the stock market . You want to take my car ? ( barking ) Shh , shh . This ... This is what comes of hasty research . ( barking ) CHUCK : Are you hungry , pup ? Nice doggie . ( grunting ) What was that ? Sleeping pills . Good Lord . ( quiet growl ) CHUCK : Good boy . Huh ? Nice doggie . ( dog whining ) ( Chuck sighs ) Ha ! That was quick . Well , I 'm-I 'm much obliged to you chaps . But how on earth did you find me ? Well , uh , I-I read an article . Uh , the ten richest guys in Chicago , and , uh , three of ' em happened to be art buffs , so the , uh ... We went to the , uh , first two houses earlier , which is why we were late . Yeah , but what about the dog ? Dog was in the article . Oh , I see . Oh , right . Well , I 'll be off then . All right . Yeah . Good hunting . ( mumbles ) Let 's go . Hey . Ah , come on . Wait a minute . You 're not going anywhere . Look at this . ( Chuck panting ) GARY : Oh , for Pete 's sake . Oh . ( clock chimes playing tune ) Clive , don 't do that ! Huh ? ( gasps ) Now what ? The-The painting- - there 's-there 's a , uh ... uh ... Passive infrared motion detector . What ? Good Lord , you 're right . God , a crafty beggar . Yeah . Yeah , but how on earth did you find that out ? Uh , the article . That is one well-researched story . All right , this is gonna take some careful maneuvering . All right , steady on , old man . Cool and calm . ( sighs ) CHUCK : Hey , check it out . Gare , they got an autographed Michael Jordan sneaker . All right , steady as you go . No sudden moves . CHUCK : You know , I think these are the very same shoes he wore against the Jazz in the finals . I can practically smell the sweat from here . ( gasps ) Got it . ( loud beeping ) Oh , brilliant ! What do we do now ? Run away ! Run away ! CLIVE : Uh , uh , uh ! Don 't touch , old man . So , uh , this is an original Van Gogh , huh ? How much is a thing like this worth ? On the open market , something upwards of $ 30 million . $ 30 million ? For something like this ? Guy can 't even stay inside the lines . ( chuckles ) Right . Now for that museum . This could be tricky . Um , I might need some help here . CHUCK : Help ? Some help with what ? Oh , well , nothing elaborate , Hobbers . And this time , there won 't be any dogs . Yeah , yeah . Let me tell you something . First of all , my name 's not Hobbers , and second of all , they don 't have dogs at museums . They-They 've got guards with guns . MARISSA : Clive , why don 't you just turn the painting over to the police anonymously or something ? No , I can 't do it , dear . There 's Faye to consider . Faye ? Yes . Oh , didn 't I tell you ? She was the curator of the museum when I stole the Van Gogh . And if it came out that the museum had accepted a piece of forged art while she was on watch , so to speak- - well , it would just ruin her reputation . ( door opening ) No . The only way I can put these things right is to break into that museum myself and replace the painting . How are plans shaping up ? Faye . Talk of the devil . Faye . My God ... you did it . Uh , the first part , yes . Uh , Faye , could we talk out there ? Fantastic . Yeah , isn 't it just ? Would you excuse us ? Sure . Um , make yourselves at home . CLIVE : Uh , just through here . What are you doing here ? Isn 't it obvious ? Keeping an eye on you . No need for that . I gave you my word . ( laughs ) Yes , well , we both know what that 's worth , don 't we ? ( sighs ) Uh , Faye , about that night ... I , uh ... What ? Nothing . Never would have worked , anyway . Yeah , well , that 's all blood under the bridge , isn 't it ? So , how are you getting on in New York ? Guggenheim still treating you well ? How did you know I was working at the Guggenheim ? I like to keep my hand in . You 've had several offers . I understand the Getty wanted you . Palm trees and smog ? Forget it . You always were a snob . You 're looking well , Faye . Mm , don 't . I never stopped thinking about you . Not ever . Ow . Didn 't know you still cared . Don 't flatter yourself . I stopped thinking about you a long time ago . Faye , you are a terrible liar . Not as big as you are . You had a gift , Clive . You turned your back on it . I 'm a copyist , a mimic , that 's all . Maybe you are just a thief . So , what time do we start ? ( door opening ) ( door closing ) ( indistinct conversation ) ( indistinct conversations ) ( click ) ( Chuck whistling ) ( indistinct conversation ) That 's quite all right ... ( resuming conversation ) I can 't believe I 'm doing this . Yeah . It 's like the blind leading the blind , huh ? ( laughing ) Oh ! Ten minutes . Everybody understand their roles ? Yes , sir . We go to the museum , we fall to pieces , and we get arrested . Steady on , Charles . Just do as we rehearsed . Everything will work out like clockwork . Everything is under control . Well , not everything . Ooh , what is this , a private party ? Or is anyone welcome ? CLIVE : Look , Marty , let her go . Just take me in her place , all right ? Trade her life for yours ? ( laughs ) Yeah . Lady , I think you 've just been insulted . What do you want , Marty ? Well , now , what could it possibly be ? All right , let 's see . Um , her life for the keys to your car ... No , no . Uh , her life for a certain piece of art ? Getting warmer . Her life for a certain $ 30 million piece of art ? Ah , now we 're getting hot . Hot . Clive . Here , Marty , take it , it 's yours . Just go . MARTY : Uh-huh . Uh-huh , I see . Her life for a fake Van Gogh . Now , that 's what I call a real smart trade . Yeah , but see , the thing is , Marty , it 's not a fake . It 's the real thing . Ooh , right , right , and you guys have gone and you 've formulated this incredibly elaborate plan to steal the fake . Yeah . That makes perfect sense to me . Marty ... One more word out of you , she 's toast . Now , let 's get this show on the road . Shake it . You know , I 'm sure you 've got a great plan , Clive . Tell me all about it on the way . Move it , let 's go . You 're not going to need a paper where we 're going . Shake it . It 's showtime . CLIVE : Marty , would you listen to me ? Now , these people are innocent . The only reason they 're involved is because of a remarkable sense of friendship and decency . Now , come on , Marty , let them go , I implore you . Look , I 'll get you the Van Gogh myself , or I 'll , I 'll turn myself in- - whatever you want . Your recent conversion to sainthood is truly touching , Clive , but what 's beginning to really bug me is how stupid you think I am . Now , let 's get going . ( sighing ) : Well ... let 's go , Marissa . All right . Phase one . Nice try . Excuse me , Miss , we close in five minutes . Oh , thank you . I couldn 't help noticing , but ... You were wondering what a blind person is doing in an art museum . Frankly , yes . You may find this hard to believe , but , um , sometimes I can feel the painting . Some of these works exude such a , such an aura , I can sense the color and the form right off the canvas . Wow . Kind of a metaphysical thing ? Exactly . As a matter of fact , sometimes I get so inspired , I do a little painting myself . Amazing . It is , isn 't it ? Well , I , uh , have to call for my ride . Could you point me to the ... ? Oh , yes , phones are down the hall on the left . Thank you . Mm-hmm . Oh ... Oh . " Feel the painting . " Oh , brother . ANNOUNCER : The museum will be closing in five minutes . ( sighs ) Listen , Faye , this may not be the most opportune time to say this , but I meant everything I said back at the bar . I never stopped thinking about you- - never- - and I , I just ... Me , too . MARTY : I think I need a hanky here . No more mush , or I plug her now . ANNOUNCER : The museum is now closed . ( alarm ringing ) Damn . Yeah , this is Andrews over at the University of Chicago Art Museum . I 've got a break-in alarm on the second floor . Okay , send some guys over ? Hey , pal , do we have a security violation here ? Who are you ? Who am I ? I 'm Gilliland , Internal Systems Management . I got a beep . What 's the situation ? It looks like a second-story emergency exit . Ooh , did you call the police ? Yeah , just a minute ago . I was going to go check it out myself . Whoa , whoa , whoa , no heroics . You let the pros do what they 're paid to do . Got that ? Right . Got it . Good . What 's the problem here ? We got a little , uh , situation here , Officer . That was quick . GARY : Yeah , we had a 36 over at 1825 Michigan . I had to give ' em a quick 10-4 . Oh , well , we got a possible intruder on the second floor emergency exit , a 14-24-16 . Well , we 'll go check it out . Yeah , you do that , Officers , check it out right away . Thank you . ( alarm continues ) Hey , how 's it going ? Well , as the man said when he jumped off the 20-story building , " So far , so good . " By my watch , we 've got five minutes before the real police arrive . All right , it 's all yours . See you in the gallery . Okay . Oh , yeah , I 've designed security systems all over the world . The Louvre . In Paris ? Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , Cleveland . The , uh ... Uh , here 's your problem . Oh . A blind lady ? Sorry , I got lost . If you don 't mind , I 'll let you take it from here , huh ? Right , sorry to have bothered you . ( screaming ) What 's happening ? What 's going on ? I don 't know , it looks like he 's having some sort of an attack or something . Hey , buddy , do you need a doctor or something ? ( groans ) : My pills . What ? My pills ! You 've got to do something . Help him . All right , take it easy , little fella . ( screaming ) Take it easy . All right ... in my pocket , my pocket . ( groans ) Ooh ... Quickly . ( grunting ) Thank you . You okay ? It 's a genetic condition . " To prevent bloating " ? The brain blows up like a pumpkin , but , uh , I 'm feeling much better now . Well , you 're sure ? Yeah , yeah . Tell you what , uh , why don 't I escort the lady out , and you , uh , keep an eye on things over here , okay ? Okay . Good luck . Shall we ? Yes , we shall . This way . ( grunts ) Come on , hurry up . Don 't rush me , old man . These things cannot be rushed . All right , there we are . All right . Bravo . Marty ? I was getting lonely . Ow . All right , well , where 's Faye ? Bound and gagged in the van , Clive , but not to worry , I didn 't hurt her . If she 's stupid enough to get involved with you , I figure , well , that 's punishment enough . Okay , hand it over . Come on , sonny , don 't be a fool . I said hand it over . Wait a minute , how do I know if this is the real one or not ? How do you know it 's the real one ? Well , look , you know where I live , you know where I work . Why would I ... ? Ah , shut up . Clive , boy , I 'd plug you right now , but I think you 'll suffer a lot more knowing how much I 'm gonna be whooping it up on my percentage of this . I figure about five mil , n 'est-ce pas ? ( cackles ) Toodles , mate . Five million ? ( chuckles ) That 's rather an optimistic figure , don 't you think , for a fake Van Gogh ? Yeah , except I gave him the real one . Come on , let 's go . You gave him the real one ? What 'd you give him the real one for ? Come on , let 's ... Grab that . What 'd you give him the real one for ? OFFICER : Hold it right there ! ( gun cocks ) Now ! Freeze ! Just keep it up , hands up , let 's go ! Clive ! Don 't move , Mister ! Right there ! MARTY : This could cost you your job . Do you know who I am ? He doesn 't look very happy , does he ? Get your hands off me . Yeah , yeah , just shut up and get in . ( groaning and muttering ) So Marty gets caught with the real painting . The police figured he was inside the museum pulling off the switch . And the illustrious career of the Chameleon comes to an end . Finally brought to justice . Well , wait a minute . Marty wasn 't the Chameleon ; you are . Yeah , well , uh , the police , they don 't know that . I won 't tell if you don 't . MARISSA : Oh ... see no evil , speak no evil . Tell me , Hobbers , you sly beggar , how did you manage this one ? Yeah , Hobbers , I was wondering the same thing , considering you didn 't have any visual aid this time , if you know what I mean . Oh , well , I , I was , uh- - well , we were running late , and I figured the police couldn 't be far away when Marty showed up , so it was a rare opportunity and I , uh , I took it . Improvisational art . Yeah , yeah , something like that . Very good . Now , out you go . Huh ? And , uh , take this silly toy with you , will you ? Because Faye and I have got , ooh , three years to catch up on . We do ? Oh , we do . ( chuckles ) ( moans ) Well , uh , we can take a hint . Come on , Spike . Come on , Spike . Okay , you only have to tell us once . Oh , uh , well , uh ... ( clears throat ) MAN : See you guys at the station . Well , that was an interesting evening . Yeah , it 's still pretty early . Hey , you guys want to get some dinner ? No , I 'm going home to bed . What 's the matter with you ? What do you mean , what 's the matter wi- - what 's the matter with me ? I 'm tired , I want to go to bed . Is that all right with you ? MARISSA : Stick in the mud . CHUCK : You need a ... you need a little excitement in your life , Gare . MARISSA : Yeah . GARY : Excitement in my ... What did , what did we just do tonight ? CHUCK : All work and no play makes Gary a very dull boy . MARISSA : Exactly . GARY : Do you know how silly that sounds ? You know , I usually don 't agree with him , Gary , but for once , he 's right . I 'm right . He 's r- - you 're agreeing with him ? Yes , I am . You 're agreeing with him ? You know what ? I ought to arrest the both of you .

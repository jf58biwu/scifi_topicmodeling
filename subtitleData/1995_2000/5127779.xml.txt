 Hello , Lucy . Hmm . That 's a new tip cup , isn 't it ? Yes . I thought so . Good-bye . How in the world did she get the nickname sunshine ? I was joking , Dick . Oh , that 's clever . What I 'm about to say may be repeated to no one . What is it ? I was in the chancellor 's office , and they were discussing the vacancy left by Dean Sumner . Mary , I have it on excellent authority that you have been selected as the new Dean of the school of arts and sciences . Me ? ! Shh ! Me ? You . I 'm the new Dean ? You 're the new Dean . You 're the new Dean . Remember , not a word to anyone . Watch out , you idiot ! You 've just bumped into the new Dean ! and coca-cola classic me , too , pumpkin . I can 't wait . Bye . Oh , so you 're seeing Don tonight ? Seein ' him ? I 'm losin my virginity to him . I can come back . Oh , no you don 't . You just fix that thing . Sally , this is gonna be a night you 'll remember for the rest of your life . You know , I 'll never forget the night that I lost my virginity to , uh ... oh , what 's-her-name over at the place . Magic ! Yes , it 's a special time . Do you know what you 're going to be wearing ? Not a lot . You know what I 'm Sayin ' , uh , uh ... what 's your name ? You know what I 'm Sayin ' , Freddy ? I think so . You know , Sally , sex isn 't always all it 's cracked up to be . How would you know ? I don 't . Well , Dubcek 's my expert . This little lady told me she lost her virginity 14 times , huh ? Wait . Is that possible ? No , but a girl 's got to be mindful of her reputation . Well , Sally , we knew that this time would come someday , so we wanted to make sure that you had protection . See ya . Oh , uh , Nina ... now that you 're going to Mary 's new office and leaving me , I want to wish you luck and tell you I 've never been happy with your work . And now that I 'm leaving , I want you to know you can kiss my black behind . Hello , Mary . Oh , Dick , you don 't have to call me Dean . I didn 't . I said , " hello , Mary . " Oh , good . Because nothing 's changed . I 'm still Mary . It 's just that I got a major promotion to a position of genuine authority , so if you 'd wanted to call me Dean , I 'd understand , but you don 't have to . I didn 't . Good . This office is amazing , Mary . Yeah . I especially like your new ceramic fish . What is that ? It 's a gift . You know what would go beautifully with that ? This . Oh , you have such a good eye . I 'll go get the rest of my stuff . Good . I 'll give you a hand . Smell this one . Ahh ! Mmm ! Ok , now , smell it on . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Stop smelling her ! Hi , Don . Sally , what are you doing ? Oh , I got some great stuff for tonight . Look , almond body lotion . I 'm gonna smell like a big almond . Almonds are good . Yeah . Oh , and check this one out . When you blow on it , it gets hotter . Whoo ! Yeah . Sally , Sally , could you come over here ? Oh , sure , I 'll just um- - hey , you don 't have any venereal diseases , do you , Don ? No ! Good ' cause I 'm lookin forward to tonight , but not that much . Will you go away ? ! Sally , I appreciate your comin ' down here , but , you know , until the clock strikes 5 : 00 , I 'm still on duty . Ah , tah ... uh ... I also got this for tonight . Rico , I 'm takin a personal day . But the shift 's over in 10 minutes . I said I 'm takin a personal day . Aah ! My office is so empty without you . Well ... how about a new couch to brighten things up ? Can you do that ? Oh , sure . Just call the warehouse and tell them Dean Albright said you could have a new couch . And maybe a chair ? Sure . And some sporty throw pillows to add a splash of color ? Make it so ! Oh , this is unreal . And my girlfriend 's the Dean ! My girlfriend 's the Dean ! I 'm the Dean ! Phelps , take the day off . Thank you , Dr. Solomon . So , Ron , how are the designs for my office coming ? Dick , let me be up front with you . There are people who are going to tell you not to go Louis xiv . I 'm not those people . Good . I hate those people . Carry on , my good man . What do you think you 're doing ? Refilling my drink . No free refills . Oh , is that a fact ? That 's a fact . Do you know who you 're dealing with ? Unfortunately . That 's it ! By the power vested in me by the Dean of arts and sciences , you 're fired ! Pack your bags , princess ! The free Ride 's over . You are out of here ! Fine . [ Chuckling ] What 's so funny ? Oh , if you only knew what you 've been eating all this time . The joke 's on you . I may have eaten it , but never once did I ever ... keep it down . [ Tango music plays ] Yaah-ah ! Ugh ! [ Knock on door ] Morning . Happy ? [ Snickering ] Me , too-ski . [ Humming tango ] Surprise ! Surprise ! So maybe it wasn 't the best idea to throw Sally a surprise party . Tommy , maybe you 'd like to lose your virginity without your family jumping out and yelling , but I know I wouldn 't . Oh , Sally , are you Ok ? Yeah . What 's for breakfast ? We are so proud of your entrance into womanhood that we got you this plaque . Tommy ? " Hats off to you , employee of the week . " Speech ! Speech ! Isn 't there something you want to tell us about last night ? Oh . Oh ... uh ... Ok , uh ... could ya take the hat off first ? Thanks . Um ... well , so , I- - I went out ... and I met Don at the police station , uh ... uh ... well , here I am ! Ooh ! Cereal . Come on ! Hold on a minute , Missy ! Aren 't you leaving something out ? I don 't think so . About losin' your virginity , you big knucklehead ? I can 't tell you about that . Well , why not ? I don 't know . I just can 't . It 's none of your business ! Of course it 's our business ! This is what we do . This is why we 're here on earth . I told you all about my first night with Mary , every disgusting little detail , no matter how much you begged me to stop . Yeah , and now it 's your turn , so spill ! Why do you guys even care so much ? Because a--it 's real dirty , and b--you won 't tell us ! It 's like the less you tell me , the more I want to know ! Well , you 're never gonna know . Oh , now I wanna know even more . Mary ? Oh , Mary ? Come to bed , my little tangerine . I can 't . I 'm still working . But it 's late , mutton chop . I know . Daddy needs a kiss-kiss . Well , daddy 's not going to get a kiss-kiss 'cause I 'm still cleaning up the mess you made with Lucy . Oh , that . Dick , she filed a grievance ! I had to fire her , Mary . She flouted our authority . Our authority ? You don 't have any authority . I 'm the Dean , not you . Me . Me--Dean , you--Boyfriend . Rawwrr ... tomorrow morning , you are going to convince her to take her job back . Why do I have to do it ? Oh , you 're incredible . First you give Dr. Strudwick a raise , then you carpet the men 's room . It was so echoey . Dick , I have been Dean exactly one day , and , thanks to you , I have already been dressed down by the chancellor . Fine . If it will make you feel better , I 'll take care of Lucy . Thank you . Now will you come to bed , my little wisp of cheesecloth ? No , but I 'll see you at the office tomorrow . Ahh ! Fine . So long . It 's my bedroom . Then I guess it 's the couch for you . Guess again . Oh ! Then it 's a fancy hotel room , is it ? It 's your butt out the door ! That 's it ! I 'm leaving ! I just kicked you out . Too bad . I wasn 't listening . Please ... let me stay . Out ! That 's it ! I 'm leaving ! [ Thinking ] Dear diary , I 'm so confused . I 've always been able to tell you everything , so , here it goes ... last night- - last night ... Don and I- - we- - why are you being so nosy ? Why can 't you just leave me alone ? What do you think Don did to her ? I don 't know , but I think it 's time we found him and opened up a little can of whup-ass . Hello , boys . Why don 't you save the sweet talk for the ladies , Don ? Yeah . Did you think we wouldn 't know ? Did you think we wouldn 't find out ? Stupid ! What 's the matter ? Is Sally Ok ? She 's a mess ! And we want to know why . Well , what did she tell you ? Nothin ' . That 's the problem . Well , how do you know something 's wrong ? Because she tells us everything about you . The way you wear your hat ... the way you sip your tea , the way your smile just beams , the way you sing off-key . No , no . Yes ! She tells us everything , and you can 't take that away from me . I would never do anything to harm Sally . I love her . Oh , yeah ? Well , then , why isn 't she talkin ' ? I don 't know ! That 's her business ! Why , I oughta--Ok . All right , we 'll play the little game your way . But , remember , we 're watchin ' you , 24 hours a day . I thought we were gonna go see a movie . Shh ! Eh ! Eh ! Lucy , please , sit down . I summoned you here because there seems to have been a little misunderstanding . Somehow you got the impression that I fired you . Ha ha ha ! Oh , you mean like when you said , " pack your bags , princess , the free ride is over " ? Well , I 'm not saying the misunderstanding is entirely your fault . Let 's try another approach . Cut the bull , doc . You want me to drop my grievance so you can get your sorry butt off the chopping block . Ahh , poor thing . I see the mashed potato fumes have gone to your brain . What ? Look , things happened that maybe shouldn 't have happened . I 'm not here to place blame . But I 'm sure we can reach an agreement just as soon as you substantially change your attitude . [ Chuckling ] I don 't have to change my attitude for you . Ok ! I tried to give you a second chance , but you blew it ! Out you go ! You 're fired ! You can 't fire me . You don 't have the power . Oh , I don 't , do I not ? No , you don 't ! And you never did . Now , isn 't that right ? Please , let there be an earthquake . Let there be an earthquake . Pardon me . I gotta make a call to my lawyer . Oh ! Oh ho ho ho ho ! So ... you 're gonna cut me out of your will , are you ? Well , I can do the same ! You 're out ! I am so screwed . Sally . Don . I 've been goin ' nuts . Are you all right ? Oh , Don ... I 've never been happier in my life . I just wish I could enjoy it , but I can 't because I 'm too busy freakin ' out ! Why ? Well , it 's like ... you know when you buy a new pair of stiletto heels ? Well , go on . And they 're really great , and everybody says they 're really great , and " why don 't you just get ' em ? They 're so great . " So you finally take the plunge , and you love ' em . They 're perfect , and they 're surprisingly comfortable , but then all of a sudden you realize , " what have I done ? I 'm up so high , " and what 's up ahead of me ? " The world is full of escalators and heating grates and sod , and what if I 'm not able to handle all that ? " Well , Sally , you 're so tall , you could just wear flats . I guess I just didn 't realize what an impact losing my virginity would have on my life . Losing your virgin- - hokey smokes ! You didn 't know ? No , Sally , I ... I 'm honored it was me . I ... eh heh heh ... I guess if you 've never been with anyone else , then you can 't fully appreciate how magnificent a lover I really am . I can imagine . Oh , you are a lucky girl , Sally ! A lucky , lucky girl . I know . That 's why I wanted to shout it from the mountain tops ! But when I got home , I couldn 't tell anybody . That 's Ok . Have you told anybody we did it ? Oh , sure , tons of people , but ... that was months ago . But not since we actually did it ? Of course not . What kind of heel do you think I am ? This information is only for members of the Sally-Don club . There are only 2 members . You and me , Don ? Me and you . Can Tommy join ? No . Good . Because there 's a part of me that feels like if anybody else found out about it , it 'll stop being our thing , and I don 't ever want it to stop being that . It never will . I 'm so glad we had this talk . Anytime you want to , uh ... talk ... you just see me . Sometimes I just like to lie back and let you do the talkin ' . So you like to , uh ... listen , do you ? [ Giggling ] Yeah . Ooh ! Ha ha ha . Do you ? Yeah . Well , that 's good . 'Cause I 'll talk your brains out ! Talk to me , Don ! Talk to me ! The man 's an idiot . He really is . Why are you even seeing him ? Well , it 's hard to meet nice guys . Eh ... tell me about it . So , Lucy , will you drop the suit and take your job back at the cafeteria ? After the trauma I suffered there ? I could never work in the cafeteria again . Why ? I 'm frightened . Ok , what 'll it take ? Nina , what are you doing ? I 'm working for you again , and if you think you weren 't satisfied with my work before , just wait till you see all the typos and lost messages you 've got comin ' your way ! Ohh ! You ! Can I help you ? I have to see Mary . Not so fast , doc . She 's a very busy woman . Sit down and wait your turn ! Mary ! Lucy , tell whoever it is I 'm busy . Mary , it 's me ! Tell him I know who it is . You 'll have to wait . Can you get me some water ? No . How about some cabbage soup and mashed potatoes ? No ! and coca-cola classic power is a funny thing . Yeah . So are rubber pencils . Mary has power . I have Mary . Mathematically , I should have power . But , as it turns out , all I have is the power to make her angry at me ... which is still a pretty good power . You know , sometimes it 's nice to give up power . Really ? Yeah . I don 't always have to be the take-charge lieutenant . I mean , sometimes I can let somebody else have control . Letting yourself be vulnerable , it opens you up to a whole new world of experience . Tell us ... more . No . It was worth a shot . I really thought you had her that time .

 Captain ! Our prisoners ! - It 's going down ! - Let us all out of this rat hole ! We 'II die in here ! I 'm telling you , man . You got it . Thanks , Frank . - Thank you . - More ice , Frank . Frank ? - What 's going on ? - This is too much ice . What the hell is going on here ? Earthquake , guys . What is going on ? caroline . Extreme hypothermia . BP is 1 20l 40 . pulse is 25 with drip . Okay . Let 's move it . On the count of three . One , two , three . - AII right , we 're losing him , guys . - Can I get the E3 ? - Let 's get going . - What 's his name ? No ID . John Doe . Where was he , some kind of costume party ? Bar . walked in , passed out . Let 's get some of these blood gases going . What the hell is going on ? This is frozen solid . - It wasn 't frozen a minute ago , doctor . - AII the saline 's frozen . What the hell is going on ? What was that ? I 've sent the Jesuit to the seminary in Rome . They want me to teach there . I couId study . You could study here . We have one of the biggest archives in the world . That 's not what this is about . It may not be what you want to hear , Derek . But in my heart , I feel like my soul 's been chipped away piece by piece . The Legacy 's battle against evil has its price , philip . It always has . Yes . And you can 't afford to have a weak link . I know you have a Iot to work through . But I 'm unwilling to accept this . Captain . Captain . Captain . He came to for a while last night and started raving incoherentIy . He kept repeating a woman 's name . caroline , I think it was . - His vital signs this morning ? - stable . Dr. Cannon Dr. Corrigan 's been brought in to do a psychiatric evaluation on John Doe . I explained to her about the trauma room last night . - Have you identified the toxiderm ? - Tox screen was negative . But let me tell you something , doctor . Something 's going on with this guy . - Here . Do you have a second ? - Sure . We found these in his pockets . Wordsworth , first edition . How could this book be in such remarkable condition ? And this . A compass . I 'd Iike to meet your John Doe . Hi . I 'm Dr. Corrigan . Do you know where you are ? Security ! Room 1 0 7 , now ! He ran across the street . Give us the key ! Get us all out of this rat hole ! There he is ! I told you something was going on with this guy . initials , " S.H. " It appears that something is disturbing this man . We can help . tell us what he was doing when they found him . I don 't think the hospital would mind my sharing my findings with you . What 's on your mind , rachel ? If there 's something going on with this man that I don 't know that 's beyond my understanding I wanna find out . I wanna run with this one , Derek . alex , could you join us for a moment , please ? His coat . Can we get anything from it ? We should be able to determine when and where it was made , yes . The ambulance picked him up somewhere around here . This is the spot . Excuse me . - We don 't open till 6 . Sorry . - well , we 're not here to drink . What can you tell us about what happened here the other night ? I don 't know what you mean . The disturbance . The guy they took out of here . More damn reporters . We 're not reporters . We just want to ask a few questions . Look , it was a small problem with the air conditioner and a minor earthquake . That 's all . No big deal , okay ? He 's nearby . I need to know about that ship . The name begins with " gold . " It 's a schooner . - Find a museum . - alex , look . - please . I implore you . - That 's him . - Wait ! - implore this . - You must help me . - Man , come on . Look , buddy . How many times do I have to tell you I don 't know anything about a schooner ? We 've been looking for you . Oh , great . You found him . He 's all yours . I 'm rachel Corrigan . - I 've seen you before . - At the hospital . I came to your room . I 'm not going back to that place . Here . Try this . My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky So was it when my lihe began So is it now I am a man I 've heard those words before . You had this book with you when they brought you to the hospital . This book . This compass . It must be really terrifying not to be able to remember . But we know that inside you somewhere you have all the answers . We 're gonna help you find them . At the hospital , they called me John Doe . It 's a pleasure to meet you , John . So I heard that philip got a letter from his old seminary . Is he thinking of bolting again ? well , philip is trying to decide how to serve his calling and studying with the Jesuits may be his best option . I can 't believe that he thinks he can waltz in and out of here whenever he feels the need to do so . well , aren 't you being a little tough on him ? Look , you make a commitment to something , you stick with it . What about your commitment to the SEALs ? It seems you turned your back on them . That wasn 't the way it was at all , Derek . I worked my ass off . I paid my dues . I just wasn 't cut out to be a lifer . So it 's okay for you to quit something but not okay for philip to have doubts about The Legacy ? I didn 't say that . And it is completely different , and you know it . What makes being a member of The Legacy so sacred ? - What , is this some kind of a test ? - well , I know why I am committed . I saw my father killed by something unholy and his fight instantly became my cause , my burden . What about you ? You wanna follow in your father 's footsteps ? Look , you know that I am not here because of any false attachment to this place that my father had . - Why are you so afraid to open up ? - Look , I 'm here , all right ? I 'd walk through fire for any of you , and , frankly , I think that 's enough . AII I wanna know is why . - I believe in what we 're doing . - Why ? - Because it 's right . - Why ? Because we 're fighting evil , making the world a better place . Because I haven 't got anything else to do ! What do you want from me , Derek ? I think you 're mad at philip because if he leaves he 'II break up our team a team that has become your family . Yeah , yeah . Maybe you 're right , you know . Maybe this is all due to the fact that , for the first time in my Iife , I feel like I 'm part of something special . Maybe I 've finally found my niche in life and I don 't want anyone to rock the boat . And maybe , yes , maybe that is the right answer , and you 'II get off my case ! There is no right or wrong answer . Great . Then maybe I can get back to work . The nurses found sand in your shoes . Does being here bring anything back to you ? only that a storm is brewing . I can almost feel it . Otherwise , nothing . well it may take time , John . Have you been here before ? I don 't know . If I was here , I don 't know when or why . If it is amnesia we 're dealing with , it can be really disorienting . I don 't understand what 's happening to me . That 's what we 're gonna find out . There are dozens of names of ships that start with the word " gold . " Gold Sea , Gold Runner , even Gold Witch . No missing persons report matches his description or the initials " S.H. " This book he 's been carrying , it 's definitely a first edition . - But if this book were properly stored- - - would it look the way it does now ? Maybe . But how many books were hermetically sealed in the 1 8 70s ? I don 't think they were big on that then . How soon before we get the results of the carbon-dating of the clothing ? It should be some time tomorrow . And there 's no question about it the P-wave potentials are showing up everywhere this guy goes . well , stay with him until we find out exactly what 's going on . Does this meet with your approval ? Yes . Much better fit . please offer my apology to the gentleman I stole them from . I 'm sure he 'II understand . John I know some ways to trigger your memory . It 's really simple . I think it can be key to unlocking what 's hidden in your subconscious . What do you think ? You wanna try ? Now I want you to watch your breath as it moves in and out . Like waves on the shore . In and out . It 's very safe , John . Let it go . And just listen to the sound of my voice , John . What do you see ? Mist . Nothing but mist . Let the fog lift , John . I see a bird . And two hands holding a telescope . That ship again . A sailing ship . It 's a storm . The ship 's in trouble . The crew 's very hrightened . - Angry . - Oh , my God . Give us the key ! The angry shouts are directed toward me . Let us out of here or I 'II slit your throat ! Captain , shall I unshackIe the prisoners ? Let us out of here , if you know what 's good for you ! The key ! Give us the key ! - Captain ? - No . They stay where they are . I don 't think they can survive . They 'II survive . We 'II all survive ! You 're all right . You 're all right , John . The ship . Something happened to the ship . But what ? I need to know . You 're gonna find out . It 's gonna come back to you . It 's just gonna take some time . Oh , rachel . Come in . - would you Iike a drink ? - Thank you . Any clues ? Under hypnosis , he described his ship . But the description of that ship was 1 9th-century . could it be that he 's being plagued by some kind of past-Iife regression ? medical science does not recognize past-Iife regressions . Paranoid delusional systems , schizophrenia post-traumatic stress disorders . These are all possibilities . But his connection to that ship is so strong . I 'm not sure . Aye , captain . We 've been watching you . Watching you . Aye , captain . We 've been watching you . - What do you want ? - You know what we want , Hartford . And we mean to get it . - Watching . - Watching . Watching you . Watching . The P-wave potentials are getting stronger . Yeah , there 's no question about that . Now we have a name , Hartford . There 's several hits in the bay area connected with the name Hartford . We 've got a Iot to check . hopefully , something will trigger his memory . I know this house . My husband and I restored the house when we bought it about 1 5 years ago . well , it 's beautiful . - Is your husband a seafaring man ? - only in his dreams . Some of the furniture and many of the things came with the house . Something was here . I was dusting and I knocked over this lovely old telescope . When did the telescope break ? Two nights ago . - Right before bedtime . - That 's the same time John appeared . Do you mind if we borrow this ? Of course not . Thank you . - What 's upstairs ? - More bedrooms and the attic . There are more family heirlooms up there . would you Iike to have a look ? That would be great . Thanks . I can 't make the stairs today . Turn left . There 's an old trunk under a blanket . Take a look inside . How can this feel so familiar and still not give me the answer to who I am ? John ? Do you recognize her ? I can 't say I do . rachel ? Oh , my God . That 's me , isn 't it ? caroline . My wife . My children . Dead . I 've outlived them all . In 1 8 7 4 , Sam Hartford 's ship , The Golden Princess was leaving San Francisco when it hit a storm and went down . A handful of crewmen survived , but our boy wasn 't one of them . His wife never remarried . She died in 1 901 . Their two children are long dead . He has no living relatives . So if John Hartford were alive now , he 'd be 1 60 years old ? well , that 's consistent with the carbon dating from his clothing . That means he 's gotta be some kind of spectral entity . This goes against everything I have ever learned in the scientific world . He 's solid . He 's got shape and substance . I can feel him . This is not a possession . I mean , we 've dealt with paranormal constructs before but they 're not Iike this . They 're unstable , disassociated . This is different . He has mass . He seems perfectly real . His spiritual force is so strong , it can manifest itself on a molecular level creating a fully rendered human being . So the money question is , why is he back ? well , something triggered it . We need to find out what . The P-wave potentials continue to increase . At the Iast reading , our location was dead center . This could even be more critical . I thank you all for helping me to find out who I am . What I am . But I have so many questions and I don 't want to be a burden . I need to know why I 'm here . We all need to know why you 're here , John . And you 're not a burden . Let us help you . Okay ? John , rachel ... rachel ? It 's a hologram . Nada . I mean , he 's as normal as apple pie . Body temperature 's a little below average . That 's it . - Anybody got a plan B ? - Yeah . There 's something I 'd Iike to try . In your hand is a telescope . Your telescope . You 've used it many times to help you chart your course . Use this instrument of sight now , John to help bring your past into focus . caroline is in my arms . I can feel her touch . smell the scent of her hair . There 's a sadness about her . Sam ? I don 't want you to go . I Iove you . Here . As long as you have this , you 'II be able to see me . Nothing on heaven or earth will stop me from returning . We 'II dance a waltz on this very spot . I promise . - Daddy . Daddy . - Daddy . Daddy . Now , you look after your mother . - You 're the man of the house now . - Yes , Father . samuel ! Samuel . caroline . My beloved . She didn 't want me to go . I gave her the telescope and promised I 'd return . And this all started when the telescope broke and a promise was broken . I returned to fulfill my pledge . Do I have to go back ? That 's up to you , John . How do we deal with a ghost that has red blood cells ? Has anything like this ever occurred before ? several times , actually . John milton , who was a member of The Legacy recorded this entry 1 64 7 . It tells of a woman who was burned as a witch in salem and her newborn baby , considered to be a child of Satan was left in the woods to die . She returned in the flesh to care for her infant daughter . So her commitment to care for her baby was a pledge based in love , just like John 's . This is useless ! What good is this ? The poets , the thinkers . This is useless ! absolutely useless ! AII of these volumes , with their theories , concepts . - No , wait . - They don 't mean a thing ! What good are they ? ! Nothing but meaningless , empty words . Kierkegaard , Sartre , Thomas Aquinas . So many have dreamed of living forever . To be resurrected in a world where everyone you know and love is dead I must tell you , it only seems like a curse . I wish you could help me , but you can 't . The ache I feel inside is more than I can bear . John . That ache the emptiness that you 're talking about I feel it every day . My husband died a year ago . I 'm sorry . I 've upset you . PIease- - It 's okay . It helps to talk about it . I appreciate your company . But I must be going by morning . Captain . Captain . Captain ! Hard to starboard ! Hard to starboard ! Captain ! Wait , captain ! - It 's no use . Save yourself ! - The key ! - To unshackIe the prisoners . - There 's no time . - The key , man ! - It 's too late ! Hurry ! Get us out of here ! You 'II get us all killed . - Damn you ! - Hurry ! Get us out of here . Hurry , man . We 're drowning . Let go , you fool . Give me the key . You 'II kill us all . Let go ! I 'II see you in hell , captain . Captain . Captain ! Captain ! - Captain ! Captain ! - Captain ! Captain ! Captain ! You killed us , Harthord . Our blood is on your hands . - Captain ! - It won 't work anymore , captain . You made this possible ! You stayed too long in this place . John ? - What is it ? - The convicts on the ship they were here . They accused me of causing their deaths . And now I 'm responsible for bringing them back . When SamueI Hartford returned , his arrival must have opened a rift . Making it possible for the ghosts to get through ? You mean the convicts . - The men who died aboard the ship . - exactly . Hartford 's spirit and drive to stay in our world is unlike anything I 've ever known . Derek , the convicts hold him responsible for the ship going down . - This guy 's in a no-win situation . - It 's going to get worse . If Hartford returned to his ship , would that end this ? probably . But only if he does it of his own free will . Forcing a decision is not going to work . But he 's returned for a single purpose , to fulfill his pledge . So , what we need to do is help him complete his journey . - I think I know how we can do that . - We may have run out of time . AII I can do is try . caroline would love it when I brought fancy dresses back from my voyages . I saw this one in the attic . It was her favorite . She 's so beautiful . What is it , John ? I cannot stay here . You came here to fulfill a pledge . Didn 't you ? I promised caroline I would waltz with her on the veranda . Maybe you still can . What if I were to stand in for caroline ? You think she 'd mind ? Your husband liked to dance ? Very much . I 'II miss you , rachel Corrigan . I 'm gonna miss you too . Samuel Harthord ! - I must go . - No . please . John , Iet the music finish . For me . My God , you 're freezing . - Samuel Harthord ! - Samuel Harthord ! I must go up there . So how much time does John have before push comes to shove ? It 's impossible to pinpoint , but if the rift becomes unstable , it 's gonna get ugly . We should be there with them . What in God 's name do you want from me ? ! samuel Hartford , you killed us all ! It was the storm , not me . You breathe the good air , yet we rot forever on that ship . - We want what you have . Life ! - That cannot be . Then blood will flow like a crimson tide . She 's a very beautiful woman , captain . You stay away from her ! - It 's happening . - Yes . You can 't run away from us , captain . Quick . To the beach . I came from the sea . That 's where I must return . You 've added to the memories that fill my spirit . It 's a gift that I will treasure for eternity . I have nothing but the same memories to give to you . Except one thing . Our souls have sight Oh the immortal sea Which brought us hither Can in a moment travel thither And see the children Sport upon the shore And hear the mighty waters rolling Evermore farewell , rachel Corrigan . Goodbye , samuel Hartford . You killed us once . We 'II not let you do it again , Hartford . - Stop it , Hartford ! - Don 't be a fool , man . - No ! - Don 't do it . - Don 't do it , Hartford ! - Don 't do it , man . Don 't do it , man ! Don 't do this to us . We want to live , man . We want to live . Don 't do this . No ! You did the only thing you could , rachel . Then why does it hurt so much ? Because you took away Sam Hartford 's pain and he 's been carrying it for a Iong , long time .

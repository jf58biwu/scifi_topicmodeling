 ( Kyra ) You can 't pull this now . And you can 't take the boxes out of the country until I look inside . But if you open the containers , the oxygen is gonna damage the bones . That is not my problem . Look , I did not spend five months in this hellhole digging up reptilian bones , just so that you could ruin them . [ Airplane roaring ] The law is the law . Okay . Then let 's change the law . We 'll call it the " thank you " law . When someone like you looks the other way and a nice person like me says " thank you " with money . What do you think ? I think you should leave before I change my mind . [ Hissing sound ] [ Exclaiming ] Don 't worry . The law applies to you , too . Yes , lady , it 's cute , but I don 't need a dead cockroach holding a little tennis racket . Thank you . [ Woman chattering over speaker ] I 've had enough Third World charm to last another hundred slides . So , when do we board ? We don 't . We got bumped . Wait a minute , we had confirmed reservations . Yeah , so did the other 60 people who bought tickets for a 20-seat plane . [ Sighs ] This vacation has sucked . We should 've stayed in San Francisco with Wade and Maggie . Maybe you should have . I needed the break . So when is the next flight ? Well , a week from Wednesday . Oh , just a week after we slide . Yes , Rembrandt , I realize the problem . Believe it or not , I haven 't found an answer yet . Well , what are you barking ' at me for ? Just that this vacation isn 't even over yet , and already I 'm dealing with some crisis . Excuse me , Se√±or , do you know of any charter flights that are leaving today ? Yeah , just one . It 's leaving now . Excuse me . Yeah ? We need to get up to San Francisco . Could we catch a ride ? I 'm sorry , but I can 't help you . Uh , we 'd be willing to pay you whatever you felt was a fair price . Look , my employer chartered this plane and I don 't think he 'd be too happy if I started pickin ' up hitchhikers , no matter how handsome they are . [ Shouting in Spanish ] [ Guns firing ] Wait , I need the other box . No , come back ! Grab the other end , Remmy ! What are you doing ? Earning our ride ! Come on ! [ Gun fire continues ] ( Rembrandt ) Come on , grab my hand . I 'm trying . [ Grunting ] Hurry up . Let 's go ! [ Both grunting ] ( Quinn ) They 're coming , Remmy ! [ Tires screeching ] [ Rembrandt grunting ] ( Quinn ) Come on , close the door ! Well , that was a warm send-off . Thanks . You 're welcome . [ Hissing sound ] I think . ( Quinn ) What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year , and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? ( voice ) Sliders . ( Kyra ) This one is secure . The other one is safe up front by the pilot . So , what exactly do you do ? [ Hissing continues ] I work freelance . Right now , it 's for a biotech firm called Selvatech . Never heard of it . But we travel a lot . We never get a chance to read the business section . So what do they want with a bunch of snakes ? Not a bunch . Just two . A mated pair of triadders . They 're kind of like pythons , only more rare . If I had my way , there won 't be any rare snakes . They 'd all be extinct . Actually , these snakes are very valuable . Researchers think their venom might be useful in fighting Parkinson 's disease . How many people does it take to catch these snakes ? I caught them myself . What , do you think a woman is too fragile for this kind of work ? ( Quinn ) No , not at all . I 'm just impressed . [ Chuckles ] So , what do you guys do ? Uh , we , uh ... Remmy , what do we do ? ( Rembrandt ) We get hungry . ( Kyra ) Oh , um , there 's some crackers and cheese in that box over there . Your boss won 't mind a couple of hitchhikers eating his food ? Maybe I just won 't tell him . [ Hisses ] [ Pilot screaming ] [ Groaning ] [ Grunting ] What the hell is goin ' on ? We 're going down ! [ Gasping ] We 've got a snake loose up here ! [ Exclaims ] [ Groans ] I can 't pull up ! It 's gonna crash ! ( Wade ) We 've got problems . ( Maggie ) Aren 't we technically still on vacation ? Quinn and Rembrandt got bumped from their flight . I called the airport in Zamara . They guy said they got on some kind of a charter flight . So what 's the problem ? There are two . First , there was some kind of shootout before they got on . Was anyone hurt ? The guy didn 't know . Second problem , the charter flight is not coming here it 's going to some place called Delgado . We 'll catch a flight and meet them there . Problem solved . Yeah , except you can 't get there from here . Delgado is where L.A. Would be , except on this world , it 's drug country . [ Exclaims ] So we 'll take a clue from the guys . We 'll ... we 'll see if there is a charter , and we 'll hire it . Excuse me . The guy at the front office said you run a charter service . Well , hello there . Yeah , the guy at the front office was right . Where do you two pretty little ladies want to go ? An airstrip called Delgado . Heard of it ? Oh , yeah , and the answer is no . Look , it 's really important that we get there . Hey , look , I 'm doin ' you ladies a favor . That 's dangerous country out there . I would hate to see you two pretty little ladies get your throats slit . Look , if you don 't want to take us there just rent us " pretty little ladies " the plane . And what are you gonna do , drive it to Delgado ? [ Both giggling ] Yeah , I guess we could do that . Or I could fly it . Where did a babe like you learn how to fly ? Military . Where I used to strafe guys like you . [ Chuckles ] Funny and sexy . You know , you two ladies just might change my mind yet . [ Airplanes roaring ] $ 300 for the airplane . Cash . $ 300 . That 's all we 've got . Keys ? Did I mention to you that fuel was extra ? All right , look , enough of the games . We paid , now give us the keys . Look , that 's just the way it is . The fuel costs extra . But I am a reasonable man . If you don 't have the cash I 'm sure we can find some other way for you to pay . [ Chuckles ] Yes . [ Exclaims ] I 'm sure we could . [ Groans ] Unfortunately , I don 't think you 'll be able to collect for quite some time . [ Continues groaning ] Thanks for flying with us . [ Hissing ] [ Crickets chirping ] [ Radio waves squeaking ] [ Grunts ] [ Sighs ] Anything ? We 're about to find out . Mayday , mayday . Can anyone read me ? ( Quinn ) Mayday , plane down . Can anyone read me ? ( woman ) Go ahead , mayday . Delgado Field reads you . My name is Mallory . We 've crashed somewhere northwest of Zamara . Our pilot is dead , but there are three survivors [ electric buzz ] And we need help ... Damn it . Damn it ! Just once , I would love for something to go right . [ Kyra moans ] Kyra . Hey , hey , hey , hey , relax . The snakes . [ Sighs ] You still have one . The other got away . We got to find it . Like hell we do . That thing is a killer . What are you talking about ? Somehow it got out and wrapped itself around the pilot 's neck . That 's why we crashed . It 's too important to lose . Let me tell you something , girl . We have to get back to San Francisco day after tomorrow . We 're getting ourselves out of here now , and without snakes . Quinn , please . I spent five months finding them . They 're vital to the research . [ Fire wood crackling ] It 's your call . Yeah , it 's always my call . Fine . We take the snake in the container . [ Exclaims ] ( Quinn ) Where 's the nearest town ? [ Exclaims ] There 's a speck on the map about 10 miles west . A place called Santa Marta . Better hope that speck has a phone . Are you good to travel ? Yeah . All right , let 's do it . [ Airplane roaring ] [ Exclaims ] Hello ? Anybody here ? ( Carlos ) Yeah . Hey , Hi , the owner 's out back . I saw you land . This is kind of an out-of-the-way spot for tourists . We 're looking for friends of ours . They 're on a charter flight that 's supposed to land here . From Zamara ? You know the flight ? Yeah , yeah , a friend of mine is on it , too . Do you know when it 's supposed to land ? Now , listen , ladies . I got some bad news for you . That plane went down somewhere east of here . Yeah , the owner got a distress call on the radio . Somebody named Mallory . That 's our friend . Really ? He said the pilot died , but there are two other survivors . So , I guess that means your other friend , and mine . We 'll fuel up here , then we 'll fly over and we 'll see ... Oh , no , no , no . No , you 're not flyin anywhere . The cartels shoot down any unfamiliar aircraft . So what do you suggest ? Well , I suggest you ride with me . I just rented a truck full of supplies . [ Motor engine sputtering ] Come on , look , I know this country , and it 's ... it 's no place to be driving around alone in . And I could use , use the extra eyes . Oh , Carlos , what are you doing here ? Well , I guess the same thing you are . Lookin ' for Kyra ? Uh , ladies , would you mind , uh , going and checkin if the truck is ready ? Please ? What do you think ? Rebel boyfriend meets rich sugar daddy ? I hope not . I think Carlos is really attractive . Yeah , well , we 're sliding tomorrow . A girl can dream , can 't she ? So , you and Kyra were thinkin ' of cutting me out of the deal ? Don 't talk crazy , Carlos . Why else would you be out here in the middle of no where ? Carlos , listen . You 've always been a bit of a hothead , okay ? Don 't let your temper get in the way here . We still have a deal . Do we ? You know , I could have fenced those snakes in a dozen places . But I thought we were friends . But we are friends . Look , amigo , I 'll make it up to you . I will kick in an extra $ 10,000 , okay ? My pride is worth more than the money . Carlos , no ! No ! [ Screams ] I need to get some water . Now , there 's plenty in the back of the truck . Let 's go . [ Insects chirping ] How much further ? If that map was right , it shouldn 't be more than a couple of miles . [ Birds chirping ] [ Frogs croaking ] Somethin ' wrong ? Those are tobacco plants . ( Rembrandt ) Yeah , so what ? " So what " ? The tobacco cartels have goon squads patrolling these places . Last month , a dozen TEA men were killed in a raid on one of them . How do you like that ? Tobacco is illegal on this world . Yeah , if we get out of here , I 'll write their government a congratulatory letter . Let 's go , huh ? [ Hisses ] [ Flare whistling ] Damn ! Guess they don 't like unexpected company dropping in . We got to get out of here quick . And without this thing . No , I 'm not leaving it ! It 's extremely rare . I may never find another one . We 're not taking it . ( Kyra ) Quinn , please . Once again , it 's up to me . Fine , we take the snake . Go , go , move ! [ Sighing ] [ Snake hissing ] What was that ? The snake . I thought snakes just hissed . She 's upset . She 's not the only one . [ Speaking Spanish ] We 're not TEA ! I don 't think they care , in either language . All right , we are sitting ducks here . We better split up . [ Gun firing continues ] [ Both grunting ] Get off of me ! [ Both grunting ] Are you okay ? Yes . Rembrandt ! ( Rembrandt ) Over here . [ Hissing ] [ Grunting ] [ Man gasping ] That 's my snake . ( Rembrandt ) What 's it doing here ? I don 't know . No ! It 's an endangered species . Yeah , so are we , lady . That thing just killed two men . Lucky for you , he already killed that one . Yeah , but just don 't ask us to catch it . No , it 's ... it 's too aggressive . It wouldn 't be safe . Oh , I 'm disappointed . Let 's go huh ? ( Maggie ) Damn , the truck is overheating and so am I. [ Bird ? ] Got any aspirin ? Uh , yeah , yeah , bring me my pack . [ Exclaims ] [ Moans ] Hey , hey , I didn 't say to open it . Come on . Jeez . Thanks . [ Moans ] Want some ? It feels great . The pleasure of watching you is all the refreshment I need . [ Birds squawking ] What are you doing ? Saving your friend 's life . ( Carlos ) You okay ? Thanks . Yeah . Let 's get movin ' . It 's not too safe to stay in one place too long . We better watch this guy . I don 't trust him . Wade , he just saved my life . Maybe , but my gut says there 's something goin ' on with him . Maybe he 's just not your type . Do you ever notice how you always insist on being right ? I don 't insist . I just am . Yeah , well , just in case you 're wrong , you might want to listen to someone else 's opinion once in a while . I listen to your opinion . I listen to it all the time . I just don 't think you know what you 're talking about . ( Rembrandt ) You know , I 've been thinking , Q-Ball . Maybe that male snake is following its mate . ( Kyra ) No , that 's impossible . ( Quinn ) Yeah , you 'd be surprised how many impossible things we 've seen since leaving home . So , who 's waiting for you in San Francisco ? You have a significant other ? No . You know , when we get out of this mess I 've got a great little place by the beach I 'd like you to see . Sounds great . Not the friendliest of neighborhoods , is it ? When you live in the middle of tobacco country , [ snake hissing ] You learn not to trust anyone . Whoa , whoa , whoa , you okay ? Yeah . That screamin' is just giving me the creeps . What do you have inside ? It 's just a snake . Not just a snake . That was the cry of a triadder . [ Speaking Spanish ] Release it before it brings the Angel of Death . This some religious superstition ? None I 've ever heard of . Must be local folklore . We 're not lookin ' for trouble . We just need to call for help . To help the Devil is to condemn yourself . [ Shouts in Spanish ] [ Shouting in Spanish ] It 's a safe bet they 're not gonna show us to a phone . Now what ? How far is the next town ? How far ? Well , it 's a start . Let 's go . [ Shouting in Spanish ] [ Insects chirping ] [ Birds chirping ] So , what kind of business are you in ? Lmport-export . What do you import and export ? Well , plants , animals . Mostly exotic creatures . Yeah , I find I am drawn to exotic creatures . Carlos , you are so obvious . [ Exclaims ] It 's just a good thing you 're so cute . Oh , no , no , no . Latin men are not cute , okay ? We are passionate , and intense . And wonderful lovers . We should get some sleep . It 's gonna be dawn in a few hours . We can pick up their trail again . Yep , she 's right . I 'll go sleep in the truck . Good night . Night . [ Sighs ] Look , I 'm sorry to rain on your parade , but considering the circumstances I just think we should keep our mind on our mission . Don 't lecture me , Wade . My attention is on the mission . But I 'm not a nun , and I don 't need to be mothered . This isn 't mothering , it 's a warning . Personally , I don 't care if you sleep with Jack the Ripper . But this isn 't a world I want to be stranded on and I don 't want anything screwing up us finding the guys . Okay ? Okay , but just because I enjoy a man 's company doesn 't mean I plan on marrying him . You know , it would do you some good to have a little fling on one of these worlds . What 's that supposed to mean ? I mean you seem a little edgy . The only thing that makes me edgy is you . [ Screams ] [ Grunts ] [ All grunting ] [ Groaning ] [ Pleading in Spanish ] [ Exclaims ] I 'm real sorry , too , pal . I 'm real sorry . Better luck next time . You know , I really hated to have to kill him , but he did put up one hell of a fight . [ Birds chirping ] Hey , how come everything just got quiet ? I don 't know . [ Snake hissing ] [ ? ] That 's the cry of the male . I don 't believe this . It 's followed us all this way ? Whoa , whoa , whoa , hold on one second . Hey , what 's going on inside this box ? Man , this is too weird . What are all these snakes doing here ? ( Rembrandt ) Maybe we should leave it . Okay , let 's just put down the female . Maybe they 'll back off . That 's ridiculous . They 're snakes . They don 't have the ability to communicate with each other . [ Screams ] Get it off ! [ Grunting ] All right , come on . There 's a house just up ahead . I 've just about had it with little Miss Snake Witch , man ! [ Snakes hissing ] ( Kyra ) It could belong to some tobacco lord . Doesn 't look like anybody is home . [ Snakes hissing ] ( Quinn ) These snakes are everywhere . ( Rembrandt ) I 'm telling you , they 're following us . [ Rattlesnake rattling ] ( Kyra ) My God . ( Rembrandt ) Let 's get inside . Hurry ! This has turned into the vacation from hell . From the looks of these fuses , nobody 's been here for quite a while . Okay , try that , Q-Ball . Nothing . All right , hold on a second . All right , one more time . That 's it ! [ Sparks flickering ] All right . ( Rembrandt ) I got snakes , man ! Are you okay ? Yeah . What happened ? I 'll tell you what happened . The lights went out , you got snakes comin ' out of the fuse box . It 's as if they wanted the lights to stay off . It 's like they 've some kind of intelligence . Yeah , and a plan of attack . Look , It 's not unusual for snakes to live in warm places like this wall . I know this snake of hers is supposed to cure cancer or whatever . I just don 't think it 's worth our dying ' over . Well , I 'm not letting it go . Lady , where I come from , snakes crawling out of the freaking wall are considered immediate danger . That snake holds the key to saving millions of lives . Look , I think if we all put our heads together , we can find a way to get out of this . Is she crazy , or am I ? Well , considering what 's at stake here I think we should at least spend some time trying to figure out a way to get out of here with the snake . You know , I 'm getting the distinct feelin it 's not your head that 's doing your thinkin ' right now . I 'm doing the best I can , Remmy ! Let him go . It 's okay . We should be able to get supplies at this bodega . I 'll wait in the truck . What are you doing here ? We 're just , um , we 're traveling . We 're looking for two people . Two guys , m-maybe traveling with a woman . They travel with the Devil . And so do you . You mean Carlos ? Take him away with you . What do you know about him ? We don 't want him here . Okay . Look , is ... is there a phone around here I can use ? Behind the bodega . [ Speaking Spanish ] After all I 've done for you ? How could you be so ungrateful ? Thanks . Man , when I 'm wrong about a guy , I 'm really wrong . They 're not gonna let us leave him here . They think he 's the Devil . [ Clamoring in Spanish ] I can 't believe I was so off on this guy . You think sliding affects your judgment of men ? I think it affected yours . Let 's tie him up and get him in the truck . No , let 's leave him here . He 'll get what he deserves . They 'll kill him . So ? So that 's not my style . All right . ( Quinn ) Kyra , Maybe if we could find some poles and rope in the house we could lure the male out by provoking the female . Then ... [ Kyra screams ] [ Quinn grunts ] You still think they don 't have intelligence ? They 've gotten in the water supply . Quinn , the pipes have broken under the house and they crawled up inside , okay . Don 't let your friend 's paranoia get to you , okay ? We 've got to stick together through this . [ Sighing ] [ Whispers ] Snakes . I hate snakes . ( Quinn ) Then he died in our arms . ( Kyra ) I 'm sorry . Yeah , me , too . I felt like I could always turn to him for help . Now , with the Professor gone , it 's all on me , and I am flying ' blind . ( Rembrandt ) They 're not leaving , Q-Ball . We 're running out of time and ammo . We 've got to release this snake so the rest of them will leave . No ! Look , we have tried it your way . Quinn , please . Help me out of this , and I swear I will make it up to you . You can 't make it up to us . We are leaving this world . And we have two friends that we have to take with us . All right , all right , Remmy . Why don 't we do this ? We slide out of here with Kyra and the snake then come back and get Maggie and Wade . The timer has that ability now . I can 't believe you just said that . You know we can 't control how long we 'll be gone or how long we 'll be here once we get back . If we do slide , it 's a damn good possibility we may not find Wade and Maggie . Look , we 're going now . No ! Are you crazy ? Give that to me . Stop it . What are you , nuts ? Something is seriously wrong with you , boy . Okay , fine , fine . You 're so hot to stay with her , you go ahead . But leave me the timer . You can 't go . They 'll kill you . I don 't think so . I don 't have what they want . All right , here 's what we do . We wait a few more hours . The temperature will drop . The snakes will become lethargic . Then we can sneak right past . We wouldn 't have to waste five hours , which we don 't have if we just released that damn thing . Look , let him go . You can stay with me . The money I 'll get from this snake will make me set for life . And we can spend the rest of our life on the beach . And you wouldn 't have to slide anymore . No more responsibilities or worries . Please , stay with me . She 's selling you a bill of goods , Q-Ball . Maybe I 'm in the mood to buy . Maybe I 'm tired of all this responsibility . This is gonna sound selfish , but I 'm sick and tired of worrying about everybody all the time . Remember what it was like to be my age ? ( Quinn ) The freedom ? The total lack of responsibility ? I 'm very afraid I 'm never gonna see that . I understand where you 're coming from . Just don 't expect my blessing . Fine . I 'm not making any more decisions . You want to leave , go . ( Maggie ) That 's incredible . ( Wade ) There 's hundreds of them . [ Sighs ] [ Grunts ] [ Both sighing ] [ Snakes hissing ] ( Wade ) Maggie , that 's Quinn 's shirt . They could be inside . Let 's go . [ Exclaims ] They 're everywhere , Wade . Snakes hate fire . Let 's get some flares to keep ' em back . [ Both grunting ] You think it 'll work ? [ Exclaims ] We 'll make it work . Ladies first . [ Monkey chattering ] [ Snakes hissing ] [ Grunts ] [ Sighing ] ( Carlos ) Come on , come on . [ Gasping ] [ Adder hissing ] Drop it now ! Or I 'll blow your brains out . How did you guys find us ? ( Carlos ) Shut up . Hey , man , nobody talks till I say . All right ? Hi , honey . I 'm home . Carlos , thank God . [ Groans ] Hey . How soon do you want to die ? I 'm sorry , baby . Did that hurt ? Not as much as when I realized you double-crossed me . No , that 's not true . What do you know about the truth ? First , she tells me she needs $ 10,000 to find these things for medical research . Then I find out she 's gonna sell them on the black market as an aphrodisiac and leave me out in the cold . I would never do that . Oh , no ? Explain that . I don 't understand . Well , look for the surprise inside . [ Gasps ] There 's no reason for Don to come to Delgado unless you two were cutting me out of the deal . That 's what I do to hands that steal from my pocket . Hands like yours . Like all of yours . Look , we don 't know anything about what 's goin ' on . Don 't lie to me . ( Rembrandt ) He 's not lying . All we did was hitch a ride on a plane , that 's all . ( Maggie ) It 's true , Carlos . Whatever is going on with you and her , it doesn 't involve my friends . Maybe they weren 't before but maybe they started thinkin about how much they 'd make selling the snakes themselves . Huh ? Nothing like a little fast money to turn a good man around . Some men . Not all . You 're wasting my time . ( Quinn ) Kyra , tell him the truth . We were just trying to help . I 'm sorry , Carlos . I made a mistake . I should have never listened to them . It was their idea to double-cross you . Kyra . I 'll make it up to you , I promise . You know I love you . I know you 're a liar but I can deal with that . As for you , my friends , maybe you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time . But that 's your bad luck . [ Carlos grunts ] [ Grunts ] [ Groans ] ( Quinn ) Maggie , Wade , hide in the kitchen . Remmy , get the keys . We got to free the female . There are snakes all over the place . Oh , man . [ Screaming ] [ Carlos screaming ] Hey , Q-Ball . [ Grunting ] No , Quinn , no ! You are not going to stop me . [ Gasping ] ( Quinn ) Get out . Get out ! [ Groaning ] No , no , no , don 't . It 's too late . They 're leavin ' , man . Look at this . ( Rembrandt ) All of them . ( Maggie ) Thanks , Wade . For what ? For not rubbing it in . I guess I 'm just not used to taking advice from people . Well , take some now . We 're all working for the same goal . If one of us has an opinion , at least listen to it . It might save your life one day . Oh , like I said , thanks for not rubbing ' it in . Quinn , I know this probably sounds hollow . But I am sorry . Very hollow . In spite of everything I still think we could have had something special . We never could have had anything special . 'Cause eventually , you 'd have shed your skin and I 'd have seen you for who you really are . [ Frogs croaking ] [ Motor starting ] I don 't know , Q-Ball . I would have turned her in to the authorities . I guess I 'm not as forgiving ' as you are . Yes , you are . 'Cause you 're still my friend , even after I considered leaving you . Yeah , I figured it was like in the Bible . The apple was there , the snake was persuasive . Only this time , the man didn 't bite . [ Exclaims ] All right . Quinn , Looks like we finally found something we have in common . What 's that ? When it comes to the opposite sex , we can 't trust our instincts . [ Electronic bleeping ] [ Snakes hissing ]

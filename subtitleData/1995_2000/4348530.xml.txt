 Okay , let 's hurry up here . Okay , guys . Remember , if anything happens to this truck , I will kill you . - I get on front or back ? - Oh , Mr. Chan , no , no , no . It 's okay . You have to go over here . The bus will take you to a clean hotel . You 'll be nice and safe there , okay ? Just go right in there . Somebody spiked this embalming fluid with coffee . - Are all the tenants accounted for ? - Yeah , all except for Mrs. Wilkinson . Senora Ramirez , por havor , let the man load the lamp in the truck . He 's paid to be careful . You should hear the way Mrs. Ramirez blesses your name for getting me to handle the case pro bono . Listen , she can bless me after we get that pig of a landlord to foot the bill for this move . Fire up the engines , Connie . We 're ready to roll . - Ada ? Ada ? - Mrs. Wilkinson . I was starting to think that you didn 't want to leave . Oh , Ada ? I can 't find Ada . - Who is Ada ? - She 's such a naughty little kitty . She 's hunting all the time . Why not ? With all the rodents in here , it 's like a regular buffet . You go over to the bus . Connie will help you inside . - I 'll help you . Come on . Just go . - Just relax . I 'll go find ... Find the cat . The cat . Okay , finding the cat . Finding the cat . We are never going to get out of this place . Looking for Ada . Come on , baby . Where are you , kitty ? Where the hell are you , kitty-cat ? Come on . Come on . Ada . Ada . Ada . Come on , kitty , kitty , kitty . Hello ? Who 's up there ? Hello . Hello ? Who 's in there ? Alex ? Jesus , I 've been looking all over for you . I found Mrs. Wilkinson 's cat downstairs . It 's gonna be fine . We have everything we need . You think our slumlord will risk a warrant and not show up ? If he does , it 's just gonna cost him more money . We gotta hit this guy where it hurts . In the pocketbook . When I think of the conditions these people have to live in he has to pay . Ms. Moreau , as a community activist , you 've worked to remedy other ill-kept lodgings . How does the defendant 's building ... Mr. Vance 's tenement is more than your garden-variety slum dwelling with faulty heating and chronic plumbing problems . It 's a breeding ground for rats and disease . - For hopelessness and despair . - Yeah , that 's right ! We 've tried to get Mr. Vance to initiate repairs four months ago when he inherited it . But he was too busy skiing in Zermatt to be bothered . Skiing my ass , I was snowboarding . What do you recommend this court do to rectify the situation ? Let me repeat the question . What do you recommend this court do to rectify the situation ? He should be forced to experience the suffering of his tenants firsthand . Yes ! Yes ! - Like hell I stay in that building . - Objection . Sentencing is for the court . He deserves to be confined under house arrest in his own tenement until all repairs have been implemented . Order . Order in the court . I 'm sure the court agrees Ms. Moreau has stepped totally out of line . What she 's proposing is outrageous . Is it , Mr. Marston ? Court is adjourned for 10 minutes . I want to see everyone in my chambers now . - You deserve it . - You 're wonderful . Laugh it up . You got exactly what you wanted . You 're a bona fide hero , huh ? I 'm not the hero here . These people are , Mr. Vance for having survived in your cesspool . My own aunt survived in a hellhole like yours for 20 years . You only have to stay in your building until it 's up to code . My building ? I 'm a club owner . What do I know about being a landlord ? I pay someone else to do that stuff for me . It 's your inheritance , Vance . You weren 't forced to accept it . The hell I wasn 't ! The hell I wasn 't ! Passports , visas , excavation permits site authorization , letter of introduction . We land in Aleppo and hit the ground running . Amazing . The wall of Josephus . I can 't believe the commissioner 's giving us a chance to uncover it . He 's not doing it out of the goodness of his heart . That earthquake last year left that whole area seismically unstable . If we don 't get a crack at it now , we may never . Legend has it that some 2000 years ago Josephus was able to tame the demons and recorded his methods on the tablets . Without the temple wall to decipher them , the tablets are useless . I 've been doing my research the last four years . You got the charts from the original dig ? We need them , don 't we ? Oh , God . I forgot . - It 's that damn Kyle Vance . - Don 't worry about it . I mean , you did good a thing there . You put a slumlord where he belongs . We were only supposed to get monetary judgment . And here I am , fighting for his house arrest . I mean ... - I 'm sorry . - Sounds like poetic justice to me . Well , you surround yourself with a couple of comforts , it won 't be so bad . Well , the Ritz-Carlton it ain 't . But it has an Old World feel about it , don 't you think ? - Very European . - European , don 't you think ? Little bit of scraping , paint , fumigation , we 'll be up to code in no time . Well , the contractor 's coming next week . You 'll be out soon enough . - This is it , Mr. Vance . - Home sweet home . Strap it on me . Here we go . Come on , guys . Come on . Let 's go , let 's go . Okay , now , Kyle , remember , you 're not wearing that monitor bracelet for decorative purposes . - My good-luck charm . - It 's my good-luck charm . - Not if you stray 50 feet from this building . I can 't figure out why would I want to go anywhere . All right , I 'm gonna call you tonight , Just make sure you 're settled in . I 'm a big boy , Andy . A few weeks alone . Monks do it . - Take care of yourself , Kyle . - Take care . - Get out of here . Okay . - Okay . Hello . Who 's there ? Damn bums . Jeez . Where 'd you come from ? I thought I was alone here . Hold on a second , where are you going ? Hold it . Hold on a second . - Let 's go , Alex . Chopper 's waiting . - Just give me a sec . Yeah . I think we 'll have you stay in town and resolve any outstanding issues with the case . - Are you serious ? - I couldn 't be more so . Wait a minute . I know more about the wall of Josephus than any of you . Probably you do . But we can be briefed by your materials on the way . - You can 't just cut me out . - You started something . And it 's your responsibility to finish it . It 's that simple . When did it become tactical procedure to send someone into the field without backup ? Right now . And , Nick , I don 't recall asking for your opinion on this matter . Aye , aye , skipper . Baby , Tia , come on . I don 't know , bring over takeout . We can be alone in this great big house . - We can feed each other mu shu . - There 's a club opening tonight . Honey , I know there 's a club opening tonight . It 's my club ! Well , let 's go . Sweetheart , I 'm indisposed for the next few weeks . I told you , I 'm a prisoner , alone here in this flophouse . - Nobody wants to come and visit . - Can you blame them ? What do you mean , can you blame them ? Honey , I 'm going out of my mind here by myself . - I 'm starting to see things . - Oh , yeah , what are you talking ... ? - I need you . Baby , no , I need you . - You don 't need me . Okay , I need someone . Hello ? Tia ! Well , that 's great . The damn phone 's against me . Son of a bitch . And everything 's against me ! Hallelujah . Something that works . Fuse box . That 's not a fuse box . Jesus . Hey . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? I live here . Upstairs . No , you don 't . This place has been cleared out . It 's empty . Oh , Kyle , I 've always lived here . And I 've been waiting for you . For me ? Why ? All you ever wanted , all you ever dreamed of . Don 't worry about that . Stay with me . Go , man , go . Hey . Easy , easy . - I can walk myself . Hey . - Come on , Vance . I told you , I wasn 't running away ! - I was chasing a murderer ! - Yeah , yeah . - Let me go ! - Right upstairs . What the hell 's going on here ? There were two dead bodies , a man and a woman . I swear it . Sure , Vance , and it don 't rain in Terre Haute in the summertime . Don 't stand on ceremony , Moreau . Come see what you got me into . What about this blood ? - You see that ? - I think you 'd better lay off that wacky weed , Vance . And don 't ever think about leaving this building again . I 'm telling you , it 's real ! There were two dead bodies in there , I swear it ! Sure , Vance . Tell it to the Avon lady . Come on , guys . Cops are gone , Moreau . You sure you want to be alone with a raving psycho ? What are you doing here anyway ? Why did you come here ? You 're afraid for me , aren 't you ? - You saw something , didn 't you ? - I didn 't say that . I 'm going out of my fucking mind here . Even though you hate my guts , you know it was a mistake putting me here . - I don 't know . - Don 't piss on my leg and tell me it 's raining . You 're afraid for my damn life , aren 't you ? - I don 't know . - You think I 'm crazy . You think I 'm out of my mind . You think I 've gone wired . - Listen ... - You think I 've gone nuts . I 'm gonna come right back . - You 're gonna be okay . - Don 't bother . Get out of here . Get out of here . Get out of here ! It 's all here , Derek , straight from the police homicide files . In 1926 , a chorus girl and her lover were found bludgeoned to death at 2913 Mason Street . Now , get this . The prime suspect at the time the girl 's boyfriend , Kyle Vance 's great-grandfather . The owner of the tenement . You believe Vance witnessed a spectral reenactment of the murders ? I don 't know what to believe . All I know is that for 70 years there 's been tragedy and bloodshed in every apartment of that tenement . So , what do you plan to do next ? I talked to Connie to try to have the sentence rescinded . But after my performance in the courtroom there 's no way . - Well , doesn 't surprise me . And Vance doesn 't want my help either . He 's locked me out . So , what are you saying ? You giving up ? How can I , Derek ? He 's by himself in there . Thanks to me . I mean , God only knows what he 's up against . Well , he won 't be alone , then , will he ? I 'll call the airport and book the first flight back to San Francisco . Nick . - Somebody 's gotta be with her . - That 's up to me to decide . Your job is this excavation . I 'm sure you 've got reasons for not having me go back . Would you mind making me privy to them ? Someday Alex will have to cover your back . And I need to know if the two of you will make it home . Andy , listen to me , I don 't have time for you to take it to a higher court . Do something now , or I take it to another lawyer . I don 't want a guard dog . I want to get out of here before I lose my mind . Idiot ! - No ! - I 'll kill you . I 'll kill you . Grandma ? Vance ? Vance . Vance . What happened ? What did you see ? My grandmother . My parents talked about my grandmother 's death in whispers behind closed doors . They told me she died peacefully in her sleep . I can 't figure out why he was beating her up like that . Oh , my God . I 'm going out of my mind . No , whatever you saw was real enough . For whatever reason these spirits are returning to re-create past events for your benefit . Spirits ? Re-creations ? What ... ? What do you know about all that stuff ? I thought you were a social worker . L ... I tell you , I think those murders are connected to my family . And I think that old guy is my great-grandfather . What do you know about him ? Man sails over from Lithuania with small money and big dreams . Winds up with a real-estate empire spanning 12 cities in three countries . - Starting with this building . - Right from this rotten little acorn . And he never forgot it either . Even after he made his fortune . Why ? How do you figure that ? Because he stuck this stupid stipulation in his will . Every heir who takes over the family empire has to maintain this grungy rattrap . Or the trust fund gets forfeited . So that 's why your family never sold the building . - Why they held on to it for so long . - I told you that . You thought I wanted to keep it . I just couldn 't see giving up 20 million bucks because old Joe Vance had some twisted streak of sentiment . What 's wrong ? Want some gin to get that tea on its feet ? I 'll be right back . I have to go check something out . The building is unsafe . You said so yourself . It 's got faulty heating and chronic plumbing problems . - You shouldn 't go out there alone . - Why don 't you come . I think I should probably stay here . You 're sure ? Okay . Keep your hands away . Come on . Where is it ? Keep your hands away . What do you want ? To give you what I promised . I don 't want anything . Strength . Success . I am successful . I can erase all your fears and self-doubt . I don 't have any fears . Wrong guy . Oh , yes . I know how you really feel . Deep inside . How everything you 've ever attempted has turned to failure . How all your enterprises have come to nothing . How your relationships always die . Even with your own father . Look what you 've become , Kyle . Do you know what you are ? Yeah . You 're your own worst fear aren 't you ? For years you 've lived in his shadows feeling weak and afraid dreading the day that you 'd have to take his place . You brushed aside the family business . You wanted to make it on your own and prove to your father that you 're just as strong just as important . I 'll take away the pain . I 'll give you the power . Kyle . Touch me , Kyle . Now . Now . Yes . Break the chain , Kyle ! Break the chain ! Break the chain ! Break the chain ! - Father ? - Break the chain , Kyle . Father ? Father ? - Father ! - Break the chain , Kyle ! Vance . What do you expect to find in there ? Some kind of research material ? Listen , you need to tell me what went on in your apartment . It was nothing . I told you , it was a bad dream . This would go a lot faster if you would just ... Yes . How 's your Lithuanian , Vance ? I 'd run over to Lucci 's on North Beach if I didn 't have this stupid ankle bracelet on . Get some biscotti . Great . Okay , we 're ready for a translation . What does it say ? It 's your grandmother 's diary . She says your great-grandfather built this place for her . - For my great-grandmother ? - No . For his mistress who in time became your grandfather 's mistress . How could that be ? " And so he made the pact with her without thought for the soul of his own flesh and blood or the souls of descendants to come . He became a stranger to me . " She was desperate enough to try and kill her . When that didn 't work , she hanged herself . She even had a name for her , Nakties Davisia . Mistress of the Endless Night . Kyle . Kyle . Father ? Kyle . Kyle ! My father . There was a lot of pain in his eyes . A lot of suffering . It 's cosmic justice , I guess . He dished out enough pain in his life . I think he thought I was gonna be just like him . Some role model , huh ? Everyone hated his guts . He wasn 't like that when I was a kid . He was great . Was that before he took over the corporation ? Yeah . Yeah , you know , we were a normal family then . Normal family . We went to ball games . We went to movies . We went to Sunday Mass . Believe it or not , I was an altar boy . Now , that , I wish I 'd seen . Pride of the Blessed Sacrament . In the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Ghost I reject all impure thoughts and deeds . Then we stopped going to church . I remember when that happened . Because I spent all my time trying to please him . Of course , I never could . - He became a ... - A stranger . Yeah . I thought it was my fault . Your father made a deal with the dark side . And with every deal comes a price . Loving you was one of the things he had to give up . It all comes down to this building . Even on his deathbed the bugger made me promise to come visit . - Of course , I never thought I would . - No . Until I came along and made sure you came here . - You didn 't know what you were doing . - She did all the thinking for me . She used my passion and my anger to get you where she wants you . In this place . Research compiled on Nakties Davisia also known as Mistress oh Endless Night . Evil entity prevalent in Lithuanian holklore since 12th century . The peasants believed nobles entered into covenants with the demon in exchange hor prosperity . You have done your part . You may leave now . No way . I go , he goes . Alex ! Alex ! Alex ! I 'm getting help ! Vance ! Vance . Are you okay ? Vance ! Damn . Alex ! Alex ! Alex ! Vance ! Go away ! No ! She can 't help you . But I can . You have nothing to fear . Touch my hand , and you 'll be safe . Touch my hand , and your fears will melt away . Touch my hand , Kyle . Touch my hand . Come . There 's nothing for you to fear , Kyle . Your ancestors cry for you . As empty as the wind . They can 't stop you from fulfilling your destiny . And I have been waiting for you since the day you were born . No . Vance ! Stop ! This is where your father fulfilled the covenant and his father 's father before him , and his father before that . Now it 's your time . You will always maintain this house . You will bring people to live here and nourish me . You will sire progeny to follow in your path and continue the chain . Yes . In return you will have wealth and power without fear or remorse until the day you die . Yes . Open the door ! Vance ! Vance , are you okay ? Vance ! Open the door ! Open the door ! Don 't stop , Kyle . Please , don 't do it , Kyle . Don 't do it . Make love to me , Kyle , now . I 'll give you everything . For a price . Always for a price . No fear , no more uncertainty . She 'll own you . Like she owns your father . All the power in the world for the rest of your life . She 'll own your soul . - Don 't stop , Kyle . - Just like your father . Remember what that felt like when he stopped loving you ? No . No . Don 't stop . Don 't stop . Break the chain . Break the chain . Don 't stop ! Don 't stop ! Reject ... Reject her , Kyle . Reject her . Do it ! Do it now ! Reject her , Kyle ! In the name of the Father , the Son and Holy Ghost I reject you with all my heart and soul . I reject the covenant forged in your name , Nakties Davisia and I send you back to hell . In the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Ghost I reject you with all my heart and soul . I reject the covenant forged in your name , Nakties Davisia and I send you back to hell . In the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Ghost I reject you with all my heart and soul . I reject the covenant forged in your name , Nakties Davisia and I send you back to hell . Help me . Help me . It was an entire river . Well , the only shot we 'll have , if it 's actually buried there is when that water table goes down . - Yeah . - Could be months from now . - I know . You want a drink ? Yeah , sure . Hit me . What happened to you ? I want him . Alone . So how did it go , Alex ? You know damn well how things went . You knew all along . You knew all along what was in store for me in that hellhole and you sent me down there ? You knew what I was up against ? Maybe I did . And maybe I didn 't . The point is you needed to be there . Having you stay was the right decision , wasn 't it ? Wasn 't it ? Maybe .

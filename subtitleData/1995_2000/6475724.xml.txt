 Charlie ! Come on , Charlie ! - Here you go , sweetie . - Charlie , hey ! Ice cream . Hey , buddy ! Do you want some ice cream ? Yeah ? Here , Charlie . Here you go . Look ! There it goes ! Going to balloon land . Go bye-bye . Oh , ssh . Oh , sweetie , don 't cry . Hey , look . Here 's some ice cream . Want some ice cream ? Look . Here . Teddy ... Teddy , here 's your balloon . - Look at that ! Here you go . - Oh ! Such a mess . - We gotta clean you up . - Charlie and I 'll wait for you . - That was my balloon . - Eat your ice cream before it melts . I don 't want any ice cream . I want my balloon . We 'll get you a balloon , OK ? No . I want my balloon . Fine . We 'll get you another balloon . That was a waste of good money . Ooh ! There we go . Yes . OK . Ohh ! There we go . That 's a boy . What a good boy . OK . OK , Teddy . I 'll be right back , OK ? There were six in the bed and the little one said Roll over , roll over So they all rolled over and one fell out Five in the bed and the little one said Roll over , roll over So they all rolled over and one fell out Four in the bed and the little one said roll over , roll over So they all rolled over and one fell out Three in the bed and the little one said roll over , roll over So they all rolled over and one fell out Two in the bed and the little one said ... Teddy ? Teddy ! Teddy ! Teddy ! Teddy ! Teddy ! Teddy ! - There 's a kid on the track ! - Oh , my God ! Teddy ! Teddy ! Get away from there ! Teddy ! Teddy , come here ! Damn ! Teddy ! Tell Teddy to get off the track ! No ! Oh , my God ! Teddy ? Maggie ... Teddy ... This was taken at an amusement park three months ago . The young boy in the background is Teddy Holvey , aged two . - He was killed seconds after this was taken . - How ? According to the police report , he wandered in front of the miniature train . The conductor was unable to stop due to malfunctioning brakes . Teddy 's dad works for the State Department . A coroner 's inquest was held due to the unusual circumstances of the accident . - Did the inquest find anything unusual ? - No . But the county medical examiner was disturbed by this case and by this photo , ... .. and I think with good reason . You see , this is a helium balloon . One thing I learnt in kindergarten is when you let them go , they float up . - But this is moving away horizontally . - Did you learn about wind in kindergarten ? The National Weather Service say on that day the wind was blowing north . But the balloon is moving south , as if it 's being pulled against the wind . - Pulled ? By whom ? - I don 't know . So I came to Chuck , the king of digital imaging . Chuck can extract incredibly small details from a photographic print . Not details . Information . Watch the monitor . We have limitations on how much the eye can perceive unaided . But with this special software , which I designed , we can detect hidden information . We can manipulate it , enhance it . Now watch right here . There it is . It 's clearly a concentration of electromagnetic energy . So you 're saying that , uh ... a ghost killed Teddy Holvey ? Did anyone check the camera that took the photo ? - The lens or the pressure plate ? - It all checked out , Scully . I think this is clearly some kind of poltergeist activity . This is the same reason why you 'll see a newspaper photo ... .. with Jesus ' face appearing in the foliage of an elm tree . It 's a chance occurrence of light and shadow . To get on the tracks , Teddy Holvey escaped this childproof halter ... - .. that his mom had tied to a sink . - I 've seen some slippery two-year-olds . So the CME put it on his own two-year-old ... .. and found it was impossible for the kid to free himself . So unless Teddy was the reincarnation of Houdini ... And that would be an X-File in itself . I don 't understand . There 's already been a formal inquest . We 're here apart from that investigation . We believe something may have been overlooked . Like what ? The possibility Teddy may have been helped onto the tracks . - Oh , my God . - There were over a hundred witnesses . We saw Teddy ourselves . He was chasing a balloon . There was no one else around . It was an awful accident , but that 's all it was - an accident . Do you have any reason to suspect someone may have wanted to hurt Teddy ? He was just a baby . Why would anybody want to hurt him ? I don 't know what you 're getting at . We loved Teddy . If you 're suggesting this is like that woman who drowned her kids , you 're way out of line . Mrs Holvey , did you hear anything in the bathroom right before Teddy disappeared ? I already told the inquest I heard nothing . Mrs Holvey , at the time of the accident did you have any hired help ? No . My mother came to live with us once Teddy was born . Around the time of Teddy 's death , had you noticed anything strange happening ? Things moved , odd objects appearing ? It 's that damn smoke detector . I 'll be right back . Does this happen often ? It 's an old house . We have a problem with the wiring . - Mother . - Diavolo ! Mother , it was just a false alarm . No ! Mother ! Stop it ! What is she saying ? - Maggie ! - You marry a devil . You have devil child ! I 'm sorry . D 'you recognise this ? - It 's a swastika . - It 's also known as a gammadion or a fylfot . It 's an ancient symbol used for protection or good luck , ... .. used by various cultures since the Middle Ages . The child had one on the back of his hand last night . My guess ? It was drawn by the old lady - to protect the boy . - Yes , I saw her drawing it . - You didn 't think that was strange ? I think this boy needs as much protection as he can get , ... .. but just not from ghosties or beasties . Look at this . Have you ever heard of M端nchhausen by proxy ? Yeah , my grandfather used to take it for his stomach . When a parent or caretaker brings harm to a child ... .. by inducing symptoms , usually as a way of getting attention or status . Look at Teddy 's medical history . You 'll see that he was admitted to various hospitals ten times ... .. during the two years he was alive . That 's once every three months . Projectile vomiting at three months , ... .. diarrhea at four months , vomiting , diarrhea , diarrhea ... Each time they were unable to determine the cause . - And no one questioned this ? - The family moved around with Steve 's job . Records take time to transfer from hospital to hospital . But this abuse is not limited to just one child , so I checked out Charlie 's history as well . - He had medical problems too ? - Since his brother was born , ... .. which is right when Holvey 's mother-in-law moved in . Often the perpetrator of M端nchhausen by proxy will view the child as evil . The old woman would be a likely candidate , but it could be any family member . Do you feel like taking a walk over to the State Department , Scully ? Things have been strange since Golda , my mother-in-law , moved in with us . I met Maggie in Romania in 1984 . Golda forbade our marriage , said I was the devil . After I transferred back to the US , things got somewhat better , ... .. until Teddy was born and she came to live with us . That 's when the strangeness really started . What kind of strangeness ? Superstitions rule Golda 's life . She 'll spit if anyone compliments the kids . Once she moved in , she poured hot water over the threshold to ward off demons , ... .. tied red strings around the kids ' wrists . One day I caught her throwing chicken guts on the roof . Then Teddy and Charlie started getting sick ... a lot . - And you suspect Golda ? - She 'll call Charlie evil right to his face . But at the same time she dotes on him like ... she 's afraid of him . Afraid of him or for him ? I just don 't know . Are you familiar with M端nchhausen by proxy ? Are you accusing us of child abuse ? Teddy 's medical records have raised some questions . I could never say this to Maggie , but ... .. I 've wondered if it wasn 't Golda who snuck in and let Teddy out of the bathroom that day . I 'd like to interview your son Charlie , Mr Holvey , but with a professional counselor . This is gonna be hard . - Maggie ! - What do they want ? To take Charlie away ? They just want him to talk with a social worker . - They 'll put lies into Charlie 's head . - You 're being unreasonable . You want to take him away ! You blame me for Teddy and you want to take him away . I won 't listen to this . This is ridiculous ! If you wanna come , you can . I 'm taking Charlie now . No , Steven ! What was that ? Come on , Charlie , let 's get your coat . - You have no right to do this ! - Maggie . Come on . We 'll meet you out front . - OK , you buckled in there ? - Yeah . Dammit ! No ! No ! Daddy ! No ! Noooo ! No ! Daddy ! No ! Mulder . Daddy ! Daddy ! No ! Daddy ! No ! Daddy ! Daddy ! You see this ? - Find anything ? - Yeah , maybe . It looks like ash . Yeah . It 's everywhere . Look at this . The Holveys said earlier they had problems with the wiring . - It could be the motor shorted out . - No , the motor 's fine . - What do you think it is ? - I don 't know , but I 'll have this analysed . Before we do anything , we should get Charlie out of here . I called a social worker who 's gonna come down and make a report . - The courts will be reluctant to intervene . - Not when a child is in danger . And not after they see two dead roosters in the old woman 's bedroom . Really ? - Still think this is M端nchhausen by proxy ? - Without a doubt . - What did you do ? - I didn 't do anything . Stay away from our house ! - Hey . You wanna see something weird ? - What ? Chem lab analysis of the ash from the Holveys ' house . No trace of any metal , no carbon , no oxygen , no nothing . - What do you mean ? - It contains nothing organic or inorganic . In fact , according to the technicians , this ash doesn 't exist . Come on . - Where are we going ? - To get a second opinion . Oh , wow ! Haven 't seen this for a while . Not since India , 1979 . - India ? - Before Chuck succumbed to academia , ... .. he did a tour of duty on the old hippie trail . It 's called vibuti . Holy ash . Technically it 's called an apport - something that materialises out of thin air . Wait a second . Nothing materialises out of thin air . You 've read the Bible ? Remember Jesus creating the loaves and the fishes ? Yeah , but that was a parable . In 1979 I witnessed a guru named Sai Baba ... .. create an entire feast out of thin air . Too bad you didn 't take a picture and use your computer to see the entire Last Supper . Vibuti is created during the presence of spirit beings or during bilocation , ... .. which is a phenomenon where a person 's energy is transported to a different location . That energy could have been what set off the garage-door opener . Yeah , that - or somebody activated the remote control . Well , who are you suggesting did that ? Who was standing outside when the garage door opened on us yesterday ? The old lady ... and Charlie . Mrs Holvey ? My name is Karen Kosseff . I 'm a social worker with the FBI . I 've been instructed to file a report for the court . - May I come in ? - No . - Please , I 've already had enough trouble . - I understand , Mrs Holvey . But if you won 't talk to me , I 'll have to put that in the report ... .. and it could very well complicate your situation . - Mommy ! - Charlie ? Oh , my God ! Charlie ! It 's OK , Charlie . It 's OK . It 's OK , Charlie . It 's OK . He 's been sick . My mother was supposed to be looking after him . Mother ? Mother ! Get out of my house ! Get out ! I have had enough , Mother . I want you out of my house . No ! Mother ! Mother ! Mother ! The grandmother 's taken the child and locked him in the room with her . - She may have a knife . I 've called 911 . - What happened ? There were three strange men . They were performing some kind of ritual . No ! No , Nanna ! It is the only way . No ! Mother ! Oh , my God ! Oh , no ! Mother ! Mother ! - Did you talk to Charlie ? - He says he doesn 't remember anything . The coroner 's preliminary report says she died of a heart attack . But those wounds ... I 'd swear her eyes were pecked out . There was more ash on the floor beneath the old woman 's body . And look at this . - What is it ? - It 's mugwort . I think it 's a ceremonial herb . - Was this a ritual killing ? - No , the reverse swastika on the window ... .. and the red string around his wrist are protective devices . - Protection against what ? - I don 't know . But the old woman knew the family was in trouble . Those men were here to help her . I told you before , get out of my house ! I am not interested in your superstition . Now get out . Now ! - Mrs Holvey ? - It 's all right . - Who are they ? - They are the Calusari . In Romania they are responsible for the correct observance of sacred rites . What did he say ? He said it 's not over . - The evil is still here . - Excuse me . Sir ? Can I have a word with you ? Sir , I 'm with the FBI . I 'd like to ask you some questions . You were trying to protect the family , weren 't you ? You said there was still evil here . Sir ! I can arrest you if ! have to . The evil that is here has always been . It has gone by different names through history . Cain , Lucifer , Hitler . It does not care if it kills one boy or a million men . If you try to stop us , the blood will be on your hands . Mrs Holvey ? I know this is a difficult time , but there are some questions that need to be answered . My mother used to say that evil follows evil . Once someone suffers a misfortune , they 'll always have bad luck . I used to think that was just a superstition . Now I don 't know what to believe . I blamed her , you know ? For all that 's happened . I thought maybe she was putting a curse on us to punish me . Punish you for what ? For abandoning the old ways . I was raised to believe , as she did , in spirits . The unseen world . When I married Steve and came to this country , I left all that behind . Do you know what kind of ceremony she was performing upstairs ? She was trying to cleanse the house of evil . She thought Charlie was responsible somehow . He 's just a little boy ! I think we should talk to Charlie and find out what happened in your mother 's bedroom . Charlie ? I was told they found you in your grandmother 's room yesterday . Can you tell me about it ? Do you remember how you got there ? No . Your mother said you were there . Remember ? I wasn 't there ! Many people saw you in the room . It wasn 't me ! I wasn 't there ! It wasn 't me ! - Who was in the room ? - No ! Was there someone else in the room ? No ! I didn 't hurt her ! Charlie ? Charlie ! Who hurt your grandmother ? Charlie ! - It was him ! - Who , Charlie ? Who ? It was Michael ! Michael ! Mrs Holvey ? We never told him . It was agreed upon . It was our secret . What secret , Mrs Holvey ? What are you talking about ? Michael . He was Charlie 's twin . He was stillborn . Steven and I agreed never to tell Charlie about it . My mother , ... .. she wanted to perform a ritual of separation when she heard of Michael 's death - .. to divide their souls . She said ... if we didn 't , the world of the dead would follow Charlie . But it was just a superstition . Help ! I need your help . - Charlie ? - He 's having some kind of seizure . Don 't restrain him . Let 's turn him on his side . Charlie , you 're going to be OK . - How 's Charlie ? - He 's resting . How 's Mrs Holvey ? I 'm amazed she hasn 't broken down . She 's in the waiting room , trying to sleep . The doctor said that Charlie had a seizure , but they 're unable to determine the cause . I 'm sorry , Charlie . I didn 't mean to scare you . I 'm Nurse Castor . I 'm just gonna give you something to help you sleep . - No , I don 't want a shot ! - I know , but if you spit out your medicine , ... - .. we have to give it to you some other way . - No ! Just relax . It won 't hurt . Afterwards I 'll give you a sticker . - Leave me alone ! - Charlie , it 'll just be a little pinch . - Now I want you to relax . - Stop it ! - Charlie ... Now , I want you to behave . - Leave me alone ! - Charlie , I want you to behave . Just relax . - No ! Don 't do it ! Don 't do it ! No , Michael ! Michael , don 't ! Mommy ? - I want to go home now . - Charlie ? What are you doing up ? Why are you dressed ? They said I could go home now . - Who said that ? - The doctors . They said I could leave . All right , then . Let 's just get your coat . - And we 'll talk to the doctors . - No , Mommy . Let 's just go home . Now ! OK , Charlie . We 'll go straight home . What are you looking at ? - Is that Mrs Holvey ? - Where ? There . I think she 's got Charlie with her . Ohh ... Oh . Nurse ! - Are you all right ? - He hit me . - Who ? Charlie ? - No , not him . The other one . There were two of them . Two boys . - You gotta get to Mrs Holvey . - Why ? The boy who left with Mrs Holvey wasn 't Charlie . - Are you saying she left with a ghost ? - Or a spirit . I 'm not sure . It 's what was in the photo and what the old woman tried to protect the family from . It 's killed three people . You 've got to get to Mrs Holvey 's before it happens again . - What are you gonna do ? - Get help . - There you go , Charlie . - Aren 't you going to have some ? No , dear . I 'm not hungry . - Tomorrow we can go to the park . - Yes . Sure . Can I have a balloon ? Uh-huh . Can we ride the train , Mommy ? Now , you finish up and Mommy will be right back , OK ? Please God , don 't let it be true . What are you doing , Mommy ? Mommy ? Guard the door . Mrs Holvey ? Hello ? Come hold him down . Don 't look at it ! Look away or it will recognise you . Charlie ? Mommy ? It hurts ! Do not let go ! He tricks you . - Are you all right ? - Charlie ? Let the boy rest . We must find the mother . The boy needs her . - Scully , are you all right ? - We 're OK . How 's Charlie ? Charlie ! Hello , sweetie . Charlie ! It is over ... for now . But you must be careful . It knows you . The case of Charlie Holvey and the deaths that occurred ... .. during his possession by a dark and malevolent force are unsolved . The boy , who celebrates his tenth birthday next month , is under the care of his mother . Though I believe him to be innocent , I am disturbed by the warnings of the Calusari : .. that neither innocence nor vigilance may be protection against the howling heart of evil . I made this !

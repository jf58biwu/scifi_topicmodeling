 [ Dings ] [ Dings ] [ Bell Dings ] [ Metal Creaking ] [ Gasping ] [ Man Gasps ] [ Screaming ] [ Rattling ] [ Screaming ] [ Flashbulb Charging ] Just a routine background check . To the best of your knowledge , has Mr. Wisnowski ever used any illegal drugs ? Which illegal drugs ? Yeah , in the time that you worked with Ms. Ermentrout , did you find her to be a trustworthy person ? Punctual , huh ? Punctual is good . No , no , ma 'am . This is just a routine background check . Mister - - Mr. Garber is not in any legal trouble whatsoever . Yeah . Okay . Thanks for your time . Hey , Scully , if we get lucky , next time they 'll let us clean toilet bowls . - You ready to quit ? - No . That would make way too many people way too happy . [ Rings ] Scully . I 'm on my way . I 've been called into Kersh 's office.Just me . Just you ? Don 't forget your toilet brush . No . No , ma 'am , not you . [ Knock On Door ] - Agent . - Sir . Dana Scully , this is Agent Peyton Ritter with the bureau 's New York office . - Agent Ritter . - Hi . Show her what you have . Our office is currently updating its case filing system . While I was involved in this project- - scanning old crime scene photographs into the computer- - I came across this . " " Margareta Stoller , age 57 , cause of death , an overdose of Nitraz . " " - Look at when they found her . - A neighbor called the police at 1 1 : 1 4 p.m. Right . So what 's wrong with that picture ? Clock says it is 45 minutes earlier . Well , a clock can be wrong . They certainly can , so I checked the Post from the following day . These are straight from their photo files . Hmm . Almost an hour and a half later . Right . Two different negatives , same photographer . The guy 's name is Alfred Fellig . He 's rattled around Manhattan for years . Apparently a stringer for the wire services , an on - call guy for N. Y.P.D. And you suspect this man Fellig ? You think that Mrs. Stoller wasn 't a suicide ? Well , this guy 's into taking pictures , right ? So I 'm thinking , what if- - what if he poisons this woman ... and gets his jollies by snapping a few of her dead body , then winds up back in the same apartment an hour later ... after Midtown North calls him over to do the job ? That 's quite a theory . Yeah , well , the thing is , he might have done it on more than one occasion . Now , I sifted through probably 2,000 of his police photos . Now , these three have measurable solar shadows . - Since we know the location - - - You can tell the time of day by the shadows . Right . And with it , these three are looking every bit as hinky . You 've got another suicide here , a heart attack ... and a very obvious murder for which another man was convicted . - There 's no consistent M.O. - There 's no consistent anything . I could sure use your help . - Agent , step outside , please . - Sure . I would say he has a promising career ahead of him . So did you ... at one time . With your expertise in forensic pathology , you would be a substantial asset to this investigation . I know it 'd provide more challenge to you than running background checks . Agent Mulder and I will begin immediately . Agent Mulder 's a lost cause . I 'm taking the chance you 're not . It 's you and Ritter . Do not let me down . [ Groaning ] Ohh ! [ Flashbulb Charging ] - Mulder . - Hmm ? - What are you doing ? - Being nosy . Eating my heart out . They 're sending you on an X-File . - It 's not an X-File . - That 's not what I 'm reading . I 'm thinking murder by telekinesis , maybe a shamanistic death touch . I 'm thinking about the Muslim superstition ... that to photograph someone is to steal their soul . Thank you . All very helpful . So they 're splitting us up , huh ? No . This is a onetime thing . Who told you that ? Obviously , if you do a good job , they 're not going to stick you back here . Right ? - Agent Scully , we 're all set . - Peyton Ritter , this is Fox Mulder . - It 's a pleasure to meet you , Fox . - Pleasure to meet you , Peyton . - We should get going . - Off to New York . Alfred Fellig . What can you tell us about him ? What 's to tell ? He 's one of about 1 0,000 people in town ... who have an official license to piss people off . He sometimes doubles as a crime scene photographer for your precinct . Yeah , he comes in , snaps a picture . Keeps to himself . There 's not much in the way of personal information there . There 's not supposed to be . It 's just a yearly renewal form . Would you happen to know when the original background check was done ? Here he is again . Yearly renewal dating back toJanuary 1 97 0 , but still no original . I think I 've got it . 1 964 . Whew . Old-timer . - Anything interesting ? - Maybe . - What you doing ? - Take a look at this . 1 996 . '87 , ' 85 , ' 73 . Guy 's a regular Dick Clark . I don 't know what to tell you , Dana . Other than the fact that this guy 's always been a geezer , this is looking like a dead end . Help ! Help ! Somebody call the police ! - Man , what do you want from me ? Are you crazy ? - [ Horn Honks ] Please ! Please help me ! Please ! Come on , lady ! Please help me ! - Man , what do you want from me , man ? No ! - [ Switchblade Clicks Open ] No ! No ! [ Screaming ] [ Camera Clicks ] [ Clicking Continues ] [ Switchblade Clicks Open ] [ Groans ] [ Ritter ] Prints are Alfred Fellig 's . Positive match , right off his 1 964 background check . I took the liberty of slipping them into the SAFIS database . First thing this morning , boom ! Up they came . - You 're thinking this is Fellig 's work ? - It 's a lock . The wound measurements match with the knife . He got sloppy in his old age . - What 's this ? - A whole lot of blood . Yeah , I got that . - It 's pretty clear he took a second victim . - Where 's the second body ? - They found your boy . - Fellig ? Where ? Home , watching T V . They 're bringing him in now . Yes ! Check . Check . January 4 , 1 1 : 36 a.m. 1 5th Precinct , Manhattan . Agents present : Dana Scully and Peyton Ritter . - Initial interview with ... - [ Door Opens ] Alfred Fellig . Hello . You 're a photographer . I 've seen some of your work . You specialize in some pretty dark subject matter . You 're around death a lot . It must fascinate you . Am I boring you , Mr. Fellig ? Ask me a question already . All right . I want to know how you always happen to be ... Johnny-on-the-spot every time somebody dies . You 're always there to take the picture . How does that happen ? I have a- - a nose for news . Mr. Fellig , your fingerprints were found ... on a murder weapon at a crime scene . Could you give us a full accounting of your activities last night ? The Bronx . I was on the job . Saw some gibbon ' stealing a kid 's tennis shoes . He chased me . - Ran off . - He ran off ? - Some unidentified murderer . - I guess I could identify him . Your fingerprints were found on the knife . - [ Grunts ] - How did they get there ? He left the knife behind . I guess I touched it ... briefly . Why would you do that ? Were you injured , Mr. Fellig ? You seem to be in pain . Were you attacked ? We found other blood at the crime scene , and when we have it tested , I 'm wondering if we 're going to learn that it 's yours . - I got cut some . - May we see ? May I help you ? Hey . Hey . Take Mr. Fellig to get his blood drawn . And photograph his back too . Hey , I 'm confused . I thought we were trying to bust this guy , not look for reasons to let him go . I thought we were looking for the truth . [ Phone Line Ringing ] - Scully . - Hi . My name is Fox Mulder . We used to sit next to each other at the F.B.I. - How 's your X-File coming ? - Mulder , it 's not- - We haven 't made much headway . We arrested Alfred Fellig , - and we just released him . - You can 't hold him ? What about the stabbing ? - How do you know about that ? - I told you , I 'm nosy . Why are you letting him go ? We were able to pull another set of prints off of the knife . They belong to a convicted murderer by the name of Malcolm Wiggins . That and the fact that Fellig 's blood was found all over the crime scene ... tells me that his story checks out . At least that particular story anyway . But you still think Fellig 's a murderer , huh ? I don 't know what to think . He 's , uh , unusual . As in he plugs up like a cork when you stab him ? - Where are you getting this stuff ? - Well , young man Ritter ... has been sending progress reports to Kersh . My computer may have inadvertently intercepted a few of those . He 's got nice things to say about you , though , mostly . Why don 't you let me do a little background check on Fellig for you ? - Mulder- - - Come on . It 's what I do now . I 'm getting good at it . I 'm parked around the block . Fellig 's asleep . I haven 't seen him move in over four hours . Have a lovely evening . [ Camera Clicking ] [ Clicking Continues ] - [ Knocking On Door ] - Mr. Fellig , open up , please ! Explain this . - What ? - You took that photo an hour before police arrived . You then purposely covered up that fact by photographing the scene again . I don 't think I remember that one . You have , Mr. Fellig , a long and uncanny history of being the first person at the scene of a death . You also have a history of covering up that fact . Why ? Am I under arrest again ? Are you a murderer ? Well , then explain yourself , sir . Because I promise you , until you do , you will not get a moment 's peace . You want to take a ride with me ? You come with me . I 'll show you . It 's been an hour . Are we going to drive around all night ? Yeah . This is it . This is what I do . Looking for the shot . - What shot ? - The shot . Her . She 's about to die . What are you talking about ? It could happen in the next minute , in the next hour . But it 'll happen . It 's as plain as day . Look , Mister- - Fellig , I don 't know what you 're planning , but nobody here is going to die . I 'm not planning anything . I 'm just here to tell you what 's gonna happen . That that woman right there is going to be murdered ? I didn 't say " " murdered . " " She 's a smoker . She might die of lung cancer . The " " how " " is always a surprise . I just always know " " when . " " You want me to believe that ? [ Man ] Hey , what are you doin 'out here , huh ? It 's so cold out here . [ Continues , Indistinct ] Get out of my face ! Get off me ! [ Charging ] Let go of me ! Get out of here ! I 've killed over that ! Get out of here ! Move it ! F.B.I. ! Don 't move ! - Damn ! Where 'd you come from ? - Shut up ! - What ? - Get down ! Back up ! You 're not such a big man now ! - That gun ain 't mine , Red . - Yeah . [ Mutters ] - You all right ? - I 'm out of here . [ Horn Honks ] [ Brakes Hiss ] Dana , what the hell is going on ? Assault and possession of an unregistered handgun . - I 'll be with you in a minute . - Why didn 't you call me sooner ? I apologize . What , you blew off the surveillance ? No offense , but the surveillance was blown before I got there . Wait . You blew off the surveillance and took a little joyride with him ? I confronted Fellig . I questioned him further about the deaths that he photographed . - Is that okay with you ? - What did he say ? He said that he can tell when people are about to die . If New York passes a Good Samaritan law , we might nail him on that . But other than that , I doubt we 're going to get him for murder . Wrong . Let me show you something . They picked up Mr. Wiggins last night . He says that it was Fellig who killed that kid in the alley , not him . He said he happened along and had to fight for his life . A convicted murderer half Fellig 's age . He said he would 've come in on his own but was afraid we wouldn 't have believed him . He 's right . Tell me , Ritter , did he have any help concocting that story ? Look , Fellig is a murderer . Whether or not he did this specific one , I don 't care . Not if it buys me a few days in the box with him . No judge is going to issue a warrant based on this . I know the judge . We 'll have it by noon . You know , Kersh warned me about you . - He did ? - Yeah . You and your partner . God knows his reputation precedes him , so I guess I should 've seen this coming . You muck up my case , and Kersh will hear about it . Are we clear , Dana ? - Scully . And we 're done with this conversation . - [ Cell Phone Rings ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Ringing Continues ] - Yeah ? - Hey , Scully , how 's that X-File coming ? - Before you tell me that it 's not an X-File- - - It is . What happened ? Alfred Fellig seems to know an awful lot about death . Oh , yeah ? Well , that 's not surprising , given that ... he 's reached the ripe old age of 1 49 . - Excuse me ? - I did a low-tech background check on him . This stuff is so old that they don 't even keep it on record on the computer . Alfred Fellig doesn 't exist before 1 964 , but one Henry Strand does . He applied for a press pass from theJersey City Police in 1 939 at the age of 53 . - His prints match Fellig 's . - But , Mulder , there must be some kind of a mistake . You think ? Because this Henry Strand does not exist before 1 939 . However , one L.H. Rice ... is on record as having sat for the New York State civil service exam . Now , the records don 't show whether he passed or not . But his thumbprint ? Fellig 's . Want to know what L.H. Rice 's birthday is ? April 4 , 1 849 . I 'm not good at math , but I 'm figuring that 's a lot of candles on the cake . I have spent time with this man , and he can 't be more than 65 years old . I think that 's what he wants you to think . Now , we 're talking about a guy for whom the phrase ... " " life in prison " " carries some seriously weighty connotations . I think you should get to him before he vanishes and becomes someone else . [ Horn Honks ] [ Police Scanner Chatter ] You are going to be arrested , Mr. Fellig , in two hours , charged with murder . And this time , you won 't be able to just change your name . I showed you what I do last night . I just take the pictures . What you showed me was a contemptible lack of compassion ... for another human being . You showed me that you profit off of people 's deaths . Now , why shouldn 't you go to prison ? What , do you want me to cry for them ? You want me to make like I feel sorry for them ? I don 't . Lucky bastards . - Every one of them . - Lucky ? I 'm just there to get the shot . I don 't take those people . He does . Who 's he ? That 's him . He 's the one who takes them . You 're saying that this is a photograph of Death itself ? It 's a glimpse . Just a glimpse . It 's closer than I 've gotten in- - Well , I can 't even count the years . And this is the shot that you spoke of . This is ... - what you try and get . - Mm-hmm . Mr. Fellig , I know that you know more about photography than I do , but this is just a lens flare . You 're right . I do know more about photography than you do . Okay , I mean- - For the sake of argument , why bother ? I mean , why- - Why take a picture of Death ? So I can look into his face ... so I can die . Pills don 't work . Razors , gas , bridges- - I can 't tell you how many bridges I 've jumped off of . All I get is wet . I got left behind . I don 't want to be here anymore . I can 't even remember a time when I did . Uh- - This is- - This is all I know to do . You know I don 't believe you . Yes , you do . That 's why you 're here . How is it you know when people are about to die ? Oh . You chase it long enough , you pick it up . Excuse me . - Mulder . Hi . - Mulder , it 's me . Those other two names that you said that Fellig went by- - Strand and Rice ? Yeah . Henry Strand and L.H. Rice . What about Louis Brady ? Uh , no , but there 's a , there 's like a big gap before 1 939 . [ Scully ] Will you check it out for me ? I 'm sticking here to make sure he doesn 't bolt . Louis Brady , Mulder . Tell me what you find out . Mr. Fellig ? Oops . Excuse me . I have film out . Hold on a second . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - Ritter . - Agent Ritter , it 's Agent Mulder . - Is Agent Scully with you ? - No , she 's not , nor do I seem to able to find her . Me neither , and D.C. Cellular says her phone is turned off . - What can I do for you , Agent ? - Well , you can find her for me . Listen , Agent Mulder , I 'm on my way to arrest Alfred Fellig . Good , because that 's where I think she is . And you were right . Fellig is a murderer . Under the name of Louis Brady , he suffocated two patients in a Connecticut hospital . He says he meant to catch up with Death . One year into his prison sentence , he walked off a work detail . The manhunt never officially ceased . - When was this ? - 1 929 . Whoa , whoa , whoa . When ? Look , Ritter , don 't sweat the math . It 's him . Just get there and find Agent Scully . All right . I 'm on it . You know , most people want to live forever . Most people are idiots . Which is one of the reasons I don 't . I think you 're wrong . How can you have too much life ? There 's too much to learn , to experience . Seventy-five years is enough . Take my word for it . You live forever , sooner or later ... you start to think about the big thing you 're missing ... and that everybody else gets to find out about but you . What about love ? What , does that last forever ? Forty years ago , I drove down to the city hall , down to the Hall of Records . Record archives , whatever they call it . I wanted to look up my wife . It ... bothered me I couldn 't remember her name . Love lasts ... seventy-five years , if you 're lucky . You don 't want to be around when it 's gone . Count your blessings . Why are you this way ? I mean , if this is true , give me something in the way of proof . Help me find some science that I can hang this on . It has nothing to do with science . - Someone took my place . - Took your place ? I don 't know her name . I don 't think I ever knew it . I had yellow fever way the hell back then ... when it killed half of New York . Washington Square Park was a common grave , they had so many bodies . They 'd bury them shallow . They wrapped them in yellow sheets , and the yellow sheets would stick up through the mud . I was in a city-run contagion ward . I was out of my head with fever , out of my mind , then I saw him- - saw Death . Wish I would 've had a camera then . At first , I ... just saw him out of the corner of my eye . Then he got bolder and he started flitting around the room , and he 'd take this person and he 'd take that person . And I never saw his face . I didn 't want to see his face . I figured if I saw it , he 'd take me too . - But he didn 't . - No . There was a nurse . She did the best she could . Back then , medical science was- - They couldn 't find their ass with both hands . They still can 't . But she did the best she could . She sat with me . Held my hand . I was on my deathbed , then he came for me . I didn 't look at him . I closed my eyes and turned my head . I didn 't tell her not to look at him . I wanted her to look at him . I wanted her to look at him instead of me . And then I came to and the fever broke . They were carrying her out wrapped up in a yellow sheet . Since that time , I realized you got to be careful what you wish for . I missed my chance . - You 're very lucky , you know that ? - What do you mean ? Wait a minute . Say what 's on your mind . You mean lucky like the others ? You want me to believe that I 'm about to die ? I just want to take the picture . You took my picture . You took my picture last night . Is this why ? - No . That was different . - I 'm not gonna die ! - [ Charging ] - Turn that off . - No . Turn it off right now ! Put it down ! There is nothing to be done for it . You took my phone . Why ? - Please , just give me a chance . - What don 't you want me to know ? He 's coming . He 's coming , and you should just make your peace . Shut up ! [ Door Crashes Open ] - He 's here . - [ Flashbulb Charging ] Agent ? Oh , God . Don 't . No , no , no , no , no . Come on , come on . Damn it ! I 'll get help . We need some help in here ! Do you see him ? Do you see him ? Don 't look . Close your eyes . You 're a lucky man . Coroner 's report came back on Fellig . Says he died of a single gunshot wound . That 's all it said . Well , I , uh , talked to your doctor , and he says you 're doing great . You 're making the fastest recovery he 's ever seen . You know , Mulder , I don 't even know how I entertained the thought . People don 't live forever . No , I-I think he would have . I just think that Death only looks for you ... once you seek its opposite . [ Child ] I made this !

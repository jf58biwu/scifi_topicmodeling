 This is Alpha Zulu . What is your position ? Heavy casualties . I repeat , heavy casualties . We can never escape our past . No matter how hard we run , what we 've been is what we are . Man down ! B - line ! Copter in ! Copter in ! Sometimes that past is a friend . Sometimes , it 's our greatest enemy . It can make us heroes , or hunt us down . I 'm hit ! No ... Leave me here . No ! * * Jim ? It 's 4 : 30 . Oh , I know . I 've , I 've got to get to the site early . We 're demolishing a building . Go back to bed . Okay . You sure you 're all right ? Will you go back to bed ? Okay . What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * * No-no-no-no . You listen to me . I know seafood . Seafood is my life . If I say the calamari 's bad , then it 's bad . Got me ? Hey ! I used to be a spear fisherman . What 's that all about ? Executive action . Well , well , who do you think you 're dealing with ? Some sort of amateur here ? Of course I know what calamari is . It 's squid , right ? And yours stinks . I wouldn 't feed it to my cat . Oh , yeah ? Go ahead and laugh , mister . 'Cause as of today , your contract is officially canceled . Your fish is no longer welcome here . Chuck , that was the biggest seafood supplier in the entire city . Oh , really ? I don 't care . I don 't like his attitude . It 's squid , right ? Look , why don 't you let me call him back ? No , no , no , no , no . At least let me find a new company . No can do , lady . Why not ? Don 't you have a busload of nuns to save or something ? You handle the miracles , I 'll do the fish . Listen to this . " The body of an unidentified man " was found in Lake Michigan today , the apparent victim of random violence . " " Police can provide no motive for the slaying , but refuse to rule out the possibility of robbery . " " A report that the victim 's belongings " were found in a nearby trash can is not confirmed . Fingerprints and dental records are now being examined . " It 's not much to go on . Guns ? No , it 's too messy . You 'd better go to the cops . " Go to the cops . " I go to the cops one more time , they 're going to lock me up , throw away the key . Well , it does sound kind of risky , Gary . Mm-hmm . Well , I 'll just , uh ... just go take a look around . All right . Be careful . Yeah , yeah . Oh , boy ... Don 't worry . It 's easy for you to say . Where am I going to get more calamari ? I knew it . Huh ? She 's not coming , is she ? She sent you instead . Who ? I didn 't know she was married . I swear . It was happy hour in Chinatown . We , we shared a pupu platter . She ordered a mai tai . I had a fog cutter . But I swear to you , it will never happen again . You 've got to believe me . Mister , I , I got no idea what you 're even talking about . You 're not married to Mary Lou Witty ? No , I 'm not married to Mary Lou Witty . I 'm not married to anyone . If I was married ... Mary Lou ? Mary Lou ! Just keep walking , I suppose . That is what I call calamari . That is calamari , isn 't it ? Hey , the best . Is it fresh ? " Fresh " ? If it was any fresher , it 'd bite you in the heinie . Smells a bit fishy . Well , so would you , if you 'd been swimming around in the ocean all your life . Hey , it 's not a room deodorizer , pal . It 's a squid . Yeah , well , look , I run a very high quality seafood restaurant , Mr. Smith ... Look , I 'm ready to talk a deal here . You want to talk quality , talk to my daughter . She was born on a fishing boat . Besides , she has more patience with amateurs than I do . Wait a minute . You know what ? Hey , May ! I don 't have to stand around here and take these kind of insults ! There are a million other place ... Yes ? Hello . On the other hand , uh , name is Fishman . Chuck Fishman . McGinty 's Restaurant , seafood server to the stars . Oh , you don 't want to shake my hand . You don 't know where they 've been today , believe me . I 'm May Smith . You 're Smitty 's daughter ? The one from the fishing boat ? Vietnamese fishing boat . Smitty adopted me after the war . Oh ... So , I hear you 're looking for quality . Yes , and obviously , I 've come to the right place . Excuse me . Uh , I 'm sorry . I 'm with the , uh , city 's pier inspection unit , and , uh , well , I 'm out inspecting the piers . This pier , it , uh , appears unsafe , because the , uh , the pilings are unstable , and , uh ... What I 'm gonna have to do is , if I can just ask you to step off . Why don 't you " step off " ? Well , I 'm the pier inspector and , uh ... Well , you see , if anything happens to you ... That 's my business , isn 't it ? Isn 't it ? Mr. Inspector . Yeah , I guess it is . Hey ! Hey ! Don 't do it ! Are you crazy ? Get off me ! You had no right . You stay out of my life . Mister , I ... I don 't know what 's bothering you ... What do you care ? It 's my life . Okay . Look , I , I , I just ... Look ! Butt ... out ! Period . I just don 't like to see a good life wasted , that 's all . That makes two of us . Look , mister , I , I , I ... I 'm just trying to help , okay ? You think you did me a favor just now , huh ? Well , you think again . Mind your own business . Medal of Honor . They don 't give many of these out . No , they don 't . Highest military honor the country has to give . " For conspicuous gallantry at the risk of one 's own life . " And he threw it away . How do you go from being a Medal of Honor winner to an attempted suicide ? That 's a good question . How do you even know it 's his medal ? Huh ? Guess you could find out at the ceremony . What ceremony ? The ceremony . They 're dedicating some war memorial next week . I read about it in the paper . The real paper - today 's paper . Here , I 'll show you . It 's right here . " Medal of Honor winners to attend ceremony . " That 's Matthews . That 's the guy . That 's his picture . I got an idea . Give me the phone book . Serviceman 's Special . Every Wednesday night . You bring in a medal , you get a free shrimp cocktail . Found him . Watch your step , amigo . Excuse me . Uh , Mrs. Matthews ? Yes ? Uh , is Jim around ? Well , he 's at work . Why ? You a friend of his ? Uh , well , my name 's Gary Hobson , and I met him this morning at the lake . No , you must be mistaken . My husband went to work early this morning . Hey , I guess he took a side trip or something . No , no , Jim wouldn 't do that . What do you want ? I wanted to return this to him . Well , what is this ? That 's his Medal of Honor . I don 't know what kind of game you 're playing , mister , but you don 't have no business here . Mrs. Matthews , I just need to talk to Jim . Excuse me . Mrs. Matthews , I think your husband may be in some sort of trouble . Look , I don 't know who you think you are , but I do know you never spoke to my husband . For your information , my husband doesn 't have a Medal of Honor . Well , yes , ma 'am , he does . I think I 'd know , don 't you ? Well , if you look in the paper , it 's in today 's paper . I have to go . Mrs. Matthews , please ... Mrs. Matthews ... I see you around here again , I call the police . Mrs. Matthews , I need to talk to your husband . This restaurant , it 's only the beginning . No , no . I smell ... the future . And you know what its name is ? Asia . Oh , okay . Do you know there are over 1.3 billion people in China alone ? Now , that is an awful lot of seafood to sell . And they love anything American . Especially Irish-American . Oh . This looks very fresh , by the way . I 've even made inquiries into opening up a McGinty 's out in your neck of the woods - Saigon . Oh , how very impressive . Well , you know , I 'm into the whole visionary kind of thing . You know , long-range planning . Mm-hmm . So when 's this going to happen ? Well , we 're still working out a few of the details , but it should happen very soon . This is the way it 's got to be . You can 't do that . You just raised the rate last quarter . Cost of business , Smitty . You know , inflation . That 's outrageous ! What 's , uh , what 's happening ? It 's nothing . It 's nothing . Yeah , this is a dangerous neighborhood , Smitty . I 'd hate to see anything bad ... Wait a minute . Chuck , please don 't get involved . I 'm already involved . Chuck , please ... You know , uh , something smells a little fishy around here , fellas , and I don 't think it 's me . Is that right ? It 's okay . These fellas are my , uh ... Security service . Yeah , right . Security . Is that a new name for a protection racket ? Chuck ... Who is this ? The name is Fishman . Chuck Fishman . And I 'll have you know that my third cousin Elaine 's husband happens to be very good friends with the nephew of Police Lieutenant Dennis Riley . I don 't think you understand . Security 's our business . Here , there 's my card . Good . Now I know where to find you . Now , why don 't you boys take my advice , and turn around and leave these very nice people alone , huh ? Jeez , I didn 't know we was bothering anybody . Fellas ... No , no . No , we can take a hint . If our company 's not wanted ... Fellas , please , wait a minute . You have a nice day now . Look , I 'm sure we can work something out . Not anymore . Yeah , you see ? You just have to know how to talk to people , huh ? I hope you 're right , mister . Now , Smitty , how about showing me that tuna , huh ? It 's downloading now from the Medal of Honor Web site . It 's in Braille . What 'd you expect ? Norwegian ? Hand it over . Okay . Well , this is just explaining that Matthews ... Wait a minute . What ? It says here that he was a combat engineer in Vietnam . He rescued a soldier while trapped in a tunnel . They were ambushed on the way to the helicopter . While holding off the enemy , Matthews sustained a bullet wound to the chest . He saved the entire rescue party . Well , he 's a survivor . Yeah . So why wouldn 't he want this medal ? Got me . Could be for any one of a hundred reasons . All right , his wife won 't talk to me . I don 't know where he works . I 've got to find him before he tries something again . Now , how am I going to do that ? Maybe his son can help . His son ? Says here he 's a sophomore at Northwestern . Frank Matthews ? Yeah . Hi , Gary Hobson . I 'm with the Sun Times . One of your dorm mates pointed you out to me . Uh-huh . Uh , I 'm doing a story on Medal of Honor winners , and I 'm wondering if I can have a minute and talk to you about your dad ? Yeah . My dad ? He won the medal in ' 69 . What are you talking about ? Well , it 's , uh , it 's in today 's paper . I don 't believe this . You really didn 't know ? Perfect . He 's a war hero and he doesn 't tell me . I mean , I knew he was in Vietnam . I used to ask him about it when I was a kid . You know , back when I had this crazy idea that fathers talked to their sons . What 'd he do ? Well , he pulled several men out from under a heavy fire . He was shot in the chest . He almost died . You had no idea at all ? Well , he was always tough , I 'll give him that . Did , did he ever say anything about this at all ? I have no idea who my father is , mister . I mean , this is a perfect example . How you going to grow up with somebody and not tell them about something like this ? I don 't know . No biggie . I 'm out of that now , anyway . How 's that ? I 'm on full scholarship here , football . I don 't need his money . I don 't need a thing from him . Well ... I 've got to be somewhere . Uh , Frank , is there anywhere you know we can get in touch with your dad ? Our records are kind of out of date . I don 't know , man . Talk to the union . Hey , Frank ? I hope everything works out between the two of you . Hey , don 't bother . There 's nothing to work out . Tango , Bravo . Tango Bravo . Do you read me ? Tango leader , what is your position ? Tango , Bravo . Tango , Bravo . Do you read me ? Tango leader , what is your position ? Roger . We 're at the mouth of the tunnel . I 'm about to go in . Over . MAN Roger that . You be ready when we need you . Stop it ! Stop it ! Hey . Jim . Oh ... Surprised to see me ? Had some down time . Thought I 'd come by and say hi . I called over . They said you never came in to work this morning . What 's going on ? Just wasn 't feeling all that good , you know ? Something to do with this ? A young man came by today . Brought your Medal of Honor . I thought he was crazy . Looks like I 'm the crazy one . I knew they 'd run something . Why didn 't you tell me ? You know , you told me that you were never in combat . You said that scar came from a construction accident . I didn 't think it concerned you . Didn 't concern me ? I 'm your wife . Well , we met after the war ended . So ? You think that makes a difference ? You think it gives you the right to lie to me about your past ? Well , I didn 't lie to you , exactly . I ... Jim ... You going to answer that ? Wait . Go ahead , baby . Answer that . Lake Shore Shipping . Uh , 5 : 00 weekdays . 7 : 00 Saturdays . I 'll check your order . You 're welcome . Jim ? ! Jim ? Hey , where 's your brain bucket ? What ? One of these . Oh , no , I 'm looking for someone - Jim Matthews . The union said he 'd be working here . I 'm looking for him , too . He didn 't show up for work this morning . Matthews is one of my best guys . It 's not like him to miss work , especially without calling . Get that high lift back here ! Get it over here . Him again . I 'll check the schedule again . I could be wrong , but I don 't think so . Matthews ! Hey , Matthews ! Hey , come here . I found this taped to his locker . Loves his family ? Doesn 't deserve his wonderful life ? " I can no longer live with what I 've done . " This sounds like a suicide note . It sure does . And once I left the brokerage firm , there was no turning back . I knew " restauranting " was my life . I 'm my own boss . I make the decisions . If I mess up , I face the consequences . It 's all on me . Wait a minute . I thought you had a partner . Isn 't he involved ? Gary ? Mm-hmm . I love Gary . My best friend . But he 's not exactly the hands-on management type guy . You know what I mean ? Mm-hmm . If we were a basketball team , I would be the point guard . I 'd be calling all the plays , leading the team , And Gary ... And I mean this in the nicest way , Gary would be over on the bench , folding the towels . Now , he 'd do it very well , but that 's where he 'd be . Oh . A team does need towels . Oh , yeah , yeah . So , how 'd you get started in the restaurant business in the first place ? Well , Gary actually took the place over from its former owner . Really ? Mm-hmm . Well , that 's pretty good for folding towels . Of course , then he called me up to manage the place . What choice did he have ? So if it weren 't for Gary , you 'd still be at the brokerage firm ? I don 't know about that . I come from a long line of restauranteurs . Oh , no . Another hundred pounds of ice ! Uh-oh . They slashed our tires ! The security service at work . I knew something like this would happen ! Those punks . I 'll take care of this . Chuck . Chuck ! No , no . You 've got to know how to deal with these people . That 's what you said last time . Obviously , I was too subtle . Now , they 're going to get Fishman unchained . Chuck , please ... Consider it done . I don 't get it . I think it has something to do with this . Medal of Honor ? Most guys wouldn 't keep that secret . What do you think happened ? I don 't know , but whatever it is , it 's catching up to him . I got to find him before it does . How ? Should we tell his wife ? You know where she works ? I think so . Some shipping outfit on Touhy . Lake Shore Shipping , that 's it . Lake Shore Shipping . Hey , you don 't have any idea where he might have gone ? Places he hangs out or ... ? Not really . The guy really kept to himself . All right . Thanks . Hang on a second . You know , a couple of years ago , we 're working an office tower job . He 's welding some beams 28 stories up . The wind kicks up , this guy next to him starts to slip , Matthews reaches down , grabs him by the belt and pulls the guy back . I mean , the guy would 've been a grease spot on the sidewalk if it hadn 't been for Matthews . We tried to thank him . Tried to make a fuss . He wouldn 't let us . He turns around , he goes back to work . He never mentions it again . I don 't get it . I don 't know . Listen , thanks anyway . I don 't understand . What 's wrong with him ? Ms. Matthews , they want to honor him at a memorial service next weekend , and I think that might have something to do with it . Might have set this all off . He was the sweetest man when we first met . Strong . But kind of sad , too , you know . It was after the war . He just moved here from St. Louis . Said he wanted to make a fresh start . Why didn 't he tell me ? Why didn 't he trust me ? Mrs. Matthews , do you have any idea where your husband might be ? No . Wait a minute . There was a message on the machine at home this morning . Here it is . Uh ... someplace called Childwatch . They said he missed his appointment , whatever that means . I was going to go there after work . Childwatch ... I never heard of it before . Here you go , Mrs. Matthews . Mr. Hobson , will he ... We 'll find him . God , I hope so . Thanks . So , for whatever reason , when something goes wrong concerning an international adoption - death , legal troubles , you name it - we step in to help care for the child . If we can 't place them with another family , then they stay here with us . That 's why student teachers and volunteers like Jim are so important to us . Jim 's been doing this for years . You 're a friend of Jim 's ? Uh , yeah , I guess so . Me , too . My name is Madeleine . It 's very nice to meet you , Madeleine . How do you do ? Madeleine and Jim are special friends . He reads to her every Tuesday . Where is he ? Well , I , I don 't know . Is he okay ? Oh , he 's fine . He 's just - well , he can 't uh , he just couldn 't be here today . Finish your homework , Madeleine . Okay . He 's not okay , is he ? No . He , uh ... well , he 's disappeared . I was afraid this might happen . What 's that ? People volunteer here for all sorts of reasons , Mr. Hobson . After a while , you get to recognize the patterns . With Jim , it was guilt . He 's a lovely man . He 's great with the kids . But I don 't think that he believed that . I got the sense he was always trying to make up for something . I tried to talk to him about it once , but he just froze me out . MAN Blue line now arriving . Next stop ... All right , what 's an eight-letter word for expired ? Starts with a " D " ? Try deceased . Which is what you clowns are going to be if you keep bothering my friends . Oh-ho-ho , it 's the tough guy . Hey , it works . Obviously , I didn 't make myself clear to you mamalukes the last time . People need security , tough guy . I 'm warning you . One more thing happens down there , I 'll have the cops on you so fast , your heads 'll be spinning . Oh , right . What was the name of that cop you know ? Dennis Riley . Lieutenant Dennis Riley . Hey , boss , you got a visitor . Dennis ? Long time , Fishman . Well , what I say still goes . I mean it . Stay away from them . Period ! Over and out ! Ten four ! And , Dennis , my family is going to be very disappointed . I 'm losing time . He 's out there somewhere . I 've got to find him . How am I going to do that ? Check the paper . I already checked the paper . Well , check it again . I already checked it . Oh , no . I messed up . I messed up bad . What 'd you do ? Gare , I need your help . Not now , Chuck . Look , my friends are in a lot of trouble . What friends ? May and Smitty . Wait . It 's all my fault . He 's going to do it again . * * You sure he 's here ? I 'm sure . Matthews ! You get back ! You don 't want to do this . You don 't want to throw your life away . What do you know about it ? I know what matters . Your wife . Your son , Madeleine ... You stay out of my life . I can 't do that . I 'm part of your life now . I don 't even know you . How the hell did you find me ? Who the hell are you ? Look , I can 't explain that . But for whatever reason , I did . You get back ! MAN Blue line now arriving . Next stop ... Listen , what happened ? Please talk to me . Why should I tell you ? Because it 's your last chance . You don 't talk to me now , no one 's ever going to know . And that would be a shame . Because you should talk to someone . Uh ... It was a ... it was a rescue operation . One of our guys was stuck in this tunnel complex . He was hurt bad and we , we ... We had to go in and get him . I found him okay . Patched him up , started bringing him out . It was all pretty routine . We were almost at the top when I heard something . Hold it . Go . Go . We had reports of enemy troops all around us . When I saw that light , I expected the worst . My only hope was to hold them back long enough for my platoon to get out of there . I took the only shot I could . And that 's when I realized ... there was only one of them . It was a little girl , maybe 12 years old . Her only weapon was a flashlight . She wasn 't a soldier . She was just a kid . And I had taken her life . We headed back to the landing zone . Half hour later , we got hit . MAN L.T. at Alpha Comm , this is Tango leader . I need medevac support ! It was bad . Medevac support ! We were sitting ducks . They were moving in . Suddenly , I didn 't care - about living or dying . All I wanted was to get out , one way or another . I thought to myself , " I deserve to die . I 'm ready to die . " I killed an innocent kid . No . No ! I wanted them to leave me there . That would have been the best thing . There 's not one day that goes by that I don 't think about that little girl . Then they , uh ... gave me th-that medal . I don 't feel like I ever came home . You couldn 't have known . You were defending yourself . I killed her . Because you wanted to live - that 's not a crime . Tell her that , huh ? Jim , it was a war . You know better than I do what happens , but it was a horrible accident . Killing yourself , what good are you going to ... I can 't live with it anymore ! Can 't you understand that ? ! Listen , it may take more courage than it did to save those men , but you can . No , I can 't . I - I can 't . Look , what you 're doing , you 're only punishing the people that love you , the people that you care about . Ah ... Look , your son needs you . Your wife needs you . If you 're gonna honor the memory of this little girl , you ... you got to do it by living . You can 't do it by dying . Gare ! Gare ! What ? You left the paper in the car . Look at this . What 's happening ? Do you have a car ? Yeah , I 've got a truck down there , but ... This is life and death . Will you help us ? Please . All right . What 's wrong with my car ? Just don 't worry about it . I 'll tell you later . My car works fine . Yeah , that 's great . Don 't worry about it . Come on . It 's locked . Get out of the way ! Careful . Matth - Hey , easy , hey ! Gare ! That 's them . Right there . Those are the guys . You go take care of that . Matthews ! Take care of it . Right . What 's with that idiot ? ! Left ! Go left ! Hey ! Over here ! Right here , sir . These are arsonists . These are arsonists . Get them ! Freeze , right there ! Hold it right there ! Hold it right there ! Don 't move ! Easy . Easy , now . May . Where 's May ? ! I 'll find her . Matthews , wait a second . Hey , wait a minute , Matthews ! Get him out of here . Matthews ... Go ! * * Oh , thank God . You need help ? It 's all right . I got her . Let 's get out of here ! May . Is she gonna be okay ? Take it easy with her . It 's gonna be all right . I - I 'm gonna go with her . Okay . All right . I know it wasn 't easy , but you did it . Welcome home . A little bubbly , my dear ? Veuve Clicquot , the choice of kings and Chuck Fishman . And I think you 'll be pleased to know that in your honor , tonight we are having calamari salad and trout almondine . I know I-I 've only known you a little over a week , but , um ... I can 't take it anymore . I know , I know . You can , you can spare the speech . I 've heard it all before . I know , I 'm ... self-absorbed , conceited , neurotic , a bit pushy , and some might think irritating ... No , that 's not it . What ? There 's more ? I just don 't know what women want . Steak . What ? Prime rib , meatloaf , hamburger . I mean , I 'm up to my elbows in seafood every day , Chuck , and then you 're stuffing it into me every night . I want steak . I 'm sick of calamari . You know , I would like to say something , uh , if it 's all right . Sure . First of all ... thanks . You know , I feel like I 've just come home , but there 's been somebody here all along , and I know it hasn 't been easy . That 's my wife . I 'll never let another chance go by without saying " I love you . " I love you . And to my son , I don 't blame him for not being here . But I 'm proud of the , uh , fine young man he 's , uh , grown up to be . I was never there the way a father should be , but , uh , that 's just because ... I didn 't think I deserved a young man as , uh , fine as he is . You know , I had a nice family and a nice life , and I didn 't , uh ... just didn 't know why . But I do now . Present arms ! There 's all kinds of courage in this crazy life . Not just the John Wayne save-the-world kind . Sometimes you need a ton of courage just to speak your mind , follow your heart . Opening up , telling someone how you really feel , there ought to be a purple heart for that . And then there 's the courage it takes to live with a mistake , go through the worst and start over . There is all kinds of courage out there . Hey , that person standing next to you on the subway car or in the supermarket , take a closer look next time . Who knows ? Might be , you 're standing next to ... a hero .

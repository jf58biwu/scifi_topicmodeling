 Chapter 18 : " Bride of Chaotica . " The evil Dr. Chaotica kidnaps Constance Goodheart and plans to sacrifice her to Arachnia , Queen of the Spider People . Captain Proton travels millions of miles to Planet X , where he will invade the Fortress of Doom . Chaotica fires his fiendish death ray- - certain death for Proton , as his rocket ship bursts into flames . We didn 't burst into flames in the last chapter . Why are these recaps always so inaccurate ? Well , they brought people back to the theaters . Cliffhangers . The lost art of hyperbole . You ready ? Aye , Captain . Let 's get this show on the road . Computer ... begin Chapter 18 . We 're receiving a transmission . It 's Chaotica . lmagizing . Captain Proton ... surrender ! Not a chance . Release Miss Goodheart and we 'll be on our way . I 'm afraid your " secretary " has already been promised to Queen Arachnia as a supreme sacrifice . You 'll never get away with this . Oh , ho-ho-ho ! But I shall ! You escaped from my death ray once , but you won 't survive this ! He 's charging the weapon . Brace for impact . Direct hit ! We lost both engines ! Steering jets are on the fritz ! We 're going down ! The landing gear is jammed ! Hang on ! Opening hatch . Welcome to Planet X. What 's the plan ? This is the part where we defeat Chaotica 's soldiers , steal their uniforms , and make our way through the underground caverns . Hey , I thought you said there were slave girls in this chapter . After we infiltrate the Fortress of Doom , we 'll free Chaotica 's harem . Let 's go . I 'm right behind you . Planet X looks kind of familiar . What was the last place we went to ? The Mines of Mercury . They 're identical . Sets were expensive . At least there 's no erupting volcano this time . Ah , behold the Fortress of Doom . And how are we supposed to get up there ? I told you- - the ... - underground caverns . - Underground caverns . Right . I thought you said there was no volcano . I did . Uh ... Tom . Definitely not Chaotica . Computer , end program . Unable to comply . Holodeck controls are off-line . Paris to Bridge . Bridge , respond . We need to find the manual overrides . There 's an access port on the rocket ship . Come on . Report . We dropped out of warp . We 're at a dead stop . Cause ? Unknown . Engines are operational . I 'm reading gravimetric forces around the ship . They 're disrupting our power flow . Control systems are going off-line . I no longer have access to communications , deflector , weapons ... Scan for vessels , tractor beams ... anything that might explain what 's holding us here . Halt in the name of Chaotica ! Proton ! Buddy of yours ? Surprised ? You thought I perished in the Den of Crocodiles . We don 't have time for this . I survived ... clinging to the thought that I would one day ... Oh ! Oh . I believe I have an explanation . Sensors show that we 've entered a layer of subspace . It 's disrupting our warp field . Do we have impulse ? Yes . Engage at full . No change in our position . Route all available power to the engines . We 're not moving . The impulse reactor is running hot . We 're heading for an overload . Give it all she 's got . Full thrusters . No effect . Reactor 's at critical . Abort . lncrease power to the structural integrity field . We may be here awhile . It 's no use . I can 't disengage the program . Well , you better think of something fast , Proton . A second distortion just appeared . Whatever they are , they 're getting bigger . Hold on . I 've got access to the transporter . I 'm going to try a site-to-site . There 's a third one . I 've run a transpectral analysis . The barrier between normal space and subspace is unstable throughout this region . Basically , we 've run aground on a subspace sandbar . I 've tried realigning the warp field , reversing hull polarity ... Maybe we should just get out and push . The gravimetric forces are disrupting our control systems . As long as we 're trapped here , we won 't have access to the computer core , tactical , holodecks , and all but six replicators . What about those distortions on the holodeck ? What 's the connection ? They appear to be random energy fluctuations . I don 't believe they pose a threat . Let 's keep an eye on them , anyway . And evacuate that deck just to be safe . A few years back , when I was a science officer on the Al-Batani , we tried to navigate a dense protonebula . It stopped us dead in our tracks . For three days , we attempted to force our way out until we realized we were trying too hard . Captain ? Every time we engaged the engines , we were increasing the resistance of the nebula 's particle field . We may be facing a similar situation . Our own warp field may be increasing the gravimetric forces . If we power down the core and use minimal thrusters , we might be able to break free . You took the words right out of my mouth . Your plan could work . Now that we have your blessing ... Let 's give it a try . Halt , in the name of Chaotica ! We intend no harm . Seize them ! Lower the drawbridge . We are bringing prisoners . Yes , yes , yes , Lonzak . What do you want ? Your Majesty . Where 's Proton ? He , uh ... escaped . Fool ! You will pay for your incompetence ! Seize him ! Surrender . But , Majesty ... I have brought prisoners . More Earthlings ? No ! They claim they 're from another dimension . The fifth dimension . Bring them to me . Identify yourself . You insult me ! I am Chaotica , Ruler of the Cosmos ! Kneel before his Majesty ! I said kneel ! You ... have invaded my planet . Why ? To contact other photonic life-forms ... to learn from them . Are you alone or are you the vanguard of an invading army ? We are explorers . I am growing weary of this charade . Your armies will be no match for my space force . We 'll crush you like insects ! They are hostile . This contact should be terminated . Indeed . Lonzak , execute them ! Coward . He 'll learn there 's no escape from Chaotica . Gather my space force . Power the death ray ! At once , Majesty . Take Miss Goodheart to Arachnia . Invite the queen to join me in battle . Together , we will rain destruction on the fifth dimension ! Captain 's Log , supplemental . We 've been spinning our wheels for three days now , and still no progress in breaking free of the subspace layer . Look on the bright side- - there 's only three meals a day . Coffee . Black . Uh , sorry , Captain . We lost two more replicators this morning . Listen to me very carefully , because I 'm only going to say this once . Coffee . Black . Yes , ma 'am . Coffee . Black . While I 've got your attention , there are ... Coffee first . Now , what 's the problem ? It 's a ... it 's a delicate matter . I don 't have time to play 20 questions , Neelix . Replicators aren 't the only systems of convenience off-line . We 've only got four functioning lavatories for a ship of 150 people . I see . Needless to say , lines are beginning to form . If we don 't get unstuck soon , we may have a serious problem on our hands ... uh ... especially with the Bolians . All but three sonic showers are off-line , too . In another couple of days ... I get the idea . Captain to the Bridge . On my way . I 'm going to leave these problems in your capable hands . Yes , ma 'am . Now , I was thinking , if we drew up a schedule ... Whatever it takes . Status . The warp core has been powered down . Thrusters at standby . Okay . Let 's give it a try . Take us out , Tom , nice and slow . We 're moving . Two meters per second . Three meters . Steady . Nine meters . Ten ... lncrease power to the thrusters by 50 percent . We 're approaching the subspace boundary . 25 meters per second . Wait a minute . We 're slowing down . 19 meters per second ... 18 ... Captain , I 'm reading power surges . Source ? Unknown , but they look like weapons signatures . I 'm not reading any other ships in the area . We 've stopped . I 've localized the weapons fire . It 's emanating from within the ship- - Deck 6 , Holodeck 2 . Who 's still on that deck ? No one . No life signs . There 's a program running . It 's Captain Proton . Proton ? Can you shut it down ? Negative . Control system still malfunctioning . Tuvok , get down there and find out what 's happening . Well , join him . Yes , ma 'am . It appears that a battle took place . Believe me , it wasn 't like this when I left . I must have missed a few chapters . Holodeck programs don 't normally run by themselves . No kidding . She 's dead . Who is she ? Constance Goodheart . My secretary . This doesn 't make sense . She isn 't supposed to die . She 's one of the good guys . I 'm sure you two were very close , but she is a holodeck character . A character from 1930s Hollywood . The good guys never get killed . Something 's wrong here . Invaders from the fifth ... dimension . Satan 's robot . Naturally . Queen Arachnia ... is on her way . Invaders from the ... fifth dimension . Give me a hand . If we can repair his vocalizer , he might be able to tell us what 's been going on . Destroy Proton . It looks like ... he burned out a resistor . A what ? That 's a few centuries before deutronic circuitry . I see . How do you propose we repair him ? Well , first of all , we 've got to remove this damaged tube . No problem . Just a few crossed wires . Your knowledge of this technology is most impressive . Oh ... thanks . There . Got it . Intruders ... Intruders ... intrude ... lntruder alert ! Intruder alert ! Tell us what happened . Invaders from the fifth dimension ! Invaders from the fifth dimension ! Hey , calm down ! How did these invaders get here ? A portal . The fifth dimension ... There 's not supposed to be alien invaders in this story . That 's in " Captain Proton Versus the Cosmic Creature . " Invaders from the fifth dimension ! Those subspace distortions . Take us to this ... portal . There . Photonic charges- - the same signatures as the weapons fire we detected . The fifth dimension ! We must report this to the Captain . Wait. I want to check my rocket ship first . Excuse me ? It 's got sensors . Sort of . Maybe they can tell us something Voyager 's sensors can 't . I 've established a visual link with the holodeck . The attack appears to be originating from subspace . Can you tell where it 's coming from ? No . What was that ? Chaotica 's death ray . Excuse me ? Let 's see if we can get a look inside his fortress , find out what he 's up to . Full power to the death ray ! Arachnia , Queen of the Spider People ... you have not responded to my summons . Don 't ... I don 't get it . Chaotica was supposed to be fighting Earth in this chapter . Apparently , he 's found a new enemy . The fifth dimension . It seems your infantile scenario now poses a security risk . It was just supposed to be a little harmless entertainment . Entertainment- - another frivolous human endeavor . These are your sensor readings ? Telegram . It 's a message to Captain Proton from the President of Earth . " intercepted communications " between Dr. Chaotica and Arachnia . Stop . " Chaotica at war with aliens from fifth dimension . Stop . Must strike now to disable death ray . " Stop . Please summarize the message . Well , it looks like ... Chaotica has captured a couple of aliens from the fifth dimension . An alternate universe . Could be . Maybe they wandered into the holodeck through one of those distortions . To participate in a game ? Intruder ! I assume there 's no locking mechanism on the hatch . It was a simpler time . is he part of the program ? I don 't recognize him . Invaders ! lnv ... Quiet ! Invaders . Look , there 's been a misunderstanding . I 'm Ensign Paris from the Starship Voyager . This is Lieutenant Tuvok . You have killed 53 of my people . We haven 't killed anyone ... Ensign . Everything you see here is a simulation . None of it 's real . Simulation ? A photonically-based projection . All life is photonic . We are not . We are biochemical life-forms . I 'm not familiar with biochemical . We are carbon-based . We live aboard a starship . I believe we have become trapped in a region of space that intersects your own . We 've detected no starship ... only this planet . This planet isn 't real . As I told you , it 's part of a simulation . Maybe we can help you adjust your sensors . You don 't register as a life-form . You are the illusion . We 're as real as you are . Listen ... Citizen of the fifth dimension , you will be destroyed . Wait ! Wait ! Damage . Damage . Require maintenance . Help . Help . Help . Let me get this straight . Transdimensional aliens have mistaken your Captain Proton simulation for reality . Yes , ma 'am . And now an armed conflict has broken out between these aliens and Chaotica 's holographic army . Yes , ma 'am . His Army of Evil . And will someone please explain why we haven 't simply shut down the holodeck ? We 've tried . The controls are still off-line . We 're going to have to get through to these aliens somehow and explain that they 're fighting shadows . We 've tried , but they don 't believe us . They think that we 're not real . They can 't detect Voyager , so every time they scan us , we seem as artificial to them as holographic characters do to us . That explains why they haven 't answered our hails . The Doctor is photonic . He may be able to persuade them . It 's worth a try . Brief him . In the meantime , I think we should let the program play out . You 're not suggesting we wait until this Chaotica defeats the aliens ? No , no. I 'm suggesting that we help the aliens to defeat Chaotica . They think that he 's leading some kind of hostile invasion force . Once that threat is gone , it 's a good bet that they will leave and close up their portals . How do you propose to defeat Chaotica ? Well , he 's been attacking the aliens with his death ray . It 's a shame we don 't have one . No . Forget about what it 's called , Tuvok . In the world of Captain Proton , it 's the most powerful weapon that there is and because it 's photonic , it 's lethal to these aliens . Now , in Chapter 18 , Captain Proton disables this weapon just before Chaotica can use it to destroy Earth . And you think that Proton , namely you of course , could still do that ? Well , we 'd have to knock out the lightning shield first . A force field . Yeah . Now you 're catching on . The destructo beam on my rocket ship can disable the death ray , but only if someone gets inside the Fortress of Doom and can shut down the lightning shield . And who 's supposed to do that ? Arachnia , Queen of the Spider People . Charming . Chaotica thinks so . In the story , he 's in love with her . He 's been trying to form an alliance since Chapter Three . She 's the only one that he trusts , the only one who can get close enough to disable the lightning shield . Somebody is going to have to take on her character . Who 'd you have in mind ? Oh , no . It 's the role of a lifetime . Captain , need I remind you that we have exhausted all other possibilities of escaping this layer of subspace . Until we can eliminate those distortions , we 're trapped . Think of it as Starfleet 's first encounter with Planet X. Thanks . Captain , it won 't be so bad . I can explain to you what you can expect . I can tell you ... All right , all right ! I 'm a size four . What 's the emergency ? I 've been enlisted . I 'm supposed to make contact with our photonic friends from the fifth dimension and convince them to call off their attack . Congratulations . Why do you need me ? It 's an undercover mission . I 'll need a bit of cosmetic surgery . These are the parameters for my new costume . What are you going as- - the Emperor of the Universe ? Well , I 've been forced to scale back my role in the interest of credibility . I 'll be President of Earth . I must say , the idea of an entire universe populated by photonic beings is rather appealing . Well , if your mission fails , you could be taking up permanent residence . Kim to Sick Bay . Report to Holodeck 2 , Doctor . You 're all set . The new parameters will activate as soon as you enter the holodeck . Thank you . Break a leg . So all I have to do is find the controls of this death ray and deactivate it . Well , it 's not as simple as it sounds . Now , Chaotica might be a 1930s villain , but he 's very clever . It 'd help if you knew some of the rules . I 'm listening . All right . Well ... first of all , he 's a megalomaniac , so it 's a good idea to appeal to his ego . Right . And , um , use grandiose language . He likes to be called " Sire , " and it helps to say things like " The clever fiendishness of your evil plan is brilliant . " Deck 4 . Now , remember : It 's ray gun , not phaser , um , imagizer , not viewscreen , Earthlings , not Terrans . Got it . And another thing ... these villains always have a trick up their sleeve- - trapdoors , secret weapons ... lt 's the holodeck . I can 't be hurt by weapons . Well , that doesn 't mean that you can 't be restrained or thrown into the Dungeon of Pain . Noted . Now , as soon as you get the death ray shut down , call me in my rocket ship and give me the signal to fire . You 'll have to use Chaotica 's broadcast microphone . This is how you 've been spending your free time ? Well , I 've been studying how past generations viewed the future . And ... ? Well , it didn 't work out quite as black-and-white as they imagined . Now , the specifications for Arachnia 's costume . One more thing ... if you have trouble with Chaotica or you can 't get to the death ray , you can always uncork the pheromones . I beg your pardon . Uh , Chapter 16 . " Spell of the Spider . " Arachnia sends Chaotica a vial of her irresistible potion . Now , whenever he gets a whiff , he 's under her spell . I get the picture . Yeah , well , my point is , is that these pheromones seem to throw Chaotica for a loop . Well , it worked in Chapter 16 anyway . Now , the vial is sitting on a small pedestal next to the throne . I 'll keep an eye out . Okay . Thanks for the briefing . I 'll see you at the Fortress of Doom . And remember- - you 're the queen . Sire ! Three more of our space ships have been destroyed . Full power to the death ray . Citizens of the fifth dimension , your feeble attacks are nothing but pinpricks to me . Surrender now and I will be merciful . We 're receiving a transmission . They are surrendering . No . It 's Queen Arachnia . She wishes to cross the drawbridge . Ah ... What are you waiting for ? Show her in . I present her Royal Highness ... Arachnia . Ah ... At last ... At last ... my queen . This is an historic occasion . Kindred souls meet at last . It 's an honor to be in your presence , Majesty . I 've always admired your ... clever fiendishness . Ah , your taste is exceeded only by your beauty . This must be your death ray . That , my dear , is the Cradle of Persuasion . It 's fully equipped- - a brain probe , pain modulator . Impressive . It 's good you have the lightning shield to protect your equipment . Yes , as long as it 's electrified , I am invincible ! But my greatest achievement is there . Behold- - the death ray . Oh , it looks like a ... formidable weapon . The most powerful in the cosmos . There is so much more I want to show you . My throne , for example . The seat ... of my Empire . Ah ! I see you 've kept my pheromones . I didn 't realize you were the sentimental type . Your perfume inspires me . Would you mind ? Please . Somehow I feel comfortable here . Join me ... and you will have your own chair- - one adorned with the most precious jewels and the softest silk . Your Majesty seems overly concerned with romantic matters when there 's a battle to be won . That is why you asked me here . Of course , my dear . Forgive me . It 's just that the air itself seems to vibrate in your presence . We can 't be slaves to our passion ... not when your Empire is threatened . I have assembled my fleet of ... Spider Ships . However , the lightning shield prevents them from approaching your fortress . We 'll send them directly into battle alongside my space force . My soldiers wish to pay homage to you . Gratifying . Of course , if I lower the shield , my fortress will be defenseless . Even an ally might choose such a moment to seize my throne . You don 't trust me . There is a way you could convince me of your loyalty . Oh ? I 'll lower my lightning shield , but first , you must become my queen ! Gather my courtiers ! Prepare for the ceremony ! And don 't forget to deactivate the lightning shield so my subjects may witness the blessed event . Very well . Do as she says , once her guests have arrived . Yes , Sire . And so , my dear ... the day you have always dreamed of has arrived ... the day you become Bride of Chaotica ! Welcome . You are photonic . Guilty as charged . You signaled me across the threshold . How ? I believe you dropped your calling card . I return it to you ... as a sign of good faith . Identify yourself . I am the President of Earth . Earth ? A planet some distance from here . I 've come on a mission of peace . Elaborate . Your people and the people of Earth have a common enemy . Chaotica . The one and only . He threatens to invade our realm , destroy our people . Join the club . Chaotica has designs on Earth , too , but we 've withstood countless attacks all thanks to one man- - Captain Proton . Captain Proton ? Defender of the Universe , Scourge of intergalactic Evil and ... a competent medic to boot , but don 't say I said so . Even as we speak , he 's preparing to destroy Chaotica 's death ray , but he needs your help . Explain . Your weapons pose a threat to Proton 's rocket ship . You must cease firing while he mounts his attack . Once Chaotica 's death ray is destroyed , you can return to your realm , confident that you 'll never hear from him again . Captain Proton ... may proceed . On behalf of the citizens of Earth , I thank you . Space drive . - Check . - Check . Destructo beam . - Check . - Check . If I could access holodeck controls , the first thing I 'd do is delete this guy . Delete this guy . As a matter of fact , as soon as this is all over , I think I 'm going to delete the whole program ! What about your historical study ? Class dismissed . No more robots , no more mad scientists , no more death rays . I am retiring my rocket pack , Harry . Someone else can save the universe from now on . The final chapter , huh ? The end . Isn 't anyone going to sing " Hail to the Chief " ? Mr. President , how 'd it go ? My performance was unimpeachable . He agreed ? Let 's just say I 'm considering running for office when we get back to Earth . All right , then . Let 's get this thing in the air and hope Captain Janeway is giving a command performance . Queen Arachnia . Don 't tell me ... my wedding ring . Doctor Chaotica 's wedding ring . You will present it to him at the end of the ceremony . Your Majesty , perhaps we should lower the lightning shield in anticipation of my guests . Why this preoccupation with the shield ? Oh , forgive me . It 's just that , as a fellow ruler of the cosmos , I often have to do things myself . Ah . Because of the incompetence of your inferiors , no doubt . Something like that . Oh , Arachnia , my love , my life ... how well you understand our plight . If it weren 't beneath my dignity , I ... I would weep . How I 've longed for someone who would understand . We have a saying on Arachnia : " lt 's lonely at the top . " Hmm . No longer , my dear . Majesty ! Proton is preparing to attack . Wha ... ? Ah ! Target his rocket ship . You have betrayed me . You are in league with Proton . Impetuous harlot ! Tell me how to deactivate the lightning shield or I 'll show you just how impetuous I can be . What are you waiting for , you great lummox ? Kill her ! Ha ! You 're no match for Arachnia . Now , tell me how to shut down the shield . The confinement rings ! Oh , don 't worry . I wouldn 't kill my bride ... not until after our wedding night . Reactivate the death ray . Destroy Proton ! We 've been hit . Well , I guess the Captain ran into some trouble . We 're not going down without a fight . Doc , activate the destructo beam . The what ? The big button in the middle of that panel . - Oh . - Destructo beam ! The other panel ! Destructo beam activated . We just dropped out of range . We 're losing altitude . Report . The alien weapons fire is increasing . It 's causing the distortions to grow larger . We 're being pulled deeper into subspace . Invaders ! Invaders ! Uh ... incoming . Proton 's ship is damaged , but still airborne . Not for long . Fire at will . Lonzak . Man the lightning shield . Arachnia ? Lonzak . Quickly , Lonzak . No time for dawdling . Your beauty is maddening . Entangle me in your web . Let me out of here and I 'll do all that ... and more . At once , my queen . What ... ? Back to your station ! Idiot ! Deactivate the shield ... now . Such passion . Such strength . Together , we could conquer the universe . End this madness and you may yet live to be my bride . The shield . I don 't know how to tell you this ... but the wedding 's off . Arachnia to Proton . Arachnia to Proton . Do you read me ? Arachnia to Proton . I 'm reading you . The lightning shield is down . Acknowledged . Harry , target the death ray . Doc , fire the destructo beam on my mark . Ready ? Now ! The distortions are closing . We 're realigning with normal space . Helm ... full impulse . Bridge to Janeway . Go ahead . The aliens have retreated and they 've closed the distortions . We 've cleared the subspace layer . Secure all systems and organize damage repair teams . Understood . We 're preparing to shut down the holodeck . Chakotay , give me a minute . I was about to say , " Captain Proton to the rescue , " but I see you have everything under control . I 'm the queen , remember ? Arachnia . Death , as you know it , has no hold on me . My defeat is but a temporary setback . I shall return to seek my revenge . He doesn 't give up , does he ? They never do . Our love was not meant to be , my queen , but be warned . You have not seen the last of ... Chaotica . The end of a twisted madman . And you 're going to miss him . A little .

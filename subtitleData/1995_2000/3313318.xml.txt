 Evan ! Evan ! Where are you ? Evan ! Evan ! Evan ! Evan , hurry , please ! Nothing 's coming out ! Again , our lead story . Tropical storm Leroy has been upgraded to Hurricane Leroy . The entire Gulf Coast ... Damn it . Mom , is Dad gonna be all right ? Mom ! What about Dad ? Mom , what about Dad ? We need water , Evan , right now ! - Mom ! - Just do as I say , Evan ! Come help me . Help me pull the washer out . - Please , Evan , just help me . - Mom , Reggie 's back here . Evan , let the cat alone . Okay , unplug the machine , honey . Unplug the machine . Pull that hose out of the wall . I 'm gonna pull . I need you to get behind the machine and push . All right , I 'm gonna pull . I want you to push . We 're gonna tip the washing machine over . We need to dump the water out . All right , honey , push ! Push ! Push , Evan ! - Push , Evan ! Are you pushing ? Evan ! Evan , answer me ! Evan ? Mom ! - Mom ! - Evan ? Let him go ! Let go of him ! Let go of him ! Let him go ! Oh , God . Let him go ! - Hi , this is Fox Mulder . - Leave me a message after the beep . Agent Mulder , this is Arthur Dales calling from Florida . I don 't know if you 're watching the news . We 're in for a hell of a blow ... in the next 12 to 24 . I 've been through hurricanes . Been through the alphabet . But I just got a distress call from my neighbor down the road ... to set my teeth on edge . You don 't have much time to get to the airport , but if you 're the X-Files man you say you are , you 'd better get your butt in gear . An emergency response team is advising residents ... to stay off the roads and either wait out the storm in a secure location ... or proceed to a county emergency shelter . Hurricane Leroy remains some 20 miles off the Gulf Coast , sending high winds and up to six inches of rain ... onto coastal communities . As of yet , it has unleashed none of its potential heavy destruction ... on a very nervous populace from Naples to Fort Myers . The National Weather Service predicts Hurricane Leroy will make landfall ... in the next three to four hours . - We 'll be coming back in a few minutes ... We got no sign of anything amiss at the residence out on the spit . The place is all boarded up tight . Over . Roger that . Maybe the occupants have evacuated . Over . Well , that would be the Shipleys , but a neighbor says they couldn 't have gone far without their only vehicle ... which is still in the carport out here . Over . Well , that sounds like a real mystery , don 't it ? It sure does , you dumb fathead ! Well , it couldn 't be that all the planes out were fully loaded , huh ? Mr. Dales , there 's a reason that people don 't head out into hurricanes . Yeah , the hurricane 's 20 miles offshore . Mr. Dales , can we come in ? Come in ! - Who 's this ? - Special Agent Dana Scully . - Scully ? - She 's my partner . Don 't get too comfortable . You 're gonna want to get right back out there . Out where ? Did you tell her what I told you ? Yes , but she 's ... she 's not the type that 's easily persuaded . Is that so ? What he means is I don 't hear a story about a sea monster ... and automatically assume it 's the Lord 's gospel truth . Why did you bring her here ? She knows your reputation , your early work on the X-Files . And she has a knack for getting to the bottom of things . Apparently , so does Mr. Dales . It 's a good thing I have a reputation , otherwise how could it be impugned ? Look , Mr. Dales , I 'm sure that there is good reason for your alarm . I listened to the message that you left for Agent Mulder about your friends . Shipleys , a young couple with their son . Lives out on the end of the sandspit . Sara called me in a panic . She said that some thing in the house ... had grabbed Jack , her husband . - In the bathroom , you said ? - Yeah , of all places . It was your description that caused Agent Scully 's ... dubiousness . No , not my description . No , that was Sara 's . She said ... that it had tentacles ... wrapped around her husband 's neck and choking him . And you have no reason to doubt Ms. Shipley 's report ? No , both she and ' Jack are marine biologists . Or at least they were . I fear the worst . She 's missing too ? Uh-huh . Yeah . I got on the horn to the local constabulary , but they 're about as helpful as a fart in a windstorm . I would have gone out there myself but for my bad hip . It 's not a night that anybody should be out in . I don 't see that there 's a choice . If anyone wants to get to the bottom of all this . What is it that brought you out here in the first place , Mr. Dales ? I came down for the weather . Don 't sneer at the mysteries of the deep , young lady . The bottom of the ocean ... is as deep and dark ... as the imagination . Hello ? Mrs. Shipley ? It looks like they had the time and the presence of mind ... to prepare for the hurricane . Had the place all boarded up . It 's from the inside . It makes you wonder how they got out . Hello ? Mrs. Shipley ? Mulder ? No sign of life . There 's , uh , something on the drainpipe . I can 't get it off . I don 't know if I 'm gonna need my gun or a harpoon here . - Whoa ! How the hell did the cat get in the washing machine ? Maybe he was taking a dip after he finished boarding up the windows . What do you think this leads to ? To the bathroom . Dales told me the wife told him that the husband ... was grabbed from the bathroom . - Mrs. Shipley ? - Can you give me a hand with this ? Well , howdy do . Yeah , right like that . Keep your hands up there where I can see ' em . Who are you , and what the hell do you think you 're doing ? - Yeah , nice and slow . - You can put the gun down . We 're F.B.I. Don 't all the nuts roll downhill to Florida ? Sir , we 're Agents Scully and Mulder . I can show you my badge ... This is Deputy Greer . I 'm out at the Sandspit Road . I 've got two suspects over at the Shipley residence . " B " and " E , " possible foul play . We 're out here like you . - No backup units available . - Roger that . - I 'm putting you under arrest . - We 're looking for the Shipleys too . - You have the right to remain silent . - Arthur Dales called us . Anything you say can be used against you . You have a right to a lawyer . - If you don 't have one ... - Does that name mean anything to you ? - I know Dales . - All right . I got a call from him too . Drunk as a skunk . What 's new ? What else would we be doing out here on a night like this ? You could be looters . For all I know , you could be part of the Manson family . Oh , no . You 're gonna kill me . No , I 'm not , but I 'd like to . Deputy ? It 's the F.B.I. , for real ? I 'll be in the car . - I gotta at least make out a report . - No , no . Not before you help me finish what you interrupted . Yes , sir . May I have my gun , please ? Thank you . Come on . Yeah . No , thank you . No one in the bathroom . The deputy helped me pull off the plywood . There 's no sign of anything , except more of that slime in the bathtub ... and maybe three inches of water on the floor . It 's like somebody left the taps running before they boarded up the door . Great . They 're threatening to close the airport . We 'd better get out of here . Aren 't you even curious what happened to these people ? Yes , I 'm curious , Mulder , but I 'm also suspicious . I-I think that Mr. Dales 's story is fueled by more than his imagination ... and not much deeper than the bottom of a highball . Don 't dismiss him so easily . He discovered the X-Files 40 years ago . He 's seen things that I 've only read about . Because sea monsters can only be read about . Because they don 't exist . If the sea is where life began , where our ancestors first walked ashore , then who 's to say what new life may be developing ... in its uncharted depths ? You know what ? Maybe you are a member of the Manson family . Mulder , look . There is nothing more for us to do here . There 's nothing that local law enforcement can 't do for us . These people are missing , there 's nowhere else to look . I 've done my duty for Mr. Dales , for my conscience . I mean , haven 't you ? Well , we should at least tell him we 're giving up . Shouldn 't we ? Sea monsters . F.B.I. agents . I 'm the one who could use a drink . Howdy do , folks . You 're gonna have to turn around , find someplace dry to spend the night . - What 's the problem ? - The road 's washed out up ahead . - This is an emergency . - I understand , ma 'am . But unless your car has wings , there 's no gettin ' through on this road . What about the airport ? Is there an alternate route ? Airport ? Not tonight . This hurricane 's really bearing 'down . We got trees , power lines down all over . You folks really shouldn 't be out here . I want you to drive to the first safe place you can find , understand ? Sir , it 's important that we evacuate the area . We 're F.B.I. agents . We need to get to where we 're going . Don 't all the nuts roll downhill to Florida ? - I 'll be happy to show you my I.D. - Thank you , sir . I appreciate the concern . - Mulder ! - That was one " howdy do " over the line . Car 54 , please report back to base . Yeah , this is car 54 . I 'm over at Nance Road . Over . We 're askin 'all mobile units to stay off the roads ... due to extreme weather conditions for the next three to four hours , includin 'a flash flood warning now in effect for Collier County . Over . 10-4 . Gonna make a quick stop in at the Breakers Condo complex . Looks like some folks are stranded without power . Over . Deputy Greer , County Sheriff ! - Lf you 're home , please answer the door ! If you can hear me , but you can 't answer the door , call 9-1-1 , tell 'em you need help . Hello ! - Deputy Greer , County Sheriff ! If you 're home , answer the door ! If you can hear me , but can 't answer the door , call 9-1-1 , tell 'em you need help ! - Hello ? Hello . Is somebody here ? Sir ? Ma 'am ? My God . - Hello ? - The good thing about zero visibility ? It can 't get any worse . Is this the Collier County Sheriff ? Yes . No , hi . We 're ... We 're driving on , uh ... Nance Road . N-A-N-C-E Road . Nance Road . No , it isn 't very smart , is it ? No ... Yes , that would be much appreciated . He 's going to guide us to the nearest emergency shelter . Not a moment too soon . Hello ? Hello ... No service . You know , Scully , someday ... we 're gonna look back on this and we 're gonna laugh . Just think of it as man pitted against the forces of nature . - Think of it as a test of our mettle . - I don 't need my mettle tested . - What was that ? - I think that was a tree branch . - The debris is starting to fly . - Mulder , we have to pull over . We have to wait out this storm somewhere away from the trees . We 're not gonna dodge trees in a parked car . If we 're driving , we 're a moving target . We don 't know where we are , and we don 't know where we 're going . There 's somebody I think is about to give us directions . Who says there 's never a cop when you need one ? - Mulder , isn 't that ... - Forrest Gump . Deputy ? Hello ! Anybody ... Mulder , he 's in here . Can you talk to me ? You having trouble breathing ? This man needs a trach , or he 's going to die real soon . I 've heard of passing the time . Ouch . Okay . All right , I need you to hold his head real steady . Deputy , just try and relax . Okay . Here we go . Looks like he was attacked or stung . - What are those ? - I don 't know , but he 's ... having a reaction which is affecting his autonomic response . Whatever it was , I think it came through the plumbing , the toilet . All I know is we have to get a medevac unit out here as soon as possible . If it 's in the plumbing , I gotta make sure nobody else is in this building . This is Special Agent Dana Scully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation . I need a medevac unit out here A.S.A.P. I have an officer in need of emergency medical assistance . Please state your name again , ma 'am . - Dana Scully . I 'm a medical doctor . - Scully ! Requesting a medevac unit for a sheriff 's deputy who is injured . You have a deputy down ? I have a deputy who 's been attacked by something unidentified . - Unidentified ? My ass . - What is his condition ? His vitals are weak and he 's in shock . I need him taken to a hospital right away . Excuse me , sir . Is everything okay in your apartment ? Uh , yeah , yeah . It 's all good . You need some help ... with your television ? - I thought I heard voices . Thank God . We didn 't think anybody was coming . Are you the doctors ? - No . Do you need medical help ? - Yeah . We called 9-1-1 , but no one came . Everyone else is already evacuated , but we don 't have a car . - Then the phone died . - Who 's " we " ? Who are you talking about ? Uh , my-my wife and I. She 's pregnant , a week past her due date . My God . I hope one of you has a car . - You don 't know this man , Mr ... - Uh , Suarez . Walter Suarez . Uh , no . - He 's not with you ? - I 'll put it back . Yeah . Everything in your pockets too . She 's right over here . Right this way . Angela , this is Mr. , um ... Mulder . Stay there , Mrs. Suarez . We 're gonna make sure your baby makes it safely into the world . Thank you , but I 'm not in labor . And my name is not Suarez . It 's Villareal . He tells people I 'm his wife , like he 's so macho . Uh , Walter , Angela , I 'm gonna have to ask you to come downstairs with me . Why , you got a car ? Oh , Walter here doesn 't have a car , not to mention a job . Right now I just want to get you someplace where I know you 'll be safe . - From what ? - I don 't know . But whatever it is , it may have seriously injured a sheriff s deputy . - Who ? Where ? - In the manager 's apartment . - It could be in the plumbing right now . - In the plumbing ? Oh , that 's great . I have to go to the bathroom about every ten seconds . - Kid 's gonna be a fighter . Anybody else in the complex that you know about ? - No one . Oh , there 's George . - George ? Yeah , George Vincent . He lives on the first floor . I went and asked him for help , but he just yells , " Go away ! " - He never listens to no one . - He 's gonna wanna listen to me . - Walter ! - Better go . That 's for you . Mr. Vincent ! George Vincent . Quit bangin ' on the damn door ! I 'm a federal agent . I 'm asking you to open the door . Ask away , then go away ! Mr. Vincent , your life may be in danger if you refuse to leave your apartment . You may be in danger if you refuse to quit harassing me ! - I 'm armed , and I 'm within my rights . - That 's great . But you may not be armed for what it is I 'm talking about . What the hell are you talkin ' about , hmm ? It don 't matter . I 'm armed against it . The junta , Cuba and Castro . I 'm not gonna cede my home to no revolutionaries without a fight . You got anything else you want to throw at me ? Bring it on . All the nuts roll down to Florida . He 's had some kind of foreign organism released into his body . - His condition 's worsening . - I can see that . - What the hell was chewing on his neck ? - I don 't know . It may have been some kind of a waterborne parasite . You see that ? You see what happens when you live in a dump ? - Where 's Harry ? - I 'm sorry . I don 't know who Harry is . The slumlord who owns this place . - He may have evacuated . - Harry ? Right . And I 'm giving birth to the Christ child . Harry 's legs hardly work . He 's gotta use those crutches . He don 't have no car . Nobody likes him ' cause he never lifts a finger on this rat trap . - Scully , can I talk to you for a second ? - Yeah . - Now , who are you ? - Nobody . Nobody ? It is so nice to be surrounded by so many great men . - We gotta get out of here soon . - We can 't . We can put the deputy in his car and take him to the hospital . I just got off the radio . They won 't even chance sending a rescue vehicle at this time . The roads are impassable , and I don 't even know if the deputy is movable . - You mean we 're stuck here ? - It looks that way . At least until the weather breaks . Federal agents ! Federal fascists ! Better not tramp on the rights of the common man . No need for them . Sure . Violence in pursuit of freedom is no vice . I don 't think these wounds are bites or stings . There 's something in here , Mulder , right under the skin . Tongs . Mulder , what 's his temperature ? Either he 's got no temperature , or he 's about to spontaneously combust . You 're not far off . It 's 106 . Okay , somebody fill the tub with cold water ... and find as much ice as they can in the freezer . But that thing is in the plumbing . Unless we get his temperature down , he 's not gonna survive this . Now , get moving . I need a container . Mulder , lift him up . We have to get him into the tub . - Mr. Vincent ? Drop your weapon ! Put it down ! It 's gonna take a whole lot more than this to kill whatever it is I just saw . I don 't know what the hell it was , but it came down out of there . You didn 't see it ? I caught it out of the corner of my eye , but it swooped down at me . All that happened here is a sewage pipe burst . No , this thing came at me . That looks like the four-inch tie-in to the second floor . Whatever it is didn 't just rip through the ceiling . - It went right through the pipe . - Where did it go ? I don 't know . Must still be in the building . - Probably in the outflow system . - Maybe it 'll just flow back out . Maybe it 'll come up through the can and grab you by the nugs . Someone 's already got him by the nugs . Look , whatever this thing is , there 's no evidence yet that it 's gonna kill anybody . What about the man in the bathtub ? The man in the bathtub may very well be saved if he can last out this storm . In fact , we may all be safe if we just remain calm . Remain calm ? I gotta pee so bad , my back teeth are swimming . Victory . - How is he ? - He-He 's good . Super tanker coming through . Angela , you can 't go in there . My bladder is pressing against your unborn child , Walter . He 's gonna have a head like a tortilla . This thing is in the plumbing ! The volume alone could push it right back out to sea . Scully , that 's how this thing is here . The hurricane is sitting offshore dredging up God knows what . This thing must have been driven into the city 's reclamation system ... through some offshore outfall pipe . From there it gained access to the sewer pipes in this building . - We 'll be waiting for you out here . - Thank you ! Mulder , nothing here convinces me ... I know you probably can 't hear me , but no listening anyway , okay ? Scully , something welled up out of the uncharted depths of the ocean , something that has been lying there undiscovered for ages probably . There is no evidence of any creature here . Those organisms might just simply be waterborne parasites . But something from Jules Verne they are not . I saw it ! I saw it ! It 's in the tub with the deputy . It has giant arms like an octopus . Mulder ? - What the hell is it ? - He 's gone . - It 's gone ? - No . He 's gone . The deputy . - Where did he go ? - The deputy went out with the bathwater . You mean he was in there with it ? - No , I don 't think he was . - She said she saw it . I 'm sure she did . Look , Scully . I think I know why nobody 's ever seen this thing before . It just doesn 't live in water . It is water , taking shape when it attacks , like it did when the hurricane backed seawater into the plumbing , virtually unseeable until then . Mulder , if that were true , then this wouldn 't be visible , would it ? I mean , what this is showing us is that water actually attempts to kill it . Maybe you just impeded its reproductive process . It needs time to complete its cycle , like it had with the Shipleys . The Shipleys weren 't even in their house . They were when they were attacked , just like the deputy was here . Using their bodies to lay its own spawn . Using the body 's water content to reproduce itself , to make itself a new . - He turned into one of those things ? - They 're more of them ? - We gotta get out of here . - We 're in the middle of a hurricane . - We gotta get to another building . - We can 't . There 's no way we can transport everybody . Use the deputy 's prowler . How many people ? We got two , four ... Son of a bitch . The looter ? - Mulder ? - Yeah ? Mulder , if we 're gonna leave , we should leave now . Mulder ? Hey , Mulder , are you okay ? Hey , wait a second . What are you doing ? - I am saving our lives . - That 's my partner out there ! - He should have listened to you . - You can 't leave him there ! - I 'm not letting him in here . - He 's gonna die ! - What are you gonna do for him ? - I can at least keep him breathing . - You couldn 't save the deputy . - Let me try . I 'm a medical doctor . That 's good , because my water just broke . - You 're going to be okay . Yeah , that 's easy for you to say . Isn 't much of a choice , really , is it ? We 're gonna need water . If I 'm gonna deliver this baby , you can put that gun down . - How do we know you 're really a doctor ? - You don 't . The truth is , I 've never delivered a baby before , so stand back or make yourself useful , but stay out of my way . - Long , even breaths . You got it . Breathe . Breathe . Okay , Angela , I 'm gonna need you to push , okay ? I need you to help me help you . - Okay , so let 's push . You got it . You got it . You 're on the right track . I need some towels , please . I need some towels , damn it . You 're doing good . You 're doing good . Okay . You 're doing good . Okay . Let 's go . - Okay , push ! - I can feel it up there ! - She can feel it up there ! Yeah , okay . Come on . Push ! Good . You got it . Okay . - Here it comes . - Here it comes ! Here it comes . It 's coming ! Okay . Hey , lady , what are you doing ? - It 's the water . - What ? - It 's the water ! - I 'm having it ! - I 'm having it ! I 'm having it ! - Okay ! Okay ! - I 'm having it ! - Push ! I 'm having it ! Hurry . Push . Push ! - Okay ! - Okay , pick up the gun . Pick up the gun ! Shoot out the sprinklers ! Just point and shoot ! Shoot out the sprinkler ! My name is Dana Scully . Yes . Thank you . Yes . Ew , God . That 's terrible . Well , it 's official . Ten pounds , ten ounces of piss and vinegar . El nino grande . Leroy Walter Villareal Suarez , Jr . - Oh , no . - Oh , yes . Oh , it 's amazing . It 's truly amazing . What 's that ? That you could come here in the face of a hurricane , chasing a sea monster yet , and end up bringing a new life into the world . And then slaying the monster ... and save this one 's life ... as he was quite literally circling down the drain . She didn 't save my life , really . Oh , yes , she did . Yes . With a gun to her head , no less . Well , you wouldn 't have known to go out in the rain ... if I hadn 't pointed it out to you , and it was the fresh water that killed the organism . - I saw the Shipleys ' cat . - I can 't swallow that . No , I saw the cat which had been saved , which had been in the washing machine . The Shipleys had boarded up their house , which means the only way they could have vanished was if the creature came up ... through the plumbing in a backwash of seawater . Seawater , and then the deputy ... who vanished from a bathtub full of Epsom Salts . If Agent Scully had not been there with you , I shudder to think what would have happened to you . I 'd say you owe her your life . It takes a big man to admit this , but ... if I had had someone ... as savvy as her by my side ... all those years ago in the X-Files , I might not have retired . I suggest that we have a toast to your good fortune . And I insist that we have it . So what 'll it be ? Oh , uh , anyone for water ? No ! supplied by CoBeR coberus @ go2.pl

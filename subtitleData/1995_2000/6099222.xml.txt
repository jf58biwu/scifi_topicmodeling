 [ Man ] All right ! Go ! Move ! Move ! - [ Rifles Clicking ] - [ Grunting ] - [ Footsteps Running ] - [ Chatter ] - Move it out ! - Move out ! Go ! - Outside ! - [ Warbling ] Move it ! Go , go , go ! Move ! - [ Warbling Continues ] - Come on ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - You ! Come on . Let 's go ! Move ! - Come on ! Come on ! Outside ! Everyone outside ! - Go , go , go ! - [ Clatter ] Hurry ! Hurry ! Let 's go ! Pick it up ! [ Grunting ] [ Soldiers Shouting Outside ] [ Heavy Breathing ] - Come on ! Get in ! Get in ! - Hurry up ! Let 's go ! - You heard him ! Get up there ! - Keep it moving ! Back , back , back . Come on ! - Let 's go ! - All the way in the back ! Thumbs up ! - Copy ! Clear ! - [ Gears Grind ] - Go ! - Move it ! Next truck , bring it up ! [ Heavy Breathing ] - All out ! Let 's get everyone out . - Let 's go . Come on . Hurry up ! Let 's move ! [ Warbling ] - Turn around and face the other way ! Now ! - [ Warbling Continues ] [ Chattering ] Fire ! [ Gunfire Stops ] [ Whimpers ] Mulder ? Answer me ! [ Grunts ] Damn it . - I wanna know what 's on that train . - It doesn 't matter now . Our government is operating a secret railroad . They put something on that train in West Virginia- - something living . - What more is there to know ? - What the Japanese have to do with it . How a man named Ishimaru is involved . - That , I don 't know . - Don 't tell me you don 't know , you smug son of a- - There are limits ... to my knowledge . - I don 't have time for your convenient ignorance . - What were you gonna do ? Shoot me , just like the men that shot your sister ? You know them too ? You wanna know what 's on that train , who killed your sister ? You find out what they put in your neck . The implant . It holds more than I could ever tell you . Maybe everything you need to know . [ Door Shuts ] Excuse me , sir . I need your assistance . - I 'm a federal agent . My name is Mulder . - You need my assistance ? I need access to that quarantined car you picked up in West Virginia . [ Sighs ] Sorry . Can 't help you . I 'm a federal agent , sir . Open that car . I would if I could , but I don 't have access myself . We pick these cars up . Whatever they 're carrying , they never let us know . Somebody 's got to be able to get in that car . We 've got a doctor on board . Came on back at Queen 's Gate . He might have something to do with it . I saw him checking the door . - What 's his name ? - Japanese fella . Dr. Shiro Zama . Traveling with another party , it says , but I got the impression , he was alone . - Can you take me to his compartment ? - Certainly . Right this way . Stay here . Knock on the door , but stay away from it . Dr. Zama ? Knock again . It 's the conductor , Dr. Zama . Open it . just unlock it , then step away . Why did I study French in high school ? You got a safe place you can put this ? Yes . What am I supposed to tell the doctor when he asks where it is ? If he finds you before I find him , I want you to make him lie on the ground till I get back . - Have you ever used a gun before ? - No . - [ Clip Clicks ] - I just want you to point it at him . Don 't pull the trigger . That 'll give away the game . [ Chuckles ] What if he runs ? just make sure he runs my way . [ Man ] I 'm feeding the chip impulses . The graph is recording its output , which , when I remove the current , changes slightly , but continues . This means the neural network is storing information . - Biological information ? - That was my first guess . The chip was placed subcutaneous to the back of the neck , right ? So it makes sense that it would be recording impulses ... traveling to and from the central nervous system . - But what ? - But look at the graph . Those are what we call " reverberatory loops . " They indicate the presence of circular neuronal activity in the brain . Memory formation . Yeah . The chip seems to be mimicking that process- - replicating the memory function in the brain . - Like a computer hard drive . - Yeah , but no hard drive we 've ever seen . This kind of neural network could be not only collecting information , but artificially replicating a person 's mental processes . - You could know a person 's every thought . - Frightening . Anyway , I showed the chip to some of my tech-heads , and they weren 't as blown away as I thought they 'd be . They 've seen this technology before ? They 've seen neural nets before , but never as complex as that , - nor are they likely to any time soon . - What do you mean ? The chip 's so delicate , I effectively destroyed it when I began working on it , but I found something in the silicon matrix , what I believe is the name of the manufacturer . - It 's Japanese , isn 't it ? - How 'd you know ? Oh , it was just a guess . Well , I checked for you . I assumed you 'd want me to . There 's no record or information on the manufacturer , either here or in Japan , except for this . We had Fed Ex , U.P.S. , the postal service , every commercial courier ... go through their computer records . They turned up one shipment sent to a Dr. Shiro Zama ... at a research facility out in Perkey , West Virginia . Well done , Agent Pendrell . Keep up the good work . Hey . Thanks . Keep it up yourself . " Keep it up yourself " ? What a doof . [ Chattering ] [ Gasps ] Please . [ Thudding ] - [ Clatter ] - [ Scully ] Hey ! Stop ! [ Thump ] [ Creaks ] [ Clack ] [ Whimpering ] Please . Don 't . Don 't hurt us . Please . [ Man ] Don 't . [ Chattering ] Excuse me . - [ Screams ] Oh , God ! He 's dead . - No . No . Shh , shh , shh . He 's just got a little motion sickness . I 'm gonna go find a doctor . Why don 't you and the young man just find another bathroom , hmm ? Come on , Timmy . Let 's just go . Who are you ? Don 't worry . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I 'm an F.B.I. agent . We- - We live here . We 've lived here at the facility most of our lives . What kind of facility ? The Hansen 's Disease Research Facility . Hansen 's- - Do you mean this is a leper colony ? No more . The facility 's closed now . L-Look , l-l came here looking for a Dr. Shiro Zama . Dr. Zama isn 't here anymore . None of the medical staff is . Where did they go ? Well , they all left ... right before the death squads started coming . What death squads ? That 's- - That 's who we 've been hiding from . We thought you 'd come to kill us like they killed all the others . [ Scully ] How many have been killed ? [ Man ] Hundreds . All but us . I don 't understand how there could have been hundreds of people here ... when- - when leprosy is supposed to be a treatable disease . Well , it is . Me and- - and- - and the other people back at the hiding place , we 're the last . Our disfigurement forced us into the camps before there was a treatment . - Who were the others ? - We never knew . They began arriving several years ago , but they were kept apart from us . And they had Hansen 's disease ? No , no . They had the Hansen 's deformities . Dr. Zama would round them up in groups for treatment . Then the ones that returned always came back worse- - with terrible burns all over their bodies . [ Panting ] It 's over there . [ Gasps ] Oh , my God . [ Man ] There are more of these pits . They just dump the bodies on top of each other ... Like they were garbage . [ Helicopter Approaching ] They 're coming . [ Scully ] Wait ! Hey ! No . Move and you 're dead . [ Gunshots ] [ Chattering ] [ Door Shuts ] - I found Zama four cars up strangled in the bathroom . - No . I want you to get up there and seal off that bathroom . Get word to the engineer not to stop this train until I tell him . Okay ? Till I find the killer . [ Grunting ] [ Gasping ] [ Man ] Hey ! I 'm a law enforcement officer . - Stay back . - Just put that gun down . I 'm gonna show you my identification . Put the gun down . - [ Door Whirrs , Hisses ] - [ Man Pounds On Door ] - You idiot ! - [ Pounds On Door ] [ Mulder ] Put your hands in the air and turnaround ! Put your hands in the air ! You have no idea what you 're dealing with here . Maybe you should 've filled me in before you tried to kill me . - Now , who are you ? - No . Who are you ? Answer me ! I work for the National Security Agency . The N.S.A. ? Since when did they start issuing you guys piano wire ... instead of guns ? Since we learned ... there 's a bomb on this train . There 's something on this train , but it 's not a bomb . Throw that here . This car is wired to an explosive device . It armed automatically when I entered the car . - Why ? - Because of what 's in that room . Because if the man responsible for it ... couldn 't get it out of the country , he would rather kill it than let it live . So you killed him ? The only humane alternative , given the circumstances . Put your hands in the air . This bomb could be wired to anything in the car . Smallest concussion could set it off . If you use that weapon , you take your chances . [ Exhales ] I 'll take my chances . I 'd like to speak with Miss Scully alone . [ Door Shuts ] How did you know my name ? I know most everything about you , Dana . What are you talking about ? I think you know . Who are you ? What is this place ? This was one of the most frightening places on the Earth . A place where society sent its monsters ... to live in shame and isolation . Now their disease is all but conquered . Science has eliminated thousands of years of misery . I 've seen your methods of elimination . What happened to the man with me in the forest ? What about the people who were in this room ? - They had been exposed . - Exposed to what ? The same thing all these people have been exposed to . Victims of an inhuman project run by a man named Zama . You mean Ishimaru . You hid him here after the war . He stayed here , and he continued his experiments . The ruler of the world is no longer the country with the bravest soldiers , but the greatest scientists . Unfortunately , Ishimaru began to conduct his work in secret- - not sharing with those who had risked much in giving him his asylum . - What was he exposing these people to ? - Terrible things . What kinds of things ? - Have I been exposed ? - I don 't know . Who knows ? Please . I 'd like to show you something ... that will give you your answers . Agent Mulder , do you want us to try prying this door open ? I wouldn 't recommend that . No . - Where 's the key card ? - It 's in my pocket . Take it out ... slowly . Put it on the table . It 's not gonna work . No ? How did you get in here ? There 's a code . Right ? Zama gave you a code just before you killed him . What is it ? Four ones , a four , a seven and a one . 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 4-7-1 . I assumed Zama would be smarter ... than to give me the entrance and the exit code . - What ? - He knew he was gonna die . When I used the code to enter the car , it activated the bomb . If you use it again , it will almost certainly set it off . - If there 's a bomb on this train , where is it ? - I don 't know . - Could be anywhere . - No , it couldn 't be anywhere . If you activated it coming in , it 's gotta be on this car . You 're probably right . Where do you think it is ? I don 't know . You know what I think ? I think you 're a liar . I don 't think you work for the N.S.A. , and I don 't think there 's a bomb on this train . - You 're choosing a hell of a way to find out . - Shut up ! [ Beeping ] [ Beeping ] That 's you . - [ Sighs ] Answer it . - [ Cell Phone Beeping ] [ Beeping ] [ Phone Beeps ] Yes ? Yes . just a moment . It 's for you . Put it down . - Yeah ? - [ Man ] Mr. Mulder , I have someone here who 'd like to speak with you . - Mulder , it 's me . - Scully , where are you ? - I 'm in West Virginia . - Who dialed this number ? Mulder , we 've gotten involved in something , but it 's not at all what you think . - What are you talking about ? - Whatever is on that train is not alien . - You 're wrong , Scully . - [ Scully ] Mulder , Ishimaru--Zama - - he was experimenting on innocent human subjects . He 'd been doing it for years , operating out of a leper colony . Whatever his name was , Scully , he 's dead . I don 't think this has anything to do with lepers . The leper colony was just a front . The tests weren 't just on lepers . They were on the homeless , on- - on the insane . They were brought here , and they were subjected to diseases and radiation tests . - Who told you this ? - The man who handed me the phone . - Why do you believe him ? - Because of what he 's shown me . - What ? - [ Clatter ] What has he shown you ? Mulder , I 'm standing in a train car ... just like the one on your alien autopsy video , only I realize that I 've been here before . - What are you talking about ? - This is where they brought me . This is where they put the implant in my neck- - one of these cars . - [ Mulder ] Scully- - - It all makes sense , Mulder . Ishimaru- - Zama- - He was using the secret railroad ... to conduct his tests across the country . - The women in Allentown , they all remember these cars . - [ Static On Cell Phone ] - [ Static ] - Scully . Scully ? - [ Scully ] Can you hear me ? - Yeah . Are you saying that Zama is the one who abducted these women ? What I 'm saying , Mulder , is that there is no such thing as alien abduction . It is just a smoke screen happily created by our government ... to cover up the biggest lie of all . What about the U.F.O. I saw them working on ? That wasn 't a U.F.O. It was a piece of a Russian nuclear sub that was raised . - More lies . - How can you be so sure ? Because I have what I told you I needed , Mulder . Proof . Two weeks ago , the president made a public apology ... for secret radiation tests that have been conducted on innocent citizens ... up until 1974 . - Only guess what . - Those tests never ended . Mulder , listen to me . You have got to stay out of that train car . - Why ? - Because there is a bomb on board . Mulder , if that bomb detonates , thousands of people are gonna die from hemorrhagic fever . That 's what the test subject inside has been exposed to . Well , Scully , you 're a little late . I 'm locked inside that train car . Then we 've got to get you out . That device is on a timer . - Where is it ? - There should be a ventilation grid on the ceiling . It 's hidden up inside . Step back . Open that . - Did you find it , Mulder ? - Hold on . Oh , yeah . I found it . - How much time do you have ? - Little over an hour and a half . Look , Mulder , you 've got to get them to stop that train , so we can get you off of it . They want you to tell the engineer to stop at the next station . - Why ? - So we can get a bomb squad out there ... - and evacuate the train . - Scully , you 're breaking up . I can 't hear you . - Did you hear that ? Mulder ? Muld- - - Scully ? Scully ? - [ Man ] What 's the next stop ? - It 's not on the map . Step aside . Conductor ! - Where are we ? - Iowa . We passed Murray Station about20minutes ago . I want you to get word to the engineer . There 's a bomb on this car . - Bomb ? - That 's right . I want you to tell him not to make his next scheduled stop ... and to reroute , understand ? - I think so . - Tell him to choose a place ... as far away from a populated area as possible and unhook this car . - What are you doing ? - Let 's move into the corner over there now . You 're gonna get us both killed . I want you to kneel down and put your hands behind your back . They 'll never be able to find us in time . If what 's on this train is as important as I think it is , they will . [ Train Crossing Bell Ringing ] - [ Ringing Continues ] - [ Brakes Hiss ] [ Brakes Screech ] [ Rumbling ] [ Grunts ] You 're gonna die , you know that ? What do you care ? You were trying to kill me anyway . - [ Train Creaks ] - [ Clank ] [ Cell Phone Rings ] - [ Beep ] - Scully . Scully , you haven 't seen America , till you 've seen it from a train . - Damn it ! What happened ? - I 'm not gonna make that station , Scully . - I figured that . You have any idea where you are ? - No , but I 'm sure they 'll find us . We probably lit up every spy satellite in this hemisphere . It was the only thing to do , Scully . If you 're right about what 's on this car , an explosion outside a populated area would reduce the risks . If I 'm right , they 're not gonna want to find you . - But you don 't think I 'm right , do you ? - We 'll have to wait and see . We 're not waiting for anything . We gotta get you out of there as fast as we can . I 'm fielding all offers and suggestions . They 're not gonna come , are they ? I said you were making a mistake . Tell me something . You got on this train to kill Dr. Zama . Then what ? What were your orders then ? Who are you protecting ? Unless that bomb is as phony as you are , we both got about half an hour to live . Is that part of the plan ? They don 't make provisions for saving my life . Well , what about that thing locked back there ? What provisions were made for saving its life ? I don 't know . I wasn 't expected to fail . You know what it is , don 't you ? You 're gonna die for that thing . Is it important enough to die for ? What is it , a plague carrier ? A leper ? We 're both gonna die in here . The difference is I 'm gonna die quickly . As an employee of the National Security Agency , you should know that a gunshot wound to the stomach ... is probably the most painful and the slowest way to die- - but I 'm not a very good shot , and when I miss ... I tend to miss low . - It 's a weapon . - A weapon ? What kind of a weapon ? Ask yourself , my friend . What could be more valuable than Star Wars , more valuable than the atomic bomb ... or the most advanced biological weapons ? A standing army immune to the effects of those weapons . That 's what Dr. Zama did , didn 't he ? He came up with an immunity to those weapons . He was trying to smuggle that thing to his own country to share the science , only our government isn 't in the mood to share , right ? They 've been doing experiments since World War II- - tests on innocent civilians . But Zama succeeded where the others had failed . And that thing in there , that 's no innocent civilian . It 's not a leper , either . It 's an alien-human hybrid , isn 't it ? Then again , if that were true ... you 'd have expected someone would 've been here by now to save it , wouldn 't you ? [ Exhales Deeply ] Yes . Hello . My name is Dana Scully , and I 'm trying to reach Senator Matheson at home . I 've already tried his office . Please . This is an emergency . Can you reach him ? Yes . I 'm at 555-01 99 . Thanks . This area code . [ Books Clattering On Floor ] [ Click ] [ Cell Phone Rings ] [ Rings ] - [ Rings ] - Yeah ? - [ Scully ] Mulder , I think I 've got something here . - What is it ? I think I may have a code for you . I 'm watching Zama punch it in to keypad in one of the train cars . - [ Mulder ] What are you watching ? - Your alien autopsy video . You mean I might get my $ 29.95 's worth after all ? I 've got six minutes left . Is that what you have ? - Let 's hope not . What 's the code ? - Okay . One . One . Zero . What ? Are you there ? Yeah . Yeah . One . Zero . One . 1 - 0-1 . And a three . Then a three . 3-3 . Ah . I can 't see the last number clearly . His hand gets in the way . - Tick , tick , Scully . - No . I 'm sorry . Um- - - I think it 's a one . - You think it 's a one . Are you sure ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm pretty sure . - And a one . - [ Keypad Beeps , Door Hisses ] - [ Thump ] - [ Groans ] - Mulder ? Mulder ! - [ Clatter On Phone Line ] [ Door Hisses ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gasping ] [ Heavy Breathing ] Okay . Call me if you learn anything . Nothing , Scully- - not the rail operators , not the Forestry Department . Nobody knows what happened to that train car . Are there any satellite photos you can get your hands on ? Senator Matheson hasn 't returned my phone calls . His- - His aides say he 's out of the country . Well , the administrator at the hospital where you were admitted ... said that someone had called and alerted them to your location . Now , I went through the phone records myself , and the call was placed from a phone booth in Blue Earth , Iowa . Did you locate the briefcase that Zama left on the train ? Yeah . I got it right here . It doesn 't look like the same briefcase . It 's the one they gave me , the one they said you gave to the conductor . - These aren 't the same journals . They 've all been rewritten . - Mulder- - - They 're getting away with it . - They 've gotten away with it . The bodies at the leper colony have all been removed . I know what I saw on that train . It wasn 't a leper . It wasn 't human . I know what I saw at the research facility . It was barely recognizable as human . Don 't you see , Mulder ? You 're doing their work for them . You 're chasing aliens that aren 't there , helping them create a story to cover the shameful truth . And what they can 't cover , they apologize for . Apology has become policy . I-l don 't need an apology for the lies . I don 't care about the fictions they create to cover their crimes . I want them held accountable for what did happen .

I 'll see you then . Ok . Bye . Who was that ? My girlfriend . Your girlfriend ? Yeah . Alissa . Since when is Alissa your " girlfriend " ? What do you mean , man ? We hang out at school together . We bought a pizza together . My girlfriend . If you say so . Look , she just invited me over to go baby-sitting with her . Wouldn 't you say that qualifies as a boyfriend thing ? Not in the circles I run in , no . Well , you 're super-wrong , because Alissa just happens to be my girlfriend . That 's right . Say it enough , and you might just start believin ' it . I hate you ! Hello , sweetness . Hello , Vicki . Look what I did . I ordered way too much Chinese food . I hope you 're hungry . I 'm always hungry . [ Growls ] That 's what I like about you , Harry . You 're a good eater , yet you got a stomach like a washboard . Yup , and a tush like a sink . You got good genes , baby . The kind of genes that I would like to pass along to my child . Hmm . Yeah . Could you pass the dim sum ? Harry , you know , I 'm not getting any younger , and , lately , my biological clock is just ticking ' . Yeah . Could you pass me some moo shoo ? Harry ... I wanna have a baby . Haaa ! Haaa ! [ Hacking ] good morning , all ! Uh-huh . Mm . What 's with the classified , Sally ? I 'm getting my own apartment . Excuse me ? I 've decided I need my own space . Oh , no . No , no , no . Dick , it 's time . It 's not time . And what 's more , it will never be time . Now , I 'm gonna leave and come back into the room , and we 'll just start this whole day over again . Good morning , all ! Hey.Mo rning . What 's with the classified , Sally ? I 'm getting my own apartment ? You 're what ? ! Dick , I need my own space ! Out of the question ! We are a unit ! We are on a mission ! My mission is to figure out what it 's like to be an adult human female , and I 'm still living with my middle-aged brother ! When we split up , we risk exposure . Harry , talk some sense into her . I got a lot on my mind , Dick . I 'm thinking about having a baby with Vicki . You 're what ? ! Do you think that Lamaze is the way to go ? I would say drugs . Are you insane ? What will you do when the doctor says , " congratulations . It 's an 8-pound purple tube " ? Yeah , that would be sticky . What is happening to this unit ? We used to stick together . Now you 're all going off in your own directions . What about you , Tommy ? Are you running away to join the circus ? No . I 'm just going baby-sitting with Alissa , my girlfriend . Keep dreamin ' . Now stop this right now ! I am issuing a command decision . No one on this mission will be doing any impregnating , relocating , or baby-sitting without my express written consent ! Now , let 's just try to start this day right , shall we ? Good morning , all ! Good morning , jerk . Jackass ! Creep ! That 's better . Hello . I see you have an apartment for rent . Great . Now , a Sally Solomon may be by today to look at it . Please , don 't hold the fact that she is a convicted arsonist against her . Who am I ? I 'm one of her drunken and unruly roommates . Thank you . Yeah , yeah , thank you . Bye-bye . What are you doing ? Clipping Sally 's wings , thank you very much . Sally 's looking for her own place , so he 's trashing her name to every apartment manager in town . Condos , too . Put that phone down ! Could you hold , please ? Dick , people grow . You can 't hold on forever . When I went to prep school , my father wouldn 't let go . He visited me every weekend . He was also having an affair with the school nurse . But the point is it drove me crazy , and it just pushed me farther away . You 're doing the same thing . Mary , you can 't compare me to your morally bankrupt father . My family is different . Very different . Promise me you 'll stop this . All right , I promise . Thank you . Thank you for holding . I 'm with a leading Colombian drug cartel . Yes , and I 'm scouting apartments for one of my mules- - Sally Solomon . Dick ! Muchas gracias . I 've stopped , I 've stopped . Harry , you know what ? I 've been thinking . If it 's a girl , it 'll look just like me , and if it 's a boy , it 'll look just like you . What if it looks like something you never seen before ? Now , you know , that does happen . My sister had a baby that looked just like my boyfriend . It was weird , weird . I 'm just not sure that this is a good idea . Oh , Harry , see , that 's what I love about you . Not only are you strong and sexy , but you 're a worrier . You 're gonna be a great daddy . Yeah . I 'll be a great daddy . I like kids . Like playing with kids . I just hope that 's what we have . Ok , now , here 's the number where we 're gonna be . Here 's the car phone number , and my sister 's number 's on the fridge . Don 't worry . Everything will be fine . Hi . Oh , Mr. And Mrs. Wheeler , this is Tommy . Nice to meet you , Tommy . Now , you 've got the numbers , right ? She 's got the numbers . Ok , good . Come on , let 's go . Bye-bye , now . So , uh , how you doing ? Good . How are you ? Good . So , uh , couldn 't help but notice that , um , you introduced me as " Tommy . " Uh ... yeah . Just " Tommy " ? Uh-huh . Interesting . Would you prefer , like , " the t-man " ? Well , I just- - I don 't want the wheelers to be worrying all night about who I am . You know , " is he her brother Tommy ? " Her lab partner Tommy ? " Her dance instructor Tommy ? Her boyfriend Tommy ? Her dance instructor Tommy ? " Dance instructor ? Yeah . I dabble in jazz fusion . It 's just an example . Let 's watch Tv . Good night . I 'll see you Monday . Good night . Dick ! What the hell did you do ? Or I might just stay and watch . I 've called every rental agency in this entire town . They 've all hung up on me ! Perhaps you should work on your telephone etiquette . Albright , you live by yourself . Let me ask you something . I was just leaving . It 'll just take a second . Please , just sit down . Thank you . Look , I have gotten to the point in my life where I feel I don 't have to live with my family anymore , and I 'd really like your opinion on that . Mary , tell her she 's wrong . Sally , no . Every time I give you advice , it blows up in my face . What ? Name one time . I can name 5 ! I can name 7 . Oh , I can name 10 . I can name 12 . I don 't care ! Look , Albright- - doctoralbright ... you live by yourself . I could do that , right ? No comment . So you think it 's a good idea . I refer you to my last response . Mary , you can provide a preponderance of evidence that proves what a frightening responsibility living alone is . In order to do that , we would have to determine what the meaning of the word " is " is . All right , look ... would you , in a million years , live in an attic with Dick , Tommy , and Harry ? Well , I really think that 's a matter of- - answer the question , please . I would rather live in a box behind the 7-eleven . Oh , damn ! Ha ha ! Aren 't babies cute , Harry ? Oh , look , there 's me ! I had just learned to walk . And you 're in a beauty pageant ! I was " little miss bowl-a-Rama . " Aww ! Shut up ! The situations are not comparable ! Dick , I have made up my mind ! Harry , get away from that strumpet ! I 'm doing your job here . You know that . Out ! Out ! Out ! Boy , your brother 's got some control issues . He 's a freak ! He won 't even let me get my own place . There 's a room over the garage I used to rent out . What ? Mama , that place is condemned . I know . It 's just asbestos and bad wiring . Nothing a little paint won 't fix . I would like to see this place . Well ... this is it . [ Long gasp ] Oh , wow ! I cannot believe this place . Now , there 's no kitchen . Which means no dishes , huh ? Oh , my god ! Look at that ! I know- - rat droppings . I 'm sorry . No--a window ! You didn 't tell me there 'd be a window . What a great place to put a hole ! Ok , dubie ... how much are you charging for this place ? Mmm ... 75 a month . Are you serious ? Ok , 60 . I 'll take it ! I prefer cash . Hey , what say we tack this onto Dick 's bill ? Well , sure . In that case , it 's 75 . Ok . " Good night , stars , good night , air , good night , noises everywhere . Good night , moon . " Good night . Ahem ! So , how do you know the wheelers ? Oh , um , Mr. Wheeler 's my mom 's boss . So , if she saw him walking in the halls at work , she 'd say , " hey , there 's my boss , Mr. Wheeler . " I guess . Ok . So , if you saw ... me ... walking along in the halls at school , you 'd say ... " hi , Tommy . " Right , right . [ Doorbell rings ] They 're back already ? Let 's see who 's at the door . Oh , my god ! It 's a couple of scary weirdos . Yeah . That 's my uncle and his girlfriend . Hello . We understand there 's a baby on the premises . And there he is ! Oh ! Oh ! Woojie , woojie , woojie , woojie ! Cute thing . Take him . What ? You 'll like him . You 'll see . Are you sure ? You 'll like it . Ahh ... hiya , hon . So ... you two kids thinking of having kids ? Come on , Dick . It 's all-you-can-eat . No , I 'm not hungry . You can eat the rest of what I can eat . Come on , cheer up , Dick . Sally wants her own space ? Let her have it . You gotta roll with the punches . Look at me . I 've moved on . Sally gave me the old heave-ho , and here I am , about to put this place out of business ! I can 't . I have to figure out a way to get her to come back . I know . You 're concerned for her safety . Oh , that 's a laugh . Look , Sally may be a tough cookie , but in a lot of ways , she 's naive , and that makes her vulnerable- - easy pickin 's for any rat - bastard psycho with a good haircut ! Still have feelings for her , eh , Don ? Maybe . More shrimp here , johnny ! If Sally only understood the workings of the criminal element , she 'd move back in a heartbeat . Criminal element ? Exactly how does this criminal element work ? It 's the usual story . She comes home tired and forgets to close the blinds . She puts on a teddy and parades in front of the window . Suddenly , there 's a knock at the door . Is it pizza ? No ! It 's Dr. Nefarious in a ski mask and a hatchet ! She 's screaming her head off , but nobody can hear her because of the train passing ! Clickety-clack ! Clickety-Clack ! Clickety-clack ! Whoo-whooooo ! Huhn ! Huhn ! Huhn ! Aaaaaah ! Not a pretty picture ... but it could happen . You 're right , Don . In fact , I can almost guarantee that it will happen ! So ... you want me to go buy y 'all some wine ? No , that 's Ok . They probably got plenty around here . So , um ... you ever been to Vegas ? Lookin ' forward to the new star wars movie ? Nothin ' ! Well , Harry , you can 't just talk to him while he sits there . You gotta , you gotta pick him up and play with him , see ? Go ahead . You 'll feel it . Well , I don 't feel it , but I sure smell it . And now I feel it . Here . Let me take him . No , no , no , no . Now , listen , y 'all just go on and go out for ice cream . We 'll hold the fort down here , Ok ? Are you sure ? Go on ! Go on ! Have fun with your boyfriend . Ok . Wait . Did you hear what she just said ? Look , William 's got a load in his diaper , and if she wants to deal with it , that 's fine with me . No , no , no . Before , before . She specifically referred to me as your , um ... you know ... boyfriend ? Mm-hmm . So ? So nothing . That 's great . Let 's go . In your face , man ! [ Rattle ] Uh ... ahem . Who 's there ? [ Cat screeches ] [ Sighs ] It 's just a cat . It 's just a cat . Ok . [ Humming ] Lieutenant ! Lieutenant ! What ? It 's me ! I know ! Stop choking me ! That 's an order ! Jesus , Dick ! What the hell are you thinking ? I came here to show you how vulnerable you are living alone . And did you ? Yes ! Except for the vulnerable part . Dick ! Lieutenant , we belong together ! You can 't leave the unit ! I am not leaving the unit ! I just need my own space . I want the hair in the sink to be mine . Yeah , but you won 't be under my roof . I 'm not that far away . Look , when I open my door , I can see right into Tommy 's bedroom . You can ? Oh , my god . He has no privacy at all . I 'm gonna be Ok , Dick . I 've learned a lot . Well , you 've had a good teacher . I guess I better go deal with Harry now . High commander ... proceed with care and discipline . Your counsel has been acknowledged . Hello ! Howdy ! Rrr rrr rrr ! Amazing ! 200 times , and he still thinks it 's funny . And for some reason , so do I. Honey , you can stop now . Rrrr ! I mean it ! Ok . Hey , little one , look at you . Oh , yeah . Boy , bet you 're gonna be something when you grow up , huh ? Postal worker ... toll booth operator ... or maybe even the president ... of a fan club . Oh , I envy your parents . Vicki . Yeah ? I know I 'm not your average guy . But I deserve as much happiness as the next guy . Oh , Harry ! Oh , Vicki ! Harry , stop it this instant ! Dick , didn 't you ever learn to knock ? I 'm warning you , Harry , if you continue with this foolhardy escapade and implant this empty receptacle with your cosmic seed , you will no longer enjoy the protection of our unit . Are you saying I 'm not good enough for your family ? No ! Although you 're not . Harry knows what I mean . So what 's your decision ? Dick ... would you please hold William for a second ? Vicki ... let 's make a baby ! Yahoo ! Yeah ! We 're home ! what are you writing ? I 'm entering Harry 's breach of conduct into the logbook . What 'd he do ? Never mind . Oh , what 's happened here ? This morning we were all together , and now look at us . Sally 's living in a garage , and Harry 's with that Vicki . It 's those damn dubceks . Of all the gin joints in all the world , why did we have to move into this one ? Well , it was the first place we looked . That 's true . You know , every night before I go to sleep , I look at myself in the mirror , sometimes for hours ... and I commend myself for how well I 've kept this unit together . But tonight I see only failure . I 'm a bad high commander . Oh , you 're an excellent high commander . It 's a very difficult planet . You know , humans grow . It makes other humans hurt . It 's earth . You know , what are you gonna do ? How do you know so much ? Dick , I 'm the oldest . When you get to be my age , you just know things . Are you gonna be Ok ? Mm-hmm . Oh , come here , little buddy . Come on . It 's Ok . It 's all right . Tommy ? Alissa . You left your bag at the wheelers ' . Uh ... I 'm just gonna leave this and you alone with dad and whatever the hell it is you 're doing . Get off my lap ! Alissa , look , he 's not really my dad ! He 's just some guy I 'm living with ! No , no , no ! Alissa ! time passes so quickly here . You 're put on this planet , you assume a life , your little subordinates need you and are always underfoot , all ass and elbows . Then one day , they leave , and you 're sitting alone worrying and wondering how they 're doing . Well , I 'll find out . Hey , Harry , how you doin ' ? Harry : outstanding ! Sally , how are you ? Sally : aw , shut up ! It feels so good when they call .

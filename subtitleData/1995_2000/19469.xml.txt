We 'll consider that . - Give it the college try . - That 's all I can do , brother . That 's just the way I was trained . Should we think about trying to ... ... turn you around a bit ? ls that too much stuff ? What else do you got that you could do ... ... that 's easier ? Not much , eh ? We 're all ducking and dodging at this point . I mean , the ducking and dodging that happens over there later is ... ... a little bit easier but ... . They 're in the walls . Action ! No , Morpheus ! Don 't ! Trinity , go ! Go ! Action ! And action ! Cut it ! Cut that . Weapons up . Fingers off the triggers . Cut . Cut . Oops , sorry . Action ! Cut . Go again right away ? And action . Cut . Action . And action . And action . Actually , you better kick ... ... over the hip . Excellent . And roll sound . - Roll it ! - Stay on the deck . Fall . Light . Fire ! Action ! - Now ! - Go ! - -water like that . The roof , tie it up on top . - Cut ! - Cut there . Action ! Cut ! And roll sound , please . Action ! I deliver perfection ... and don 't brag about it ! : D This movie takes place ... ... in another time and place with unbelievable effects . The Matrix is science fiction ... ... but it 's also an action / adventure film . You see things that are fantastic . And you say , " Wait a second . That 's impossible . " Freeze it . When they explained to me the movie they were making ... ... I got fired up because nobody 's made this kind of movie before . Synthesizing evolution ... ... acting in the construct ... ... giving flesh to a cartoon , soul to a machine . The movie takes place in the distant future . It is a time when computers rule the world . You have a world of people who believe they 're real ... ... but they 're not . They 're living in a computer program . There are a number of other people who are trying to liberate ... ... those people ... ... from their captivities . It 's about taking everything for granted . Other times , it 's about hope and love ... ... and belief . It 's about robots versus kung fu . And there 's some crazy action . Sydney 's a beautiful town . Who wouldn 't want ... ... 5 months in Australia ? Filming on location in Sydney ... ... is a pleasure . We 're in a great city ... ... with a very professional crew . We 're in Sydney in a beautiful new facility . This stage is brand-new . We 're the first movie on this stage . When we moved in here ... ... the paint was wet on the walls . " Do not touch the walls . " Is it okay if I kind of come forward ? It 's difficult to ask , " Where do you get your ideas from ? " Nobody knows . They just sort of happen . A friend of ours asked us to come up with a concept for a comic book . We like kung fu movies . We like Japanimation . We like science fiction books that are about the nature of reality . You 've been living in a dream world , Neo . This is the world ... ... as it exists today . What 's interesting about the whole idea of cyberpunk is ... ... it 's a great way to create a sense of alienation ... ... and disconnection and alternate worlds ... ... being caught in these ... ... quasi-dream , quasi-conscious states . How far do you want me up like this ? - That 's it . - That 's the look . I first met Larry and Andy when I read Assassins and it really was an incredible script . It was a very dark , edgy ... ... piece of material . I was impressed with that style . They showed me this animated Japanese cartoon ... ... and they said , " We wanna do that for real . " You know , that was an incredible idea to me . I mean , to actually see that animation come to life ... ... and believe me , essentially , it has . We 've had our eye on you for some time now , Mr. Anderson . In one life , you 're Thomas A. Anderson ... ... program writer for a respectable software company . The other life ... ... is lived in computers ... ... where you go by the hacker alias " Neo " ... ... and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for . I play a man named Thomas Anderson who 's looking ... ... for Morpheus , who 's played by Laurence Fishburne . I 'm searching for the answer . The question is : What is the Matrix ? My character feels that the answer will somehow make sense of his life . At last . My character is called Morpheus ... ... and Morpheus is a person who lives in the real world . And he 's the leader of this band of people ... ... looking for ... ... the One . You felt it your entire life : Something 's wrong with the world . You don 't know what , but it 's there . Like a splinter in your mind . He is this , like ... ... fevered missionary guy . He 's a zealot . There 's something dangerous about people who believe they have the truth . They do sort of act blindly . This is your last chance . After this , there is no turning back . You take the blue pill ... ... the story ends , you wake up in your bed and believe ... ... whatever you want to believe . You take the red pill ... ... you stay in Wonderland ... ... and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes . There are references to ... ... Alice in Wonderland . I think that is a brilliant book . She comes into this world ... ... and there is all this craziness . People just give her things and say , " Eat this " , " Drink this . " Everything affects her and changes her ... ... and nothing makes sense . Nothing 's logical . It 's just the way you have to do it . We tried to do that with the beginning of the film . The thing I love about Trinity ... ... is that I 'm portraying someone who 's really strong ... ... and who has a mission and purpose . Can you fly that thing ? Not yet . Operator . I need a pilot program for a B-212 helicopter . She 's a warrior . Yet , I don 't think that she 's lost being a woman . Lieutenant . Oh , shit . Agent Smith is the law enforcement ... ... and he 's seemingly an invincible machine who develops ... ... human frailties . There was an accident . Goddamn car accident . Cypher was a disciple , a strong disciple of Morpheus . But now , I 've had second thoughts . Did he tell you why he did it ? Why you 're here ? Jesus ! What a mind job . So you 're here to save the world . Then you go from the- - To- - Speaking about Larry and Andy together as a pair , as a team of writers ... ... I liken them to the Brothers Grimm . I imagine that 's what the Brothers Grimm were like . Action . Boom ! Good . Somebody 's gonna be here . They work well together , wonderful sense of humor . So you do get a dialogue happening that is normally ... ... just within the one director 's head . So it 's normally one director talking to themselves ... ... working out a problem and expressing their solution to that problem . Whereas , with Larry and Andy , you 'll see ... ... you 'll see the dialogue going on . They 're just like real guys . There 's none of that kind of " Hollywood " thing . It 's not evident at all . They 're from Chicago . They wear shorts , they wear baseball hats . They watch basketball games . They love movies . They get so excited . There 's nothing greater than doing a scene ... ... and for them to get excited . Monday ! Monday , I will no longer just be a computer nerd . I will be a superhero ! They search for clarity . They 're very thoughtful ... ... and yet they 're very ... . They have a wonderful sense of humor . Action ! It 's really ... ... you know , unusual that directors ... ... are so sure of what they want . They know exactly what they want ... ... what angle they wanna see it at ... ... what the actors should say ... ... when he takes a breath in his speech . They had storyboards of fight sequences that they wanted . Certain punches and kicks ... ... and flips they wanted to see . I see some of the framing of Frank Miller . There 's some ... ... Japanese angles ... ... and perspectives in it . Dodge this . They worked with people that they knew from the comic book world ... ... and designed these fantastic things . We went into the first Warner Bros. story meeting ... ... and they said , " Okay ... ... we know we 've bought something cool . We don 't know what it is . " " Could you take us through it once ? " It helped translate the movie for us . Nobody really understood ... ... the level of action we wanted in the action sequences . Then when we 'd show the storyboard to people , they 'd go , " Whoa . Jeez . " The scale that you can pull off ... ... with comics is just always fantastic . You can freeze a moment and make an image ... ... that 's sort of sustained . There 's some action that we can do a lot better in comics ... ... and some things that were better in film . Kung fu is great on film . We 're supposed to start with these programs first . That 's major boring shit . Let 's do something more fun . How about ... " Jujitsu " ? I 'm going to learn jujitsu ? And action ! Just roll your chest down . Bring it down . One of the things that we love about Hong Kong action ... ... is how they shoot fight scenes with the long takes and wider angles . But they also do this wire work ... ... which is very fluid and people , you know , fly around ... ... and jump incredibly . It 's very balletic and everybody ... ... has a superhuman , supernatural grace . We wanted to bring that kind of wire work to our movie . Cut ! Raise up ! You don 't have to go up so high . More out . It just looks better . At first , Larry and Andy were frustrated because their dream was to work ... ... with this guy that did Fist of Legend . Through contacts in Hong Kong ... ... we tracked the guy down and it turned out to be Wo Ping . Wo Ping rocks . He 's one of the best . We love his movies . We been watching them for years . I think it 's good for Laurence . He said , " I really don 't know how they got my number . " He was in Beijing making a movie ... ... and got a call saying the brothers were interested in him . He said , " I 'm very busy . I don 't have the time . " And the call came again . He read the script and he ... ... thought it was a very brilliant script . So he decided he should do it . One of the incredible experiences here , unlike any movie I 've done ... ... is that our four leads spent ... ... 3 or 4 months training with Wo Ping and his Hong Kong stunt team . These aren 't athletes , but actors . To paint your house , you hire a painter , not an actor pretending he 's a painter . They really had to learn ... ... a fighting style they never had learned before . It was a tremendous hardship ... ... but it 's evident on the film that that 's Laurence , Carrie-Anne ... ... and Keanu in those scenes doing that stuff ... ... and it 's astounding . We started training in October of ' 97 . Trained all the way ... ... through till March of ' 98 . That was on , like , an everyday basis . One , two , three ! Ready ? It was a very involving , exhausting process . I initially thought we were gonna be doing kung fu for maybe ... ... 4 or 5 weeks . Something like that . It ended up being months and months of training . The interesting thing is in the challenge . The challenge is how to make these people look like they know ... ... and are born with the skills . We all sort of have our own person ... ... that is our teacher . Mine is Mo Dai . He really held my hand in the beginning ... ... and was very hard on me at the same time . Chu is Keanu 's main guy ... ... and Chu doesn 't speak any English . Then we have Dion , who oversees us , and he speaks ... ... better English than the rest . And he 's sort of our go-between ... ... Wo Ping and us . We 've had various movie kung fu dojos ... ... in Los Angeles and in Australia ... ... and at lunch , we 'd sit with our legs ... ... trying to open the rusty gates and stretch . Watch kung fu movies and see what was good and bad . Action . I really didn 't know ... ... if I would be able to do what they were asking me to do . I was going every day , getting on the wires ... ... and being lifted up just to get the feeling of being on the wire . Practicing , sort of getting up the wall ... ... and then having the wall padded and going along the padded wall ... ... and them taking the pad off and me being terrified . I couldn 't do the wire the day they took the pads off ... ... because I was so afraid . He 's very inventive and organic , the way he works . You must have your own style , but you also have to have ... ... you know , good kung fu . Initially , I think Wo Ping and the wire team , they took us on ... ... and thought we were useless , which we were , hopeless at kung fu . But they realized after a couple weeks ... ... maybe we were gonna be able to get to a level where we 'd be ... ... halfway decent . It was really intense , but it was a lot of fun . And again it 's ... . It 's the kind of thing ... ... that you very rarely get an opportunity to do something like this . I feel incredibly blessed to have ... ... worked with Wo Ping and his team . So what do you need ? Guns . Lots of guns . I 'm gonna pass out to everybody a rubber handgun ... ... to go over the weapons parts ... ... and you can physically have something . These are 100 % safe . Turn ! Kill ! Pick up your weapon and hold it with two hands in front of you . Almost everyone has a great position . We tried to ... ... not do guns how they 're always done . The guns should be at each other 's- - What do we do ? Directors ! Yes . I tried to make it kind of funny . Please remove any metallic items you 're carrying . Keys , loose change . The sets on the picture ... ... all originated from the visual design ... ... that Larry and Andy achieved in storyboarding the film . They were executed , built and designed ... ... by Owen Paterson , who 's our production designer . It 's full of details . We 're trying to create ... ... an environment which is just an illusion . This is my ship . The Nebuchadnezzar . This is the main deck . Don 't pull it anymore ! And we 're trying to use ... ... contemporary technology and a slightly retro fashion ... ... and something that looks different to your archetypal spaceship . We 've fallen back a great deal onto , and utilized ... ... as Larry and Andy wanted us to , Geof Darrow 's drawings , which were ... ... the original concept . We tried to promote that idea of reality that isn 't real . You 'll look at it and go , " That 's a real place . " There are the illusions within it . There 's some of the most spectacular stunt stuff ... ... I 've been involved with . There 's style and visual effects that has not ever been seen before . " Bullet Time . " Registered trademark . Enter " the Gaeta . " " The Gaeta Force . " Let 's get the wind cue right . Nobody 's around . In this particular rig ... ... there are 1 20 cameras and two motion-picture cameras set up . Bullet Time was conceived for The Matrix specifically ... ... but I think it 's the byproduct of the directors ... ... observing technology and asking ... ... the right question at the right time . That 's the money cam at the end ... ... that last one , where the bullet will come over your head . I could shoot the same exact stunt several times over . I can also do things like go forward in time ... ... or stop the camera abruptly and move backwards ... ... while the action continues to move forward . I can create a three-dimensional construction of the object . Everything begins with a simulation ... ... and all the math for the shot . Works backwards from there . These guys have a lot ... ... of specific notions about the worlds that they 're creating . They 're pretty over the top . You 're allowed to do things you wouldn 't normally do . We were going to slow motion to high-speed ... ... jump-cutting , crossing the line , everything . To achieve what seems like a fairly simple thing to do ... ... to fly a helicopter down the front of a building ... ... and rescue someone by jumping out a window . It seems , if we see it in the film , a seamless object . But in fact , it 's been shot in two different buildings . It 's been shot on a big set . To figure out how to make that scene work- - We wanted the glass to explode in sort of an ever-expanding circle . To actually figure out how to make the glass do that ... ... and what glass to use , it probably took ... ... three months of heavy-duty research . It 's such a rare experience ... ... for a group of actors in film , maybe in theater , to work together- - We 'll have worked together for a year ... ... by the end of this . It 's been a great , kind of , melding ... ... of heart and soul and spirit and action . Working on a film of this magnitude ... ... has been an enormous eye opener for me . It 's kind of chased away a few demons for me ... ... and it 's educated me more . Working on a film with this budget and on this scale has been great . I really think that this is the first film of the next century ... ... of the millennia ... ... the year Y2K , they 're calling it . It is monumental . I think it is- - It 's groundbreaking . Something people have never seen before ... ... and it 's gonna take people 's breath away . There will be a lot of films that will be disciples of this movie . Andy and Larry will start ... ... a new visual style , you know ... ... that will be very ... ... well-known and well-remembered . Ripped with SubRip 0.97b Corrected by CdinT ( Cristi _ Polacsek @ SoftHome.net ) I deliver perfection ... and don 't brag about it ! : D I deliver perfection ... and don 't brag about it ! : D Bullet-time is a stylistic way of showing ... ... that you 're in a constructed reality ... ... and that time and space are not the same as ... ... you know , us today , living our lives . It 's slowing down time to such an extent ... ... that you really see everything around you ... ... as clearly as you possibly could . Bullet-time was conceived for The Matrix , specifically . But I think it 's the byproduct of ... ... the directors observing the controls coming into place . And then they ask the right question at the right time . You always know that you 're doing something groundbreaking ... ... if someone asks something , that you go : " Maybe . Maybe , if we do some development ... ... and get the right minds working on it . " And it takes some pretty heavy thinking to get it together . Everything begins with a simulation . All the computer simulation information is the basis ... ... of the timing sequence . Each camera has a specific moment in time to fire a frame of film . All that is taking into account ... ... the net , total effect of the move . That is , a camera coming up to speed , moving out of speed ... ... and coming off of speed . In this particular rig ... ... there are 120 cameras and two motion-picture cameras set up . The rig that we 've made ... ... can be configured into any shape that you want . The shapes are basically what we compose ... ... in our simulations . It can do " S " curves . It can do arcs . It can do spirals . It can do anything you want . It 's an erector set . The heights of the cameras , where they point ... ... also from same simulation . In the middle of that box right there ... ... is a motion control laser-pointing system ... ... that takes an animation file and creates a point ... ... on the cube 's surface , telling where to point the camera . The two motion-picture cameras that 'll be in this particular shot ... . That 's running at 150 . That one 's running at 120 . There are bullet-times where the end camera is a Photosonics camera . So we 'll be running that at 360 . I can choose , at will ... ... any elapsed real-world time ... ... to photograph . That is , if I have a guy falling over ... ... I can choose to capture the whole event ... ... in the time it takes to go around the circle . I could choose to capture only a very brief moment . And that is how we determine what frame rate ... ... the cameras eventually wind up . I could shoot the same exact stunt several times over ... ... creating a simulation of 100 frames per second ... ... 500 or 2000 frames per second ... ... all with the same camera move , moving at the same speed and time . I can go forward in camera motion ... ... and forward in time with the event . I can stop the camera abruptly ... ... start moving backwards while the action continues to move forward . I can shoot the move coming from both sides at the same time ... ... crisscrossing over and ending . I could shoot in waves , you know , cycles of film ... ... that crisscross like waves over the middle . There is a very heavy digital half to this capture . Not every frame that a camera captures ... ... is the only frame that will be seen . There 's a lot of a process we called " interpolation " ... ... which is the creation of frames , digitally ... ... that are the byproduct ... ... of real frames . That is , we analyze what real frames we have . And we can create new frames ... ... of moments in between the captured frames ... ... to make moves longer ... ... or stretch them out , or do time-compression effects . There 's a lot of work going on ... ... in the art form of interpolation . It needs to be said , because it 's not " what you see is what you get . " It 's all baby steps toward something much larger ... ... that won 't be really commonplace for a few years . But there are people around the world ... ... that are sort of scratching their heads ... ... about a new way to photograph things . It 'll be as revolutionary as when cameras came off sticks ... ... and went to a crane ... ... when they came off of cranes and went to Steadicams . We 're talking about cameras that are now ... ... broken from the subject matter , that are virtual . That 's the next phase . That 's what computers ... ... have introduced into cinematography .

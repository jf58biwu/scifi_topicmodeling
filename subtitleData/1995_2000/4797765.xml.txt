 ( Siren blaring ) Chuck Fishman : What if you knew beyond a doubt what was going to happen tomorrow ? ( Bell tolling ) Sure , I know it 's crazy , but what if you did ? Whether you 'd be rich or poor , a hero or a loser , lucky in love , unlucky in life ; what would you do ? What if , by some magic , you found the power to really change things ... People , events , maybe even your life . ( Man whistling , dog barking ) Would you even know where to start ? Maybe you can 't know until it happens . Marsha ? Marsha , it 's me . ( Window raising ) Hon ? Hon ? Happy anniversary ! Heads up . ( Theme music playing ) ? Radio reporter : Good morning . It 's Monday in Chicago , and here 's what 's in the news today . The white house announced it will not attend trade talks with Japan . The president called his decision final and reaction ... ( Sighs ) ( Sighs ) ( Knocking at door ) Marsha ... ( Truck horn honking ) ( Sighs ) Marsha ? Hey . Happy anniversary , or whatever one says . Cruller ? So , no news , huh ? Nope . I called her a dozen times , and all I got was the machine . Well , that 's an improvement . Last week , she was hanging up on you . Mm-Hmm . I just hope she 's all right , that 's all . She 's a lawyer , Gary . Of course she 's all right . I don 't know . Maybe I ought to stop by and see her or something . Yeah . Maybe this time , she 'll toss you a lamp . Don 't you have anything nice to say ? The cubs look good this year . The cubs stink . And I hate crullers . So do I. Look , Gare , I 'm your best friend . How do I put this delicately ? You think it 's over . Finito . Kaput . Dead as a doornail . She threw you out , you 're living in a hotel . Doesn 't that tell you something ? The towels are free . ( Cat meowing ) ( Thudding against door ) Gary : What 's this ? Looks like a cat on a newspaper . Shh ! Go on . Go on . ( Meowing ) Since when do they have cats in hotel rooms ? I didn 't order this paper . Maybe it 's to keep away the rats . Oh , no , I hate rats . That 's funny . Rats ? No , this headline . It 's wrong . I just heard on the radio that ... Hey ! Come on . We 're late for work . We got to get a move on it . Pritchard 's on the warpath again . If we don 't start generating profits , we 're not gonna have a job tomorrow . Wow . ( Phone ringing ) Marsha ? Woman 's voice : Good morning . This is your wake-up call . You know what ? You 're hopeless . Have a nice Monday . I 'll see you at the office . And , uh , try to come in before lunch . Yeah . Guess some guys have all the luck . ( Horn honking ) This is gonna be one hell of a Monday . Oh , well , aren 't we dapper today . Did you buy that jacket pre-wrinkled ? Sherman , don 't ask . Here you go . The usual . Oh , I already read it . Oh , buying from the competition , huh ? I didn 't buy it . Huh . I 'm feeling better already . There . An actual smile . You know , kid , you got to take better care of yourself . Try eating something other than gum . No , that 's okay , it 's on me . Thanks , Sherman . Hey , kid ! What ? Who do you like , bulls or the magic ? The bulls took it by ten last night . Where did you hear that ? I read it in the paper . ( Laughing ) : What ? ( Phone ringing ) Strauss and associates . Can you hold , please ? Thank you . Good morning , Gary . How do you always know it 's me ? That 's easy . Got a nose for gabardine . Did you get the dog ? Nope . Fell through . I 'm back on the waiting list . Sorry . Don 't be . I hate sorry . Of course , I could always get lucky , win 15 k and buy myself a pooch . Good luck . Hobson ! Marissa : Same to you . Strauss and associates . Can you hold , please ? Let 's see . Almost 10 : 00 o 'clock . Thinking of doing some trading today ? That 's right , Mr. Pritchard . I 'll tell you what . While you 're at it , try making a profit . Or would that be breaking your string ? ( Laughs ) That was a good one . Can it . I hate that guy . I hate this tie . Well , you 're gonna like this . I got a hot tip with a capital h . From where ? The men 's room . This one can 't miss . That 's what you said the last time . Trust me . Oh , man ! What happened ? Why me ? ( Taps keyboard ) I think you just lost your shirt . You know , I never learn , do I ? I got to find myself a new men 's room before I lose the rest of my sleeves . Hey , Chuck , what 's the point of all this ? What ? This . What we do . What 's the point of this ? What do you think , we 're here for our health ? The point is to make money . Accrue power . Wipe the other guy out . Things very near and dear to my heart . Well , I thought the point was to , uh , make a living . Get married , have kids , the American dream . Where you been ? That was in the ' 50s . You know how I got started in this business ? 'Cause Marsha wanted to go to law school . Wow ! Look at winter wheat . It 's really moving . Don 't touch it . It went up 30 yesterday . It 's gonna drop . Gare , wake up . Yesterday was Sunday . Market was closed . I read the paper . What paper ? This morning , the headline . It said winter wheat ... Jumps 30 . Nah . Nah . Where ? There . They cleaned the room . They cleaned the room . ( Engine chugging ) Gary : Hey , wait ! Hold that ! Wait ! Wait ! Hold up ! Stop ! Hold it ! No ! Stop ! Stop that truck ! Wait ! ( Sighs ) What ? I don 't believe this . I don 't believe this . Neither do I. Something like this comes along once in a lifetime , and you lose it . What ? I 'm gonna kill myself . What are you ... what ? What are you talking about here- - a newspaper that tells the future ? Shh ! Look , you saw the numbers , right ? We rallied at 30 . Not 29 , not 31 , but 30 . Just like you read . Now , how do ... How do you explain that ? Coincidence . Coincidence ? Did you read the sports pages ? Gary : Yeah , kind of . UCLA versus Kentucky . UCLA , 95-85 . World cup soccer , Brazil and Italy . Brazil , three-two . Yes ! You 've been reading the soccer scores . All right , well , tell me this- - where does it come from ? The newspaper fairy . Who knows . The point is , it 's gone . Unless it comes back again . You know , this is crazy . I 'm gonna go call Marsha . You know , that 's just like you . Heaven passes right under your nose , and you don 't even blink . You know , maybe she 'll talk to me . Gary Hobson ? Yeah . Process server . Huh ? Have a nice divorce . Sorry , buddy . ( Laughter in distance ) ( Coughing ) Hey , mister , can you spare some change ? ( Coins clinking ) ( Coughing ) ( Coins clacking into cup ) Thanks , mister . You 're a nice man . Yeah , what do I do now ? Anything can happen . Radio reporter : Good morning . It 's Tuesday in Chicago , and here 's what 's happening . ( Paper thuds against door ) ( Cat meowing ) ( Paper thuds against door ) ( Cat meows ) ( Meowing ) Anything can happen . ( Cat yowls ) ( Siren wailing ) Hey , what happened to you ? Sherm . Get mugged by an iron , sleep at the cleaners , and a smile . Like the cat who ate the canary . So ... we 're making some changes , huh ? You might say that . Well , nice to see you back on your feet again . Paper ? Nope , saw that one already . You 're going to put me out of a job . You 'll live . Yeah , I suppose so . Thanks , Sherm . Hey , kid . What is it ? That canary you ate ? Don 't know exactly yet , but I 'm gonna find out . Radio announcer : The weather today in Chicago is going to be beautiful . Hey , don 't believe it . You 're going to need an umbrella . Zero chance of rain in the five-day ... And now . Chuck : Hey , man . How you doing ? Busy . Listen , if it means anything , I 'm really sorry about everything that 's been going on for you , you know , with Marsha and every ... It came ? It came . Yes . Yes , yes , yes , there is a God ! Okay , so tell me . What 'd we buy ? We ? You . Just tell me , what 'd you buy ? Tell me , too . I love a secret . Just buying and selling . Based on what information ? I 'll handle this . Based on ... Based on ... You handle this . Instinct . Instinct . Instinct . Pritchard : That 's almost funny . Cancel those trades . Who , me ? Yeah , you . If you want to keep your job . Go ahead , do as the man says . And speaking of future employment , Hobson , perhaps it 's time we discussed yours . And that is ... ? Not rosy . I need sharks . Sharks make profit . Sharks succeed , you don 't . Am I making myself understood ? Uh , Mr. Pritchard , I 'm afraid there 's some bad news . Those trades went through . How much did we lose ? Nothing , actually . They ... they all went up . Six and a quarter , five and an eighth , and eight and a quarter . ... Eight and a quarter . Well ... Well done . How big were we in ? One share each . What 'd you say ? You heard me . One share each . Assure me you 're joking . No joke . Look , I don 't need this . I 'll have your job , buddy . Well , you got it . Keep it in a safe place . You 're quitting ? I guess I just don 't like wearing a tie . Marissa , you busy this afternoon ? Booked solid . What you got in mind ? How about lunch ? On me . Where ? Sky 's the limit . Announcer ( Over P.A. ) : Welcome to off-track betting . Please place your bets . Hey , Charlie , got some luck for me today ? Eh , no chance . The usual ? Yeah , two dollars on the number four horse . It 's your money . Gary ? Lunch . Gary : How 's the food ? Terrible . You come here every day , huh ? Yep , one bet , two bucks , take a shot at a dream . Announcer : It 's the number three horse Gordon shadow by a nose . The number four horse ... And then it 's back to the grind . Easy come , easy go . Announcer ( Over P.A. ) : Ladies and gentlemen , one minute to post time for the second race . Please place your bets . Order some food , I 'll be right back . Uh ... Biscuit in the second . It 's a long shot . Maybe . Announcer : And coming out of the turn is Marta 's girl , followed by Eloise , and biscuit running third and moving up on the inside , followed by Marty 's hope and Dylan 's deal . Biscuit now pulling away , Eloise dropping back along the railing , and , at the wire , it 's biscuit by three lengths , Eloise , and Marta 's girl . Incredible . Welcome back . So , you like your food lukewarm or cold ? Announcer : Place your bets for the sixth at Belmont . The horses are now approaching the gate . I 'll be right back . Oop , wait . Nice talking to you . 26 on apple cart . Your funeral . Announcer : It 's apple cart coming from nowhere , apple cart pulling away , and it 's apple cart at the wire . Yes ! ( People groaning ) There you go . A lot of George Washingtons in there . Let it ride . Are you nuts ? On who ? Sikorsky to win . 50 on Sikorsky ! Sikorsky ! ( Starting bell rings ) Announcer : And they 're off . Siamese Dream breaking fast , Zuckers notion on the outside , Sikorsky trailing the pack . Come on , Sikorsky ! Come on , baby ! Gary , what are you doing ? Come on , baby . This is where you 've been ? Uh-huh . How much did you spend ? A dollar ? ( Laughs ) Now Sikorsky 's making a move . Come on , baby . At the turn , it 's Zuckers notion and Sikorsky neck and neck . Zuckers notion and Sikorsky down the stretch . Come on , Sikorsky , come to papa ! It 's a two-horse race . Come on , baby . Sikorsky and Zuckers notion nose to nose . And at the wire it 's ... Zuckers notion . Yeah- - ( People groaning ) Zuckers notion by a nose , Sikorsky , and Siamese dream . No , no , that 's impossible . No . No , no , that 's impossible . Your attention , please . Ladies and gentlemen , hold your tickets . Zuckers notion has been disqualified . The winner is Sikorsky . ( Cheering ) Ha , ha ! So you want to tell me how you did it ? I already told you- - luck . You want to tell me why you did it ? I thought it 'd be fun . ( Chuckling ) : I see . Fun . Well , this is my train . Thanks for the afternoon . It was , um ... Different . Take care of yourself . Marissa ? Yeah . I want you to take the winnings from today . I can 't take this , Gary , this is yours . Now you can get the dog you 've been waiting for . Gary , wait . ( Muffled ) : Gary ! Chuck : No , no , no , no , no . I refuse to accept this . Hey , take it easy , will you ? All right , Gary , look , just run this by me again , okay ? You took the paper ... Two beers . You went to a betting parlor , you won money , and then , you gave it away . I gave it away . Why ? She needed a dog . A dog ? Why not ten dogs ? Why not a whole kennel ? Well , I don 't know , it seemed like one dog was enough . Gary , this thing is not some kind of toy , okay ? It 's a very powerful tool . A tool ? Yes , for getting very rich . No , no , no . This is opportunity with a capital " o . " You can 't just let it wither on the vine . It goes against nature . Whose nature ? Mine . Yeah , but it doesn 't come to you , it only comes to me . You don 't know that for sure , now , do you ? ( Thunder rumbles ) Meaning ? Meaning maybe it comes to him . How are you ? Up yours . Or maybe it comes to people all over the world , they just don 't talk about it . Well , what do they do with it then ? What any normal person would- - they make money , lots of it , and they spend it on clothes and yachts and presidential campaigns . Oh , my God . Gary , look , just give it a try , all right ? Take it from me , we got nothing to lose . Look , no one gets hurt , no one even knows . Do it for me . What do you got to lose ? Chuck . ( People clamoring ) It 's the newsstand . Sherman . Excuse me . Whoa , whoa , whoa , move back . What happened ? Hey , what happened ? You want to know ? Read tomorrow 's paper . ( Thunder rumbling ) I missed it . ( Siren wailing ) I missed it . ( Gulls keening in distance ) ( Meowing ) ( Dog growls softly ) ( Panting ) It 's about time . What are you doing here ? Your bellman let me in . Look , if it 's all right with you , I don 't want any company right now , so ... I don 't give a rat 's butt about what you want . What 's wrong with you ? What ? Nothing . I 'm fine . ( Dog whining ) What 's your dog 's name ? Spike . What 's your cat 's name ? That 's not my cat . Acts like he 's your cat . It 's not my cat . Now , what is your problem ? Look , I told you , I don 't have a problem , I 'm fine . No . You quit your job , you take me out for a lunch you don 't eat , and then you drop 15 grand in my lap and disappear off into the sunset . I mean , who do you think you are , the lone ranger ? Oh , that 's very funny . You know , Gary , there 's lots of people in this world that think that being blind is the same as being stupid . Are you like that ? You think I 'm stupid ? No , I don 't think you 're stupid . Then tell me . All right , fine . You want to know about it ? Because of me , there 's a guy in the hospital and he might never wake up , and I could have stopped that . You want to hear about that ? Yes , I do . And that 's about it . It comes every day , like it or not . Which you don 't . You got it . Where 's it coming from ? The hallway . That 's not what I mean . Can you- - could you , uh ... ( Wry laugh ) Maybe it comes from God . Oh , right , yeah . Yeah , God 's a cosmic paperboy . Look , if God can be a burning bush , he can be any damn thing he likes . You don 't really believe that , do you ? World 's full of miracles , Gary . You don 't always need eyes to see them . Yeah . Well , I 'm not too big on miracles right now . Well , that 's too bad , being as it 's happening to you . Well , yeah , why me ? I 'm just an ordinary guy . I 'm no superman . What , am I supposed to run around in a little red cape and save the world ? You might look good in a cape . Oh , you think that 's funny ? Well , let me tell you something , I didn 't ask for this thing . I don 't want it and I don 't need it . Give the damn thing to somebody else . ( Cat meows ) Gary , you don 't need to be a hero to make the best of what you 're given . And you 've been given this . What am I supposed to do with it ? You 're supposed to do whatever you can . " A tragic series of events " ended in disaster Monday afternoon " in a bank on Chicago 's South side . " An out-of-work factory worker , Frank price , " who had earlier been turned down for a loan , " returned to the bank , armed , near closing time . " Authorities say the suspect panicked " when the teller set off an alarm . ( Alarm bell ringing ) " By the time it was over , " nine people were dead , including the suspect himself . " Oh , no . Uh-uh . ( Spike barks ) You can give me a cat in a tree or a flat tire on the bus , but not this . You could at least tell someone . Who ? Hey , Gare , where you been ? ( Spike growls ) Good doggie . Oh , look , the paper . You could tell the police . I am not going to the police . ( Indistinct police radio communication ) I 'd like to report a situation . What kind of situation ? A future one . Tagliatti . Come on , let 's go . ( Knocking ) Detective Tagliatti ? Mm-Hmm . Uh , I , uh ... I can 't wait to hear . I want to report a crime . Well , lucky for you you 're in a police station . Sit down . When did it happen ? Today ? N-not exactly . Yesterday ? Last week ? Well , it hasn 't happened yet , but it 's going to , unless you stop it . Domestic dispute ? No . No , it 's a robbery . Well , at least it starts out that way at the first national bank . Well , you see , at least it 's gonna be . Uh-huh . Do you have any I.D. ? Yeah , uh ... The guy 's name is Frank price . He 's out of work , he got turned down for a loan and , uh , he 's a very desperate man . Okay , let me get this straight . We 've got a guy , a bank , a loan , some kind of robbery ? Well , no . It 's not a robbery yet , but it 's gonna be . Gonna be . Just for the record , not that I doubt you , you know this because ... ? ( Softly ) : Oh , I can 't tell you that . O 'Grady ? Have you heard of anything over at first national bank ? Yeah , flying saucers . So we 're on to it . Thank you . They almost locked me up . Good call , Marissa . Who asked you ? Oh , a little sensitive . Hey , could we just get out of here ? ( Spike barks ) Forget it . Gary , listen to me . Yeah , listen to you , I 'll end up in the loony bin . All right , I was wrong , so sue me . Right , no harm done . You tried , you failed . A noble effort , move on . Gary , where do we start ? The bank . How 's that ? Sports . Sports are good . Maybe it 's not enough to tell someone . Maybe you have to be there . Oh , no , no . We are , we are not going down to that bank . Good call . Check out the NBA . Well , it 's worth a try . Yeah , we tried , it didn 't work . Of course , there 's always the NHL . So you 're just gonna throw in the towel ? You 're just gonna stick your head in the sand ? Oh , no , no , no , that 's not fair . You know you can 't do that . All right , let 's just relax , okay , mother Theresa ? Look , butt out . Go walk your dog . Now , you see what you did ? Easy , boy , okay . ( Growling ) Look , I did everything I could do . I 'm sorry . Sorry ... Well , where are you going ? I always hated that word , sorry . Go figure . Come on , spike . ( Spike whimpers ) Gary , here 's your paper . Uh , listen , I forgot I had a 1 : 15 , so I 'll see you later . Chuck ( Shouting ) : Taxi ! Gary : Ten ? I thought it was nine . Ten ? Marissa . Seven , eight , page nine . Page nine . Where 's page nine ? Chuck ? ( Announcer calls plays on TV ) Run , baby ! Run , baby ! Yeah , yeah ! Touchdown ! Yes ! I don 't believe this . The bears haven 't run the ball in two years . How did you know that ? Intuition . That 's 50 bucks , pal . Thank you very much . All right , anybody else want to get in on the action ? I 'm feeling , like , a maybe a , uh , fake punt in O.T. Anybody ? I 'm feeling very lucky today . It 's my night . Page nine . I have no idea what you 're talking about . Hey , what are you doing ? Gary , easy . Stop , huh ? Oh . That page nine . I-I thought ... That 's page ten . That 's not page nine . Gary , where you going ? Hold it , Gary . Listen , fellas , I got to go . Taxi ! Gare , Gare , look , it 's not what you think . I was betting with my guts , my instincts . I barely looked at the paper at all . I need some money . How much you got in there ? Five bucks . $ 3,700 and change . Hey , that 's my good briefcase ! First national bank and move ! Gary , hey , give me- - hey , Gary ! Oh , taxi ! Marissa ! Well , if it isn 't the king of sorry . Yeah , Marissa , you got to get out of here , now . Gary , calm down . I told them . Everything is under control . What 'd you tell them ? I told them to be on the lookout for a desperate man . Uh-oh . " Uh-oh " what , Gary ? Nobody ... All right , nobody move ! I 'm a desperate man ! ( Alarm bell rings ) You want to tell me what 's going on here or am I going to have to guess ? All right , get down . ( Customers murmuring anxiously ) ( Alarm bell ringing ) Frank ? Frank , you don 't want to do this . Halt ! ( People screaming , shouting ) Frank ! Hi . How do you know my name ? Uh ... Frank : Out here . Now ! My God , how did this happen ? ( Police sirens blaring ) Move ! Move ! Move ! Where ? Anywhere . Frank , are you sure you want to do this ? Shut up ! Okay , no problem . Let 's go ! Move it ! Move it ! Come on , hurry ! All right , what have we got here ? Sir , it 's hard to say . Well , say it anyhow . It looks like a robbery . Caught the guy ? Kind of . Marissa : Get your hands off of me ! You arrested a blind woman ? ! We think she 's the lookout . The lookout ... ! For the guy on the roof . What guy ? The guy with the gun . The gun ? There might be a gun . We 're not sure . Is that it ? Not exactly . Well , spit it out . There 's a hostage . Perfect . Six months to retire and I got to deal with this . Where 's my phone ? Where 's my walkie ? Where 's the damn coffee ? You , uh , see any flying saucers ? Not yet , but I 'm looking . Don 't you know your job ? Oh , my God . What is going on ? Gary ... Not so fast . Come on back here . Excuse me . Who do you think you are ? I 'm , uh ... Federal marshal Rabinowitz . Never mind that . Who 's in charge ? Come on , get out of here . Tagliatti : Wait . I know this guy . Let him through . God , this is not what I wanted . Yeah , I know what you mean . Are you a cop or something ? No . Talk . The cubs look good this year , huh ? Cubs ? The cubs suck . Well , that 's what I meant to say . The cubs suck . Detective , just hear these people out . I don 't have time . They may have some information . What kind of information ? Uh , first , keep an open mind . What kind of information ? About ... what 's going to happen . What are they , psychics ? Broker . Receptionist . And you call yourself a cop . Yeah . I 've been wondering that , too . All right , Mr. and Mrs. Houdini , you got 30 seconds . What do you know and how ? We read about it . Yeah , in the paper . Mm-Hmm . I didn 't see it , actually , I only saw the sports but , uh , she read it . ( Car tires screeching ) I just wanted for someone to listen , I didn 't ... And you had to screw it up . Why ? Listen , Frank , I don 't have time to explain . Just answer the question ! Because people were gonna die . What ... I wasn 't gonna , I ... Well , maybe I was I , I don 't know . Listen , Frank . How do you know my name ? Well , I know a lot about you . Look , the layoff at the plant , the medical insurance , you got turned down for that loan . Look , Frank , you got a raw deal . Look , I understand what you 're going through . You ? ( Sirens wailing , getting closer ) Don 't make me laugh , pal . I mean , look at you . I mean , what do you know about losing everything you thought you ever had ? ( Wry laugh ) Try me . First shot you get , take him out . Which one ? How should I know ? Shoot the bad guy . 16 years ... I worked that job . Never missed a day and ... You think you 're building s-s-something , like a future or your family and then ... Then one day , you know , ptth ! Just like that , it 's gone . Yeah . I looked everywhere for work and there 's nothing . It 's ... That 's , that 's why I came here . This is the place I keep my money in . Your savings , all those years and ... You know what they said to me ? They said they couldn 't take the risk . Like I was asking for a handout or ... Or like I was nothing . I was ... Yeah , and so , um ... What am I supposed to do now ? Yeah . It 's ... ( Sighs ) My wife 's gonna be really upset . She loves you , huh ? It was 19 years , you know you know , three kids . It 'd be a shame to lose that , Frank- - wife and kids . It 'd be a shame to lose that . Yeah , well you think that , um ... They never even saw the gun , Frank . And if money will help , it 's yours . Yeah , but did it help you ? No . ( Distant siren wailing ) ( Sighs ) So , what do we do now ? ( Indistinct police radio communication ) And you 're sure you want to do this ? Yeah . Gary : Hold your fire ! What the hell ? Oh , my ... Woman : It 's money ... ! ( Crowd applauds and cheers ) Man : It 's money ! That 's my money . Oh , no , no , no . That 's my money . You don 't understand- - that 's , that 's my money . Oh , no . ( Laughter and cheering ) Exact details are not yet clear . All we know is this hostage situation has been resolved . And thanks to some quick action by Chicago police , a potentially dangerous felon has been apprehended . You 're under arrest . Let 's move it . What 'd I do ? Gary : Easy . Easy . Hey , what 's going on ? Don 't know yet , exactly , but we 're sure as hell gonna find out . Right , superman ? Okay , let 's move . Gare ! Excuse me . You got five bucks for a cab , big guy ? ( Siren wailing ) Thank you . Anytime . Can I go now ? No reason to hold you . For the record , you wouldn 't want to change your story , would you ? To what ? Anything remotely believable . Nope . I just hope I never see you again . Next time ... Uh , there won 't be a next time , believe me . Yeah . ( Elevator bell rings ) Gare ? Gare ? Come on , reconsider ? Nope . ( Spike growling ) What about the cat ? What about me ? Spike , take care of her . Where are you going ? Where they can 't deliver . Thank you . Here you go . Whoa , whoa . Not so fast . Radio reporter : Good morning . It 's Wednesday in Chicago , and here 's the news at this hour ... ( Knocking on door ) ( Heavy muffled breathing ) I 'm here to spray for the roaches . ( Cat meows ) ( Paper thuds against door ) Chuck : There are no explanations , of course , but that 's nothing new . Magic 's like life , mostly unexpected ; which means , newspaper or not , you can never be sure what 's around the corner or what you 'll do when you find it . Hey , Marissa ? What took you so long ? I had a hunch about the lottery . I thought , uh ... Might send some of the money to Frank . Well , that 's a good idea . How 's Sherman ? Oh , he 's fine . Be back at the newsstand in two weeks . So , uh , decided what to do with the rest of your life ? Got to find a new place to live . A place that takes cats . Yeah . And then ? Got to buy a kitty litter box .

 Come on , you can do it . It 's hard to believe the universe even bothered putting a brain in that . 4.0 since the 9th grade . 1580 on his SAT 's National Merit Scholar . He 's excellent . Remember , just to the brink . You never got far enough to see the darkness in people . All you ever knew was love . That 's lucky . ( screaming ) Shh . Don 't disturb Daddy . He 's working . ( screams ) Excuse me , I 'm sorry , but I need to take some blood . It 'd be great if you and your little girl had the same blood type . I mean , that would like really be on your side . Is she gonna go into surgery ? The doctor didn 't say . The doctors never say . At least not to me they don 't . - Charlie ... - Ooo , I vant to drink your blood . Don 't . That is a very important sample . Some bitch of a specialist made a big deal about it . Nurse ? Do you have the Gregg sample ? The swimmer ? Yes , Doctor . It 's right here . ( sobbing ) Oh , thank god . Someone has to get the kitten out of the tree . - Oh , my baby . - I mean it , Mommy . Right now . Don 't worry , honey . We 're gonna get the kitten out of the tree , okay ? We 're gonna get all the kittens out of all the trees all over the whole wide world . You know what else we 'll do ? We 'll even put some kittens up in some trees just so we can get ' em out . Okay ? So this is it . That 's my dad . What a surprise ! Think he 'd miss his chance to share in the glory ? Maybe he brought the vintage champagne . May I have that , please ? Dad , we have to have that to the lab and processed in the next six hours or we go back to square zero . So you just happened to hear about this world class scholar and athlete who just happened to be at death 's door ? Well , we do have our contacts at all the major medical centers across the country . It would take a long time for something this perfect to just turn up . Well , I guess we got lucky . You got damn lucky , if you ask me . What exactly are you saying , Dad ? I 'm sure you 'll forgive me for jumping to unpleasant conclusions . See , I let you run with this project ... this minefield of a project ... because I thought it 'd do you good to be stuck with some consequences . But I think you know that this time when you bring the house down around your head ... there 'll be no building of libraries or prep schools so they won 't kick you out . Well , there won 't be a " this time " . " War Without Widows " is an idea whose time has come . Today , thanks to the joint efforts of the Department of Defense and Oslett Technologies ... we begin an awesome adventure . The age of sending our fragile irreplaceable sons to war is over . From a thread of DNA taken from a single human blood cell and implanted in the nucleus of an unfertilized egg ... we will forge a new warrior . A warrior who leaves no widows or orphans and feels no grief or fear . And with enough fuel his wounds will heal themselves almost instantly and he 'll be able to march for days with no sleep . And if I 'm to believe what the scientists are telling me about a gene that carries extra sensory powers ... he may even someday be capable of getting his orders telepathically . And he will never doubt the moral foundation of any order ... even in his heart . It 's that doubt that is a soldier 's greatest agony . He won 't have superhuman strength ... but his metabolism will be to yours and mine as ... well as the engine of a Lamborghini is to a bicycle . You 'll note the child has reached full gestation in only 19 weeks . If the growth agents we 've been experimenting with keep working miracles at the same rate ... he 'll be ready for the kind of work General Ames has in mind by the time he 's chronologically ten years old . It 's unfortunate this breakthrough comes at the expense of a tragic accident . Well , Senator ... I like to think that a brilliant young athlete ... even after death , has the opportunity to do great things . I mean , we 're standing at Kitty Hawk , my friends . We 're watching Columbus sail from Cadiz . ( crying ) - General ? - No , you go ahead , Drew . What is it , darling ? Are you all right ? Nothing . I think I just swallowed something the wrong way , that 's all . When my son first told me he wanted to be a writer , I told him he 'd better find himself a rich wife . When he told me he was going to marry an artist , I told his mother to get his old room ready for the day when he 'd have to throw himself on the mercy of his hard-working parents . I am so happy to say I haven 't been right yet . To my son , on the publication of his first novel , the first of many . And if any of you know where such a nice boy got the idea for the scene with the drill and the snake , please ... don 't tell me . To Marty . - Here , here . - Well said . Excuse me . I 'm just gonna get a little air . Kathy , could you take her for a second ? What 's going on ? I don 't know . It 's weird ... it 's ... I feel like I 'm scared or something . Do I need to call a doctor ? No , it 's ... it 's not physical . If there was something to be scared about , I 'd understand . Are you kidding ? What 's scarier than having all your dreams come true ? I think I feel better . I could get the kids out here on some pretext and we could all sneak away to Bora Bora . Why drag the kids into it ? You know , I 've seen photos of the swimmer at that age . There isn 't the slightest resemblance . With all the experimentation we did with his genetic makeup ... there was the possibility that we would alter his appearance but not his talents . Are you ready to meet Alfie ? Oh , yes . It 's okay , Alfie ... I brought a friend . This is General Ames . I 'd like you to meet him . Alfie . Actually , we met once before when you were a very little boy . I ... just came by to see how you 're doing . I 'm doing great , sir . Well , I 'm glad to hear that . I brought you a present . I hope you like checkers . Wow . I love checkers . I bet I could beat you . I 'll have to take you up on that . Alfie , you can beat the general at checkers later . Right now I have something very important that I 'd like to discuss with you . General , would you excuse us , please ? Of course . I 'll see you in a minute , Alfie . That 'd be great . Thank you . Alfie , you wanna send Pepper to his house ? Hey , go to your house , Pepper . Alfie , have a seat . I afraid I have some bad news . We 've discovered in our midst a dangerous spy . An assassin that was sent here with orders to kill all of us . What spy ? Where is he ? I 'll take care of him . Well , I 'm sorry that I have to tell you this ... but the assassin is Pepper . Pepper 's a dog . That 's true , but dogs can be trained . And it stands to prove what I 've always told you ... that you can only trust you and me . - He 's just a dog . - Alfie , you know what you have to do . Be at peace , Alfie . I 'm at peace , Father . Come here , Pepper . Come here , boy . No ! No ! Open this door . Pepper , come ! Get this door open . Alfie ! Sit . Stay . Alfie . Alfie ! That 's enough , Alfie , don 't hurt him . It 's a mistake . He isn 't a spy . It 's a mistake , Alfie . Make him stop . I said make him stop ! Be at peace , Alfie . The General 's right . We made a mistake . A fearless soldier is not the same thing as a heartless killer and if you 'd ever been within 10,000 miles of a combat zone ... that 's something you 'd know . I thought the entire point of this project was to create a fearless soldier who would never question the moral foundation of an order . I 'm pretty sure I heard that somewhere and I think I heard it from you . Well , that 's not what I see . I see a little boy who 's never learned to be sad , and I take full responsibility for that . Don 't be fooled by the " Aw , shucks , General , I 'd sure like to play checkers with you " demeanor . Alfie is a weapon . He is designed to be a normal human in the normal world ... but that 's all he is , a brilliant design . There is no more heart and soul inside of him than there is in a Patriot missile . I 'm pulling the plug on this project . You don 't have the authority to do that , General . I take my directives from the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee , not you . Daddy 's roommate at Harvard ? Princeton , actually . Well , then I 'll call my roommate from West Point . He 's military affairs editor for the " Post " . And I 'll make sure your father knows he has you to thank for the Pentagon review of all defense contracts currently held by Oslett Technologies . Big world , Alfie . Bigger than anybody told you . It 's filled with a lot of bad people . A lot of good people , too . It 's scary . I know . It 's okay , Alfie . Everything 's gonna be all right now . Hey , buddy . How do you feel ? Hungry . Of course you 're hungry . Your wounds are healing themselves . Can I go home now and watch TV ? Absolutely . Do you think you can walk ? Yes . Beyond belief . You 'd never know he was even scratched . I can 't believe we 're actually beginning . And if I have one penny left when this is finished ... I won 't have spent enough . And the rear mast is about to ... ( explosion sound - hollering ) We 've taken a hit ! Man the lifeboats ! Women and children first ! No , Captain , we will not abandon ship . We will stand by you till the end . My country ' tis of thee , sweet land of liberty ... Okay guys , be sure to do your homework . Don 't we always ? Tell Mom I 'm going for a drive . I 'll be back in an hour . Maybe Brett should get to San Francisco before the murder . That way we don 't know if his alibi is a fake until after Grace confesses to the Seattle job . Uh or Aw , you know what ? Forget it . If Brett gets to San Francisco before ... If Brett gets there before Grace , how does Walter find out the combination to the locker at the airport ? Maybe he could ... ( horns blaring ) ( tires screeching ) I need the number for a taxi , please . I blacked out , Paige . I blacked out and hallucinated at 60 miles an hour . You know what it 's gonna take for me to get behind the wheel again ? What if the girls had been in the car ? What did Dr. Guthridge say ? - Don 't cut so close to your fingers . - You know Paul . He won 't make a guess over the phone , so I 'm gonna go see him and let him run all the tests in the world . Meanwhile , I picked up this book when I was researching " Slow Bleed " . Look , cross-referenced by symptom . You do not need some Home Guide to Hypochondria to tell you that the stress you 've been under would crush many a lesser man than Martin Stillwater . Deadline on a new book , British rights bidding war , " Celebs " article on the stands , what , tomorrow ? Paige , stress is when you don 't have a bidding war going on over your British rights . ( sighs ) Listen to this . Blackout plus amnesia and hallucinating equals Alzheimer 's . I mean , if I was 40 years older . Stroke covers blackout and amnesia and doesn 't say anything about the hallucinating . Martin James Stillwater , look me in the eye and listen carefully . - You do not have a brain tumor . - I think I do . I mean , I think I might have something very , very serious . That 's what you thought a couple of years ago when you thought you had chest pains . Turned out to be a pulled muscle . - I was lucky . - You 're still lucky . Maybe that 's the problem . You know what they say about the Fates . Bunch of old lonely witches sitting up there weaving the same old rug for the last million years . They think somebody gets a little too lucky , they reach for the scissors . Any old ladies show up here with sharp sewing utensils , they 'll have to talk to me . ( festive music playing - people talking ) ( screams ) ( siren wailing ) Welcome to Fort Worth , Mr. Stiles . Would you like a map of the area ? A map is the last thing in the world I need . Old hand at Texas , are you ? Actually , no , I 've never been here before in my life . It 's a funny thing , though . Wherever my company sends me , I just almost automatically seem to know how to get where I need to go . Like a map has been planted in my head . Well , it sounds to me like your company has a very together travel department . By the way , this was delivered for you . - Hi , can I help you ? - Soda . Coming right up . ( TV Announcer : ) The de facto head of Peru 's military had been in the spotlight recently due to his vehement support for a widening of the already bloody border war with Bolivia . Sources report the suicide note contained references to dark thoughts Obregon was no longer able to control . James Ewald of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee commented today in Washington , " We are sorry for the sadness this may have caused the Colonel 's family , but there 's a chance this tragedy could open a possibility of a wide and lasting peace in South America . " Peace . Hi . You here for the book fair ? No . Actually , I 'm really quite busy right now . ( soft music playing - laughter ) ( cheering ) Whoa . Rock and Roll . Ask me how my day went . How was your day ? I don 't know . Lately I 've been feeling like , what 's the point . Hotel rooms and rented cars and one city after another ... No , I have a little girl . Well , she 's lucky that it 's against the rules . " Don 't leave a mess , Alfie . Don 't make a mess . " Get out . Hurry up . Get out ! You have the power to go that extra mile , for family ... Remember how mom ... ( telephone rings ) Are you there , Alfie ? Where else would I be ? That 's very funny . You really make me laugh sometimes . Is everything okay ? - When do I get to go home ? - You are home . You 're home every time you speak to me on the phone . No , I mean really home . Mom and Dad and groceries and a bicycle in the driveway . You 've really been watching too much television , Alfie . Alfie ... Be at peace , Alfie . No . Be at peace , Alfie . I am at peace , Father . Very good . Now , after a favor for me in Texas , you 'll be going to Miami . You 'll catch a plane tonight at midnight . Now turn off the television so we can discuss your responsibilities . Are you looking at the picture of my father and Kingman Flagg ? - I see it . - Good . That 's very good . Look , Daddy . I 'm the Queen of England . Daddy , look . Look , Daddy , I 'm the Queen of England . Daddy , look . And I am ... - Daddy , what 's wrong ? - Oh , nothing , sweetheart . Just a little headache I 've had all day . I 'll be okay . Now , where was I ? Ah , yes . And I am the evil Grand Duke Lingills , plotting to steal your Queendom ! ( playful screaming echoes ) Daddy ! Daddy . Daddy . What 's up ? Is everything all right ? Hello , Dad . Want to watch some television with me ? What is this ? I think the first report should be on just about now . Business associates have expressed shock at the heart attack death of eccentric petroleum magnate , Kingman Flagg . A police spokesman has just announced that although Flagg had declared a fight to the death against a takeover bid by Oslett Industries , no foul play is suspected . Kingman Flagg began his often bumptious career in the petroleum industry ... You heard ? Yes , well , we already know the nephews are ready to talk ... Excellent ... Yes , well ... Send flowers and a note with my , with my signature . Yes ... Bye . Fate . Ah , fate . Oh , she 's a nasty customer , isn 't she ? Fate ? Merry Christmas , Dad . Which means what ? Remember when we shut down the Triple W project after General Ames was killed in the car crash ? Yes . We didn 't really shut it down . We kept it going very quietly and it has surpassed our wildest dreams . We make these little beauties in Czechoslovakia , or whatever the hell they 're calling it these days . You can pack it with one cc of anything you like and it will dissolve in the human body within 15 minutes . You killed Kingman Flagg ? Me ? No . No , it wasn 't me . It was Alfie . The Alfa clone from the project . I mean , as far as anyone knows , Kingman Flagg died of a heart attack . And if Alfie should ever be caught , which of course he won 't be , he doesn 't know one name . He doesn 't know mine , he doesn 't know anybody 's . He doesn 't even know where he lives . I want you to leave . Go on , get out of here . Fine . Listen to me ... for the first time in my life I 'm doing something that is not about making money . Dad , this is something we can do together and I want you to be a part of it . Do you know what happened in South America yesterday ? No . No . I don 't want to know . Like you 've ever wanted to know anything about me ! You come in here , tell me that you 've murdered someone , and then play the neglected son ? The swimmer ... It wasn 't an accident , was it ? No . I mean , we couldn 't very well have the perfect soldier running around with the face of a gold medal swimmer , now could we ? So now you know everything . And you could turn me in . And erase me from your life forever . But , with the Flagg merger being investigated by the Justice Department , and 13 billion dollars at stake , I 'm not going to be packing for Leavenworth anytime soon . You know , I suppose it 's really no great loss . I mean , after all , we 've managed to get along just fine without you . " We " ? Who else is in this with you , Drew ? Excuse me , can you help me with something ? With what ? What 's it like to have a memory ? I know that 's a strange question , but ... I can remember how to drive a car and which way is left and right , but ... but not things in life , like on TV . Not Mom and Dad and the first time I rode a bicycle . I actually have to get back to work . No , listen ... please . This is important . See ... It 's all just blank . And that makes me really sad . Like , just now I had ... Well , it was the first time in my life , and I just want to be sure that it was a memory like on television , like ... like a television show in your head ... Look , could you just leave me alone , okay ? ( laughing ) Good night , Sheldon . Good night , Loretta . Good night , Bob . Good night , Peepers . I 'm going to the corner to see if the magazine 's on the stand . Just keep it where I won 't accidentally get a glimpse of it , please . Why do you always get so grumpy when somebody mentions the magazine article ? Because he doesn 't want to be a circus freak . But we all know it 's way too late for that . Why do they always think it 's so important to tell the world that I only have one kind of shirt ? Strangeness sells magazines . You know , a complete and total disinterest in fashion is a sign of ... distinguished intellect . Who said that ? Somebody said that , right ? Face it , Dad . You 're weird . Out of the mouths of babes . Good night . - Good night . - Good night , Mom . Okay . Here we go . Made you look . Ten points . Five , max . Seven and a half or no story . Okay , seven and a half . " At last , Thanksgiving is safely past ... More turkey eaten this year than last . It rhymes . More ' taters got stuffed , more yams got jammed ... into our mouths by using both hands ... Slaw by the bucket , biscuits by twos , We all got too fat to fit in our shoes ... It isn 't a day to be gloomy and listless ... I ask you , young ladies ... - what is it ? - It 's Christmas ! The reindeer galloped like bats out of hell . If that 's Santa 's driving ... then Santa 's not well . He hoots , he gibbers , he chortles and spits . Whoever knew Santa was this given to fits ? His mean little eyes spin like devilish tops , Somebody , somebody , call in the cops ! A closer look proves what we all guessed ... It 's psychosis ... and a really bad case of - back off - halitosis . So beware when Christmas comes this year ... " " Unattended vehicles are subject to immediate tow-away . For your safety and security , do not leave your baggage unattended . The white zone ... " " So beware , when Christmas comes this year ... Because there is something new to fear .

And I can 't take a plane ... because if I use my credit card they 'll trace me in a second . Now I know why they don 't give me much cash . Daddy ! Daddy , help ! Please , Daddy ! Honey , what 's wrong ? What is it ? Honey , what 's wrong ? What is that doing here ? " Deadly Twilight " , remember ? You swore you 'd send it back when you were finished with your research . I never got around to it . I don 't want it in the house , Marty . - We need it . - What for ? What are you afraid of ? I love you , Marty , you gotta tell me what 's going on . I don 't know . I 'm right here . Everything 's gonna be fine . ( telephone rings ) Yes ? I 'm in Miami . Guess who isn 't ? What ? He checked in for an 11 : 10 flight . His boarding pass has been handed in . Try to transcend denial , Drew . Our boy has gone AWOL . He can 't go AWOL , Carl ... because he can 't do anything without asking permission . Well , if ... you like that reality better . Do you think he 's hurt ? I mean , if he was hurt , we 'd know , right ? Well , he 's definitely out there and he 's on the move . How fast can you get to Phoenix ? - Fast . - All right . I 'll meet you in baggage claim at 3 : 00 p.m. Little do-it-yourself shoe repair ? Oh , no . I 'm figuring my company must have some kind of a way of tracking me . Some kind of transmitter of some kind . I haven 't found any implants under my skin ... so these shoes are about the only place it could be . Makes sense . I knew it . I knew they wouldn 't let me get away so easy . Hey ... You guys be careful today , okay ? Daddy , we 're gonna be late for school . Daddy , don 't move a muscle . Made you look ! Made you look !

Now , what exactly leads you to believe this was a panic attack ? Hyperventilating , my heart was pounding , it ... it felt like it was gonna explode . Sounds like sex . It wasn 't . Trust me . And Paige thinks it 's just stress , right ? Well , I 'm inclined to agree with her , Marty . I mean , just relax , you know ? A little fame won 't kill ya . What will ? Well , after a careful assessment of all the tests I 've run this afternoon ... I 'd have to say , old age . Look , there is someone that I want you to talk to . Her name is Bar ...

Oh , there 's so much to explain . So much to try to remember . I need you to come home now ... before the girls get home . You and I , we need to spend some time . Alone . Together . It 's been so long . Honey , is something wrong ? What did the doctor say ? I need you so much . Marty , what ... what 're you talking about ? Come home , Paige . Come home now . ( cellular phone rings ) - Hello . - Hi , honey . Hi . What was that all about ? What was what all about , honey ? I 'm ... I 'm back , come home now . You lost me , kid . A minute ago , you just called here acting as if ... I haven 't called anybody . You didn 't just call me ? Did somebody call and say they were me ? - Yes . - And they sounded like me ? Exactly . But not like you at all , it 's hard to explain . Well , I can explain it . Must be the article in the magazine . I swore I 'd never have to have an unlisted number , but I guess the time has come . Yeah , that 's probably it . Some unbalanced fan ... copying your voice . Do I have any other kind ? Of course not . Okay , bye , sweetheart . I 'll be home around 4 : 30 . Okay , bye . Dr. Guthridge 's office . Hi , Jan , it 's Paige . I need to talk to Paul about Marty . Oh , I 'm sorry . He 's with a patient right now . Could you see if he could give me a second ? It 's sort of an emergency . You 'd better clean up your act , Marty . You 're back home now ... with a wife that you can talk to about your writer 's block ... and anything else that 's bothering you in the whole wide world . Oh , my god . I need my life back . Are you a robot or a clone or is it just makeup ? No . Makeup wouldn 't have fooled Paige all this time . I need to speak to Dr. Guthridge ... No , tell him it 's an emergency .

" And then it 's " I am at peace , father " and then kiss and make up . Well , not this time . Now I know you 're not a robot . A robot wouldn 't have to use the phone . It would just transmit .

Get the girls out of here as fast as you can . What happened ? Take them to Vic and Kathy 's . And get the police here as fast as you can . Daddy , why do you have a gun ? - You 're bleeding . - It 's not my blood . Take them to Vic and Kathy 's now . They 'll be safe at the Delorio 's . Hurry ! Delorio . - Come with us . - I can 't . Take them over to Vic and Kathy 's . Hurry . - Drop it ! - Down the street ! Do it ! The Infiniti down the street , he 's getting away . Hands in the air . Don 't move . Hands in the air . - He 's getting away . - Kick it away from you , - Hands in the air . - He 's getting away . - Face down . Get down , now . - Hands behind your back . It 's okay . It 's okay . I 'm the one who called . I live here . This is my house . He 's my husband . He 's Marty Stillwater . Get back , lady , get back . Get back , honey . Please . Are the kids all right ? They 're fine . Okay , babies , I gotta go . The police are waiting . There 's a rumor about some chocolate chip cookies inside , but it hasn 't been confirmed . Go see Kathy . Lord almighty , what 's going on over there ? I 'd give everything I have for an answer to that question , Vic . Now please listen to me very carefully . No matter what happens , do not give the kids to anyone . Not the cops . No one . Unless Paige is with them . Not even to me . Not unless she 's with me . Not even you ? Only if Paige is with me , okay ? What ... what 's going on ? They 're waiting for me . Only Paige . Excuse me , sir , could I go ahead of you , please ? I really , really need to eat . Oh , well , you 'd have to take it up with the bosses here and well , I don 't think you 'd have much luck . Please . Look , forget it , man , okay ? The way I 've been engineered , I can heal anything that happens to me except getting my head cracked open . But all that bio-energy needs to come from some place . Now , you see these ... They were inside of my chest just ten minutes ago . I really appreciate it ! Victor Delorio . Quite a story . I want 24-hour protection for the house and for my children . That 's not my department , but I 'll pass it along . You 're entirely certain that you don 't have a twin brother ? He doesn 't have any brothers , he 's an only child . Now , the gun you shot this intruder with ... did you purchase that from a licensed gun dealer ? Yes , I bought it for research . I don 't like to write about a gun I haven 't used . Is the Heckler and Koch another weapon you purchased for research ? Heckler and Koch ? P7 . Fires nine millimeter ammunition . Do you have a license for it ? I don 't own a P7 . It was lying on the floor of your office . That was his gun . So there 's no license for it ? How would I know if there 's a license for it ? It 's not mine . In your ... research , Mr. Stillwater ... have you learned how much blood there is in the human body ? Say a body approximately the size of your own . 5 liters . That 's very good . As a guess , but an educated guess , I 'd say there 's somewhere between two and three liters of blood in various rooms in this house . Do you know what I expect to find with that much blood ? The body that it came from . That 's right ... Because it really does stretch the imagination to picture such a grievously wounded man being able to flee the scene . Do you see the problem I 'm having putting all this together ? I already told you , I don 't understand what 's going on here either . You have a new book coming out in a month or so , don 't you ? What 's that got to do with anything ? Ah , I 'd imagine that if ... Mr. Murder himself became the target of some ... mysterious killer ... a glossy magazine article would be just the beginning of all the free publicity . If you 're suggesting that my husband murdered his little girl 's pets as a publicity stunt , get the hell out of here . Now you do know it 's illegal to file a false crime report . And if the blood we found in this house did come from an animal , our lab will be able to determine the exact species . Let 's go . This time you 've gone right off the deep end . Au contraire , Detective . I don 't think we 've seen the half of it . And the next time you display doubt in your superior officer during an interrogation , I 'm gonna have you put on report . Who 're you calling ? My parents . Maybe they had twins and the hospital told them that the other one died but they sold it in some kind of illegal adoption or something . You don 't believe me . Marty , for 13 years your voice has been the first sound I 've heard in the morning and the last sound I 've heard at night . I know it like the sound of my own breathing . I didn 't call you today . He must have gotten your number here in the house before I got here . Would you believe this story if you heard it ? Would you have it happen to one of your characters ? Do you think I killed our own pets ? Took a sledgehammer to our own house ? Do you think I poured blood into our own rugs ? You had a blackout on the highway yesterday . Maybe you had another blackout and just went crazy or something . What happened on the highway yesterday was totally different . I remember every second of what happened here today . Paul told me that he wanted you to see a psychiatrist and you wouldn 't . You checked up on me ? I was scared . I 'm scared right now . Let 's get the girls and get the hell out of here , okay ? Let 's say we 're gonna do it because we don 't want ' em to see the blood all over the house . I don 't care why , just so long as we do it . Please . And if my parents don 't have an explanation for all of this and the cops don 't catch this guy and clear all of it up , then I 'll take any test you want . I 'll see whatever shrink Paul says , okay ? Okay . I know who it was . It was Mrs. Sanchez . Daddy wouldn 't shoot the cleaning lady . He would if she went berserk . No , no way . She 's too nice . Nice people go berserk all the time . Name one . Mrs. Sanchez . But she only comes on Saturdays . You think when you 're going berserk , you care what day it is ? Hello , Victor . Well , hello , Martin . Welcome to my humble abode . Where are the girls ? They 're in the den . Come on in . I need my girls . I need them now . Are you okay ? I need my little girls . Daddy , what took you so long ? Is Mrs. Sanchez okay ? Did you have to shoot her ? Is she dead ? My Emily , my Charlotte . Daddy loves you very much . And he 's not going to let anyone steal you away ever again , okay ? What is this , Marty ? What ... what happened over there ? We have to go now . Come on girls . Come on . Hurry . Hold my hands , okay ? Come on . We 're your friends , Marty . We wanna help . Thank you , but there 's really nothing you can do . Where 's Paige ? Go ahead , girls . Get in that car right there . Whose car is it ? It 's Daddy 's new car . I bought it today . Go ahead . - It 's okay . Go on . - Look , Marty . Wait , Marty . Marty , you told me earlier not to let the girls go with anybody unless Paige is with them . Please , we have to go , Paige is waiting . You told me to not let the girls go unless Paige was here with them . Not even you ! Please , Vic ! I 'm sorry . It 's like I 'm losing my mind . It 's so crazy with all that 's going on . And what is going on ? Wait ! Don 't open the door , honey . He could be standing right outside . I forgot something , I 'll be right back , okay ? Okay . You know what an obsessive fan is , don 't you ? Well , some creep is out there ... he 's read all my books , now he thinks he can steal my children . He came to my house with a gun . I had to shoot him . That 's why the police were here today earlier . Vic , can you imagine me shooting someone ? Now you should go back inside . He could come back . But ... but , the cops ... The cops don 't understand the problems of artistic people , Vic . Now please , go back inside . He could come back any second . Okay , everybody , buckle up , please . Where 're we going ? Whose car is this ? Where 's Mommy ? Did you really have to shoot somebody ? Did you shoot first ? Quiet , please . Daddy 's concentrating . Where 's Mommy , Daddy ? Why can 't you tell us where Mommy is ? Shut up ! Just shut up ! Be at peace , Charlotte . Be at peace , Emily . You two shouldn 't cry so much . You should try to be stronger . I blame myself for the problems you have , but all of that is going to change . Marty , let 's go . Emily ! Charlotte ! - Who 's that ? - It 's Daddy ! He 's not your daddy ! Emily ! Charlotte ! Daddy , hurry ! Daddy , come on . Come on , Daddy ! Emily ! Charlotte ! He 's not your daddy , but I swear he will never ever trick you or hurt you again . Daddy , help us ! Daddy , no ! Hurry , Daddy ! Daddy ! Emily ! Charlotte ! - Move over ! - What are you doing ? - He 's got the girls ! - Who does ? Marty , slow down . You 're gonna kill us . - That 's him . That 's his car . - Who ? Whose car ? Marty , you 're sick . You need help . Marty , stop it . Come back . I 'm not gonna hurt you , my babies . I wouldn 't hurt you for anything in the world . But I can 't let you go yet , do you hear me ? Not until we go back and get Mommy . Now you two stay right here ... And don 't move . You promise ? Okay , let 's go . Come on . Charlotte ? Emily ? Come on out , please . We have to get away . When the fake daddy finds out you know about me ... he 's gonna try to hurt you . I know he is . Please come out . I 'm the real one ! Don 't you do it . Where are you ? Oh , baby , you scared me . You 're here . You didn 't go for the police . I would never do that . I need your help . The girls are scared of me now . They 're hiding and they won 't come out . They 'll come out if you call them . Marty , the girls are at Vic and Kathy 's . I wish they were . I know I should have left them there until I had you with me . Marty , I love you no matter what . If you love me then you 'll help me . Now please , call the girls . I don 't want them to be scared of me anymore . Okay . Charlotte ? Emily ? Where are you ? It 's Mommy . What if there 's two Mommys ? - I don 't know . - I don 't wanna go . Come on , Emily . Whatever happens , I 'll be there . And there 's only one me . Okay ? Okay . - Call again . - Marty , they 're not here . I know how hard all of this is for you to accept . Now , please , call my girls . Emily ? Charlotte ? Mommy ? - See ? - Where are you ? I 'm right here , honey . - Mommy ! - What happened ? There 's this man and he took us away ! I 'm so scared ... Thank God . It 's okay , it 's okay . Who is that man in the raincoat ? And why does he look exactly like you ? Get away from them ! Get the girls out of here , now . Oh my god ... - Get the girls out of here . - Go now . Go , go girls . Hurry ! Move ! I 'm calling the cops ! - Marty ? - Did you see him ? What are you doing here ? Call Lowbock . Lieutenant Lowbock of the Mission Viejo Police . That 's not Daddy ! That 's the other one ! - Get away from her ! - Girls , get back ! - Let me in ! - No . Get away ! Let me in , Paige . Please ! - Go away ! - Let me in . Stop the car , Paige ... Girls , get down ! Get off ! What happened , Mommy ? There 's Daddy . Go get him ! Hold on girls . Stay down . - We have to get out of here . - No , we have to find him . No , they 'll arrest you this time . They 'll arrest both of us . Girls , stay down . - Who is he ? - What is he ? Where did he come from , Daddy ? I don 't know , baby . I don 't know . He 's the neighborhood celebrity . I can 't say we 're close friends or anything . PTA meetings , barbecues , you know . - Yeah . - Look at these . Where were the girls when these shots were fired ? Right around where you 're standing . So ... when he fired the gun , he fired more or less in the direction of the girls ? The children ? Was it Marty who fired , or the other man ? I don 't know , I was still half asleep at that point . - I saw who it was ... - Joey , shh ! It was the xerox Mr. Stillwater . - Who ? - The xerox Mr. Stillwater ... Bang ! Bang ! Can he see the backyard from his room ? Yes , but before you get too excited , ask him where Broderick the giant hamster is . Joey , where 's Broderick the giant hamster ? He 's right behind you , and you 'd better watch out . If you step on his tail , he 'll wake up . Well , Joey , I 'll make sure I steer clear of him , then , right ? Lieutenant , there 's a call patched in from the office . Excuse me . It 's Stillwater . - This is Lowbock . - He came after us again ... On Belle Vista near El Serrano . He 's wearing a black raincoat . And this time , we have a witness . A man who lives near there saw him . The man who lives there saw you and an unidentified assailant . What , have you dragged one of your friends into this ? Come on , Marty . If you turn yourself in now ... you could save yourself and your family a ton of trouble . Have you run tests on the blood you found at the house ? Yep . 100 percent human blood . And there 's only one set of prints on all the guns . Yours . I told you that he was identical . Even twins don 't have the same fingerprints . I 'll have a warrant for your arrest within the hour . - What are we gonna do ? - Exactly what he said . Turn myself in . - No . - Yes . Get a lawyer . Figure this thing out . But I don 't trust him to protect you . I need to know that you and the girls are safe . Which means my mom and dad . James and Alice here . Leave a message so we can call you back . Where are you guys ? Call me , okay ? Maybe they went up to the cabin . Has your dad put in a phone out there ? It 'll be a cold day in hell when my dad puts a phone in that cabin . Here they come . Senator ... Grace . What can I do for you ? Look at the article that begins on page 66 . - What is this ? - Just look at it , Drew . Is this a joke ? - We wish . - We went into the hospital records . On October 17th , 1989 , Martin Stillwater gave a blood sample . At the Good Samaritan Hospital in Tustin , California . A $ 200 million top secret contract ? A joint venture of the world 's leading genetic research institution ... and the United States Department of Defense ... and you took the wrong test tube ? You know John Waxhill , don 't you ? - Hi , John . - Hello , Drew . To fill you in , Stillwater was attacked at his home yesterday afternoon . He told the police the attacker was a lost identical twin with superhuman powers , who took two bullets to the chest and then drove away in an Infiniti . So far the police think Stillwater is either a publicity hound or a crackpot . - So far . - We will find Alfie . However ... If he found Stillwater , he 'll find him again . Of course , except that Stillwater 's gone . Smoke , along with his whole family . We do have one lead to go on . His parents live in Mammoth Lakes , California . They have a house in town and a cabin in the woods . Both of which you 'll find on this map . Of course , we 're hoping to get Alfie back on line , pack him straight off to Miami . But how much did he tell Stillwater ? What if the whole family knows now , even the children ? If this were to lead to some kind of a leak ... He didn 't tell them anything . Alfie has no short-term memory beyond the orders that he is given directly . - Are you certain of that ? - He doesn 't know anything ... he didn 't say anything . The police already think that Stillwater 's insane . If he does something really colossally insane and right out of one of his books , it 's only gonna make them think they were right all along . " Gavin locked all the doors ... Man kills wife , children ... then gets dragged to jail . That , Gavin Charles Lumbacher was not prepared for . But , man kills wife , children , and then self ... " " That was a headline he would be happy for the city wake up to . " Sounds brilliant to me . Drew , it would be terrible to lose the Miami opportunity . It could set us back years trying to find another way to do this . But if Alfie can 't be controlled , he 'll have to be destroyed . I will find Alfie , and I 'll get him back on track . Destroying Alfie is not an option . Alfie 's a person , he 's made of flesh and bone , and he 's mine . You 're not gonna hurt him . You wanna hurt me , take your shot . But you 're not gonna hurt Alfie . Good night . Emily : Did Santa come down the chimney yet ? Christmas is three weeks away , sweetheart . Not that Santa , the bad Santa . The one in the story . Is there storytime in motels ? Daddy can 't read to us tonight , Emily . The book 's at home . That 's what you think . - That 's what you think ! - You brought it . - Everybody wanna hear some more ? - Yeah . " The reindeer land on the roof . Very sneaky ... Oh , but this Santa is fearfully freaky . He whispers a warning to each of the deer ... Leaning in close to make sure they hear . You all have relatives back at the pole ... " What is it ? Nothing . I 'm okay . " You all have relatives back at the pole ... " - He 's inside of my head . - What ? He knows where I am , that 's how he found me . Fight it . Block him out . " Each one a gentle , antlered soul . So if you fly away while I 'm inside ... Back to the pole on a plane I will ride . I 'll have a picnic in the midnight sun ... Reindeer tamales , reindeer on a bun ... Reindeer salad and hot reindeer soup , all sorts of delicious reindeer goop . He goes to the chimney and looks down the bricks ... but that way in , is strictly for hicks . " It 's working . He 's gone . I can block him . ( shouting ) In Mammoth Lakes ...

Am I there ? - What ? - Nothing . I wanna come home . Come on up . Just make sure the darlings have their woolen undies . They say we 're in for some wicked cold . - I have to come alone . - The girls are in school , aren 't they ? Need to get a little writing done ? I have to get off the phone now . I love you , Mom . I love you too , Marty . No matter what ? - Darling , what is it ? - I 'm fine . I can 't wait to see you . Mom . The lab is pretty sure that the blood in the rug is Stillwater 's . What kind of nutcase would store up two quarts of his own blood ? I 'm calling in the state police and I 'm gonna recommend that they treat this as a hostage situation . What ? Shoot first and study the evidence later ? There 's a woman and two children in danger here . You think about those two children , and then you tell me ... Is this the kinda guy you wanna give the benefit of the doubt to ? Yes . What do you have back there ? Nothing . Hey , who 're you talkin ' to here ? Excuse me . What are you , his biggest fan ? What 're you gonna do ... trap him in a house in the snow and saw his feet off ? I don 't know about the house in the snow part , but I 'm a pretty big fan . Signed . Look , I know a lot about him . He 's been married to his wife since the week after they graduated from high school . He 's got wonderful parents that are like his best friends . All he cares about is his family . He did not fire at his little girls . Please , don 't send out some shoot-to-kill posse until we talk to him again . " The twine dug red ditches in his daughter 's wrist ... as Gavin cinched it hard around the table 's oak leg . Sheila screamed , but what was the chance of anyone hearing her through the duct tape Gavin had wrapped seven times around her head ? One time for each year of their marriage . " Everything in me says to call the state police . And that 's exactly what I 'm gonna do . They got special swat teams just for this kinda thing . ( ringing ) - Del Rio , here . - Is Lowbock with you ? Yeah , Chief , I 'm right here . You 're not gonna like this ... The FBI 's putting a man on your Stillwater team . Kidnapping issues . Celebrity , possibility of some weirdos crawling out of the woodwork ... Look , Chief , I don 't need any Federal ... Save your breath . It came from way over my head ... so you can imagine how far it is over yours . Lord , almighty ... And when is this gonna happen ? Right now , sir . Jason Reiling . I have strict orders to stay out of your way , Lieutenant . Just think of me as a magic force field between you and the tabloids . ( dialing cell phone ) James and Alice here . Leave a message so we can call you back . Honey , they must have gone to the cabin . Why don 't you check your voice mail at our house ? ( phone ringing ) Where are you , Marty ? I just talked to you ten seconds ago ... Listen , sweetheart , I forgot to tell you we 're going to be up at the cabin tomorrow . And don 't you try and tell me nothing 's wrong because I know when something 's wrong with my son . We love you , Marty . Drive safely , okay ? What ? What is it ? He called my parents . He knows where they are . Where 's that detective 's phone number ? Quick ! Lieutenant Lowbock 's office . This is Marty Stillwater . I need to speak with Lieutenant Lowbock please . They 're not paying you enough to get cable ? Lieutenant Lowbock 's not available right now ... but I 'll connect you with his superior . Yes ... Patch him through . Where are you , Mr. Stillwater ? That doesn 't matter . My parents are in danger . I 've been trying to reach them and I can 't . Whether you believe me or not , please ... I need to send some kind of protection up to their cabin . It 's 5060 Rural Route 10 , outside of Mammoth . I 'll send someone up there immediately . You may be glad to know we 've received information which we think validates your story , but we need to see you . Where are you , Marty ? What the hell is this ? Some kind of a deal ? You won 't protect my parents unless I turn myself in ? The order to check on your parents has already gone out . I just wanna sit down and talk this out . Compare what you 're telling us to what we 've turned up . We don 't need to do that in person . We can do it right now . What have you turned up ? I 'm not comfortable doing that on the phone . That makes two of us ! He hung up . We need to flush him out of the bush . Can we get something in the papers out there ? It 's already taken care of . Good morning , sir . - Mr. Oslett ... - Good morning , Dr. Roget ... Roget : I wish that you had called first . Oslett : Yes , I 'll bet you do . My son told me everything that was going on here ... I would like to find out all I can about it . Now , if you would be so kind as to help me gather all of the records of the Triple W project , I 'd be most appreciative . I wish that your son were here , Mr. Oslett ... but I 'm not allowed to show anything to anyone . Doctor , everything you do here ... Everything you 've ever done here ... Is the property of Oslett Industries . Now , where do we start ? What about school , Daddy ? You don 't need to go to school today , sweetheart . But I have a Social Studies test , and I studied really hard for it . Mr. Huffman will give you a make up . I might forget by then . Impossible . Not someone as smart as you . Daddy , look ! " Mystery Writer Linked to Deaths . The car found near the scene of Stillwater 's last appearance had been stolen yesterday from a Fort Worth parking lot . Preliminary tests match Stillwater 's fingerprints to prints found at the scene of the heinous murder . " Who is doing this ? Let 's go . Morning . I 'd like to make a withdrawal , please . I 'll have to get that approved . Fine . But we are in a hurry . Thanks . For that large of an amount I 'm going to have your home branch fax us your signature . If you could sign this , so I can get a match ? Thank you . He 's inside my head again . - Block it . - I can 't . It 's too hard . He 's too close . What 's taking so long ? Mr. Stillwater ? Oh , my god . Mom , Mom ! Come here , quick ! You are gonna absolutely die ! Oh , I 'm Lucy De Vrees . It 's an absolute pleasure to meet you . What in god 's name are you doing here in Lancaster ? It 's a long story . But you 'll all read about it very soon . I was having terrible writer 's block for a while ... but that 's all over now ... Because the plot of my new book is writing itself this very second . What 's it gonna be called ? I 'm thinking of calling it , " The Man Entered the Room . " Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to sign a few copies of " Crimes of Passion " ? 2,100 ... 2,200 ... You don 't have to count it . No , Mr. Stillwater . I do .

Neighbors of the well-known mystery writer expressed surprise , even shock at the police 's allegations of bizarre behavior , and possible involvement in a Texas killing . " Marty 's never been in Texas in his life . He 'll be here soon . He 'll explain everything . But it said he disappeared last night . What if he never got my message ? He won 't know we 're here , he 'll think we 're in town . You lock up . I 'll get the truck . ( cell phone rings ) Why does he look exactly like the writer ? Dad ... Now , how would you have any idea what he looks like ? - I 've been to the lab . - Really ? I thought you weren 't interested in what we were doing here . - Now , suddenly , you 're interested ? - How did this happen ? You know , you 're going to have to decide whether you 're with us or against us . Gotta make a choice , and you 've gotta make it soon . ( dial tone ) Just picked up a weird police report on the uplink . Stillwater showed up in a bookstore and / or a bank in Lancaster ... and then took off in the family Yukon , and / or a chromed-up red motorcycle . Lancaster ... So he 's definitely on his way to Mammoth ... and we 're not far behind . ( doorbell rings ) Oh , Marty ! Son , what 's happened ? Where 's Paige ? Where are the girls ? Are they all right ? I think they 're still okay . Mom , Dad , you have to help us . We 're in trouble . There 's a man . He looks just like me . Exactly like me . Even I can 't tell the difference . Paige and the girls think it 's me but it 's not . He 's stolen my life . I don 't know who he is , or how he 's fooling Paige ... he 's stolen my memory . And left me with nothing . I can 't figure out how he 's managed to take all this away from me and leave me so empty . Marty , perhaps you should go back to the beginning ... and tell us exactly what 's happened . Step by step . We don 't have time . Paige and the girls are on their way over here right now with him . Now please , I need your help . We have to kill him so I can get my family back before it 's too late . It 'll be okay , Mom . We 're a family . We can handle it . That 's right . You 're not alone , Marty . We 're always here for you , son . You know that . We 'll get you whatever help you need . And if Paige is coming , like you says she is ... we 'll sit down together when she gets here . We 'll talk this out ... and we 'll try to understand what 's happening . I already explained to you what 's happening . Marty , we can 't help you if you won 't let us ! Marty , please . Please ... ( phone rings ) Let it go ... Son , you have to understand how hard it is for us to ... Marty : Hey , if you guys are there , pick up . All right , look ... There 's a lot of crazy stuff going on right now , so ... I asked the police to come up there and check on you . So don 't freak out when they get there . If you get this message , we 're about halfway to the cabin . We 're gonna take the Red Gap Cutoff . If you 're not there when we get there , we 'll wait for you . ( beeps ) That 's him . He 's the fake . How did you do that ? Is that a recording ? Oh ... baby ... You don 't believe me ... ? My real parents would 've believed me . That must mean that you 're fakes . Too . What have they done to you ? How could he have gotten on a motorcycle with all his kids ? He didn 't have any kids with him . I 'm telling ya , Officer , he drove away on a motorcycle . Are you saying I 'm lying to the police ? It was a , you know , a four-wheel drive thing . An Explorer , or something . And his wife and his kids were with him . Did he seem like he was threatening or coercing them in any way ? No , because they weren 't with him . Yes , they were ! And they all did seem a bit quiet and worried . And what time would you say he came into the bank ? 9 : 00 on the dot , because he was the first customer in the bank . Oh , now I know he 's crazy ... Our front door unlocks on a timer at 9 : 00 ... It was about a minute later that I saw him . Look at the withdrawal slip ... It 's him ! Well , what about the book he signed ? The withdrawal slip 's him . I don 't get it ... Who signed the book ? The xerox Mr. Stillwater . Here I come , pumpkin ! No ... Daddy ... ! Ready ? Ready ? Now ! Look out ... look out ! Swing ! Oh , she 's a natural ! Throw it ... Throw it again , Daddy ! Hi Mommy !

Doesn 't that make more sense ? Be Marty for a second , okay ? If the police were chasing you and your picture were in the paper , would you go someplace where there were a lot of people ... or would you go someplace that was off by itself in the woods ? We 're not stopping . It 's just another half an hour to the cabin . We 'll be lucky if we make it another half mile in this thing . We 'll probably just have to put water in the radiator . You can hide in the men 's room . Do it fast . Is that gonna do it for you today , sir ? Yeah , that 's about it ... Chromed-up red motorcycle , right there . I see it . Be at peace , Alfie . I am at peace , Father . I am at peace , Father . Alfie ... Do you know you have taken a decade off of my life ? Did you know that ? Okay . Look . Let 's get out of here . If the cops see this face ... they 're going to start shooting everybody and I don 't wanna die ... believe me ... outside the men 's john in Buttsville , California . Let 's go . Daddy ... Pumpkin . I wanna get out of here , Daddy . This place gives me the creeps . Of course we can , pumpkin . Come on . We 'll get out of here as fast as we can . Have you found Stillwater ? Yes . But I lost him in the city . How did you find him ? He was in my head . Exactly . That 's exactly how I said it would be ! Remember when we experimented with the genetic implants with paranormal capabilities , we thought we got nowhere ? We got somewhere . This is it ! Okay , look . As soon as we get rid of Stillwater ... we get Alfie back on line and it 'll be as if nothing ever happened . Drew , I think that may be a slightly optimistic appraisal of the situation . You lost them in the city , huh ? Who taught you to lie , Alfie ? Where does that come from ? Look , we stick with the plan . We 'll catch them in Red Gap . It 's a couple of miles from here . Let 's go . Hello . They 've got Alfie . Everything 's under control . That 's good news . Now , keep me posted ... Every second of the way . All right . Well , is it , or isn 't it ? Well , it does seem that the genetic structure of the blood is incredibly similar to Stillwater ... But there are some unusual differences . Like what ? This blood coagulates at over ten times the normal rate . And there even seems to be some evidence for the capacity for ... self-regeneration . He asked me to protect him , and I treated him like some kind of psycho looking to sell some books . You 're protecting him now . It 's not too late . We gotta find him . Before he finds himself . Put a flag on his cell phone . And his credit cards . And if ether one of them get used , I wanna know about it . While it 's happening . And maybe we should call off the SWAT team . This is really quite interesting about the blood , but ... I 'd sure like to get a second opinion before we make any drastic change in plan . Can we get an electronic hook-up to the Federal lab in Bethesda ? I 'd be up for a second opinion . So Alfie , I 'm hoping to have you on an airplane to Miami tonight ... right after we take care of the Stillwaters . I don 't think he 's in any condition to go to Miami . He 's gonna be fine . It 's a complicated job because there are multiple targets . I know that 's a first for you , Alfie , but I ... I have every confidence you can do it . Now , here , take a look at the map of Miami . I 'm hungry . You really are hungry ! " Trailers for sale or rent ... Rooms to let for fifty cents ... No phones , no food , no pets ... I ain 't got no cigarettes ...

It 's perfect for Gavin Lumbacher . What exactly happens to old Gavin himself ? He shoots himself in the head . We can take care of that before we take care of the others . There 's not a medical examiner in the world that would know the difference . - I need ... - You need what , Alfie ? I need my family . I don 't want you to do anything to hurt them . Let 's face it , Drew . There 's a flaw in the design . We gotta cut our losses . Just take it easy . Alfie , look , I understand that you hurt , but they 're not your real family ... That 's just a mistake that you 've made . Okay ? Look when this is all over , I 'll give you a " forget " command ... and you 'll never hurt again , okay ? No ! For crying out loud ! Get out ! Be at peace , Alfie . That doesn 't work anymore . Look , this is Father talking . Get out ! Now ! Move ! Don 't shoot . You know , they wanted me to kill you ... and I wouldn 't do it . Alfie ... I love you . Who are you ? Father ... I 'm your father . What 's your name ? Drew Oslett . - Like Oslett the chemicals and oil ? - Yes . Now give me the gun . The sooner we get Stillwater out of your head ... the sooner things will be fine . Why do I have to kill people ? For a better world . Alfie , if you kill me , it 'll never happen . This is for a future better than anyone could 've ever dreamt of . What future ? The world doesn 't have to be the way it is . There doesn 't have to be so much war and suffering . Think about Hitler . 50 million deaths that he caused . If someone had had the vision ... if somebody had the guts to assassinate him at the ' 36 Olympics ... none of those deaths would have ever occurred . But nobody did . We ... you and I , we can create a real peace in our time ... One country , one continent at a time . But not if it ends here . Don 't you see ? You 're the greatest hero the world has ever known . You 've already stopped three wars before they could start . The two heads of state that you 're gonna assassinate in Miami ... Their corruption has caused a famine that could kill a half a million people by the turn of the century . But that 's not gonna happen . Because of you . You 're gonna stop that . That 's wonderful . Don 't throw this away . Alfie , please . Who 's behind all of this ? Who 's the boss ? Who 's calling the shots ? Look , I don 't have time to explain it right now ... But I will . I promise . We have to go together to catch Stillwater and his family , and stop them ... We have to kill them . They 're going to tell on us and ruin everything . What 's the password to your computer ? Give me the gun and I 'll give you the password . What 's the password ? You might as well shoot me ... because if what 's on that computer gets out to the public ... we 're all dead anyway . Alfie ! Alfie ! Alfie ! Alfie ! That 's not Alfie . It 's Stillwater . Alfie would have shot you . No , he wouldn 't have . I 'm his father . And he loves me . Grandma ... ? Grandpa ? Grandma , Grandpa , we 're here ! - Where are they ? - We 'll find them , sweetheart . Everything 's gonna be okay . Okay . Put your suitcases in your room . Well , I think what we all need is a fire in that fireplace ... and a nice family dinner together . Honey , I think the girls need rest more than food right now . The thought of cooking or eating ... I really want us to have some dinner . Come on , Paige . I know we 're all tired but it 's really very important to me . Okay , I 'll see what your mom has in the fridge . Thanks , honey . Girls , go help Mommy in the kitchen . Daddy , is he gonna try and get us again ? Whatever he does , I 'll be ready for him so don 't worry , honey . Okay ? - Okay . - Gimme a hug . - Now go help Mommy in the kitchen . - Okay . Marty made a call on his cell phone from the highway ten miles north of Mammoth . They 're definitely on the way to the cabin . How fast can you get us a plane ? Excuse me , sir ? " And in the latest development in the bizarre and now tragic story of the fugitive mystery writer ... Stillwater 's parents have been found murdered in their Mammoth Lakes home . Police claim that eyewitness reports confirm that Stillwater was seen entering the house earlier this afternoon . One neighbor says , 'I 've known Marty Stillwater since he was on training wheels ... and the man going inside that house was indeed Marty . ' Police suspect Stillwater in connection with another brutal murder in a Texas parking lot . And neighbors in the quiet Orange County community where the author lives with his wife and his two children ... described Stillwater 's behavior in the last 24 hours as ' shocking and bizarre . " ' Yes . Tell Jack Davies at the Justice Department that I 'm coming in to see him right away . Thank you . You know , I was thinking , if there was ever a time ... this family needed to say grace ... it 's now . I 'll say . Paige ... I don 't know what to say ... Thank you , God ... for getting us to the cabin safely , and for keeping us together ... and don 't go away , because we still need you pretty badly . - Amen . - Amen . - You okay , honey ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Do you think there 's gonna be a gold ring around the moon tonight ? I always love it when there 's a gold ring around the moon . Sometimes there isn 't . A what ? You know , a gold ring around the moon . Like , when we were at that wedding , and the band was playing ... and there was this gold ring around the moon . God , whose wedding was it ? I can 't quite put my finger on it , but ... Aunt Drucilla 's wedding . That 's who it was . We don 't have an Aunt Drucilla . Of course you do , sweetheart . Marty , how exactly is Aunt Drucilla related ? Wasn 't she your father 's sister-in-law from his first marriage ? Why don 't we all just enjoy our meal before it gets cold ? Charlotte , this chicken is very dry . Why don 't you take Emily into the pantry ... and see if Grandma has any canned gravy or cranberry sauce or something in there ? Yeah ... I hate gravy , and I hate cranberry sauce ... and it 's spooky in that pantry . Oh , Emily , that 's so selfish ! Come on , let 's go see what we can find . Go ahead , honey . I think Emily has the right idea . Chicken tastes fine to me . Why don 't we all just sit down and finish our dinner ? I can 't believe we 're here . Together . With nobody else . You know , I 'm still a little chilled inside . You want a brandy ? I think your father has a bottle in the kitchen . You stay right where you are . You cooked that whole dinner ... You drove that whole way ... The least I can do is make you a drink . No way , hombre . I want you all rested and relaxed when I get back . Oh , god , Mom ... It 's locked ! Block the door . Come on , sweetheart . Okay . Good girl . Take my bag . Paige ? Is everything okay ? Take the gun . Paige , what 's going on in there ? Don 't come in . I 'm planning a big surprise . Paige ? Paige ! Paige ! Paige , wait ! - Stay away ! - What 's the matter ... ? I don 't know who you are , but you stay away from my family , you freak ! Put that ax down ! Put the ax down , now , Paige ... ! Give me the ax ! The ax , now ! Paige ! Honey , it 's me . Show me your wedding ring . Marty ! Oh , thank god ! We figured it out , Daddy . Good girl . Okay , come on , let 's go ! Get in , get in . The key 's in the house ... ! What about the hide-a-key ? Girls , get down ! ( clicks ) Okay , let 's go . Let 's go ! Marty , look out ! Girls , hold on ! Mommy ! All right , get out . Come on , honey ... Hurry up , hurry up . Go with Daddy . Hold on , now . Hold on . Is everybody okay ? Let 's go , come on . We 'll go hide in the mill . Come on , this way . Be careful . Come on , Paige . Careful here ! Daddy ! Marty ? I 'm all right ... Daddy , what 's wrong ? What is it ? Come on . We gotta go . Don 't waste the shells . Come on . Take the girls into the mill . Get as far as you can . No , Mommy , come with us . Honey , he 's gotta come through here ... and I 'm gonna shoot him when he passes me . Okay , go . That 's a good plan , except you 're going with the girls ... and I 'm staying here . Marty , your the one he has the connection with . Don 't block him out . Let him feel you move away ... He 'll expect us to be together . Okay , girls . Mommy 's right . Let 's go . Drew , if I were talking to anybody else on the planet , I 'd be calling for the men in white coats right now . How far back does this thing go ? Well , the project ... about ten years . This business of killing , about half that , I think . You are placing your son in complicity with the murder of Kingman Flagg . Yes , but , listen to me , Jack . There 'll be more murders than that if you don 't bring out all your guns and stop this thing . Fast . I hope there 's still time to save Stillwater and his family . I 'm taking this straight to the Attorney General . Oh , good . Good . Mr. Attorney General ? Excuse me ... Mr. Attorney General . Jack ... What is it ? When I was in high school , all the tough guys used to come down in here and smoke their cigarettes . Cigarettes ? That doesn 't sound so tough . Well , that 's probably not all they did . ( thump ) ( phone rings ) Yes ? I 'm there . I 've almost caught up to them . I think the Gavin Lumbacher scenario should play out quite nicely in an abandoned lumber mill , don 't you ? Drew , there 's a problem . Do " the problem " and I have the same last name ? You were expecting this ? Well , how bad is it ? It 's bad . Your father 's ready to go public to expose us , and he 's got the credibility to make it stick . This has to be your call , Drew . Do you think you can talk to him ? Are you there ? I 'm here . Are you going to talk to your father or not ? I 'd love to talk to my father ... I just don 't think he has any interest in talking to me . I really have to go now , gentlemen . You 're sure ? Let 's just say , that my father will do the world a lot more good by leaving it than he ever did while he was here . Thank you . Goodbye . ( dial tone ) ( loud clank ) ( footsteps ) I 'll pay you ten times whatever my son is paying you . You spent your whole life thinking everything was about money . What do you think it 's about ? Come on , girls . Help me out here . A six letter word that starts with the letter " f " . Come on ... Come on ! Oh , that 's not it . This means something really important . Friday ? Okay ... F-R-l-D-A-Y . No , sweetie , that 's not it . " Low battery ... Iow battery . " Something really important that begins with " f " and has six letters ? That 's right . Daddy , it 's so obvious . What ? It 's you . F-A-T-H-E-R . " Welcome to Oslett Technologies . " Wow ... Oh , look at this . We got him . All right , now let 's go . Come on . ( beeping ) Daddy . What 's wrong ? Nothing , honey . Okay . Let 's go . Are you okay ? You 're hurt really bad . You two are gonna have to go on without me . I can 't move as fast as you can . No ... You 're hurt . It 's safer that way , pumpkin . He 's after me , not you . Where should we go ? You two go down , and I 'm gonna go up . But he 'll catch you . No he won 't . I 've got the home court advantage . All right , now , go . Come on , give me a kiss . All right now , hurry . Go . Go on . Take this . - I 'm not cold , pumpkin . - For your arm . Okay , thank you . Now go . Go on . Hurry . Go back . Go the other way . Emily , are you okay ? - Daddy ! - You 're okay , sweetie . Daddy , there 's another man with a gun down there . Show me your ring . Oh , Daddy ... ! Oh , my babies ... Oh , it 's okay . Daddy 's here now . My brave little girls , we have to go now , okay ? Come on . Lieutenant , hold your men there ! The lookout saw smoke coming from the cabin so we figure that 's where he has the hostages . They 're not hostages , they 're his family . He 's been telling the truth . The double killed his parents . Excuse me ? There 's no time to get into it now . We have to get Marty . But not like that . We have to talk to him . And we need to figure out which one we 're talking to . - Del Rio here . - It 's John Waxhill . You should know the results from the blood test are in . My orders are to rescue two young girls and their mother from a dangerous armed killer . How ? I 've got the best precision shooters in the country here . Your orders are gonna have to be changed . It was my understanding , you 're the one who called the state police into this . Yeah , and I 'm the one who 's calling you out ! We have new evidence . The whole picture 's changed . No ! It hasn 't ! That was Washington . The results on the blood came in from the Federal lab . We were getting those strange readings because it was old blood . That simple . Blood that had been stored in less than perfect conditions , for as long as two months . And there 's more . The bank called in Lancaster ... Their clocks were off . Their clocks were off ! Marty actually signed the withdrawal slip six minutes after he walked by the bookstore . Do it ! Do it ! Who is that ? One of the bad guys . Go through that door . Go on . We have to find a way to get down and get Mommy and go home . Okay ? Careful ! Come on . Get away from him ! Don 't move ! My wonderful brave little girl . You heard exactly what I said . Go ahead , Charlotte . Shoot him . It 's the only way to stop him . You don 't have to shoot anybody , honey . That 's Daddy , that 's Daddy 's jacket ! No , I don 't know ... I don 't know ! - Yes , you do . - I 'm confused ! You know this jacket . I always wear this jacket . Give me the gun , sweetheart . Give me the gun , pumpkin . A gun can be a very dangerous thing . That one ... That one 's Daddy ! Oh , Emily , I don 't know what to do ... What rhymes with " psychosis " ? Lots of words , honey . You see ? He doesn 't know ! What was Mommy 's last name before she got married ? - Walters . - That 's wrong ! - Simpson . - Daddy ! No ! Daddy ! Grab the little girl ! Grab her ! Let her go ! Put down that gun ! Put it down or I 'll kill you and your daughter . Get over there ! Do it . Over there . Put the little one over there . Put her over there . - No . - What ? Put her over there ! What 's wrong with you ? We 're almost done here . Three bullets , three tragic deaths ... and then we can go home . Leave my babies alone ! Daddy ! Daddy ! " Halitosis . " - Oh , Marty . - Daddy ! Oh , baby . He was trying to save us . ( helicopters overhead ) Stay here . It 's okay , baby . What are we gonna do ? We 're gonna disappear . Then we 'll find a place to hide out . I 'll make copies of what 's on this computer and give it to every television station and newspaper in the country . Then , can we go home ? I don 't think so , pumpkin . - Okay , let 's go . - Where ? We 're gonna head south . That way it 's just nothing but open country . Then Mexico . Marty , we 've got one bad arm , two hungry children ... no food , no water . They 're gonna have the highway patrol , the border patrol ... and the FBI after us . Tell me how we 're supposed to do that ? We can do this . ( humming " King of the Road " ) Let 's go . " After a nearly two year investigation , United States authorities now state that the shadowy group could be tied to as many as two dozen assassinations . Members of the group included construction heiress Grace Weatherall ... United States Senator James Ewald , and Attorney General Greydon Lamont ... whose suicide last week shocked the nation . - In the wake of further revelations ... " - Johnny ... Johnny , look . It came in the mail today . The Italian edition ! Our 46th country . It 's beautiful , Annie . - Do we have everything ? - Everything . Rebecca , Suzie ... All hands on deck ! Where to , Captain ? Next stop , Bora Bora . " In yet another strange twist in this tale of conspiracy and murder , mystery writer Martin Stillwater and his family have yet to be found .

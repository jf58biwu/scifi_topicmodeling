 Hey , Dick , can I borrow the car keys ? I have a date with August . - Sure , Tommy . - You can 't give him the keys . He can 't drive . How do you know ? I 've never tried it . I could be great at it . - Check and mate . - He doesn 't even have a licence . - You don 't have your licence yet ? - I 'm taking driver 's ed . Look , she 's right . No keys for you . - Ha ha ! - Then what am I supposed to do ? - Sally , you drive him . Ha ha ! Hey there , Tiger . You remember my daughter Vicki , don 't you ? Sure . I put a turkey carcass on my head and had sex with her on your kitchen table . That 's my little girl . So , what brings you to Rutherford ? She 's back for her high school reunion . Thanks for killing the surprise , mama . Ever since they cancelled " Ryan 's Hope , " she 's been real moody . So , Vicki , why didn 't you return any of my phone calls ? Well , I wanted to , but they ... they put a lock on the phone down at social services . Well , I 'm glad you 're here 'cause I could use some social services . Come on , come on . Anyone . - " Y " to the fourth power . - No . 11 ? No . - Velocity squared ? - No . That guy from Jeopardy " ? No , no , no ! Dr. Solomon , can 't you just tell us the answer ? We 've been guessing for 45 minutes now . You 've been guessing ? All right , people , due to your staggering ineptitude with the most basic concepts of quantum superpositions , I am issuing the following assignment : you will write a five-page letter to your parents apologizing for wasting their money . I want them on my desk tomorrow morning for my approval and a blistering P.S. And bring a stamp , damn it . I 'm not a post office . The wedding chapel was only two miles away . All she had to do was come to a complete stop and turn on her blinker , but I guess she had more important things to think about . And now she 's dead ! - Any questions ? - Yeah . Where can I rent that movie ? You can 't . Class dismissed . Hey , Tommy . Hello , Don . - Hello , Sally . - Tommy said you were showing " the bride wore asphalt . " - Did I miss it ? - Yes , but ... - maybe I can arrange for a private screening . - When ? - Now . - Can we watch it backwards ? You 're a sucker for a happy ending . Look , her head 's back on . - Judith ? Dr Solomon , As head of the disciplinary committee , it is my sad duty to inform you that one of your students has registered a complaint against you . There must be some mistake . Is it true that you forced them to write humiliating letters to their parents ? Well , yes , but that can 't be it . I 'm afraid it is , and according to university rules of conduct , you must attend sensitivity training . My office will contact you . Oh , and Dick , I wouldn 't leave town . I don 't need sensitivity training , you strident , power-Mad tart ! - Happy birthday , dad . Of course I remembered . How 's the chest pains ? Mary , do you think I 'm insensitive ? You just hung up on my father . Now , don 't try to change the subject . Okay , fine . You 're insensitive . I am ? Oh , come on , Dick . It wouldn 't kill you to occasionally think of people 's feelings before you speak . What a bunch of crap . You log 40 billion light-years without a single moving violation , they make you take a road test anyway . Welcome to earth , folks . You don 't need that book . Just use your common sense . Green means go . Yellow means slow down . Red means stop and check your make-up . That 's my best friend . That 's Kenny . Ooh , Jace carter . Ooh ! Whoa ! Who 's the biker chick with the confederate flag and the bottle of bourbon ? That 's me . Nice . Harry , I was wondering if maybe ... you 'd be my date to the reunion . I 'd love to . Will there be ... turkey ? - Family meeting ! Family meeting ! What ? I 've just heard the most upsetting thing . Someone has accused me of insensitivity . You 're not family ! Get out ! What is it with this planet 's preoccupation with sensitivity ? You should be able to have an open dialogue with anyone , like we do . We can say anything to each other and not take offense . For example , Tommy wouldn 't object if I mentioned that he was a greasy little disappointment . What 's to argue ? Sally couldn 't dispute that she 's a sadistic bimbo . You got me . And , Dick , you 're a rubber-faced bag of wind . Well said ! And Harry , you 're an idiot . Thank you , sir . May I have another ? Hooray ... for personal growth . Today we 're going to learn how to breathe , how to listen , and how to say " I have a personality disorder . " - Wait a minute- - - Dick , I hear you . Can ... you ... hear ... me ? Yes . You 're the annoying guy in the unitard . Dick , labels disable . We 're all shipwrecked at sea . There 's very little food left and one passenger too many . I say we eat the big , fat guy . Boo , Dick ! Boo ! How about the woman with the bad hairdo ? Your work is incompetent . You get an " F. " You fail . You 're right . My work has been weak , but it 's not my fault . I 'm just not as smart as you are . Ah , I suppose you have a point . I am exceedingly brilliant . You just go so fast , I can 't follow you . And now I 'll never get a job . I 'll have to sell my feet for keychains . I 've never heard things from your point of view before . Maybe I have been a little hard on you . I 'm .. I 'm ... I 'm sorry . I think someone needs a hug . Okay , class , I thought we 'd try something different . - No kidding . - Now , let 's reflect on the ballet that is physics . In standard quantum chromodynamics , the Lagrange density equals one over four pi times the square of the field strength tensor . Now , given that there is this concentration of intense nucleic energy , how many hydronic jets will emerge when the quark - antiquark line within the meson ruptures ? Bug ? A million ? - Does that mean I 'm right ? - No , not even close , bug , but you tried , and that 's what makes you special . What 's that supposed to mean ? - Do you want me to say it slower ? - No . Class , I have your midterms . Now , I didn 't want anyone to feel stress , so I 've abandoned the traditional grading system , and I 'm giving you all happy faces . I can 't apply to graduate school with a happy face in physics . Graduate school ? I don 't think any of you have to worry about that . Nina , did you make the appointment for my high colonic ? There are two things I don 't do . I don 't pick up dry cleaning , and I don 't schedule enemas , okay ? That 's okay . I forgive you . - Mary , are we still on for dinner ? - Sure . I was thinking of wearing this . It 's not coming off anytime soon , is it ? Dr. Solomon .. oh , dear god . I 'll make this brief . Your students have filed a class-wide complaint against you . You are required to appear before the disciplinary committee , which I chair . What ? ! I give them happy faces on their mid-terms , and this is how they repay me ? - Yeah , that 's messed up . That 's it . No more Mr. Nice guy . And no hug for you , four eyes . Fine ! This is the last time I shop at gotta dance . Damn , they won 't allow me to return my unitard . Why not ? - Because I wore it without my underpants . - Oh , my god ! This reminds me of your prom night . - Oh ! Only this time your date isn 't married . Hi , folks . Unless you have a warrant , you cannot come in here . - No , that 's Sally 's date . - Oh . Well , it 's nice to meet you . Don 't I know you ? No , I don 't- - let 's go . Mama , let 's go . Go , go , go . Hello , Don . Hello , Sally . I thought we would skip dinner and drive straight to lookout point . That is , if you can stand the heat . You know me , Don . The hotter , the better . - Ready , Tommy ? - Yeah . - Tommy 's coming ? - The kid needs to see how it 's done . You could show him how to put the key in the ignition . Couldn 't I just buy him some magazines ? He 's been reading about it for weeks . He 's ready for the real thing , and I figure ... he should learn from the master . Okay , he can come , but I 'm not promising anything . If you 'll all take your seats , this hearing can begin . All right , Dick , out with it . Where did you grab her ? And how many times ? It 's not that kind of hearing . First , we will hear from Dr. Mary Albright who will speak on behalf of Dr. Solomon . Dr. Albright , how would you describe Dr. Solomon ? Well , it 's kind of hard . I mean ... have you ever had a piece of really stinky cheese ? I enjoy stinky cheese . Continue . The thing is , it has these wonderfully rich flavors that you can 't get to without the stinkiness . Have you ever found Dr . Solomon to be insensitive ? No . Dr. Solomon is warm , kind , and a credit to Pendleton state . And he 's never been abusive towards you ? No . Dr. Solomon is warm , kind , and a credit to Pendleton state . - Have you been coached to say that ? - No . Dr. Solomon is warm , kind , and a credit to Pendleton state . - Just keep your eye on the white line . - Where is it ? Look out ! Uh ... Don , maybe you ought to drive . No ! You 're passing that test tomorrow if it kills us all ! You heard the lady . A 3-11 . Tommy , step on it . Oh , party , man ! Okay , Harry , don 't you let these people intimidate you . You just be yourself . You 're great . Remember that . - Hello , Vicki . - Hello , Elroy . This is my boyfriend . He 's a famous brain surgeon . Vicki Dubcek ? - Look at you ! - Oh , look at you . What was that nickname we used to call you ? " Whore . " Whore ! Isn 't she priceless ? And who are you ? Harry Solomon , united states ambassador to Portugal . What bothers you most about Dr. Solomon 's teaching methods ? He 's always saying I 'm wrong . And how often are you wrong ? Always . One day he told me if I liked long hair so much , maybe I should join the circus . - Were you hurt by that ? - No . More confused . And then he stared at me , and I felt all dirty . He did well in the session , but when he left , he stole the puppets . I 've heard enough , who 's buying ? Dr. Solomon , do you have anything to say - in your defense ? - I have plenty to say . I should have brought a book . I stand here accused of insensitivity . Oh sure , I 've tried to change my ways . I 've cried . I 've hugged . I 've been hugged . And you know what I 've discovered ? I 'm an offensive person . But in a tolerant society , is there no place for my kind ? Why must everyone like me ? Why can 't we all just ... not get along ? Conflict is necessary . Throughout history , human beings have persecuted the great agitators Socrates , Galileo , and now Dick Solomon . Where would you be without us to provoke and enlighten you ? To attach the electrodes of knowledge to the nipples of ignorance ? Throughout history , all over the world , people have rightfully looked to Pendleton state for virtually nothing . But maybe one day they 'll be able to say that an unpopular battle was won there for an ugly little thing called ... the truth . - Thank you . - And when they make a movie of this .. and they will .. I don 't want to be played by woody harrelson . We will now deliberate and return with a guilty verdict . Who would have thought that I 'd be spending this night in a veritable wonderland of twinkly lights , tiny wienies , and the most beautiful woman from Orlando ? Mmm . So what did you do at your high school reunion ? Vicki , I didn 't exactly graduate from high school . Oh . Well ... I didn 't exactly graduate , either . Jace ? Jace carter ? - Yeah ? - Well , it 's ... Vicki Dubcek here . Oh . Right . I don 't think you understand . That 's Vicki Dubcek . - Who are you ? - I 'm Vicki 's husband , Harry Solomon , Hollywood stuntman . And when I 'm not crashing through plate glass windows or catching on fire , you 'll find me at my Hollywood mansion with my wife . You see .. I could have any woman I want ... including her ... but I choose Vicki to share my fabulous Hollywood lifestyle . Wow ! Vicki , you made it . Yeah . Yeah , I did . I 'm also the postmaster general . After reviewing all the testimony , the disciplinary committee unanimously votes to admonish Dr. Solomon . - What does that mean ? - You 're officially admonished . Does that come with a pay cut ? No . However , if there 's another violation , you will be censured . Does that come with a pay cut ? No , but should that fail to stop you , you will be sanctioned , which means a 30-day suspension . - With pay ? - Yes , with pay . That sounds good . Could I be sanctioned right now ? No . We 're adjourned . Dr. Solomon , I 'm really sorry . We never meant for there to be a hearing . I don 't even know how it got this far . No need to apologize . You 're stupid , I 'm rude . See you tomorrow . We 'll see you . Well , Dick , I think you made a nice point . Yes , for a piece of stinky cheese . Oh , Dick , you are who you are , and that 's the guy I love . Thank you , Mary . - And you know what ? - What ? - I love me , too . - Good . It 's something I learned in sensitivity class ... to love myself . - Good . - And I really love myself . I mean , a lot . Well , I failed by driver 's test . I can handle a high-speed police chase , but for some reason , at 20 miles an hour I hit three parked cars . Don 't worry about not having your license . Lord knows it hasn 't stopped me . I 'm going to be the laughingstock of my whole school . Well , I 've discovered something , Tommy . It doesn 't matter what you do in high school , as long as you can make people feel like losers at the reunion .

 The Centers For Disease Control . Are we dealing with epidemic ? Whatever the carrier we know it 's not the water . We don 't believe that it 's airborne . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ... Strickler 's Disease was first diagnosed two years ago . We 're no better off now . I needed you to see this for yourself , Doctor Tyler . It 's the same at every hospital in the city . For the lucky ones it 's a lifetime in leg braces . Most of these kids won 't make it . We need your help . Strickler 's Disease came to New York like a thief in the night . Threatening to steal an entire generation of children before our eyes . Deputy Director of the Centers for Disease Control . The killer was cunning . It was deadly . Neither a cure nor a vaccine could be found . We at the CDC had to contain it before it could spread beyond Manhattan Island . So we went after its carrier the common cockroach . Or rather , she did . Doctor Susan Tyler is the reason there hasn 't been a new case of Strickler 's in the city for six months . Doctor Susan Tyler . Professor of Entomology at the New York State University . Thank you , Peter . I don 't think I need to tell you New Yorkers just how resilient the common cockroach is . Since it has proven to be virtually immune to chemical control . We had to find a new avenue of attack . So , with the aid of genetics labs across the country . We recombined termite and mantid DNA to create a biological counter agent a new species to be our six-legged ally in wiping out the roach population . We call it the " Judas " breed . Once in contact with the Judas ' secretions . The common roaches were infected with an enzyme . - Come on , Susan . You 're missing it . - The common roaches ate , every last member of the nest starved to death within hours . Hope someone 's taping this . This announcement 's been a long time coming , ladies and gentlemen . The Strickler 's outbreak has officially been contained . The epidemic is over . Hey , Susan . Honey ? Doctor Mann ? What did this victory mean to you personally ? Our fifteen minutes are gone . And personally , it 's where I met my wife . What is this ? Is this some kind of Catholic guilt thing ? We don 't even know what the impact is of what we did . The impact is . There are gonna be a lot of kids next year because of you . A lot of kids . Maybe we get lucky . Maybe a couple of them 'll be ours someday . Oh , a couple , huh ? Oh , okay ? We 're not rushing things . I didn 't want to overtax you . It 's been a hard year . It 's been a great year . Oxfords . 7 and half . Black . Leather soles . Funny , funny shoes . Funny , funny shoes . C.D.C. Hey , boss , welcome to disease land . Tuck it in . All right . All right . You sure this is yellow fever ? What , are you ignorin' your pages now ? Listen , I 'm . These two cops saw the scaffold and the paint mess here . And then they looked through that cellar window . Go ahead . Take a look . Pleasant , isn 't it ? Couldn 't let ' em out until you gave me the okay , so . Roughly , there were three dozen people trapped in here . We 've got bacterial sample reading off the scale , though . - Nothing 's airborne . - We 've got a Reverend Harry Ping . Preacher , if you can imagine that . He ran this place . There 's no sign of him . Have you had lunch ? Try to keep it down when you see this , okay ? Piece of shit on the ceiling . Figure that one out . Here you go , Josh . The subway ? You know what ? This is what I love about my job . I get to travel , see the world and meet new exotic cultures . It 's it 's all bacterial , but hey what the fuck . Right ? - Thanks a lot , Miguel . - Board up every exit . If this leads to the subways . I don 't want anything to spread . Quarantine everything . What 's going on , Remy ? Oh , I 'm just commemorating my sad moments . So we 're at this great restaurant I 'm thinking , finally a fucking gentlemen . I go to the ladies ' room , I come back . I catch the schmuck slipping sedatives into my drink . What a pervert . This city is full of perverts . You don 't know who anybody is anymore . Jesus , I look like shit . Hey , guys . You the bug lady right ? We 're here to deal . When you pick them up , you should pick ' em up vein , 'cause it 's the strongest part . See , that way you don 't break it . Now , let 's see what else you have in here . Look . What do we have here ? Swallowtail ? Excellent . How come you like bugs so much ? Just imagine that you 're one of them . What , eating furniture and stuff ? That 's gotta suck . No , no , no . Now don 't judge them too quickly . These guys were building castles when dinosaurs were still wimpy little lizards . Now , say you 're him . He 's what we call it soldier Now , there is no way that you would ever quit fighting , no matter how badly injured you were . Its would be a battle to the death . But , most insects don 't kill unless their territory is invaded . You just stun your prey up here . And then you drag it all the way down through here ... to there . Into what 's kind of like a pantry We eat it alive ? Yeah . You 're not really squeamish about those kind of things . This is the nest It 's the heart of the colony . The big enchilada . Why ? Well , if anything were to happen to the nest , the entire colony would die out . I 'd just bail and start my own . Well , you couldn 't do that . See that big guy there ? Next to the queen ? Look over there . He 's the king . And out of all the nest he 's the only fertile male . He got a good deal . Yeah . It 's a simple structure designed for their survival . It 's perfectly balanced and it 's very beautiful . Whatever peels your banana , lady . Do you wanna buy the butterflies or what ? You know what ? You guys have done a really good job . So , how about five bucks ? - That 's your best ? - I 'm gonna show her the weird bug . Costs a dollar just to look . It 's a really great bug . We got him in the sub-way . We kind of broke it a little . Okay . My best offer ten bucks for everything . Plus a specimen jars some tweezers , and some mounts . Deal . Are you crazy ? This is the best . This is our meal ticket . Come on . Bug 's almost dead , anyway . It 's yours . You gave ' em ten bucks . They 're from Alphabet City . There 's much worse things they could be selling . Oh , no ! Your papers . Help me get the window . Susan . Push . Ah , come on . Oh , I hate this window . Okay . On three . One , two , three . Who do you think you are , puttin ' my two officers on quarantine ? Listen to me , Captain . Those two , they kiss their wives they kiss their kids . And I 'm the one with a full-blown epidemic . Come on , Chuy We have to make dinner . - Okay , Dad . - I don 't care . Well , I do care ! Jesus ! I hate cops . They make the worst coffee . Shiny wire . Don 't stare . People look back if you stare . I can 't believe this . What ? I spend an hour in the field . I get a weekend 's worth of crap . Oh , speaking of that . That turd that I took to the lab ? They found these in it . What are they ? Buttons . Buttons ? Maybe they needed fiber . Sorry . Oh , my God . You 're just a baby . Oh , my God . Judas breed The transfer of recombinant genetic material from termites and mantids into Judas breed , will allow rapid enzymatic change . Insuring one hundred percent sterility in all Judas females . Utilization of a suicide gene . Leading to a life expectancy of one hundred twenty to one hundred eighty days . Not too little ... and not too much . You rub it in . Around and around . Like this , huh ? Funny Shoes . Mister Funny Shoes . No one is there . It 's empty . Chuy listen to me . They have Jesus on the cross but that is not a holy place . Can you call me back tonight ? Thanks , Officer . Cops are on it . Good . Uh , th-they said . Can you do me a favor and hold off working at night for a while ? I can 't do that . I was thinking I had to get back . Susan , someone broke into your office , okay ? Sorry about you losing your specimen but let 's try to get ... This is not a specimen , Peter . I did a ph test and there 're only two species that match what I found . Now , one of them is a leaf cutter ant in the Amazon . The other one we re-leased here three years ago . You said that . You said the ones we released only had a life span of six months . We engineered them to be sterile adults . The Judases were not supposed to last past one generation . So what happened ? The one I examined today was a baby . They were designed to die . They are breeding . I shine them good . Chuy Black Lincoln . Chuy ? Black Lincoln . This one . Chuy pay attention , please . This is where you found the bug ? Yeah , man . But they changed the lock . You sure you haven 't seen one of those ? No . What is it ? It 's an Oo-theca . It 's kind of a fancy name for an egg case . There 's probably more , like weird bugs in-side of it . No way . I see one of those , I 'd puke . Here you go . Here . Hold on . Is there money to be made on this egg thing ? Sorry . Dealing days are over . Vamanos . These egg things look nasty . Thought you liked to find new nasty things . Well , what if we go find these things ? She 'll pay us , right ? Is that all you think about ? Come on . This bug . What does it look like ? Do you hear that ? How deep does this go ? Let 's see . Let 's take a look . You see anything ? Not yet . Shit . I dropped it . I can 't reach it . Let me try . My hands are smaller . Just leave it . Well , no . Wait . I think I 'm almost there . How much you think the bug lady will give us for this egg thing ? At least a twenty spot . Jesus ! Fuckin ' moles . Hey ! Got any change ? Get a job , scag . Hey kid ! Get the hell off the tracks ! That 's where he is . Long John ! Hey ! Slow down , hot shot ! Don 't be talking to the moles They messed up . Hey , mole ! Eat my Long John ! Look , I already told you this is CDC business . And I 'm telling you that those lockers are MTA business . Okay . We 'll pay for the lock that we broke , Officer . I mean , whatever we can do . Lady , who am I talking to now ? You or him ? You 're talking to me Okay ? You 're talking to me . All we want to see is . See what ? That 's the old maintenance bridge , buddy . This insect that we are looking . Look , man your lady want a bug or its eggs , or whatever she wants . That 's fine by me . But it 's like Swiss cheese down there . Tunnels in . Tunnels out . Old tracks . You go messing around break you neck , and it 's my ass on the line . Lace-up shoes . Black . Nine West . Chuy , finish your sandwich It 's good . It 's chicken . Penny loafers . Double E. He 's really good at that . Oh , yes . He imitates anything . Don 't he go to school ? He doesn 't need school . He 's special . What you making , there ? Is that a super-hero ? Mister Funny Shoes . - He knows everything about shoes . - Hey ! I 'm talking to you . No , you talking at me , partner . You come back with the proper permits . Maybe we 'll have a conversation . Great , we 'll do lunch . Yeah . I look forward to it . Uptown . What happened ? Napoleon is alive and well and working for the MTA . We have to get down there . He wants a permit ? I 'll give him a real special one . Ah , what 's that ? Is that the egg thing ? Give me a hand . Oh , man . That smells . I can hear the bugs inside . Come on . Cut it . She gonna give us at least forty bucks . What 's up ? I think there 's a guy down there . Shit . Oh , shit . Oh , shit . Help ! Oh , God please ! Please help me ! A philosopher named Hobbes once wrote that life , by its very nature . Is nasty , brutish , and short . An ant would put it more succinctly . Can I eat it or will it eat me ? It 's this kind of simplicity that governs the phylum Insecta . - Hello ? - They live in a world . It 's me . I got the permits . You did ? We 're going down first thing tomorrow . Okay . That 's great . Listen , honey , I gotta go right now . I 'll call you later . Or of cellular phones . As my colleague can tell you . So you think your little Frankensteins got the better of you ? I as hoping you could tell me . I really need to find some answers , Walter . Dear Susan . Is it answers you want from me or is it absolution ? You still think making the Judases was wrong ? Three years ago I would have called it unforgivable . But I have two grandchildren who are alive today because of you . It would be a tad hypocritical for me to pass judgment . That 's not an answer , Walter . It 's not an easy question . But as to the Judases . I think it 's likely some survived . Evolution has a way of keeping things alive . But they all died in the lab . Yes , Susan . But you let them out into the world . The world 's a much bigger lab . Funny shoes . Yeah . Hi , Peter . It 's Remy . Yeah . Hi . Is Susan there ? I need to talk to her . How you doing ? Fine . It 's really important . Yeah . Sure . What are you doing ? What do you got there ? - Where ? - Right down there . In your hand . Nothing , nothing . Are we testing it ? Maybe . Are we testing it ? Maybe . I don 't know . Could be . It 's Remy . Oh , good . Okay . So give me the phone . Give me the phone . Are we testing it ? Yes . Can you hold on a minute ? Hey . What 's up ? They found what ? What 's going on ? Okay , I 'll be there in , in about twenty minutes . Okay . Bye . How long you got ? Patience . Just try again . Try again . You know , sometimes these things can be wrong . It 's okay . I gotta go , okay ? Bye . Susan we got the subway thing today . Yeah , I know . I 'm just gonna to meet you there when I 'm done . Wait . Done from what ? Boots , toys , uh , beer bottles Body parts , cocaine-filled condoms Uh , little baby alligators . Shit , you wouldn 't believe the stuff I 'd seen . Yep . They flush ' em down . We fish ' em out . But this thing . We didn 't know what this was . We were thinking about throwing it , but then I remembered Remy . Jeremy plays bass in my band . Anyway so , uh . Yep . I remember Remy says to me . " If it 's got more than four legs it 's not a mammal . " It 's a lobster . Right ? My father saw me stay in bed . He 'd go get the pitcher cold water and whoosh ! Brr ! I tell you that 's some alarm clock . How big did you say these bugs are ? Come on . Hurry up . You know my shift 's almost over . I need my beauty sleep . Man , if I 'm blowing off my Saturday then so are you . Yeah . It looks like somebody requested you for overtime . Come on . Hurry up . Let 's find these things . We 've got a long way to go . All right , watch your step there . We got burrows going down seven stories here . No shit ? Oh , yeah . It 's five stories down , partner . You fall , I don 't wanna come back and pick you up . Okay . It 's all yours . Go ahead . - It 's forty-eight hours anyway . - I can 't wait that long . It 's forty-eight hours . You got something to write with ? Yes . Yes . I write it . Come on , here 's the case number it 's two-seven . What you say ? Two-seven ? Yes . Two-seven . Eight-three . All right . You got that ? What does this mean ? Case number ? It means I deal with you in forty-eight hours . Okay ? Mister Funny Shoes . Chuy ! Hi , Doc . Susan sent you some homework . Chuy ? Chuy ? Chuy ? Chuy ? Chuy ? People actually do live down here ? Yeah , man . The mold people . This section was pretty popular all the way to Fulton Street . Tweaked-out crackheads , dopeheads shitheads . Mental cases . Then suddenly poof ! All gone . Rumors got started . Someone found a couple of stiffs . Yeah , they make up some crap about a killer . Overcoat Slim , Long John . Now , down here is the land of talk . The wildest version goes the farthest . Hold it right here . You got it ? I see . What this ? Look ! The organ 's perfectly form They were functional . I 'm guessing here ... and of course ... they don 't have a complete specimen but ... What do you think it is ? This thing is not just some random mutation . It 's a highly evolved soldier caste formidable killer . It couldn 't have developed in a vacuum . It 's part of a colony . This way . This way . Should have stayed at the office . How much longer do we have to go ? Keep looking around . The size of your palm . Man , looks like shit . Aw , amn , take a whiff . God , it smells like acid . No , it 's ammonia . Hey , guys . There 's some weird shit here . What kind of weird shit ? Lots of it . God ! Man ! Go ahead . Ask him . Ask him . What the heck . You seen anything like this before ? Why 're you asking me if I 've ever seen some shit like this before ? Do I look like I 've seen some shit like this before ? Hell , no , I ain 't never seen no shit like this before . Who the fuck would want to climb up these walls and hang one of these ? Must have been a big elephant-ass motherfucker . I don 't know the fuck . The Delancey Street station will be closing in five minutes . Please find alternate routes to your destination . Oh , come on , Peter . Hurry up . Do you have the time ? Sir , the time ? You know , my father always wanted me to become a dentist . And I said , " No way . " I 'm not gonna spend my life looking into people 's open mouths . What could be worse than that , right ? Oh , I 've never been this deep . This is the old Armory Station . Hey , they built it around the turn of the century . It 's been closed for decades . I guess we covered everything . Hey , look you got your shit . I 'm happy for you . Let 's get the hell outta here . Josh , I want a full team in here by six tonight . All right . - Oh , shit ! What the fuck ? - Don 't . Hey , look what the fuck you did , man ! You see the size of that thing ? ! Peter , are you all right ! It 's okay , Josh . It 's okay . I think I 'm okay . Get the hell off me . Yeah , I think he 's okay , too . How am I gonna get you back up ? I don 't know . See a way up ? No . Shit . There is no way up . Man , that 's gonna work . Do you know a better way up ? Hey ... show that to the station manager . Tell him , Leonard said he 's gonna have his bubble-butt if he don 't have someone down here in ten . Wait a second . I can 't find my way back alone . Look look , look . Just go back the same way we came . Wait ! - All right . - Take the first tunnel to the left Then go to the fourth . Right ? Then , right , right left . Right ? Left , four Peter , can I just stay here and help you guys back up ? Toss the glow-sticks down and just go , Josh . Please . Just keep heading ' up . You 're gonna get there . - All right . - Hurry !

You know I loved that woman and now she 's gone Could you just knock it off . Please ? Knock it off . Hey , I sing when I 'm nervous . Turn these lights back on . What ? You said the cables are still alive . Maybe we could rewire them . There you go again . What ? How you gonna rewire all this ? You need a crew down here . What is your problem , man ? Do we need a memo every time we take a shit ? - Oh , don 't go there . - Hm ? You better be careful how you speak to people . Josh ? He wouldn 't be coming from there . Manny , what the hell are you doing here ? Hurry ! The lady needs help ! Hey , honey , we 're coming ! Oh , Jesus please hurry . Please . Come on . Dam ! Oh , no ! What the fuck is that ? Just hold out . Come on get her man ! Down ! What the fuck is that ? What the Fucking monster ! Look ! There ! There ! There ! The car ! The car ! Push the door ! Push the fucking door ! What the fuck was that ? Come on . Here Here ! Here ! Here ! Just wait a minute ! Fuck it ! You wait a minute ! I 'm gonna make sure ! It 's not dead . Yeah , well it 's gonna be ! Very soon , lady ! There it is . Drag it out . - There it is ! - Drag it out ! You better tell me what the hell 's going on around here . Oh , man . Okay , Leonard . Okay . It 's gonna be fine . You 'll be fine . Okay , You stay calm . Oh , Christ . Okay , there we go . Everything 's gonna be okay . Christ . Yeah . Do you feel better ? Josh will be here soon He 'll Oh , man ... You 're dreaming , man . You 're dreaming , man . If your boy was coming back he would been here by now . They got his ass , man . They ate his ass , man . We don 't know that . What has been putting that shit all over the walls ? Listen Leonard , if you keep on screaming like that we 're gonna meet the rest of its family . Manny ? Manny , be careful . It-it 's dead . No , no , no . I emptied two clips into that thing and it kept coming . Wait . Wait a second . Help me turn it over . Peter , these are lungs . What the hell is she talking about ? Shit . Biology 101 . You know , insects don 't have lungs . It 's what limits their size . Secretions are the same . Oh , God . When I increased the Judas 's metabolism I must have sped up its breeding cycle . We 're talking tens hundreds of thousands of generations . I mean , who knows how many mutations . Listen , I just don 't know if I can get this . How could the ? How could the Judas evolve into this ? Think generations . Not years , okay ? It took forty thousand generations for apes to turn into humans . So ? We changed its DNA , Peter ! I mean , we don 't know what we did ! Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Wait a minute ! Hold on . If that thing has been around , How come nobody 's ever seen it ? I think we have . Sometimes an insect will evolve to mimic its predator . A fly can look like a spider . A caterpillar can look like a snake . The Judas evolved to mimic its predator . Us . Nobody up there knows about this ? Nobody would . Not until it 's too late . These things can imitate us . They can infiltrate us . And breed a legion before anyone would even notice . How ? How could you do this ? How ? How could you do this ? ! You ... you take something and you make it like a man . A man who 's not a man , Manny he 's he 's thing ! Manny ! - Steal my child . - Now , you tell here Manny . You tell her , ' cause she don 't give a goddamn . Hey . Hey . Hey . Hey . Your kid 's gone . My leg 's Shut up . Shut up Shut the fuck up . Oh , shit ! They 're everywhere ! Manny , get over here ! It 's the blood ! The smell of the blood is driving them crazy ! Oh , shit ! We have to cover the smell ! Manny , give me your razor ! Give me the razor ! Here . Taking to the windows , any one crack . Just do it ! Ow ! What is it ? Scent glands . Insects use them to identify themselves . Here . Rub it all over yourself . They won 't attack you if they think you 're one of them ! It worked . Do you mind if ? No . Go ahead . Manny , give me your lighter . Look this is where we are . Now , these tunnels may lead to the surface . Yeah . If we can get this car moving , we might be able to make it . What ? What you mean ? I mean , probably . But even if they do . This thing 's been down here rotting for half a century . How do you know it 'll move ? Listen . This car is a C.R. - seventeen from Coney Island . Believe me . It was made to last . Now , Manny there is a track relay switch in this room here . You switch the tracks . That 'll get us going . Yes , I 'll try . I 'll try . Do . There 's a fuse box down the tracks If I can rewire it I can juice up the whole system . Leonard , man , look at yourself . I 'll do it . Hey , if you talk me through it I 'll go out there . - All you 've gotta do is . - No , no , no , n-no , I 'll go . I 'll go . Why ? I know much more about what 's out there than you do . You 're right . You understand the creature and , Leonard knows the subway so ... So this is the way it 's gotta be . Whatever happens , it 's Manny and me . Why ? You two have gotta stay on this car . You gotta get back up . You gotta undo this . So , I 'll go . We 'll go . I have to put this on you now . They mimic us . We mimic them . Ah , Peter Peter . Peter , look . You 'll find two wires . One green , the other blue . Okay . Man , this , this shit can 't be sanitary . Take it off . No , man . L-L-Leave it on . Leave it on . Don 't touch it . Try not to sweat . They sense chemical changes . Okay . Okay , I 'll , I 'll try not to sweat . Chuy ! Susan ! He 's in . He just needs to find the switch . Green . Blue . Green . Blue . Green . Blue . Shit ! Oh , shit . A-A-Ah , shit . Chuy ! Chuy ! Chuy ! It 's me ! Come on , Manny . What 's taking you so long ? Do these subway tracks lead to the Grand Central and Penn Station ? Yeah . Yeah . Well , they 'll use them and migrate out of the city . After that they 'll set up colonies anywhere they can . Now every specimen we 've seen has been female . Because a male would be a lighter color and it would have no wings . And if they 're holding true to the Judas 's spawning pattern , the nests will have only one fertile male . Now , if we could catch that male and kill him . Then the females won 't be able to breed and the whole generation could die out . Where the hell is the male ? Chuy , come here . Come here . Friends . Come here . Please ? Oh , goddamn it , he must be in trouble . He must be in trouble . Wait ! Listen ! - Oh , Jesus ! - I 'm going out there . You stay here . Listen ! If the car starts I 'll meet you at the end of the platform . Chuy ? Oh , my God . Oh , Manny . Chuy . Yes ! Yes ! C.R. - seventeen from Coney Island , goddamn it . Goddamn it ! Damn it ! God ! Leonard ! Get away ! Get away ! I 'm bleeding . Found a way out . By the dumbwaiter . Peter , I 'm bleeding . Go away . I can 't stop it . I can 't stop it . They 'll be here soon . Where 's my wife ? Where 's Susan ? She went to get Manny . Susan ! Sh ! They haven 't seen us yet . Don 't move . Oh God . No . Leonard ? You see my health ... feel ... And I ain 't got too much time . - Come on , Chuy . - Hurry ! All right . Come on in . That 's all right . That 's a good boy . Come on . No . No , it 's all right . Sh ! Stop . Stop it . It 's okay . It 's okay . Good boy . All right , Pete . Come on . Get in . Get in , Peter . Come on . Chuy , shh ! Stop it . Stop it . Shh ! What is ? Get in . Peter , get in . Peter ! What are you doing ? I gotta stop them here . No ! Peter , don 't do this ! Peter ! No ! No ! Oh , Jesus ! Don 't ! Chuy ! Chuy ! Stop ! Stop it ! Train ! We 're here ! Help ! Watch it . Go on . Go on ! Get out ! Hurry ! Go ! Fuck you ! Watch out ! Chuy ? Chuy ? Chuy ? Chuy ? Oh , God . It 's the male . No ! You will not hurt him ! No ! Turn around ! Turn around ! Come on . Police and emergency crews continue their work in the aftermath of tonight 's explosions on the Lower East Side . We wept the area twice . It 's burned . Nothing could have survived down there . What about one of us ? I 'm sorry , Susan . I really am . Shiny wire . Mountain boots . Ten . Brown .

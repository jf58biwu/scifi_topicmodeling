 ( Michael ) Laurie , where are you ? I can 't believe you 're not home . I 've just come across something out here that 's ... that 's gonna blow your mind . I 'm faxing you copies of some weird seismic activity . [ Beeping ] But it 's not geological . It 's coming from underground or something . I don 't even know . I think I 've ... I ... I ... I think I 've lost power or something . [ Man whispering ] ( Michael ) Hey ! What the ... What the hell are you doing ? [ Michael grunting ] I have a permit to be out here . Where are you taking me ? L ... I promise I ... I won 't tell anyone . Oh , we know you won 't . What are you doing ? What the hell is goin ' on ? [ Whooping ] Run , boy , run ! [ Whooping ] [ Panting ] Help me ! [ All chuckling ] Somebody help me ! [ Screaming ] No ! Help ! Help ! Please help ! Something 's got me ! Don 't let this happen . [ Chuckling ] Something 's got me ! Don 't let ... Somebody ... Damn . She 's still hungry . ( Quinn ) What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds , where it 's the same year , and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? ( voice ) Sliders . [ Grunts ] I hate this new timer . All of our landings have tanked ever since we started using that thing . I 'll keep adjusting it till we find a landing we like . [ Grunts ] Or at least one we can survive . [ Grunting ] How long we here ? Three days and change . [ Panting ] Hey , maybe it 'll warm up , and we can catch a little sun and swim , huh ? Uh , I wouldn 't recommend it , Miss Wells . Of course . First time we slide to a beach , and it 's closed . All right . Let 's go find Paradise . I don 't know about Paradise , but I was in a place called Eden once . In Tunisia , in North Africa . Nasty , fly-infested place . [ Bird calling ] Hey ! What do you think you 're doin ' ? Uh , the lady 's got a flat tire . Just helpin ' out . Yeah , well , we 'll take it from here . Oh , yeah , sure . I 'm runnin ' late anyway . Take care . Mr. Mallory ? That wasn 't exactly Auto Club material . Thanks . He was one of those creepy guys from town . No problem . I actually hold the world record in tire-changing . [ Chuckles ] Great . My assistant and I are up here looking for oil deposits . Well , when you see your assistant , tell him he 's gonna have to replace that spare . If I see him . I went back to L.A. For a few days , and last night he left this strange message on the machine . I haven 't been able to contact him since . I 'm sure he 's fine . I always imagine the worst . [ Grunts ] All right , that should do it . Listen , is there any chance we could catch a ride into town ? Yeah , the sign says it 's seven miles . Looks like it might rain . Please . It 's the least I could do . Great . ( Professor ) All right . ( Professor ) Let 's get out of this rain . [ Grunts ] Somehow , I always imagined Paradise as being a little bit more lively . They don 't get many tourists here because of the beach . It 's never open . We got any money to get something to eat ? Not here . ( Rembrandt ) Problem solved . Ah , working in a restaurant , huh ? Hmm . Chopping lettuce , washing dishes , taking orders from awful people . Looking for work ? Yeah . You the manager ? Huh . Manager , owner , waiter , and cook . That 's why I could use some help around here . I have two openings . My friend here , Mr. Brown , actually cooked in the Navy . And Wade , didn 't you wait tables back in high school ? Thanks for remembering . Okay , then . Let 's get you started . We 'll do the menial work on the next world . Next two worlds . Leave while you can ! Listen to me ! Now , you let go of that pretty lady 's arm , Trudy . You 'll have to excuse her . Trudy doesn 't like strangers much . She , uh , always tries to scare ' em off . Uh , let me show you the kitchen . [ Sighing ] Sheriff Burke , I 'm Laurie Miller . I spoke with you about my assistant . Oh , yeah , right , right . Um , well , first thing this morning , I went up to his base camp and took a look around . Nothing seemed out of place . I 'm sure he 's okay . I 'm not so sure . Organize a search party , we 'll look together . Well , that might be a little premature . You see , around here a lot of folks often go out into the woods and go hiking . I 'm sure he 's just somewhere out in the great outdoors communing with nature . We won 't know if he 's okay until we find him . Well , if you want to go out looking , I 'm not stoppin ' you . Is everything okay ? The sheriff won 't do his job . I am a one-man department here , and this town keeps me pretty busy . I can see you 're a real tornado . [ Clears throat ] I can be . Good . Cause she 's got a problem , and I think it 's a little more important than your horoscope . ( Parker ) Sheriff . Uh , Bud just called . Said it was an emergency . Well , like I said . This town keeps me pretty busy . Great . I 'll never be able to search those hills alone . We 'll all help . We 've got a couple of days here . I 'll go with you up to base camp . The Professor will ask around town . I 'm sure we 'll find Michael somewhere . Come on . [ Dog barking ] [ Footsteps ] ( Bud ) It 's Al . [ Sheriff sighs ] Was Al . Third time she 's come this far inland . Yeah , her appetite 's gettin ' bigger . We 're gonna have to start feeding ' her more . Feedin ' her more ? Who are you gonna start feeding ' her with , our families ? Some outsiders came into town today . They 'll do . Make sure you get it all . [ Children playing ] ( kid # 1 ) Right here , mister , come on . ( kid # 2 ) Over here with the ball . That 's weird . Why play on cement when you can play on the grass ? This whole town 's a little strange . What 's he doing ? Come on ! Oh . Sorry . I 'll get that . I 'll be right back . ( kid ) Oh , my God . Here you guys go . Thank you , Mister . Those kids were watching you like a hawk . I know . ( Alice ) I was surprised when Mr. Whitmore called . We don 't get many visitors this time of year . Well , we 're just passing through . Won 't be here more than a couple of days . Well , you 'll be all set soon as you sign in . Right . Next of kin ? City ordinance . In case somethin ' happens . Well , you 'll have no fears there . We four are all the kin we have . You , um , wouldn 't , by any chance , have come across a young geologist called Michael Levy , would you ? No . We don 't know the name . Would you be so kind as to ask among your friends ? Well , they wouldn 't know either . How do you know ? I 'd know . If somebody 's new in town , we all know . Yes , I 'm sure you do . Right . Here 's the key to your room , and it 'll be ready in about five minutes . Thank you . Quaint place . Lovely picture of you . 1941 ? ( Alice chuckling ) That 's not me . That 's my gram , Annie . She founded the bed-and-breakfast , and ... and that was the opening day . An extraordinary likeness . Yeah . People always say that . ( maid ) Sir , your room is ready . Oh , uh , Mr. Arturo . We are so happy that you 're here . Thank you . I don 't care what the sheriff said , he didn 't just walk off . No one leaves without their wallet , or their laptop , or their car . Let me see that fax again . Whatever happened to Michael has gotta have something to do with this . Is there any way you can reconstruct that ? Well , the field transmitters have a three-day memory . I could reconstruct the fax by using the original data . I 'll download it now . All right . Tell the computer only to bring up the last few hours before Michael disappeared . It 'd make sense . He probably just discovered what he was tryin ' to send . [ Beeps ] ( Laurie ) This doesn 't make any sense . Maybe this 'll give us a better image . What 's that ? The computer 's programmed to cut in if the sensors pick up any seismic activity . Something 's moving underground right now . No , impossible . Nothing out there can move through earth like this . Well , obviously , there is . This must be what Michael was tryin ' to tell you about . These people are pleasant to the point of nausea , but they tell you nothing . Maybe they don 't think they have anything interesting to tell you . Ah , but they do . Take the cemetery , for instance . Up to 1949 , there were 27 deaths , since 1949 , there have been three . Talk to the town people about it , what do they say ? I 'll bite . What do they tell you ? Absolutely nothing . Same with Michael Levy . Nothing . I think you 'd get the same response if you asked them the color of the sky . Do you know that half the people who come in here won 't even let me take their order ? They 'll only talk to Parker . Well , it 's a small town . They 're not used to outsiders . Or people over 30 . Do you realize , apart from Trudy , I 'm the oldest person in town ? Well , no wonder you don 't like it here . [ Rembrandt and Wade chuckling ] Look , don 't worry about it , Professor . I 'm sure you 'll wheedle some information out of someone . I don 't think so . These people are extraordinarily tight-lipped . Look , when I was touring , I spent the night in a speck of a town called Mount Dora . It was hurricane season , so I got no further than the hotel bar . But after two hours , I knew that a girl by the name of Deanne was sleeping with the town doctor , and that the mayor had skipped with $ 20,000 to buy a new boat . Point taken , Mr. Brown . Perhaps I should spend some time in the town bar . ( Rembrandt ) Uh , my time 's up . Yeah , I guess my break 's up , too . Hmm . I 'll see you back at the hotel . You , uh , you like him a lot , don 't you ? Well , what 's not to like ? He 's cute , he treats his grandmother great . I don 't know , there 's something about him . He just ... He doesn 't seem like most guys his age , you know ? I think somebody 's tryin to get your attention . Who ? Can I get you something ? Go away . Mrs. Whitmore ... Get out . Get out ! Leave before it 's too late . Hey , we need a doctor here ! What are you doin ' ? What 's wrong with these people ? I was just tryin to help the boy . For whatever reason , they don 't want your help . And it 's pretty clear some don 't want us here at all . What 's with this place ? ( Laurie ) Right , right . [ Beeping ] Damn . I 've lost it again . Where do you think Farmer John went ? Let 's hope he went to get help . Whatever tunneled under this must 've been huge . It 's moving again , in the opposite direction . [ Grunting ] Well ... Oh . ... so much for keeping you dry . Oh , nice try , anyway . ( Wade ) Thanks for walking me home . Well , I , uh , hope there 'll be other opportunities to do it again . You know I 'm only here a few days , Parker . Is there any way I can get you to stay ? Sorry . Just not possible . That 's too bad . I like havin ' you here . Oh , I 'm glad someone does . I got the distinct feelin a lot of people around here didn 't . I told you , don 't pay attention to Trudy . Hey , it 's not just Trudy . You saw how some of your customers wouldn 't even talk to me . Don 't worry about them . They just don 't have any manners . ( Alice ) Parker Whitmore . What are you doin ' here ? Just makin ' sure Wade got home all right . Well , she 's home now , isn 't she ? Right . See you in the morning . [ Chuckling ] Okay . Thanks , Parker . For everything . ( man ) Hurry up . [ People chattering ] [ People chanting ] " We vow to keep the secret . " " We vow to keep the silence . " " We ask forgiveness for those ... " " We vow to keep the secret . " " We vow to keep the silence . " " We pray they did not suffer . " " We vow to keep the secret . " " We vow to keep the silence . " " We pray their souls are at peace . " " We vow to keep the secret . " " We vow to keep the silence . " Well , I 'm not sure why she 's feeding so much , but let 's hope she calms a bit . The good news is , the more she eats , the more of the " gift " she leaves us . One other note . Y 'all know we lost Tom Cooper at the restaurant today . He lived a good life , all 103 years of it . Let 's take a moment for him . Okay . Let 's eat . [ Chattering ] Slow down , slow down . Don 't waste it . Every drop is precious . [ Gasps ] You shouldn 't have seen this . [ Laughing ] [ Laughing ] I can make it , I ... Yes , I know you can . But I think I need a bit of help , just to make sure I get home . [ Chuckling ] [ Snickering ] You 're all right , Max . Yeah . So are you , Fred . You know , you and your friends should leave here . Why is that ? Well , you know what ? What I told you about my flap here , it 's all a lie . What ? You didn 't lose it in the American-Canadian border dispute ? I lost it right here , in Paradise . How ? I was just mowing ' the grass , minding ' my own damn business , when that damn beast got me . What ? I didn 't say nothin ' , Max . If he asks , I didn 't say nothin ' . Hey , Fred , where 're you going ? ( Sheriff ) Let him be . You and I have business . What kind of business would that be , Sheriff ? [ Sighs ] Get in . We 've got a body at the beach that needs an ID . Why me ? L ... I don 't know anyone in town . You know your friends . We think the one at the beach is the girl . Wade ? Well , I can tell you from here , it 's not Wade . This is not even a woman . This some sort of local humor ? Where I come from , it would be considered poor taste . ( Professor ) What 's going on here ? What the devil do you think you 're doing ? All right , guys . Now , if this is your quaint local way of frightening off strangers , congratulations , it works . The stranger is frightened . Now , you 've had your fun . Get the ladder down . No , the fun is just beginning . Oh , come here . Come here . [ Yells ] [ Whispering ] It 's all right , come on . [ Grunting ] [ Grunting ] [ Groaning ] [ Grunting ] Damn ! Confound you ! [ Grunting ] ( Laurie ) Well , that 's weird . It just made a radical turn towards the beach . ( Quinn ) All right , hang on . [ Tires screeching ] ( Laurie ) Hold it . Hold it right here ! Where is it now ? It stopped . It should be just over the bluff . All right , we 'll get there faster if we cross on foot . Come on . Go , go . Hey ! Get back in the Jeep . This is private property . Maybe you didn 't hear me . I heard you . I 'm just not listening . [ Both grunting ] I really suggest that you stay there . That guy had a serious problem . This whole town has a problem . [ Thudding ] What 's that ? Sounds like drums . What just happened down there ? I don 't know . We 'll wait till it gets light and then we 'll check it out . Check out this sinkhole . What could have caused it ? We 've been up and down this beach . There 's nothing out here . Bud stopped us for a reason . Something happened down here . It 's almost 7 : 00 . Maybe the sheriff can get Bud to tell us what 's goin ' on . It 's about time you showed up . I 've been callin your office for over an hour . We 're on our own clock around here . Yeah , and it 's running a little slow . You need somethin ' , or did you just come down here to insult me ? Yeah , my friends are missin ' . I need you to help me find them . When was the last time you saw ' em ? Last night . The Professor never came back from the pub . Wade , she went for a walk . She never came back , either . Hmm , maybe the girl found the bar and they 're sleepin it off together . Look , she said she was going to the restaurant and she was gonna meet with Parker . Why don 't you go into your office and give him a call ? Maybe he 's seen her . Well , if she did , there 's your answer . That Parker has always had good luck with women . And , as far as the Professor goes , well , maybe he got lucky , too . Three people have disappeared in this town within the past two days . Now , if you 're not gonna do anything about it , maybe the State Police will . Hey . Okay . Okay . Come on in . We 'll give Parker a call . Don 't fight me on this , Wade ! I 'm doin ' you a favor . Yeah , right . I really needed to be kept tied up all night ! Yeah , you don 't understand , but you 're goin ' to . My friends 'll figure out where I am . They 'll be comin ' for me . Yeah , we got plans for the two that are left . And they don 't include rescuing you . What ? The big guy , the Professor , it 's sad what happened to him . What happened ? Hey , what did you do to him ? They sacrificed him to the beast . The creature needs human flesh to keep alive . They feed it drifters , criminals , outcasts . Anyone who nobody will miss . They fed him ? Years ago , this town was nothing but a uranium mine . We had a huge explosion in the hole . It killed 50 people . But it also created a mutant beast . Parker was actually trying to kill it when he discovered that it left something behind . Something that helps people live a long time and keeps them young until the day they die . That disgusting stuff they were eating ? Trudy , please help me . I need to get out of here . Please . There 's nowhere for you to go . If you don 't become one of us , Wade , you 'll be sacrificed with the others . You choose this , then you choose to be young for the rest of your life . You may look young , Parker , but , inside , you are as old and decrepit as I look . And every time you feed someone to that beast , you make one step closer to hell ! Don 't start with me . At least when I finally die , I won 't have the blood of innocent people on my conscience , or my hands ! You fool ! This is a gift , and I 'm not gonna waste it like you ! Eat ! Why are you doin ' this ? I want you to stay with me . ( Trudy ) He wants a new wife . Someone to replace me . [ Door opens ] Hey ! Hey , in here ! ( Quinn ) Rembrandt ? Q-Ball ! Get me out of here ! What 's goin ' on ? What 're you doin in there ? The hell if I know . I came here to get the sheriff to help me find Wade . Next thing I know , he 's hitting me over the back of the head . Wade 's missing ? Yeah , and the Professor , too . What is goin ' on in this town ? Why do people keep disappearing ? You won 't like the answer . Trust me . I 'd like to know anyway . You won 't hear it from me . Whatever this town is into , we are not gonna be a part of it . [ Chuckles ] It 's too late , man . You better start talkin ' . ( Rembrandt ) Forget it , Q-Ball . I think the sheriff went over to Parker 's . I told him Wade might be goin ' there . L ... I know where he lives . It 's listed on one of Michael 's charts . Look , you guys go on without me . No , no , no . Here , hold him . [ Sighs ] Get over here . [ Grunts ] Stand back , Remmy . Here , cuff him . [ Grunting ] Hey ! You can be happy here , Wade . I 'll be a good husband . You can ask Trudy . [ Chuckles ] She 's mad at me now , but she has to admit , ever since her stroke , I 've taken good care of her . What 's it gonna be , Wade ? Eat and live , or don 't and die ? I don 't want to die . Then taste and live . [ Parker grunting ] [ Grunts ] Where do you think you 're goin ' , huh ? I 'm sure the hell not gonna be the next meal ! [ Chuckling ] Optimistic , aren 't you ? Come on . Come on . [ Wade grunting ] Let her go , Burke . What is that on your face ? Parker , you idiot . You know you 're supposed to ask the Council for permission to feed her . Why ? So they could deny me ? I said let her go . [ Both grunting ] [ Gun fires ] Let her go . Burke . All right , who 's gonna explain that ? ( Wade ) It has to do with the stuff they eat . The stuff that the creature leaves behind . The Professor . Trudy said he was fed to something that lives by the ocean . That must be what Bud was tryin ' to keep us from seeing . And Michael ? They could all still be alive . The beast keeps the sacrifices alive until she needs to eat . How do you know that , Trudy ? Because I 've been in her cave . I was just lucky to escape . But what I saw , others cocooned , kept like food for winter . That 's why I couldn 't eat the " gift . " I keep seeing those people . Where is the cave , Trudy ? The cove . The cove . We 've got a read . It 's movin ' over there . What exactly are we lookin ' for ? You 'll know when you see it . If we see it . At the angle it 's traveling , it should surface a few feet offshore . We better move over to the rocks . [ Radar beeping ] Laurie . [ Gasps ] Remmy . Laurie , come here ! [ Laurie whines ] Get to the rocks ! It 's after her . [ Grunts ] Quinn ! Up here ! [ Screaming ] Quinn ! Help me ! Don 't let it ... [ beeping ] It 's in there . What is it ? Did you actually see it ? No . But I could feel it movin ' underground . It could be some kind of freak nemertean . Is that Latin for " big freakin ' worm " ? Somethin ' like that . But that thing 's had its last meal . Time to put a slug on the barby . [ Gun firing ] Can you keep him busy ? Not a problem . All right . We gotta make a run for the cave . Give me the bag . Can 't be any dumber than walkin ' into the creature 's living room , right ? Okay . Go ! See you in there . [ Gun firing ] [ Panting ] We made it . So far . Would you like me to carry the dynamite ? I got it . 'Cause if you don 't feel comfortable ... I got it . Pitchblende . This place is a uranium mine . That could explain how it might have mutated . Yeah , that 's what Trudy told me . ( both ) It 's spawning . ( Wade ) Oh , my God . That 's why she 's been feeding so much . Max . He 's in a state of suspended animation . Here , come on . [ Quinn exclaims ] Professor ? Are you all right ? How did you get here so fast ? Fast ? You were taken here last night . Come on , help me with Laurie . [ Grunting ] Where am I ? Don 't worry , we 're gonna get you out of here . [ Gun clicking ] One more . Come on . One more , one more . Put your hands over your head and step out ! A flare . [ Grunts ] Mr. Mallory . This was Michael 's . I 'm so sorry . Come on . We need to get out of here before that thing comes back . Professor , this way . We must destroy this horror , Mr. Mallory . Destroy it utterly . I 'm going to set the charges . I 'll meet you up there . Don 't overstay your welcome . ( Rembrandt ) Hey , Q-Ball ! Over here . Hey , we got a problem . What the hell 's that ? The nursery . What problem ? The sheriff 's got more ammo . All right . There 's an opening halfway down the cave . Get out of here . I 'm right behind you . [ Grunts ] [ Growls ] [ Sheriff screaming ] [ Screaming ] [ Yelling ] ( Wade ) It 's hard to believe a place called Paradise could be the setting for something so horrible . 54 years of sacrifices . All so a few people could stay perpetually young . It makes you sick just thinkin ' about it . You all right ? Yeah . I just didn 't realize it was gonna be this difficult . You sure you don 't want to come with us ? I have to admit , exploring new worlds does sound like fun , but I enjoy exploring this one . I should say goodbye to the others . Yeah . Thanks again for everything . I 'm sorry we couldn 't do more to help . Oh , but you did . It 's better to know what happened . At least , that way , you can deal with it . Thanks to you , his family won 't be waiting for the rest of their lives for him to come home . Michael was an adventurer , too . He loved to travel . He loved discovering new things . I think he 'd like it if you wore this . I 'd be honored . Last chance . [ Chuckles ] Happy trails . Likewise . [ Whoosing ] [ Whoosing ]

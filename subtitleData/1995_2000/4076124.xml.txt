THAT 'S WHY IT 'S ALWAYS DARK . THEY CAN 'T STAND THE LIGHT . SO WHY DO THEY NEED YOU ? WHEN THEY FIRST BROUGHT US HERE , THEY EXTRACTED WHAT WAS IN US SO THEY COULD STORE THE INFORMATION , REMIX IT LIKE SO MUCH PAINT AND GIVE US BACK NEW MEMORIES OF THEIR CHOOSING . BUT THEY STILL NEEDED AN ARTIST TO HELP THEM . BUT THEY STILL NEEDED AN ARTIST TO HELP THEM .

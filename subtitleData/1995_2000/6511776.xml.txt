 Max ? Max , you there ? You 're late , kid . - You get lost ? - Sorry . Had to wait till my mom took off . It 's way past his bedtime , Max . He 's not cut out for this . Cut out for what ? Oh , there 's more here than just trees . Before you can find out what , I gotta know you 're not gonna tell anyone about this place . I won 't . I swear . It 's a vow , Tony . Don 't make it if you 're gonna break it . I won 't break it , man . Not ever . No matter what ? Even if someone dies tonight ? Anthony Reed . - Got any outstanding warrants ? - Of course not . I 'm gonna have to check it out , so put your hands on the vehicle . - Look , I was just taking a walk . - Uh-huh ? Right past all those big " No Trespassing " signs ? - Now , you just stand there for a minute . - Come on , man . I didn 't do anything . I wish I had a nickel for every time I had to drag you kids out of these woods . Deputy Foster to dispatch ... Can you repeat that request ? Sir ? I didn 't quite copy your last transmission . Officer ? Dispatch to Foster . Do you copy ? Deputy Foster , this is Dispatch . Do you copy ? Deputy Foster , sir , what 's your 20 ? - There you are . Heavy traffic ? - Slow going . Let 's say I had ample time to read the police report you faxed . Provided by the local authorities . It doesn 't begin to tell the whole story . Sheriff 's deputy is slain during a routine patrol . It 's a tragic occurrence , but I don 't see the mystery . Except that he was beaten to death by an invisible assailant . Yes , according to the man accused of his murder . One Tony Reed , and I 'm guessing wrongfully accused . He 's an " A " student , moved from Philadelphia . He 's never been in trouble . Tell me you 've got more than SAT scores to show that this Tony Reed didn 't commit this crime . Maybe . Take a look at the body . The former Deputy Ronald Foster . As you can see , the report doesn 't quite do it justice . My God , it looks like he was hit with a Sledgehammer . Police flashlight . One blow . Damage to the maxillofacial bones and the cranium is consistent with a blunt-force trauma , but ... I 'd say that , uh , Tony eats his Wheaties . Check out the back of his head . His eyeglasses . Penetrated to the back of his skull . Babe Ruth couldn 't hit this hard , let alone a sophomore . Maybe if he was under the influence of PCP or some stimulant . Tox screen came back negative . Even so , stress and fear may have triggered an adrenaline response which is known to enable feats of near-superhuman strength . Agent Mulder ? How long you plan on being down here ? Sheriff Harden , this is my partner , Agent Scully . How long you plan on being down here ? I 'd like Ron left in peace . I don 't know what there is to see , anyway . We got the kid who did it . We don 't mean to second-guess you . We 're hoping to be of assistance . I don 't need it . I got the murder weapon with bloody fingerprints , and once the state crime lab matches that up with Tony Reed , it 's open and shut . Well , uh ... we 're done here . Right ? But you won 't mind if I talk to Tony Reed , do you ? I mean , it won 't hurt your case and if he did do it , you 'll want to know why . What ? This is your lucky day for visitors . This is Agent Scully with the FBI ... I 'm not talking any more . OK ? Well , that might make things worse , and they seem pretty bad already . In your statement , you say that Deputy Foster stopped you , but you don 't say why . Come on , you were cruising , right ? A small town like this , you 're not exactly living la vida loca . I know , I grew up in dullsville , too . Nothing to do but drive and park . How long ago was that ? Look . Don 't you think I know what you 're doing ? You 're like the tenth cop who 's come in trying to relate to me till I confess . If you didn 't do it , it 's all the more reason to clear it up . Everything I know is in my statement . OK , but bear with us cos we 're old and stupid . How long was it between the time you heard the scream to the time that you found Deputy Foster ? Tony , you 're not likely to get a fairer hearing than this . Maybe ten ... 15 seconds . OK , but you didn 't see anyone near the patrol car ? You didn 't hear anything ? You 're still gonna stick with your story that you were the only one there ? I want to go back to my cell . 16 years old , and his life is over unless he starts telling the truth . If you think he 's guilty , why don 't you ask yourself this ? Why wouldn 't he make up a plausible cover ? Why didn 't he say that a pickup full of hillbillies drove by and clobbered the deputy and ran away ? I 'm not saying he 's guilty . I 'm inclined to agree that Tony Reed did not commit murder , but I think he saw who did , and he 's covering up for it . I 'm not sure there was a person to see . I think there was a force at work . What kind of force ? I don 't know , some kind of territorial or spiritual entity , maybe . Poltergeists are associated with violent acts , and manifest around young people . They 're drawn to the turmoil of adolescence . Mulder ... Rather than spirits , can we at least start with Tony 's friends ? Please ? Just ... for me ? I think there 's one person in particular I 'd like to talk to . Let 's wrap it up , people . Two-minute warning . There goes half your grade , Max . You missed the midterm . Not if I take it right now . - In one minute ? - Oh , I 've been studying . I don 't care who your father is . You fail my test , it sticks . Well , I guess I better ace it then , huh ? Take your seat , young man . Piece of cake . It is when you mark them at random . Go ahead , check it . Maybe I got more going on than people know . Chastity Raines ? I 'm Agent Scully . This is Mulder . We 're with the FBI . Yeah , I remember you . What did you and Tony talk about this morning ? - He didn 't kill that cop . - How can you be so sure ? Tony just doesn 't have it in him . Do you ? Were you there when it happened ? Look , I gotta go . Do you realize that Tony could go to prison for the rest of his life for this ? Chastity , if you know something , now is the time to mention it . - Without a warrant , you don 't have to talk . - Wow , you must be her lawyer . Let 's go . Butting into our investigation . I wonder what your father , the sheriff , would think . - How do you know who my dad is ? - You got the same last name . Oh , you 're good . We 're done here . Come on , babe . You must have been a Betty back in the day . A Betty ? Back in the day . Scully . What about the murder weapon ? All I know is , we put the flashlight in here , and now it 's gone . It 's like it disappeared into thin air . How many people have access to this room ? - Me and the deputies under my command . - What does the tape show ? That no unauthorized persons came in , and no one went near this locker . Was this here before ? I don 't know . Can we take a look at the surveillance tape ? You can see that the flashlight was properly secured . It 's not like we 're running some kind of a half-assed operation here . No one 's saying that you are , Sheriff . Here 's when the state police came to take it to the crime lab . There 's me going to get it . We open up the locker and it 's gone . I maybe , uh , didn 't give y 'all the warmest welcome , but if you have any ideas ... May I ? - I watched it a dozen times . - Could there be malfunction with the VCR ? I don 't see how , plus there 's no gap in the time code . The murder weapon was the only hard evidence we had . Without it , we got no case . You know what I gotta do now ? I gotta call Ron Foster 's widow and tell her that I gotta turn his killer loose . Scully , check this out . What am I supposed to be seeing ? Here it comes . Now you see it . One more frame ... now you don 't . What do you make of that ? Take another look , Now it 's here ... now it 's not . Are you ready to be straight with me ? Leave me alone , Mom . Would you just leave me alone ? I 'm tired . This isn 't like a bad report card . Anthony . A man is dead . I told you , I didn 't do it . It 's just that what you say happened doesn 't make sense . - There 's got to be more to it . - Well , there isn 't . OK ? Are those kids involved in this ? That boy , Max ? No . - They 're my only friends . - You 're done seeing them . - You don 't even know them . - I do know them . I was your age once . Tony ... we came here to get a fresh start , get away from them bad schools , the wrong crowd . You are doing so well here . How would you know ? You 're never around . You think it 's my dream to work two jobs ? I 'm doing it for you , Tony . I just want to get some sleep . That 's all I want . You got a chance at a good life ... a real future . We didn 't come all this way so you could throw it away . Listen to that , man . This car 's got guts . Sort of like you that way . Who 's car is this , Max ? Chastity told you to shut up and things would be fine . You did . That tells me a lot . Everything 's not fine . We 're in a stolen car , a cop is dead . Calm down . He 'd been snooping around . He had to go . What do you mean he had to go ? - What happened out there ? - You gotta learn not to ask questions . Slow the hell down , man . You 're freaking me out ! You ain 't seen nothing yet . Max , look out ! I 'm gonna make you one of us . But I call the shots . Always remember that . Hey , Chuck . Sorry to make you trek here for what 's probably a glitch . - What 'd you come up with ? - Eyestrain at first . Then I ran it through my imaging software . I 'm here to tell you , it 's not a glitch . It 's what the camera saw . Buckle up . Chuck is about to take us on a ride through the paranormal . Well , yes and no . Initially , I was thinking spectral manifestation , but , uh , with spirit activity you 'd expect to see light streaks , auras , atmospheric disturbances , translucent figures . Whatever this is ... it 's not a ghost . Especially since ghosts don 't go around leaving synthetic polymers in their wake . - That 's what the gunk on the floor was . - Huh . I dig a mystery with layers . I get the feeling you don 't know what the hell this is . I cross-referenced the silhouette against every organic and inorganic object in the Library of Congress database . The closest match was a Soviet Akula class submarine . I think we can rule that out . And then , there 's this weirdness . My enhancement brought up this dark edge around the anomaly . - A shadow . - It would fit with the lighting . The problem is , it can 't be throwing a shadow unless ... Unless it 's a solid object . Which is impossible , as it only appears for a single frame . One-thirtieth of a second . You know what ? Maybe , uh , SCAG can give us a clearer picture . - SCAG ? - Spectrographic Colour Attribute Generator . I 'm , uh , beta-testing it for JPL . It 's still in the tweaking phase but the basic idea is , I assign known colour values onto the black-and-white image . Then SCAG assigns chromatic values throughout the frame . In effect , making an educated guess at , uh , what all the colours might be . It still needs fine-tuning . What ? You recognize these colours , Scully ? Hey , Tony . Everyone 's looking at me like I 'm a criminal . I 'm not . I heard you took a ride . What was that ? How did he do it ? You 'll find out . Maybe you were right ... about me not being cut out for this . It 's a little late for second thoughts . You trying to move in on my girl ? Saved by the bell . Hey . You wanna stare at someone ? Stare at me . Well , class ... I graded your midterms . Save for a few of you , the news is not good . Mr Pembleton ... what happened ? Welcome back , Mr Reed . Expect to make up the test tomorrow . Mr Harden , you 're here on time for a change . What 's this ? - Self-explanatory . - I got every answer right . - Not because you knew the material . - Are you saying I cheated ? How ? I have no idea how , but you did , and I won 't tolerate it . Back to business , people . Mr Guider ... Mr Baker ... How do I tell Max that I want out ? I wish I could help you , Tony . I can 't even help myself . Babbitt ! Oh , my God ! Excuse me , please . Thank you . Just stay back . I 'll show you my theory if you show me yours . Based on the eyewitness accounts of the students , at this moment , I 'd have to say that I don 't have one . - What about for these globs of goo ? - The ones we found in the evidence room ? Yep . I 'm guessing Max Harden could tell us how they got there . You think Max did this ? Based on what ? I spoke to a few students myself . Max was angry at Mr Babbitt because he failed him on his midterm . He had motive . He may have had motive , but he didn 't have opportunity . - Nobody here saw him go near the victim . - Maybe he didn 't need to . I pulled his records . Rising attendance and discipline problems , but look at this transcript . As his behaviour gets worse , his grades go through the roof . - This kid has changed . - He 's a teenager . Everything is changing . His body and his brain chemistry is in a state of unparalleled upheaval . There 's peer pressure and substance abuse . Any one of these could alter his behaviour . What if it 's given him a psychokinetic or paranormal ability that allows him to exert force over a victim without laying a finger on him ? - That 's your theory ? - Yes , it is . To be proven as soon as I get Max in for questioning . - You needed to speak to Sheriff Harden ? - Yeah , about his son . He 's with him now . They 're taking him to the emergency room . Max just collapsed in the parking lot . You hear about Max ? You OK ? Where are you going ? Tony , the less you know , the better , all right ? What ? No candy ? No flowers ? My deputy told me you were coming and why , so you can just turn right around . Whatever happened at that school , my son didn 't do it . We 'd like to ask your son a few questions . He 's sick . The doctors can 't even say what 's wrong . Max could tell them . You know why you collapsed , don 't you , Max ? Yeah , too much teen spirit . You think ? Smells like murder to me . Who do you think you 're talking to here ? It 's not like you got a damn thing on me . You got a problem with authority , don 't you ? If I wasted Babbitt , then how did I do it ? Am I Carrie or something ? I used some kind of mental powers ? You figured out a way to tap into something that gives you superhuman powers . It came in handy with Babbitt and Deputy Foster . Man , you 're whistlin ' Dixie . High temperature and heart rate , low blood sugar , electrolytes show acidosis . All of these symptoms are consistent with extreme exertion and withdrawal . - Withdrawal ? From what ? - The rush . Whatever gives you power to rearrange furniture and turn a flashlight into a battering ram also gives you quite a buzz . If I can do all that , then what 's stopping me from doing it to you ? I don 't know . Maybe the effects worn off . Maybe you need another fix . As soon as I blow out of here , I 'll be sure to get one . That 's not gonna happen any time soon . Your condition 's getting worse . And we 're not gonna be able to help you unless you can tell us what 's going on . - Boy ... is any of this true ? - No . You better pray I don 't find out it is . Sir ... can we have a word outside ? He 's not a bad kid . He just needs discipline . We 'd like permission to search your house . You 're not getting it . I 'm not ready to jump on a bandwagon and call my boy a murderer . There 's some test results missing from Max 's chart . I think we should track them down . Thanks . Hot off the presses . Anything interesting ? - This can 't be right . - What is it ? Oh , my God . What ? Evidence of cerebral lesions from repeated concussions . Arthritis in the spine and major joints . Stress fractures . Numerous muscle and ... and ligament micro-tears . - What would cause this ? - In a teenager ? I can 't even imagine . You 'd see this in someone who 's crashed race cars or played pro-football for 15 years . Whatever Max is doing , it 's killing him . I think I 'm starting to get it . - I thought I saw a young lady come in here . - I wish . Max Harden 's personal effects . Yeah . Oh ... this is it . Those globs we found ? This is where they came from . Speed . Somehow , Max Harden has found a way to move faster than the eye can see . - Mulder . - That explains Babbitt . Also explains how a chair and table appeared to move with enough force to penetrate a wall . Force equals mass times acceleration . It 's impossible . The human body isn 't designed to move like that . Exactly . That is why his is falling apart . Agents , could you ... ? Max , please don 't do this . You can stop . Sure , just like you can . I mean , hurting people . Haven 't enough people been hurt ? This is not why I got you out ! Look , let 's just leave here , OK ? Let 's just go away . - And do what ? - Find a place to get some help . Help for what ? This is the best thing that 's ever happened to me . I can 't go back to things standing still ... and neither can you . Tony , what are you doing here ? You went in that cave , didn 't you ? You shouldn 't have done that . It was such a rush . Moving fast like that . I didn 't want this for you . How did you find it ? I followed you . I was worried about you . That 's so sweet . I wish things were different than how they are . Maybe they can be . With Max in the hospital , we could go to the cops . He 's out . Oh , my God . Hello ? Boo ! You killed Ron Foster . Yeah , I did . Why ? I don 't know . You want some great reason ? You little son of a bitch ... He thought he was really something ... always liked to push people around . Same as Babbitt ... and same as you . I 'm not afraid of you any more . I can 't let you do this , Max . Yo , Scully . How bad are his injuries ? Too soon to tell . He 's unconscious and bleeding internally . - Apparently from a blow to the abdomen . - Yeah . Delivered with this . - Max 's weapon of choice against cops . - Why would he leave it behind ? - To taunt the police ? - No , I think somebody intervened . I think that 's why the Sheriff is still alive and why his gun is missing . If he can do what you claimed , then who could possibly intervene ? It 's someone who knows exactly how Max does what he does . - Someone who 's finally standing up to him . - Tony . How do we find him ? I would guess the source where Max gets his power from . The woods near where the deputy was killed . Tony never came clean about what he was doing out there . Maybe that 's why the deputy was killed . Maybe he got too close to the truth . Chastity , we don 't have to be doing this . I took care of things with Max . - No , you didn 't . You shouldn 't have tried . - He was gonna kill his father . You stopped him because he let you . He was slowing down . You have , too . If we don 't get back to the cave before Max , we 're history . Hurry ! I 'll catch up . Chastity ? Are you OK ? You 're late , kid . - What did you do to her ? - She took a swing at me . You believe that ? You got it all turned around . Come on , man . Who do you think you 're dealing with ? All I ever wanted was for you to be my friend , Tony . You stuck a knife in my back . Now I 'm gonna mess you up . I 'm sorry , Tony . I can 't go back . Chastity ? Did the USGS show up ? Yeah . 18 geologists and three semis full of gear . They covered every inch of that cave . - And what did they come up with ? - Nothing . Bat guano , above normal magnetic field readings . Nothing that would cause a physiological effect . - What 'd you expect them to find ? - I don 't know . A vortex , like in Oregon . Gravitational aberrations , unique chemical compositions . Relics that would indicate that the cave was a sacred site . You and I were in there . Nothing happened to us . We 're still slow-poking around . What if we 're too old ? You said teenagers differ from adults chemically and physiologically . What if it affects only them ? Well , that 's doubtful . But , no more so than any other theory . - I mean , it 's worth checking out . - Yeah ? Well , we can 't . They pumped concrete into the cave . Sealed it for precautionary reasons . We 'll never know . How 's he doing ? Bruises and muscle strains , mostly . He 'll recover ... go back to being a normal kid . I made this !

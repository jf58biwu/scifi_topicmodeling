 You make man ? No . Woman . MONSTER : Woman ? [ MUSIC - OINGO BOINGO , " WEIRD SCIENCE " ] THEME SONG : Weird science , ooo ! Pictures from a magazine , diagrams and charts , mending broken hearts and making weird science . Something like a recipe , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation , ooo , my creation . It 's my creation ! No heart of gold- - just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation , ooo , my creation . It 's my creation ! From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand ? It 's alive . Alive ! I can 't believe you actually got Zuzu Bailey 's phone number . And it isn 't the Weather Service either . I checked ! Hey ! What What ? Shh ! ( WHISPERING ) Don 't talk . Listen ! I don 't hear anything . ( WHISPERING ) Exactly ! It 's quiet . Too quiet . The whole living room is probably booby trapped . This definitely smells like a Chett trap . All I small is a rousing game of third period dodge ball . Do you want to the serious ? Or do you want to spend another night picking pizza shrapnel out of your nose hairs ? You think the place is wired ? All I know is my parents aren 't home , Chett 's Jeep is in the driveway , and there hasn 't been an ambush in weeks . A recipe for disaster . Don 't touch the floor ! Ah ! Ah ! Oh . Ugh . Don 't worry . I 'm OK . Oh . Good . [ CLICKING ] [ CLICKING ] Oh . Ice maker . Do you remember the moment that you lost control of your life ? Wait ! It might be booby trapped . What booby trap ? We 're safe . We made it to your room . [ ELECTRICAL SOUNDS ] I think we 're about to have a Kodak moment . Hello . Ha ! [ LAUGHING ] Oh , I think I 've got this year 's Christmas card . I made this for Chett when I was in the second grade . Well , it 's certainly impact resistant . Gary says he 's not coming over here anymore as long as Chett 's living here . Dare me to fit this whole thing in my mouth . Lisa , could you pay attention ? Sorry . You know , what it comes down to it , I 'm the only one who sticks up for him . But does he appreciate me ? No . I 'm just his whipping boy . You know , I 'd like to see Chett try and get along without me . I 'd like to see that , too . [ YELLING ] Lisa ! What have you done ? Opened up a little vortex . Nothing to worry about . Well , that was fun . What the hell is this ? This is limbo , Wyatt . A place for things that never existed . Never existed ? You mean I 'm dead ? No , not dead . As far as the world is concerned , there never was a Wyatt Donnelly . That 's my room . Come on . Let 's see how Chett likes being Wyatt-less . Hm . Feels kind of like electric Silly Putty . WYATT : My room looks different . It 's not your room anymore , remember ? Chett 's an only child . It 's his room now . It 's not there . What ? Zuzu 's phone number . You didn 't exist for her to give it to you . Follow me . Remind me to tell dad we have termites . My parents are home ? What kind of bizarre world is this ? There 's no need to whisper . They can 't hear us . Chester 's not home from school yet ? Not yet . Wonder what he 's up to now ? Sounds like the same old Chett . CHETT : Mom ? Dad ? WAYNE : Chett . Where have you been ? Sorry about that . I was at the library . I guess I lost track of time . Oh , here . You got a 98 ! That 's great , hon . Should 've been 100 , but the test fell on the same day as my interview for grad school , and it was my day to volunteer at the children 's hospital . WAYNE : We 've held dinner for you . Thanks , but no . Eating always makes me sleepy , and I 've got a lot of work to do . You know , that 's quite a son we 've got there . We certainly hit the jackpot with that one . I 'm glad we stopped there . My love for a second child would only have paled in comparison . Hey ! What 's going on ? Is this some kind of joke ? This is what Chett would be like without me in his life ? Hm . Not quite the object lesson you were hoping for , is it ? Not quite . Well don 't get upset about it . I 'm sure there 's lots of other people who would be worse off if you were never born . Yeah ? Like who ? GARY : I 'll- - I 'll do anything ! Take my lunch money ! Ah ! Don 't hit me ! Just don 't hit me , man ! Oh no . Poor Gary ! So the bully says to Screech , what kind of name is " Screech " anyway , whodow ? [ LAUGHING ] Hysterical , Gary . I love that show . He 's looking right at me . I thought we were invisible . We are . Where you been , Pooh Bear ? WYATT : I can 't believe it . Gary 's locking lips with Marianne Martineau , the hottest girl at Farbner ! LISA : Wow . Without you , he 's incredibly popular and a babe magnet . Wyatt , watch this . See that pencil ? Watch it carefully . How about that ? I 'm haunting him . [ DOORBELL ] Come in . WYATT : Gary ? What 's Gary doing here ? Chett . Wallace , what are you doing here ? We had an appointment . I can 't tutor you today . I have 400 pages to read , and I have a speech to write for the Young Businessmen 's Association . I paid in advance . All right . I 'll give you five minutes . If I don 't floss , I think I 'll be OK . Let 's just go back to limbo . I 've seen enough . I 'm better off dead . Just a few more minutes . I 'm trying to dip your dad 's tie in the gravy . I 'd just like to say that I 'm proud to hold the future of this country in my- - and I 'd just like to say that I 'm proud- - Don 't forget , Chett , tomorrow is Meals on Wheels day . Right . And you have a three o 'clock with your admissions counselor . Got it . And while we 're all together , your father and I have a surprise for you . A surprise ? Your father has arranged for you to start an internship with his agency . Start tomorrow . Three afternoons a week and Saturdays . Three afternoons a week and Saturday ? Could I be excused , please ? [ KNOCKING ] Hey , Chett . Oh , I 'm glad I caught you . Listen , I don 't get number eight . Do you have a minute ? Do I have a minute ? You bet . Well , not quite a whole minute . Will you take 30 seconds ? Because there 's nothing I 'd rather do than help you , Wallace . I don 't have time to tinkle , but I want to make sure you 're OK ! Great , because I don 't pass this , I am screwed . " What is the underlying theme of Steinbeck 's ' Of Mice and Men ' ? " You know what the answer is ? Life sucks ! That 's the answer , OK ? You do your best , you try to keep up , but you just can 't . It 's all too much . You 're not smart enough , or talented enough , or good enough . You can 't cut it . You 're destined to be miserable . The end ! That 's only 48 words . I need a 50-word answer ! I can 't believe it . Chett had a total meltdown . What happened ? I guess the pressure 's too much . You 're not around , so your mom and dad are fixated on Chett . Maybe he 's not destined for greatness . So what 's gonna happen to Chett ? Looks like he 's about to lose it . And if he does , then he 'll probably spend the rest of his life a miserable burnout feeling like he let everybody down . That 's terrible . Try not to let it get to you . [ TEARING ] Lisa , You 're a genie , capable of turning men into mushrooms . Why are you so obsessed with unzipping people 's flies with your mind ? I 'm haunting them . I 'm getting pretty good at it , too . Watch . Is there something you want to tell me , Mr. Wallace ? It 's not what you think . PRINCIPAL SCAMPI : Oh , really ? So , if I check those serial numbers against the ones missing from the junior class treasury they wouldn 't be the same ? What 's going on , Gary ? Stand back , Ms. Martineau . We 've caught him red-handed with the stolen funds . Well , there must be some kind of mistake . Gary does need to steal money . His father is Mike Wallace of " 60 Minutes " fame . Go ahead , tell him Gary . Don 't bother . I 've done some checking . His father is Al Wallace , a tow truck driver . Ew ! PRINCIPAL SCAMPI : Missing toys from the Toys for Tots drive . Is there no limit to the depths of your treachery ? Come on you creep , let 's go . All right kids . Shows over . Return to your classes . But let this be a lesson to you . Corruption wins not more than honesty . Principal Scampi ? Your barn door 's open . I can 't believe it . He 's a criminal . He could go to jail ! Poor Gary . I guess he wanted to be popular so badly he 'd stoop to anything . You weren 't there to reign him in , Wyatt . Without you , he didn 't know when to quit . Nice to see you in a good mood . Hey , my brother 's a nut , and my best friend 's a felon . Who wouldn 't be happy ? They need me . All right then . Prepare for reentry . Here we go ! Uh , Lis ? Uh huh ? Nothing 's happening . I noticed that , too . I just had a terrible thought . Please share . If you never existed , then you weren 't around to help Gary create me . What are you saying ? Stupid ol ' me . I zapped the both of us right out of existence . Are you mad ? What have you done ? What have you done ? I can 't believe this ! We are trapped in limbo forever ! Are you through ? Because I 've got a plan . We 've gotta get a message to Gary . If we can convince Gary to recreate me on the computer , I can get out of here and zap you back into existence . Simple . OK . OK , uh , all right then . So we get Gary Wallace , computer illiterate D student and all around underachiever to create a magic genie on a computer . It 's a brilliant plan . You know , people who don 't exist ought to go easy on the sarcasm . Oh , well . Excuse me for not living ! Chett ! Chett , can you here me ? It 's Wyatt ! He doesn 't know who Wyatt is ! Uh , Chett , it 's , uh , God ! Oh , that 'll calm him right down . Uh , never mind who this is , Chett . If you can hear me , give me a sign ! I 'm not listening , because sane people don 't listen to the voices in their heads . He hears you ! Must be some kind of psychic link between brothers . Keep talking . Uh , Chett ! Uh , you have to listen . I 'm your unborn brother . I need you to create a magical woman on your computer to bring me back into existence ! Oh , this is encouraging . Even the voices in my head are insane . You 're not getting me , voice guy . I 'm not listening to you , because I have a secret hiding place . [ HUMMING ] He may have turned a corner . WYATT : So Chett was a bust . What 's the plan with Gary ? Maybe we can haunt him into doing what we want . Hey , Marianne . Look ! This Etch-a-Sketch is writing things all by itself . [ BELL RINGS ] You are such a big , fat liar . Shoot . Hello ? Talk to me . - Do something ! - I 'm trying ! TOY : The cow says , Gary , help me ! The duck says , listen to the cow . Just tell me what you want me to do . TOY : The piggy says , load the memory manager into upper RAM . All I see is a goat and a pig . There 's no ram on here . We 're never going to get anywhere at this rate . He can 't figure out the Squeak and Squawk . Let me try . TOY : The horsey says , get help from Chett . Chett . OK . I understand . So the cow told you to build a woman , huh ? No . The cow said , help me Gary . The mouse told me to build a woman . Build her on the computer , right ? You 've been talking to the pig , haven 't you ? No . I haven 't spoken to anyone . I haven 't heard any voices ever . Never . Here , you try . see if it talks to you . CHETT ( VOICEOVER ) : If this toy actually speaks to me , it means I truly am insane . Who said that ? The voices are back ! Oh , wait . That was just me . TOY : The chicken says , help Gary make a woman . I 'm not crazy . No , you 're not . I am . Oh , it 's all clear to me now . I 'm going to build a woman on my computer and release my unborn brother from limbo . OK . Now you 're starting to freak me out . It 's too late , Gary . I 've heard my calling , and you 're going to help . Now grab the talking cow , and let 's go build us a woman ! [ MUSIC PLAYING ] GARY : Well , that 's it . We just push this button and get our girl . Push button , make girl . Push button , make girl . Push . Push . Push ! Push ! Hang on to your crown , big guy . Ah ! [ LAUGHTER ] Show me the way , oh mighty moo cow ! So what do you little maniacs want to do first ? Just kidding . You 're real . I thought I was going insane . But you exist ! I 'm not crazy ! WYATT : What 's taking so long , huh ? Hey , you didn 't forget about me , did you ? I don 't hear you . [ HUMMING ] Hello , you stupid old staircase ! Hello wall ! Hello carpet ! He 's been doing this all day . Well , we had quite a scare . Huh . What do you know ? Zuzu 's number ! Hello room ! Hello light switch ! BOTH : Wyatt , no ! Gotcha . Hello , Chett . [ LAUGHING ] [ MUSIC - OINGO BOINGO , " WEIRD SCIENCE " ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Fantasy and microchips , shooting from the hip , something different , we 're making weird science . Ooo ! Pictures from a magazine , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation , I do not know . It 's my creation ! From my heart and from my hand , who don 't people understand my intentions ?

 Well , if you ask me , it was that Simon fella . Do what you want , just get off ! I ain 't talking . Do what you want , I ain 't talking ! Loose tongues get cut out , get cut out at the root ! The Lord is my shepherd , I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures . Green pastures ! Have mercy on my soul ! Oh , Lord , have mercy upon my soul . Oh , Jesus . Since the beginning oh time mankind has existed between the world oh light and the world oh darkness . Our secret society has been here horever protecting others hrom the creatures who inhabit the shadows and the night . Known only to the initiated by our true name The Legacy . " And so , as the executor of your Aunt Rebecca 's estate it is my duty to inform you that as the only daughter of Rebecca 's sister Ruth you have been named as her sole beneficiary . The funeral will be held here in Kingston at 4 : 00 on the afternoon of the 23rd . Please contact me at your earliest convenience if you expect to attend . Sincerely , Harold Taggart , attorney at law . " So I called him and said I 'd be there . Sole beneficiary ? Believe me , I was shocked to learn I was inheriting anything . My mother and Aunt Rebecca had this big falling-out over something when I was a little kid . I barely remember meeting my eccentric southern aunt . Was Rebecca older or younger than your mother ? Wow , it 's been so long . Well , she was ... She was younger by three years . So you 'll be meeting a lot of family you haven 't seen in a while . There won 't be any others . Taggart says that I 'm the only surviving member of the family . But I 'm taking Kat . Kat ? Do you really think that 's wise ? She is Rebecca 's family , her only family after me , and ... I don 't know . When I picked up this letter I felt something so disturbing . I 'll be on guard , I promise . I 'll keep in touch every day . Cloistered as she was within the walls of that decaying house for decades we all believed that Rebecca Cantwell 's life was marked by torture , loneliness and despair . And that belief was unfortunately confirmed by the circumstances surrounding the discovery of these her bodily remains . May she now finally rest in peace . As it is said in Ecclesiastes : " Thus shall the dust return to the earth from whence it came and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it . " Come on , honey . Mrs. Corrigan ? Rachel ? I 'm Harold Taggart , Miss Cantwell 's attorney . We spoke on the phone . Yes , of course . Pleased to meet you . This is my daughter , Katherine . Sheriff Hank Parker , ma 'am . Sorry about your aunt . Rachel , I know you just got in and drove straight over so I took the liberty of reserving you one of the finest rooms at the Savannah Hotel . Actually , I 'd like to stay at my aunt 's house take inventory , close the place up . Maybe help Katherine learn a little bit about family history . What 's wrong ? Begging your pardon , ma 'am but could I have a word with you over there for a second ? Of course . Excuse us . It 's about the way in which your aunt died , ma 'am . I don 't know what you 've been told ... You 've got your aunt 's eyes , Katherine . Exactly . You know , I don 't think ... Mr. Taggart . Kat and I will stay in that house regardless . I 'd like to learn as much as I can about my aunt in the short time we 're gonna be here . Well , that house is yours . At least it 's gonna be , according to the will . And , sheriff I want to speak to the man that worked with my aunt . Simon ? Well , we 're still holding him for questioning but I 'm sure he 'd just as soon stay locked up safe in his cell forever . He 's not ... Well , he 's not quite right . Nevertheless , I 'd like to speak to him . And I 'd like to think about that . You have a nice stay in Kingston . Ma 'am . Look , Rachel , I 've got appointments all day so how about if I swing by tomorrow around 10 ? We can discuss the details of the will . It should be pretty cut and dried . I 'll have my secretary leave the keys in the mailbox . Thank you . Come on . Well , I hope they actually left us the keys or else we 're gonna be camping on the lawn tonight . - That would be fun . - I 'm not so sure . I remember they get mosquitoes as big as buzzards down here . Rachel . Rachel . What is it , Mom ? Nothing . Come on . - Mom ! - Kat , what is it ? - Mom , help me ! - What ? What 's the matter ? Keys . Gotcha . Katherine Corrigan , give me those . This is gonna take forever . Lucky guess . Rachel . Mom , something feels weird . Oh , it 's probably just big , old , empty-house weird , that 's all . It 's okay . - She 's pretty . - Oh , yeah . What 's this ? Open it . Oh , it 's a music box . Mom ? Mom . Sorry , honey . You know what ? I think I remember this tune from somewhere . Hey , take a look at this . Rachel called it in . It 's about her aunt 's death . Something 's not right . Derek had a hunch something was wrong there . He talked to Rachel and told her you 're going down . I know she 's gotta be a little concerned at this point . - My bag 's already packed . - Good . Now , come on , Simon , nobody 's accusing you of murder or anything . Talk . Tell me what happened . Who was that man Rebecca was with ? Fee , fi , fo , fum I smell the blood of a gentleman . Look , I don 't wanna hold you here any longer than I have to . Simon likes it here . Simon sure doesn 't wanna go back to Miss Rebecca 's house . And I 'm sure Miss Rebecca 's niece wouldn 't want you there . What ? Someone 's at the house ? Miss Rebecca 's niece , Rachel . She 's staying there with her daughter . This is bad . I 've gotta talk to her . Don 't do it . Don 't do it ! Cut your tongue out ! Simon says : Rachel . - Derek , it scared the hell out of me . - Think it through , Rachel . - What 's the common link ? - Obviously this house and all the stuff that 's happened in it . - You read the article , didn 't you ? - Yes , I did . Rachel , after all that 's happened there are you sure you still want to stay ? Yes . Yes , I am . It 's just gonna be for a few more days , and ... Yeah . Hey , it was just a nightmare , right ? - Nothing to get that upset about . - Yes . All right . Nick is flying out there . He 'll be there tonight . Thanks . Bye . Goodbye . Well , I 'm ready to ship out . Is there anything else ? Rachel 's worried , but not worried enough in my opinion . She 's too close to it . She can 't be objective . You have to be careful with her , Nick . This could really be a very uncomfortable situation . Rachel . - Mom , where are you ? - Yeah , I 'm in here , honey . Have a look at this . See ? Look . There 's a picture of my mom , your grandma . She 's with her sister , Rebecca . I thought you said they didn 't get along . They look happy together . Yeah , they do , don 't they ? I think they were just teenagers there . Who 's that ? That 's your great-grandfather Joshua . There he is with my mom and with Rebecca . He looks really serious . Yeah , he does , doesn 't he ? Mom , look at this doll . Who 's that ? I think that 's Rebecca when she got all grown up . She 's pretty . She is , isn 't she ? Thank you . So everything lays out pretty simple here . The house , your aunt 's single investment account totaling roughly $ 97,000 , goes directly to you . Ninety-seven thousand dollars ? How did she ever manage to save so much ? My aunt didn 't work , did she ? Rebecca taught piano lessons way back when . That 's about it . But for the past few decades she had uncanny luck with her investments good times and bad . Unfortunately , estate taxes will take most of it . There 's so much I don 't know about my aunt . So much I 'd ... I 'd like to know . You know , maybe after you 're gone the best thing would be to tear this whole place down . Sell it for lot value . I could agent it for you if you 'd like . I 've got somebody interested already . Oh , Mr. Taggart ... Oh , I am so sorry , Mr. Taggart . - Can I help you mop that up ? - Oh , man ! I 'm so sorry , I ... Well , I 'm just a little bit upset here . It 's a good thing I 've got copies of that . What do you say I come back later today ? I think tomorrow would be better . Great . Tomorrow , then . Mitch , you stay out there with Kat . We won 't be but a couple of minutes . Hey , Simon , you got a visitor . - Miss Rebecca 's niece . - Hello , Simon . Hey , now , don 't be getting rude on us , Simon . You wanna talk to her or not ? She and her little girl are going back home in a couple of days . - It 's your call . - Alone . - I don 't believe I can do that . - It 's all right , sheriff . Simon what if I moved back here , would that be okay ? Okay . How about that ? Is that better ? Okay . Sheriff , you can leave now . I 've dealt with men like Simon before in my profession . We 're gonna be just fine , aren 't we , Simon ? Well , I 'll be right outside if you need me . See ? If you had been where you were at first when Simon started being not Simon then you would 've got hurt . What do you mean by " being not Simon " ? The spider 's got the fly and the spider toys with the fly . Even now . Simon says : Simon ? Simon ! Did Miss Rebecca tell you anything about the man that she was with ? The one that they found her lying next to ? Get the hell out of there now ! A-tisket , a-tasket , nobody leaves that house except in a casket ! Simon . Simon . Now , calm down . Sit down , now . Pretty good , Mom , picking that tune up by ear . Mom ? Mom , are you okay ? - Nick ! - Hey , hey . How are you , sweetness ? I 've been standing outside knocking for about five minutes . She won 't stop playing . Yeah ? Rachel ? Rebecca . Rebecca , it 's me . Rachel , it 's Nick . Come in . - Feeling better ? - Much . I 'm sorry . I don 't know what happened to me down there . - That makes two of us . - Oh , God . Three , including Kat . I finally got her to bed . She 's ... She 's pretty worried about her mom . I just ... This is so hard on her and I 'm not being much help . I 'm not coping with this very well . I 'm just kind of making matters worse . Sometimes I think she knows me better than I know myself . Why don 't I pack up your gear and we 'll go to a hotel ? No . There 's no point in trying to run away from grief . I 've counseled enough people who 've tried to do that . What I need to do is just stay here and cope with it . Sure , she 's acting a little bit odd , but then , who wouldn 't be ? You should see this place . Nick , she 's faced death before . In the past year , Rachel has experienced more trauma than most people ever do . Maybe she 's just a little bit burned out . I mean , after all , it is her aunt who died . Did you suggest having them leave the house ? I brought it up first thing , but she pulled back on me . Besides , she 's got a point about hacing her hears . Okay . Let me know immediately if there are any more developments . - Day or night . - All right . Goodbye . Rachel . Rachel . A confession is good . It cleans the spirit , saves the soul . Unless you 're too late . Miss Rebecca wouldn 't let me be free . Said she 'd kill me first . Time to get it out . I was made to do damnable deeds for which I 'm going to hell . But that woman and her child too many flies . Sheriff Parker I 've gotta tell everything I know so that you can save them . Who 's there ? Who 's there ? Rebecca . I wasn 't gonna tell them . I was just fooling them . I wasn 't . I wasn 't gonna tell them . I swear . They ... They ... I wasn 't gonna tell them . I was fooling them . I wasn 't gonna tell them , I swear . I swear , Rebecca ! I wasn 't gonna tell them ! I wasn 't gonna tell them ! A - tisket , a-tasket A green-and-yellow basket I wrote a letter to my love Mom . Kat , you scared me . I 'm sorry , but I knocked , but you wouldn 't answer . What do you want ? Nick sent me up . He wants to talk to you . I 'll be there in a minute . - Are you sure you 're okay , Mom ? - I said , I 'll be down in a second ! Okay . What 's going on ? Took a walk into town . Simon Walters is dead . Oh , God . How ? He died of a heart attack last night in his cell . And when I got back , I found this on the porch . Looks like a forensics report . It 's on your Aunt Rebecca and the body they found with her . Who left it there ? Well , I would think somebody who wanted some help but was too proud to ask . - Like Sheriff Parker . - Yeah , that would be my guess . " Autopsy . Sex , male , 30 to 40 years . Height , 6 foot . Estimated time of death 40 years ago . Cause of death ... " Let me guess . " Unknown . " - " Unknown . " - Well what would you expect after 40 years ? Well , I wouldn 't expect this . What happened to the body after he died . " The body , embalmed for decades in herbal resins had pieces of flesh , organs and bone carved away in a precise pattern suggesting postmortem surgical mutilation as opposed to a regular pattern of decay . " There 's a circular pattern carved into the bone . I 'm gonna fax this to Derek . What time did you say that lawyer was coming by ? Taggart ? A few minutes , 6 : 00 . I can handle him by myself . - Okay , I 'll be right back . - Bye . Katherine . What 's that , dolly ? Should we go see ? Okay . Katherine . Come here , child . - Who are you ? - Your Aunt Rebecca . I 'm so pleased to meet you , Katherine . Oh , we are gonna be such good friends . Good afternoon , Mrs. Corrigan . On time , as promised . I brought by the papers for you to sign for the sale of the house . I don 't think I 'll be signing any papers right now , Mr. Taggart . What ? Not sure I wanna sell this house . Well , you can 't do that , Mrs. Corrigan . Rachel , I ... I mean , I 've made arrangements for the sale . I made plans . There 's people waiting on me . Well , there 's a fly in the ointment , Matt . A big , fat , juicy fly . I don 't understand . You gotta sell eventually . - Not if I decide to stay here . - What are you talking about ? How long do you think you 're going to stay here ? I might just stay here forever . Mrs. Corrigan . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? There 's a fly in the ointment here , Matt . A big , fat , juicy fly . Oval , sawtooth patterns in the bone . Clean-cut and purposefully made . Let 's see the next one . Occult markings carved into the seam of the skull cap . So , what are we talking about here ? Necromancy , blackest of the black arts . Defiling corpses to control the future . Pendants cut from bone . Only , this kind of desecration over decades is highly unusual . Matthew Courtland must have meant very much to Rebecca in life for her to use him so extensively in death . What 's this ? It 's a photograph Nick faxed along with the rest . It 's Rachel 's mom and her sister , Rebecca , 60 years ago . Rachel is in terrible danger . Nick should be back in the house by now . Call him . Everything we planned for so carefully together , Matthew . A child , a family all destroyed in one instant . Why ? The seeding ritual was going perfectly . Our child ... Our child was ... Was to be created by ritual in an ultimate moment of dark power . Matthew ? No ! Now , Matthew we have the chance to live again . - Hello ? - Nick . - Derek . What did you find out ? - More than I would wish on anyone . - Necromancy . - Necromancy ? How ? I 'm not sure , but it involves some sort of pendant . - What would it look like ? - Oval in shape , 2 to 3 inches . Carved from one of Matthew Courtland 's bones . It gives Rebecca 's spirit its power . I want you to hind and destroy it . - Where 's Rachel ? - I don 't know . I just got in the house . Nick , hrom this and everything you 've said it 's clear that Rebecca 's trying to possess Rachel in some way . I want you to take Rachel and get her and Kat out of there now . Understood ? Nick ? Are you there ? Nick ? This is a very special book to me , very powerful . Now , this , this is for making somebody love you . Of course , you don 't need that right now , but someday ... Hello , Nick . Rachel . I know you know what 's happening here . And you can be part of it if you like . You can take Matthew 's place , we can be a family . So , what now Rebecca ? Now ? Oh , now Kat and Rachel get to stay here and become the family I never had the family I was cheated out of by the death of the man I loved . - Death or murder ? - No . No , not murder . Matthew wasn 't supposed to die . It wasn 't his time . He was the only man I ever loved . That 's why I kept him with me all these years . Matthew and I were gonna have a child a special child , one born of ritual . Blood is very important . It breeds talent . Kat 's not born of your blood . She 's Ruth 's . Ruth ? I hated my sister to the day she died . - No , Mommy . - Oh , yeah , Ruth . Ruth had everything that Matthew and I wanted . - A job , a family , a grandchild . - Stop ! No , Mommy ! Rachel , look at Kat . Look at her ! Mommy ! Mommy ! She 's your daughter . Look at what you 're doing to her . Rebecca won 't rest until she destroys you both . Mommy ! Mommy ! I got you , kiddo . Mom , stop . You 're killing him ! Rachel ! The brooch , take it off ! - Tear it off ! - Mom , get it off ! It contains Rebecca 's soul . Tear it off ! Mom , throw it ! Mom , fight her ! No ! - Yes ? Nick ? - Derek ? - Tell me . - It 's over . Rebecca 's spell 's broken ... - ... and Rachel and Kat are both okay . - Excellent , Nick . Good work . Bring them home .

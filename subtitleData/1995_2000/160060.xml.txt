AND WHO DO YOU TRUST ? AND WHO DO YOU TRUST ? Newswoman : WITH OVER 240 DESTROYERS LOST IN THE BATTLE , LISTS OF CASUALTIES ARE STILL BEING DRAWN UP , BUT CURRENT ESTIMATES PLACE THE DEATH TOLL AT BETWEEN 6 AND 7,000 KILLED IN ACTION . PRESIDENT SUSANA LUCHENKO HAS CALLED FOR A WEEK OF PLANETARY MOURNING FOR THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES IN THE BATTLE AGAINST THE DRAKH . Newsman : WHILE THERE ARE COUNTLESS HEROES WORTHY OF DISTINCTION ... [ DOOR SIGNAL ] YES . [ DOOR SIGNAL ] YES . ANYTHING NEW ? NOT MUCH . IT 'S A MESS DOWN THERE . EVERYBODY 'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO NEXT . WHAT ABOUT THE ALIENS THAT ATTACKED ? ANYTHING MORE ON THEM ? NO . JUST A NAME--THE DRAKH . BUT APPARENTLY SOME OF OUR SHIPS ARE STILL IN PURSUIT . THEY 'RE HOPING TO CAPTURE A COUPLE OF THEM . DAMN IT ! DO YOU KNOW WHAT ? THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES I WISH I WAS STILL ON A DESTROYER . THIS SHIP WAS DESIGNED FOR EXPLORATION , NOT COMBAT . WE GOT HERE AS FAST AS WE COULD . IT WAS OVER BEFORE WE EVEN JUMPED . THERE WAS NOTHING YOU COULD 'VE DONE . YEAH ? WELL , THAT 'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH . YEAH ? WELL , THAT 'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH . HOW 'S ENSIGN JAMES ? THE DOC CHECKED HIM OUT , SAID HE 'LL BE FINE . HE THINKS YOU SHOULD PUT THIS ATTEMPTED MUTINY ON THE RECORD . NEGATIVE . HE WAS SCARED . WHO COULD BLAME HIM ? WE WERE ALL SCARED . I PUT HIM DOWN BECAUSE I HAD TO . THAT 'S ENOUGH . YOU 'RE BEING A LOT MORE MERCIFUL THAN HE WILL . YOU KNOW , HIS FATHER 'S A HIGH-RANKING OFFICIAL ON MARS . HE PROBABLY GOT ON THE LINE TO HIS DAD AS SOON AS HE WOKE UP . AND THE POLITICAL SITUATION BETWEEN EARTH AND MARS COLONY HAS ALWAYS BEEN SENSITIVE . STRIKING A CREW MEMBER LIKE THAT , THEY COULD TURN AROUND AND BRING YOU UP ON CHARGES . COME ON , WE 'RE IN A STATE OF PLANETARY ALERT . WHO 'S GONNA CARE ABOUT- - [ BEEP BEEP ] YEAH . Crewman : CAPTAIN , WE 'VE JUST RECEIVED NEW ORDERS . WELL , IT 'S ABOUT TIME . WHAT ARE THEY ? WE 'RE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO MARS . WE 'RE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO MARS . MARS ? DID THEY SAY WHAT THEY WANT WITH US ? Crewman : NOT US , SIR . YOU . YOU . AND SO IT BEGINS . AND SO IT BEGINS . DRAKH SHIP IS ACCELERATING , MAKING A RUN FOR IT . COMM SYSTEM 'S OUT . WE 'RE VENTING AIR ON ALL DECKS . WE CAN 'T TAKE MUCH MORE OF THIS . STAY WITH HER . PREPARE TO LAUNCH THE DISTRESS BEACON . TELL THEM WE 'VE LOCATED ONE OF THE SHIPS THAT ATTACKED EARTH AND PURSUED IT TO THIS SECTOR . WE INTEND TO FORCE HER DOWN ON THE NEAREST PLANET . WE INTEND TO FORCE HER DOWN ON THE NEAREST PLANET . SYSTEMS ON OVERLOAD , SIR . MASSIVE DAMAGE TO REACTORS . LAUNCH BEACON . AYE , SIR . BEACON AWAY . LET 'S JUST HOPE SOMEONE ELSE CAN FINISH WHAT WE 'VE STARTED . CAN FINISH WHAT WE 'VE STARTED . [ HAMMER TAPPING ] [ HAMMER TAPPING ] [ BEEP BEEP ] Woman : MR. EILERSON , YOU SEE THAT ? I SEE IT . MIGHT BE A METEOR , PIECE OF SPACE JUNK . SEND JENSON UP TO DO A FLY-OVER , CHECK IT OUT . WE HAVE TO GO THAT WAY ANYWAY IN A FEW DAYS . LET 'S SEE IF WE CAN 'T FIND THAT DAMNED UNDERGROUND CITY . NO REASON WE CAN 'T SWING BY , SEE IF THERE 'S SOMETHING OF VALUE . YES , SIR . YES , SIR . THAT 'S THE FUN PART ABOUT BEING AN ARCHEOLOGIST , SAM . THE PRESENT CONSTANTLY GETTING IN THE WAY OF EXPLORING THE PAST . BUT WHO KNOWS . MAYBE WE 'LL FIND SOMETHING OF VALUE WE CAN SEND BACK TO THE CORPORATION . NOTHING LIKE THE OCCASIONAL SURPRISE TO KEEP THINGS INTERESTING , EH , SAM ? TO KEEP THINGS INTERESTING , EH , SAM ? GIDEON IS THE WRONG CHOICE FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT . DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME , SEN- - SENATOR McQUATE . AH . CAPTAIN GIDEON . THANKS FOR COMING . MR. AMES--MILITARY LIAISON , PLANETARY SECURITY . CAPTAIN . SIR , I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN- - IN A MOMENT . I ASSUME YOU 'VE BEEN BRIEFED ON THE SITUATION BACK HOME . WELL , YOU 'VE ONLY HEARD PART OF THE STORY . WELL , YOU 'VE ONLY HEARD PART OF THE STORY . THE PLANET IS IN A BLIND PANIC . MASSIVE RIOTING ACROSS WHOLE CONTINENTS . MASSIVE RIOTING ACROSS WHOLE CONTINENTS . DOOMSDAY CULTS SPRINGING UP ALL OVER THE PLACE . DOOMSDAY CULTS SPRINGING UP ALL OVER THE PLACE . EARTH GOV 'S IN CHAOS . NOBODY 'S EVEN COMING IN TO WORK . HELL , WHY SHOULD THEY ? THEY 'LL ALL BE DEAD IN 5 YEARS ANYWAY . 5 YEARS ? THAT 'S JUST A GUESS , SENATOR . THE HIGH-I.Q. BOYS BACK HOME FIGURED IT WOULD TAKE THAT LONG FOR THE PLAGUE TO ADJUST TO OUR BIOLOGY . ONCE THAT HAPPENS , EVERY MAN , WOMAN , AND CHILD ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH WILL DIE . YOU KNOW , CAPTAIN , SOME FOLKS THINK THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIFE ON MARS ONCE UPON A TIME . IF THEY DID EXIST , THEY LEFT NO SIGN . THEY LEFT NO SIGN . WE 'LL NEVER KNOW WHO THEY WERE OR WHAT THEY DID , WHAT SONGS THEY SANG , WHAT STORIES THEY TOLD . MARS IS A DEAD WORLD . CAN 'T IMAGINE THAT HAPPENING TO THE EARTH IN A FEW YEARS . CAN 'T IMAGINE THAT HAPPENING AT ALL . FOLKS BACK HOME ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN , BUT THE ODDS OF US FINDING A CURE IN THE TIME THAT 'S LEFT ARE JUST ABOUT ZIP . WE MUST LOOK OUTSIDE . THIS PLAGUE DIDN 'T COME OUT OF NOWHERE . SOMEBODY OUT THERE SOMEWHERE HAS COME ACROSS IT BEFORE NOW . MAYBE SOME ALIEN RACE WE 'VE NEVER EVEN MET BEFORE CAN HELP US . MAYBE THE CURE IS BURIED BENEATH SOME ANCIENT ALIEN CITY , FORGOTTEN UNDER CENTURIES OF SAND . WE NEED THE RIGHT SHIP AND THE RIGHT PERSON TO FIND THAT CURE . THE RIGHT SHIP IS THEEXCALIBUR- - PROTOTYPE DESTROYER , TOP OF THE LINE . THAT PERSON ... IS YOU , CAPTAIN . WELL , I 'M HONORED , BUT ... WHY ME ? THERE ARE OTHERS JUST AS QUALIFIED . DURING YOUR TIME CAPTAINING AN EXPLORER CLASS VESSEL , YOU 'VE COME ACROSS MORE NEW ALIEN LIFE FORMS THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE FLEET . THERE ARE HALF A DOZEN CAPTAINS RIDING EXPLORER SHIPS . THE REST ARE EITHER TOO OLD , TOO CAUTIOUS . YOU 'RE A DANGEROUS MAN WHEN YOU WANT TO BE , CAPTAIN , AND RIGHT NOW , WE NEED A DANGEROUS MAN . SO , ARE YOU UP TO THE JOB ? YES , SIR . WILL I BE ABLE TO PICK MY OWN TEAM ? SOME , YES . SOME , NO . THIS IS A HIGHLY POLITICAL SITUATION BACK HOME . WE 'VE HAD TO MAKE CERTAIN COMPROMISES TO GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD . THERE 'S GONNA BE A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER ON THIS ONE , CAPTAIN . I UNDERSTAND , BUT JUST SO WE 'RE CLEAR , ONCE WE GO , THIS IS MY COMMAND . I 'LL DO WHATEVER 'S NECESSARY . IF THAT MEANS TURNING THE ENTIRE GALAXY UPSIDE-DOWN AND SHAKING ITS POCKETS TO SEE WHAT FALLS OUT , THAT 'S WHAT I 'LL DO . I 'M NOT SUBTLE , I 'M NOT PRETTY , AND I 'LL PISS OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY ... BUT I 'LL GET THE JOB DONE . DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO , CAPTAIN . MAKE SURE EARTH DOESN 'T TURN INTO THIS . MAKE SURE EARTH DOESN 'T TURN INTO THIS . [ BEEP ] BASE , THIS IS SHUTTLE 2 . STILL NO SIGN OF THAT CRASH . COMING AROUND FOR AN- - JUST A SEC . JUST A SEC . CONFIRM , BASE . I HAVE VISUAL LOCK . IT 'S DEFINITELY A SHIP . ORIGIN UNKNOWN . RELAYING POSITION . RELAYING POSITION . AH , HELL . AH , HELL . I 'M BEING FIRED UPON . I REPEAT , I 'M TAKING FIRE . EVASIVE MANEUVERS . EVASIVE MANEUVERS . Jenson : I 'M BEING FIRED UPON . I REPEAT , I 'M TAKING FIRE . EVASIVE MANEUVERS . THAT 'S WHEN WE LOST CONTACT . IS THERE ANY WAY TO GET WORD BACK TO THE COMPANY TO TELL THEM THAT WE 'VE GOT TROUBLE ? NEGATIVE . THE ATMOSPHERE IS TOO HEAVILY IONIZED TO GET A SIGNAL OUT VERY FAR , AND THE TRANSPORT ISN 'T SCHEDULED TO COME BACK AND PICK US UP FOR ANOTHER 2 WEEKS . WE 'VE BEEN OUT OF CONTACT EVER SINCE WE GOT HERE . UNTIL NOW , IT WASN 'T A PROBLEM . ALL RIGHT . WHAT OPTIONS DO WE HAVE ? JUST ONE . MOVE OUT BEFORE THEY COME AFTER US . WE DON 'T KNOW THEY 'RE HOSTILE . THEY COULD HAVE THOUGHT OUR SHIP WAS GOING TO ATTACK . THEY DIDN 'T TRY TO ESTABLISH CONTACT . THEY DIDN 'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HE WAS GONNA DO . THEY AMBUSHED HIM AND BLEW HIM OUT OF THE SKY . NOW , I DON 'T KNOW ABOUT WHERE YOU COME FROM , BUT WHERE I GREW UP , THAT 'S DEFINITELY CONSIDERED HOSTILE BEHAVIOR . TRACE , GIVE IT A REST . LOOK ... THEY DIDN 'T SEND OUT A GENERAL DISTRESS SIGNAL . THAT MEANS THEY DON 'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW THEY 'RE HERE . NOW THAT THEY KNOW THEY 'VE GOT COMPANY , GUESS WHAT- - THEY 'LL COME AFTER US . WE CAN 'T JUST PACK UP AN ENTIRE EXPEDITION . THE HASSLE- - IS A HELL OF A LOT LESS HASSLE THAN BEING DEAD . I GOT PLANS FOR THE WEEKEND , AND BEING DEAD AIN 'T PART OF ' EM . I SAY WE MOVE EVERYBODY OUT , MAYBE INTO THOSE CAVES WE SAW DOWN BY THE CLIFFS . ON FOOT ? WHAT ABOUT THE SHUTTLE ? WELL , WE 'VE ONLY GOT ONE LEFT , AND IT ONLY CARRIES 4 PEOPLE AT A TIME . IT 'LL TAKE LONGER , AND WE MIGHT BE SEEN . BESIDES , I NEED IT . I 'M GONNA TAKE HER UP OUTSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE AND , UH , SEND OUT A DISTRESS SIGNAL WHERE SOMEBODY MIGHT PICK IT UP . IT 'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE WRONG PEOPLE COULD HEAR YOU . WHOEVER THOSE ALIENS ARE , THEY PROBABLY SENT FOR HELP BEFORE THEY CRASHED , AND WHEN THAT HELP GETS HERE , YOU 'LL BE THE FIRST TARGET ON THEIR LIST . I KNOW . BUT LIKE I SAID , I DON 'T PLAN ON BEING DEAD ANYTIME SOON . YOU JUST TAKE CARE OF THESE PEOPLE AND LEAVE THE REST TO ME . AND LEAVE THE REST TO ME . McQuate : AND THIS IS CAPTAIN MATTHEW GIDEON .

THE EARTH IS UNDER QUARANTINE . IT 'S TOO DANGEROUS . FINE . I CAN LIVE WITH THAT . I CAN DO A HELL OF A LOT MORE GOOD THERE THAN SITTING AROUND HERE ON MARS . NO ONE 'S JUST GOING TO BE SITTING AROUND HERE , DOCTOR . WE HAVE A JOB FOR YOU , VERY IMPORTANT JOB . FOR ALL OF YOU .

HE 'S THE BEST FIRST OFFICER I 'VE EVER HAD . HE 'S ON THE CREW . PERIOD . HE 'S ON THE CREW . PERIOD . LET 'S MOVE IT OUT , PEOPLE . JUST GET YOUR GEAR . JUST GET YOUR GEAR . THE DRAKH KILLED MY PEOPLE , MY ENTIRE WORLD . I CAME HERE DURING THE WAR TO STOP THEM . I KNOW MORE ABOUT THEM THAN ANYBODY ELSE YOU 'RE GONNA FIND . I CAN HELP . I AGREE , SO WHAT 'S THE PROBLEM ? OUR GUEST IS A MEMBER OF THE THIEVES GUILD . SHE HAS A RECORD AS LONG AS YOUR ARM . WE 'VE KEPT HER IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE SHE MIGHT HAVE SOME INFORMATION WHICH MAY BE OF USE . BESIDES , THE PRESENCE OF A THIEF WOULD DIMINISH THE PRESTIGE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE MISSION . CAPTAIN , LET ME DO THIS . YES , I 'M A THIEF , AND A DAMN GOOD ONE . YOU NEED TO GET INSIDE SOMETHING , YOU NEED TO GET OUT , TUNNEL UNDER , GO AROUND , GO THROUGH , I 'M IT . YOU 'RE GONNA HIT SOME PRETTY STRANGE PLACES . YOU 'RE GONNA NEED A LOCKPICK .

ANY OTHER SURPRISES I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ? NOT NOW . UH , WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? WELL , THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAME WITH ME . I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA BE ON THE MISSION . WHERE IS HE ? I DON 'T KNOW . HE DISAPPEARED SHORTLY AFTER WE ARRIVED . I TRIED TELLING THE OTHERS ABOUT HIM , BUT THEY WOULDN 'T BELIEVE ME . NO , IF HE WANTS TO SHOW UP , HE WILL , IN HIS OWN WAY AND HIS OWN TIME . IN HIS OWN WAY AND HIS OWN TIME . SIR , ENGINES ARE ON-LINE . WE CAN JUMP AT ANY TIME . EXCELLENT , LIEUTENANT . ANYTHING ELSE ? ACTUALLY , YES . I KNOW YOU SAID IT WASN 'T A PROBLEM GETTING ME HERE , AND I HATE TO CONTRADICT A SUPERIOR OFFICER , BUT I SUSPECT MY STATUS AS A TELEPATH DID ... COME UP . COME UP .

YOU ARE TO PROCEED AT TOP SPEED TO SECTOR 85 BY 4 BY 20 . WHAT 'S HAPPENED ? WE HAD A DESTROYER PURSUING ONE OF THE DRAKH WARSHIPS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR RELEASING THE PLAGUE INTO THE EARTH 'S ATMOSPHERE . WE LOST CONTACT WITH THEM 2 DAYS AGO . APPARENTLY THEY LAUNCHED A DISTRESS BEACON BEFORE BEING DESTROYED . ACCORDING TO THE MODIFIED BEACON , THE DRAKH WARSHIP WENT DOWN ON CETI 4 . YOUR SHIP IS THE CLOSEST ONE WE HAVE TO THAT SECTOR . WE NEED YOU TO GET THERE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO RETRIEVE THE SHIP AND ANY SURVIVORS . YOU SAID A MODIFIED BEACON ? APPARENTLY THERE WAS AN ARCHEOLOGICAL DIG WHICH WAS SPONSORED BY INTERPLANETARY EXPEDITIONS , WHICH WAS IN PROGRESS AT THE TIME OF THE CRASH . ONE OF THEM HOT-WIRED THE BEACON TO PIGGYBACK ADDITIONAL INFORMATION . SO THERE MAY BE CIVILIANS AT RISK ? CAPTAIN , RIGHT NOW WE 'REALLAT RISK . CAPTAIN , RIGHT NOW WE 'REALLAT RISK .

YOU ALWAYS JUMP TO THE END OF THE STORY LIKE THAT ? WHY NOT ? STORY OF MY LIFE . I FINALLY FIND A CITY LIKE THIS , INTACT , DESERTED FOR 10,000 YEARS , PROBABLY CONTAINS HUNDREDS OF PATENTS THAT I CAN EXPLOIT , AND I 'M GONNA DIE . I CAN APPRECIATE DRAMATIC IRONY AS MUCH AS THE NEXT PERSON , BUT THIS IS PUSHING IT A BIT . BUT THIS IS PUSHING IT A BIT . [ BEEP BEEP ] [ BEEP BEEP ] REPEAT . THIS IS THEEXCALIBUR .

HE SAYS THAT HE WILL NOT COOPERATE , AND HE WILL NOT BETRAY HIS PEOPLE , AND HE WILL NOT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS . WELL , THAT 'S FINE . FOR STARTERS , WE HAVE HIS SHIP , AND ONCE WE 'VE ANALYZED THE DELIVERY SYSTEM USED TO DROP THE PLAGUE WITHOUT INFECTING HER CREW , WE 'LL KNOW HOW TO CONTAIN THIS THING .

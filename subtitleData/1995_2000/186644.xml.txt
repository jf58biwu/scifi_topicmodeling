 [ Whooshing ] Whoa ! [ Screams ] [ Groans ] That water 's freezing . You always said you wanted to land near a beach . You got to be careful what you wish for . I never said near , I said on . On a beach , okay ? [ Laughs ] ( Maggie ) I hate wearing wet clothes . What am I gonna wear while these dry ? I don 't know what to tell you , except ... I know . Improvise . ( Quinn ) I have learned the hard way . If you wanna slide , it is the only way to survive . How 's the timer , Q-Ball ? Ah , nothing a little sun won 't cure . 26 hours and change . What 's that ? ( Quinn ) Looks like the Channel Islands . Too many . Maybe it was the big one . People on our world are always saying that California would break off into islands if a big earthquake ever hit . Well , it 's fine by me . An island makes it a lot easier to find Rickman . [ Growling ] What the hell was that ? ( Wade ) Whatever it is , it sounds hungry . And it has an advantage . It knows the terrain , and we have no weapons . Okay . If it comes after us , we just head straight into the trees . [ Growling continues ] It 's coming , go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! ( Quinn ) What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year , and you 're the same person but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? ( voice ) Sliders . ( Rembrandt ) Where is he ? I don 't see him . ( Maggie ) I guess we lost him . Strangest-looking animal I ever saw . ( Wade ) Or the ugliest man . Talk about unsightly body hair , huh ? I never heard a man snarl like that . ( Quinn ) You didn 't know the Professor that well . [ Rembrandt laughs ] [ Birds cawing ] Which way ? [ Growls ] ( Maggie ) Quinn ! I 'll bite . What is it ? Hard to say . Looks like something from a science-fiction movie . Sounds like there 's more of them . If the rest are as ferocious as this one , it 's possible Rickman 's dead already . Not with our luck . Let 's get out of here before he wakes up . His mood is not gonna improve . [ Growls ] [ Growls ] When do we attack ? We don 't . I told you that . Vargas has guns , I don 't . So , a few die . Considering what Vargas has done to them , they won 't care . But I do . They depend upon me to lead them . And I will not see them die just so you can suckle on some pure human . Is it really their lives you 're concerned about losing or your own ? [ Growls ] Do not challenge me , Rickman ! You live because I choose it . You feast on the weakest of the pride because I allow it ! Don 't forget that ! We both know why I live , Ceres . If you expect me to take you with me when I go to another world , you better curb your tongue . [ Growls ] What has happened ? A fight with humans . Humans ? You mean Vargas ? I thought he never left the compound . Not Vargas . Kolain said they , they fell from the sky . They 're strangers . Kolain said two male , two female . Sliders . Welcome to my nightmare . Forget Vargas . I want these strangers . [ Birds chirping ] Is it just me or does it feel like we 're being watched ? It 's not just you . Wait a minute . This looks very familiar . That 's because we passed this spot an hour ago . We 're walking in circles . Great . Just great . And I think something is circling us . Yeah . More than just one something , though . All right , come on . [ Growling ] [ Grunting ] Go ! Go ! Quinn , look out ! [ Hybrid squealing ] I won 't hurt you , but they will . This way , hurry . The compound where I live is just beyond the clearing . We 'll be safe once we 're inside the fence . What are those things ? I 've never seen anything like them , or you . We 're hybrids . We 're genetic mixtures of humans and animals . [ Growls ] What is in those guns ? Poison darts . If the hybrids lie down and remain passive , they 'll survive . The doctor would prefer not to kill them if he doesn 't have to . Come on , this way . [ Birds cawing ] Doctor ? Let 's just hope his last name isn 't Frankenstein . [ Growling ] [ Fires ] [ Squealing ] That was the last dart . You sprained it . Let me help you . No . I must walk . [ Grunts ] That 's it , I 'm carrying you . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . I don 't have the timer . We gotta keep moving . Let 's go . ( Rembrandt ) We 'll come back for it , Q-Ball . Open up ! We have somebody hurt ! ( Alisandra ) Daniel , hurry ! [ Growling ] Be careful of the gate , it 's electric . Open up ! We have an injured ... My name is Alisandra . Alisandra 's injured out here ! Come on , open up the gate ! [ Growls ] Daniel , hurry ! ( Maggie ) Go , Quinn ! Come on ! Quinn , hurry ! I 'm coming . [ Snarling ] What did you do to her ? It 's okay , Daniel . It 's not their fault . ( Dr. Vargas ) Oh , but it 's not okay . Go . Get out of here . [ Hybrids snarling ] Who wants to be the first to see what new things I have in my lab ? Who are you people ? What are you doing here ? Our boat capsized at sea and we swam ashore . So swim to the next island . I don 't want you here . Well , believe us , as nice as this place seems to be with your electric fences , warm hospitality and interesting array of wildlife , we don 't want to stay . We lost something of vital importance in the jungle . If we could borrow a couple of dart guns , we 'll leave right now . That 's all you want ? Some guns ? That 's right . And you 're not from the government ? Trust us . We 're not even registered to vote around here . We 'll talk about what I can provide you inside . You , get up . Here , let me help you . No , no . She must do it on her own . But she 's hurt . I gave you a command . Maybe you didn 't hear me . Daniel ! Stay . I heard you , but she must learn to do what I ask . Maybe she does , maybe she doesn 't . Look , I don 't know what the rules are here , but there 's one thing that I do know . I don 't have to obey your commands . And I 'm gonna help her . Your friend has a peculiar attitude for someone needing a favor . Sometimes he lets his emotions get the best of him . These hybrids , what created them ? Not what , who . Come , I 'll show you . So , when do we get the guns ? In the morning . It 's getting dark . It 's too dangerous to go out in the jungle at night . ( Rembrandt ) Is the couch okay ? ( Alisandra ) Yes , that 'll be fine . What do your friends call you ? Well , it depends on their mood , but mostly they call me Rembrandt . Well , thank you , Rembrandt . Yeah . We don 't need to look for the humans . They will find us now . How 's it feeling ? Oh , better , thank you . Here , let me warm that up . [ Sighs ] It 's not as bad as I thought . You 're gonna be up on that in no time . Can I get you something to drink ? Water , please . I 'll be right back . No , don 't go . This will be fine . Do you want some ? Oh , no . No , thanks . I 'm cutting back . [ Laughs ] I 've never seen anyone like you before . Yeah , yeah , I know the feeling . You have an interesting color . Do you live on the land that sits under the horizon ? No , my home 's a little further away than that . And this place where you live , do you have a mate ? Mate ? No , no mate . That pleases me . Here , let me hold that for you . ( Dr. Vargas ) I bought this old sugar plantation five years ago and converted it into a working lab . In here , I mix samples of the animals ' DNA with my own . Finding the right formula has been difficult , but I 've had some successes . Alisandra and Daniel are two of my best results . ( Quinn ) And the ones who don 't turn out so right get put back out in the jungle . Well , science always has its failures . So , this is your idea of a good time , right ? Using the chemistry set Mom and Dad gave you for Christmas to make genetic mutations . No . To make the perfect human . I use these hybrids for experiments in genetic markers . [ Tiger roaring ] ( Dr. Vargas ) Shh . These are the genes that cause various cancers . Parkinson 's , that sort of thing . Now , if I can identify and control those markers , I might be able to eliminate them before they take hold in you . In the human body . Well , take a look at this . Now , this is Michael . Oh , my God . He 's still in the infant stage , so we 've just started to communicate . Infant ? He 's at least 10 years old . Well , hybrids mature faster because of the animal DNA in them . Come along , Michael , say something for our visitors . Doc ... Tor . Doctor . Doctor . Yes , good . Well done . Ow ! Damn it ! Damn it ! How dare you bite me ? I created you . I can destroy you , too ! So , uh , well , when you 're ready , Daniel will show you to your rooms . [ Hybrids growling ] Make sure they don 't try and leave during the night . I 'm not finished with them yet . Oh , and , get rid of Michael . Yes , Doctor . It 's all right . It 's just me . Alisandra , what are you doing here ? You must leave the compound right now . Daniel believes Dr. Vargas is a threat to you and your friends . What kind of a threat ? Daniel isn 't evolved enough to figure it out , but I trust his intuition . [ Sighs ] All right . What about the guns ? Daniel is getting what he can . Alisandra , if Vargas finds out you 're helping us ... I just don 't want anything to happen to you because of us . You like me , don 't you ? Yeah . Yeah , I do like you . [ Purring ] Don 't worry . We 'll be fine . Without us , Dr. Vargas is a failure , and his fear of that is stronger than any anger he 'll have . Come , let 's wake the others . Go to the jungle . The others will take care of you . [ Growls ] Go . I could only get one gun . I thought you were loyal to Vargas . Why risk helping us ? I help Alisandra because she likes him . Well , whatever the reason , thanks . Let 's go . Be careful . The hybrids like to attack from above . You take care . Why do you even need this ? It 's just like the one you already have . If mine breaks , I 'll have spare parts . Very valuable when you travel the way I do . You mean like we will . [ Snarls ] Yes , of course . Don 't worry , Ceres , I won 't leave you behind . We 'll find a world where someone like you could be appreciated . [ Growls ] The humans you seek have left the compound . Are the traps set ? Yes , as you wanted . [ Laughs ] Let 's go see the fun . [ Birds cawing ] I can 't stop thinking about the little boy in the cage . I understand a little of what Vargas is trying to achieve . But science without a moral compass is easily abused . [ Low growls in background ] They 're all around us . [ Hybrids snarling ] [ Growling ] I 'm out of darts . Let 's move . Go ! [ All grunting ] Hold still . Remmy , get out of here . I 'm not leaving you . ( Quinn ) Go back to the compound . Get some more tranq guns . Go ! Is that you , Maggie , my darling ? Rickman ? Yes , it 's me . Or at least what 's left of me . This is all your fault . If only you just left me alone . Do you want me to go after the one that got away ? No . He doesn 't matter . I have what I want . [ Spits ] [ Snarls ] [ Laughs ] Alisandra ! Daniel , open up ! Why did you come back ? I had to . My friends were taken . Where 's Vargas ? In the lab . Alisandra with him ? Daniel , where is Alisandra ? In the house , recovering . From what ? [ Howling ] Please , no more . Alisandra , it 's me . Don 't come , don 't come any closer . What did he do to you ? [ Cries ] What did he do to you ? Nothing he 's not allowed . No one 's allowed to do this . Not to a human , an animal , or anything . It 's because of us , wasn 't it ? If it wasn 't you , it would have been something else . He gets angry sometimes . He doesn 't need a reason . Maybe not . But I know what he does need . Rembrandt , no . Vargas ! Whatever 's on your mind , it might be wise to reconsider it . [ Crashing ] You give me one good reason why I shouldn 't do to you what you did to Alisandra . I told you , she has to learn to serve one master . You must understand that . Rembrandt . I know that you care for me but he is still my master . And I am still his slave . What are you talking about ? It 's what I was bred for . It 's what all the hybrids were bred for . You said you created them for medical reasons . Yes , but I wasn 't making any progress . And now you turn them into slaves ? They 're not slaves . Huminals , a new species of life . Bred to be docile beyond reason . The only thing that you 've accomplished is to create a new term for an age-old sin . Oh , look , I 'm not in the mood for a moral debate . Now , you 've obviously come back here for something . Now , what is it ? My friends were taken by your rejects . Now , I want guns and darts . [ Sighs ] All right , yes . Yes , of course . In return for your DNA . What ? We 're not going to help you make more slaves . Oh , yes , you will , if you want my help . Now , look , I know where the rejects , as you call them , I know where they live . And , no doubt , that 's where they 've taken your friends . And I also know the back way in . I get my friends first , then you get the DNA . Oh , please , Mr. Brown , please . Now , look , we both know that once you 've found your friends you 'll never come back here . [ Dr. Vargas sighs ] Unless you 're forced to . Get your stinkin ' paw off me . I always loved to watch you sleep . Go to hell . ( Rickman ) Oh , look at me , love . I 'm already there . What are you going to do with us ? You 're a smart man , Mallory . I 'm sure you can figure it out . Of course , I 'll save you for last , Maggie . ( Rickman ) Give us a chance to see if we can rekindle the old flame . [ Exclaims ] You mean after all this time with your new friends you never once mentioned we were lovers ? Biggest mistake I ever made . Wrong ! The biggest mistake you ever made was betraying me to follow Mallory . [ Growls ] I 'm sorry you 're gonna have to be first , Wade . I really am . I 've always found you rather attractive . Look in the mirror . Then guess how lucky I feel . ( Rickman ) I like your spirit . I hope I get a large dose of it . Quinn ? Listen , take me instead of her . Don 't worry , Mallory . Your turn will come . Get her out of there . [ Quinn groans ] No ! Angus , please , leave her alone . ( Rickman ) Why ? You people never left me alone . Don 't you know payback is hell ? [ Growls ] Dr. Vargas is here . Here ? Good . Put her back inside . Nothing personal , Wade . But if I can have a doctor ... Come on , let 's go . [ Growling ] [ Exclaiming ] So the rumors were correct . I would 've come to see you sooner , Doctor , but I know you 've had company . The reason for my visit . As I guessed . Where is Mr. Brown ? Back at my compound . Unfortunately , he was injured by one of my servants . [ Growling continues ] So , I 'm guessing you 're not here to invite me to a neighborhood watch meeting . I 'm here to trade . Mr. Brown told me about your unique needs . At my lab , I have hundreds of samples of human DNA , and I will give you a dozen of them for each of your prisoners . Oh . An attractive offer . But I 'm not interested . You see , I 'm leaving the island this evening , and I have all the supply I need . Besides , I have a special connection to my prisoners . A warm , fuzzy relationship . Much like you have with these servants . Ceres , don 't make me do it . The poison , I 've made it stronger . [ Hybrids growling ] Okay , let 's go . If you change your mind , you know where I 'll be . Haven 't you heard , Doctor ? I change my mind every day . [ Rickman snickers ] [ Snarls ] [ Hybrids growling ] There are too many of them . You stay . But I don 't have enough darts . Daniel , do what I say ! Stay ! ( Rickman ) Get after the doctor ! [ Monkeys chattering ] Come on . Come on . ( Rembrandt ) Guys , where are you ? Hey ! Remmy ! ( Wade ) Remmy . Remmy . Shh . Took you long enough . Shh , shh . Can 't put it back at least topside . ( Maggie ) Quinn , get the timers , and Rickman will be here forever . Hey . [ Hybrid growling ] Let 's go , Q-Ball . Right behind you . [ Grunting ] Oh , no . [ Exclaiming ] [ Howling ] How much further ? Not that far . Then we just got to wait 40 minutes till Rickman 's timer hits zero . Can you believe it , Rembrandt ? 40 minutes till you 're home . Hey , guys , I 'm going back to the compound for Alisandra . You can 't go back to the compound . That 's the first place Rickman will look for us . Rembrandt , we all know how much you care about her , but you 'll be putting us in too much danger . Look , I didn 't say " us . " I got 40 minutes , right ? I 'll catch up to you . Remmy , if you miss the slide , you 're never gonna get home . Maybe so , but it 's somethin ' I have to do . Fine , then we 'll go with you . Uh-uh . I 'm going to have to pull rank on you , Q-Ball . Can 't let one person jeopardize a whole mission . Right , Captain ? He 's right . All right . So where can I meet you ? East side of the cliffs . Makes it easier to defend ourselves in case they find us . I 'll meet you there . Rembrandt . Where 's the key ? On the desk . [ Hybrid howling ] Where 's Dr. Vargas ? I don 't know . Maybe the hybrids took him . Alisandra , look , I 'm leavin ' the island and I want you to come with me . Ah , yes . Yes . I knew you 'd try to double-cross me . It is so typically human . [ Hybrids growling ] [ Howling ] I need a volunteer . Somebody care to step forward ? You 'll do . [ Grunting ] Take the gate down ! [ Sighing ] Unfortunately , with your DNA , I have little hope of producing a docile hybrid . My only hope is to cross you with a more timid creature . [ All growling ] Kill them all ! I 'm afraid I 'll just have to dispose of you . [ Rickman howling ] [ Hybrids growling ] Hurry . Come with me . [ Sighs ] I can 't . I belong with my own kind . But it was good to feel like a human being , if only for a little while . Use the back door , quickly . What do you think you 're doing ? Have you forgotten who I am ? It is I who created you ! Now , all of you , get out of here before I take away the very life I gave you ! [ Groaning ] [ Grunts ] [ Growls ] Yes ! There 's your villain ! He doesn 't care for you ! He will destroy you ! Where are the sliders ? Well , you 're the animal . Why don 't you sniff them out and hunt them down , hey ? ( Ceres ) They could be anywhere . No . Maggie will go to high ground . That 's the way she 's been trained . I 'm going to the cliffs . Do what you want with him ! You think you can destroy me ? No , you cannot . My genes are everywhere ! I 'm in all of you ! I am in all of you . [ Groaning ] [ Screeching ] [ Growls ] I 've got less then 10 minutes before my vortex opens . I hope Remmy 's watching the clock . [ Seagulls cawing ] ( Quinn ) He 'll be back in time . [ Sighs ] Hey . Where is he ? Ah , don 't worry . Remmy will be fine . I wish there was some way that you could come with us . But we both know I can 't breathe on your world . I know . Listen , uh , this timer will hit zero a couple of minutes after we leave . I hope you find someplace where you could find happiness . Thanks . Come on , smile . You 're getting your crew home . Not the whole crew , Maggie . You 're part of us now . [ Sighs ] I was never a team player until I met you guys . Now I 'm going to be flying solo again . Part of me wants to go with you . Part of me wants to talk you into it . But you got them here and you 're going to have to get them home . Don 't ever forget me , Quinn . Never . Remmy . Where 's Alisandra ? Couldn 't get her to come . We 're going home , Remmy . Home . Yeah . Seems too good to be true . I guess it 's for real , huh ? Yeah . It 's time . [ Whooshing ] Looks like it , Maggie . It 's been a hell of a ride , Rembrandt . I 'm going to miss you gettin ' on my nerves , Wade . Same here . Take care of yourself . Rickman 's going to be comin right after us . You keep your head down . [ Hybrids growling ] I think he 's already found us . When that vortex closes , you better be in it . Now , go ! No . You 're not going to face him alone . You have no choice . Go , I 'm right behind you . No , not without you ! I said go ! [ Both screaming ] [ Growling ] Stay back . Not without me ! [ Rickman screaming ] [ All growling ] Stay back ! Quick , before they change their mind . How much time ? 20 seconds . Here . Track their wormhole . It 'll take you home . It 'll take us home . That 's right . I 'm not going to leave you on this island . Quinn ... I know . You just have to take your chances on my world . [ Whooshing ] You 're the genius . You just have to find a way for me to breathe when we get there . I will . I 'm not going to lose you , Maggie ! [ Whooshing ] We got to get you to a hospital . Wait a minute . This isn 't your home world . I 'm not having any trouble breathing . The tracking device must have been damaged in the fight with Rickman . We just slid randomly . [ Airship roaring ] We must have slid into the future . So how do we get you home ? I don 't know .

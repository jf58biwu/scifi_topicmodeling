 You guys see that thing ? Colin ? Maggie ? Remmy ? What 's going on ? It 's got you ! You know , brother , it occurred to me that if we threw a large mattress into the wormhole ahead of us , it might not hurt so much when we land . Of course , we might miss the mattress . That 's right , " it 's " Lipschitz Live ! Hello ? Quinn ? " This portion of " Lipschitz Live is brought to you by Maggie ? Body Slam Malt Liquor . Rembrandt ? For that special occasion , or for no reason at all . Body Slam is gonna take you down . That 's Body Slam , my friends . Hi . It 's not just for breakfast anymore . Yeah , excuse me , I was just wondering ... Q - Ball ! What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? Come on . I got it . Q-Ball , you and I are gonna have one serious talk ! Save it . They 're not here . Come on . What do you mean , they 're not there ? We must 've got separated . I got you , Remmy . Yikes . Sweet Mary and Joseph . We must be a mile high . Somehow , this has to be Quinn 's fault . Okay , Lipschitz Live . We 're back on the air . There 's been an increase in the number of metal implants found in people heads . Proof of alien abduction , or dental malpractice ? You be the judge . Folks just like you and me , who claim to have been abducted . Remote viewers , out-of-body travelers , and a man who claims that he is the reincarnation of Nostradamus , but swears that he doesn 't remember predicting anything . And all week , right here " on " Lipschitz Live , " we 're " gonna be examining ... Two hours , fifty minutes . People , where are you ? Aliens , from somewhere out there . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Controls . Yeah . Push one . Why I gotta push it ? 'Cause you 're the man . Act like one ! Jiminy cricket . Okay , look , we 've got red and black here , right ? Red means stop . We 're stopped . Hey , hey , hey . What ? Colin ! Colin ! Colin ! Maggie , Maggie . What ? I 'm looking at freaking seagulls up here . He can 't hear you . Well , push something so we can go up or down ! We 've gotta get to get to him . All right , whatever . Yes , folks , thanks to you , Lipschitz Live " is now " the most watched show in the history of television . Beamed to our armed forces abroad , to the research teams at the South Pole , and to those hard-working guys aboard the crippled space station MIR , Lipschitz Live sets the pace for our world today . My next guest has a pug who predicted the big LA quake and the results of last year 's Rose Bowl . Hi , how are you ? Welcome . Thank you . The dog 's name is ... Excuse me ... Can 't you see this is important ? The girl 's got a psychic dog . I 'd like a room . We 're booked up . Booked up ? This place is never booked up . Big corporate wedding . Well , what about the quake ? How did she predict the quake ? Fine . Then I 'd like to leave a message for my friends . She leaped up on the coffee table again ... Do you have a room ? Not according to you . Then you can 't leave a message . Why not ? We 're a full-service hotel , but only for guests . No guest , no service . Look , I have an agreement with my friends that if we ever get separated , we meet here . It 's kind of important . Fine . I 'll be at the bar , if you need me . You think the others made it through ? Who can tell ? I mean , this whole trip is like no slide we ever had . You ever get separated before ? Yeah , but not like this . The only other time we ever had a problem was when the wormhole was struck by lightning . Oh , man . You think Colin was making his way toward the Chandler ? It looked like it . I just hope we didn 't miss the slide window . " Okay , " Lipschitz Live is back on the air . This just in . In Los Angeles , the bowling ball ... Hi . I 'll take a beer . The cheap kind . This time , the scene was the Richard Nixon Freeway in Yorba Linda . An hour and 45 . Come on , guys , where are you ? ... off the back end of flatbed truck ... Thanks . People seem to really like that guy . Are you kidding me ? Man , Barry Lipschitz rules . His show is the only show . Literally . ... but we 've been in touch with his agent . And if and when ... Now , don 't tell me you don 't watch it . ... we 're gonna have it right here on ... Well , I travel around a lot . I mostly read . Books ? Yeah . See , that 's the trouble with you kids today , you know that ? You read too damn much , you don 't watch enough television . And how do you expect to keep informed on what 's going on in the world ? Books . Oh , that 's two bucks for the beer and 15 for the drinker 's insurance . We 've got Cletis Shepherd . Could I just charge that to Millenia Media ? ... for being buried alive in a six-by-four wooden box ... Are you there , Mr. Shepherd ? The voices ! The voices ! And I 'd love to see a menu . No , no , no , Mr. Shepherd , it 's me . It 's Barry Lipschitz . Get out of my head ! That was delicious . Thank you . Good . Wow , that 's a pretty fancy-shmancy clicker you got there . Excuse me ? Get a load of this baby . Control capabilities include TV , VCR , DVD and LD . Switchable between IR and EM bands at wide or narrow beam settings at unlimited range . Ho-ho ! Well , your clicker 's definitely bigger than my clicker . And I say that without a trace of male envy . Huh ? Ready for this Lipschitz news flash . A 10-year-old Webelos Scout in Ashland , Kentucky was revealed today to be a clone . Excuse me . Hey . Can 't you see I 'm in the middle of this show ? Well , excuse me . I thought you worked here . I do . Great . So , we would like a room , please . Oh , who wouldn 't ? Well , actually , we would like a suite . Sold out . Sold out ? You 're never sold out . People keep saying that , but we are . No rooms , no suite . And we 're running out of ice . Okay , look , actually , we 're looking for some friends of ours . Oh , who isn 't ? Okay , they may already have checked in . Could you please check the register ? We 're looking for a Quinn Mallory . " Okay , " Lipschitz Live is back on the air . No , no , no . There 's a Colin Mallory . Yeah . Room 412 . You can use the phone over there . Great . All right . Thanks for , you know , whatever . Okay . All right . All right . Oh , man . This guy is ... He 's crazy , man ! All in the way you hold your mouth . A few more slides , and we 'll all be master burglars . Did Colin have time to eat Chinese ? What a trip . I just got here , and I 'm ready for the slide . And what is with this television stuff ? Nobody seems to be doing anything but watching this Lipschitz guy . When you saw Colin , did he have a suitcase ? Not that I remember . Must 've just bought it . Yeah , but how did he have time to get this stuff monogrammed ? I don 't know . This is expensive , too . Yeah . Did he have this much cash ? No . He 's still keeping up his taste for high-volume outfits . Uh-oh , hold it . Here 's a news flash . They 've found another Bat Boy on Long Island . But right now ... Hi , I 'm ... Look , we 've got no rooms , we 've got no suites , we 've got no ice , and I haven 't seen any of your friends . And , no , you can 't leave a message for them . Thank you . All right . We 're back with Duane . Do you get any grief from the others ? Let me ask you something . Go ahead . Call me Hal . Hal ? I 'm Quinn . Nice to meet you . Say you got separated from someone and you needed to find them in a hurry . You expecting somebody ? Yeah , some friends of mine and I got split up and we 've got a plane to catch very shortly . In 92 minutes to be exact . Well , you guys are kind of cutting it a little bit short , don 't you think ? Yes . I was wondering , is there anywhere in town where people congregate ? Center of town ? Well , I kind of like to hang out at this karaoke bar , you know . I go there a couple of times a week . My friends say that my Neil Diamond is not to be believed . That 's great . But that 's really about the only thing I can think of . I mean , everybody just kind of sits around and watches old , you know , Barry Lipschitz on TV all day . Is that a man ? I do believe that is a man . Were you always a cross-dresser , Duane ? No , not until I started working on a fishing boat . We 'd go out for long periods of time . It 's just a way of bringing , you know , a little touch of home to the boat , you know . Those are some pretty shoes . Hope my wife 's not watching this . She 'll probably want me to buy them for her . All of you dressed up ? Colin ! There you are , Look , we 've been chasing you for over an hour . Hey , hey , don 't touch me . Leave me alone . What 's spooking you ? What are you doing ? What 's your problem , Colin ? Colin ! Come on , let us through ! He 's our friend . Excuse me , what 's wrong with you people ? Colin . Colin . Can we get some help here , please ? What are you doing sitting around ? Colin ? All right , already ! What 's with the cameras ? They 're trying to get that $ 10,000 from " America 's " Funniest Fatalities . Come on , let 's go . Let 's ride with him . Come on . " Coming up on " Lipschitz Live , we 're going to meet a host of very interesting personalities from this world and beyond . Space aliens . Inter-dimensional travelers . Are they really among us ? And if so , what do they want ? And aren 't they an added burden to our already weighted down welfare system ? You want to find out , you stay tuned " to " Lipschitz Live . Hal , this Lipschitz guy , is he really the only thing on TV ? Yeah , pretty much . But , I mean , there 's some , you know , there 's some educational stuff . Oh , did you know that you can cut your hair with a vacuum cleaner now ? Tell me more about this Lipschitz guy . Wow , you really are out of the loop , aren 't you ? All right , well , let 's see , he got his name as a reporter for INM during the war with Guam . Which we , you know , we kicked their butts , by the way . You better believe it . Damn Guamians . Anyhow , after the war , INM merged with TBC . Now , Global bought TBC , and then they merged that with UniMax , which , of course , that got pulled into the Turnbull Group . And then that whole thing just got swallowed up by General Comco , and then , well , that guy that everybody thought was the Unabomber , he just went and bought the whole shebang . And then , of course , he made Lipschitz his star . I mean , everybody watches him . Now , how would one go about getting on " Lipschitz Live ? " You got a weird story to tell ? Sort of . Well , you know , they just shoot in a theater a few blocks from here . It 's just right around the corner . It seems , once again , you 've been handed the reins , and once again you 've disappointed me . It 's not going to be that easy this time , Colin . Like it or not , as my stepson , you will live up to your obligations . Stepson ? When I married your mother , you became heir-apparent to the Infinicorp dynasty . Now , I can 't tell you how important this whole transaction is . No . Of course you don 't . A great deal hinges on you , son . Our merger with Millenia Media means putting an end to 50 years of brutal warfare . War ? 50 years ? Have you been drinking again , son ? I 've warned you about that . Now , get dressed and make me proud . Get dressed into what ? Well , I guess that answers that . Nice work , conning that nurse with your Super Bowl tickets . Well , of course she won 't be able to use them to get into the game on this world , but it got us on this floor . How is he ? No concussion , no broken bones . He 's mildly sedated , but he 'll be all right . Thank God for that . We gotta get moving . Colin , wake up . Colin . Did he always wear this jewelry ? Must 've gotten that stuff on this world . Farm boy always did like shiny things . Come on , we gotta go , Colin . Huh ? You a friend of my father 's ? You sure there 's no concussion ? No , Colin , come on . We 're your friends . Go get his clothes . Just how good of a friend of mine are you , toots ? Oh . Snap out of it , Colin . We have to find Quinn . We don 't know when the next slide window is . Slide window . Right . Whatever works . Here . Hey , thanks , homey . Hey , baby , I 'm still a little groggy . Want to help me on with those pants ? But I 'm perfect for your show . I told you , I 've got all the guests I need . Besides , your story , it doesn 't have any sex appeal . Bigger . Bigger hair . Sex appeal ? Since cable died there 's no market for shows about scientific whiz kids who live in their parents basement and have no life . I 've battled androids , I 've met Elvis . I even met the female version of myself . Did you have sex with her ? The senator , while denying he was drunk , could not explain his nudity . Sign it . Sign the book . You may sit down . What we have witnessed here today is the beginning of the end . The conflict is over . No longer will our efforts be hindered by destructive competition or ruinous price wars . We can now all push forward as one single corporation . And remember our motto , " Farmers grow stuff , but we feed the masses . " The merger is complete . I now pronounce you one husband , one wife , one family , one corporation . Congratulations , son . You 're married . Hey , Dave , how about it , huh ? Welcome back , ladies and gentlemen ! And here he is , the paragon of the airwaves , that titan of television , the most watched , admired and awarded host in the history of worldwide communications , Barry Lipschitz ! Lipschitz loves you ! Too kind . You 're really too kind . My friends , and I take that word very seriously , today we have something special . Something more than just a show . Something more than just entertainment . Sure , we like to entertain , we like to inform . But more than that , most of all , what we really like to do is contribute to the education of what I believe is the most knowledgeable audience in the world today ! You ! They walk among us . Or do they ? Today , we 're going to be talking about aliens , people from other planets , other worlds . Are they here ? And if so , what do they want , and what do they have to tell us ? Well , we 're hoping that our two guests on the show , ladies and gentlemen , will clear up the answers to those questions . First , I 'd like you to meet and greet , on live , on Lipschitz , Mr. Arnold Potts ! Bring him on ! Be self-reliant and multiply . Well , thanks , Arnie . Same to you . Sit down and get a life . Okay , Mr. Potts ' claim , let me see if I get this straight , folks , Mr. Potts ' claim is that he is not really here at all . I am not here at all . Ooh . He is a pan-galactic traveler who can project his image anywhere in the cosmos . Good . Love the suit . Okay , our next guest , bring him on with a warm welcome , is Mr. Quinn Mallory , ladies and gentlemen ! Come on , come on . Oh , man , look , look ! I know that guy ! I was rude to him ! I 'll be damned . He 's a good friend of mine . Yeah . Now , Mr. Mallory is a slider . Is that right ? He slides between those parallel dimensions . Is that right ? Yes , Barry . The guy is an obvious phony . Well , why do you say that , Potts ? He 's a media grabber . He 's in it for the 15 minutes of fame . Look at him . He doesn 't even have an outfit . Uh-huh . Hey . Yep , yep . Come on , he 's got a point there . He has a point . Mr. Mallory , tell me , when you make these slides between parallel dimensions , do you slide in your street clothes ? Yes . I 've made calculations that prove conclusively that the G-forces generated by trans-dimensional traverse would cause the subject 's eyes to explode . That is why I wear these . All right ! All right ! Love the suit . So tell us why you 're here , Mr. Mallory . Well , Barry , it 's kind of like this . Colin ! Maggie ! Remmy ! Come on down to KKRP ! We slide in an hour ! What is he doing ? One hour ! We slide ! That 's what he 's doing . Leave it to Q-Ball . Friend of yours ? Please stand by . Yeah , and of yours . Let 's go . Hey , whoa , whoa . Where are you taking me ? Far , far away . You mean , like out of the city ? At least . Come on . Lead on , baby cakes . I 'll give you baby cakes . That 's a feisty broad . I don 't know exactly how to tell you this . Especially considering that a woman 's wedding day is supposed to be the happiest day of her life . It grieves me to ... Put a sock in it , Colin . Let 's just get this over with . But that 's what I 'm trying to tell you . I 'm not Colin . I mean , I am Colin . I 'm just not your Colin . Now , is that the best that you can do ? Absolutely . You know , look , I don 't want this marriage any more than you do . But like it or not , the corporate dynasties continue through our bloodlines . It 's a curse of birth . But that 's what I 'm trying to tell you . I wasn 't born here . I 'm from a parallel dimension . Have you been drinking again ? You know , I 've warned you about that . Look , I know it 's hard to believe , but my friends and I come from one parallel world to another . Your Colin must be my alternate on this world . Did you try that line on your father ? My father 's dead . Look , you know , I know you hate MacArthur , but really . I don 't hate MacArthur . I don 't even know him . Besides , he seems to be trying to do what is best for his family . And his son . He doesn 't care about you . His sole focus has been to create the biggest corporate dynasty in the world . Indeed . And what an incredible legacy to leave to one 's children . My father tried to do the same . Although a two-room cabin , four cows and some chickens isn 't much of a dynasty . All right , fine , delude yourself . But some day the illiterate serfs will be outside the gate and you will finally understand what 's going on here . Hey , look , it 's too bad my counterpart can 't fully appreciate the value of the effort , or the value of having a father still around to share it . But back to the matter at hand . I have to find my friends . All right , forget your friends . Call in the lawyers . Lawyers ? Yes , they 're in the hall . Don 't look so surprised . They must be present at the consummation to verify the merger . You know that . Huh ? Colin , come out of there . What is with you ? I know for a fact that you are not shy . You know , Bernie and Hal have witnessed a lot of mergers . Colin ? I was gonna be the only guest on this show today . This charlatan demeans the very concept of inter-dimensional voyaging ! Yeah , yeah ! All right , hold it , hold it , hold it . Hold it , hold it , hold it . That 's a point , Mallory . Come on , tell us . Are you a charlatan , or what ? No , no . Okay , okay . The only reason I am here is to be reunited with my companions so we can move from this Earth to the next . Now , my timer states that I only have 45 minutes . Listen , listen ! Now , my timer says that we have 45 minutes left here before we slide . So Remmy , Maggie and Colin , please come down . Colin , come out of there . You call that a timer ? Colin , get out . That 's a timer . That 's a timer . Get that out of my face . You broke my timer ! I 'm sorry . Yeah , yeah , yeah ! Look at this ! Come here , everybody . All right ! All right ! Colin ? Colin ? Marley 's ghost ! Colin ? Come on . Come on , Colin , get out of there . Come on , Colin , get out . Colin ? Colin , come out of there . Colin ! Take your pick . A thousand dollars off , or 3.9 percent APR . Hundreds of beautiful used cars in stock , some with guarantees . Oh , great . Everything must go . We 'll have to get another cab , if we can find one . The Hilton runs an airport shuttle every 30 minutes . Why would we go to the airport ? We 're going to KKRP . And what 's with the smoking ? Hey , you don 't smoke . 3.9 . What a deal ! Oh , yeah , that 's right . I don 't smoke . Sorry . So do you think we can get a move on ? I think we should get to the airport . People might be looking for us . Okay , we 're back ... So , Potts , you would have us believe that you can dematerialize . That somehow the atoms in your body vaporize into molecules which are then magically transported to another plane . There 's no magic involved . I deatomize here , and I reatomize somewhere else . Well , I 'm sure we 'd all like to see that . Wouldn 't you , Mr. Mallory ? I don 't think you can call what I do deatomizing . Okay ? I jump into a vortex , a wormhole that takes me through a tunnel that leads to another dimension , another world . Well , I 'm sure we 'd all like to see that , too , wouldn 't we ? Maybe you will , wise guy . Maybe you will . Uh-huh . You know , R.J. , I never thought this day would ever come . I didn 't think my kid had it in him . But from now on , the sky 's the limit . Commemorative plates , spoons , action figures . Tomorrow on the Lipschitz Book Club , our panel of reviewers are going to take a look at the controversial new bestseller Satan : What 's the Big Deal ? That 's tomorrow on the Lipschitz Book Club . We 'll get back to these nut bars in a minute . But first a news update from the Lipschitz Action Desk . This just handed to me . A new age in American corporate culture was born today , when the heirs to two rival conglomerates were joined in matrimony . Colin Mallory of Infinicorp and Roxanne Crane of Millenia Media were merged in a ceremony at the Chandler Hotel . I 'm a free man ! We 've got the wrong Colin . Yeah . Now , we have exclusive word that , that merger is about to be consummated at this very moment , so we 're going to take our cameras live to the bridal suite at the Chandler . Oh . Okay , well , there seems to be a delay in the action . But you can be sure when that merger is about to be consummated , Lipschitz Live " is " going to be there with our cameras . And by the way , I do smoke . Who the devil are you , and where 's our friend ? Hey , get your hands off me . Like the man said , Colin Mallory married Roxanne Crane . And I hope they 'll be very happy . That was supposed to be you . Yeah , well , it 's some other lucky guy . Your friend , or whatever . How did you manage to get him to take your place ? I swear I had nothing to do with it . It just happened . Maybe it 's for the best . I was trying to get out of it , and now he married a great girl . Yeah . And from the way I see it , a lot of money . Say what ? Yeah . If our friend takes your place , then he gets everything you were going to get . And you get nothing . Yeah , well , maybe there 's time to change it back . Yo , taxi ! How much time do you think we 've got ? Quinn said 45 minutes , 10 minutes ago . Which is not a lot of time to hit the hotel , pick up our Colin , dump this Colin off , and get to the studio in time for the slide . Chandler Hotel , please . You call that number , and you tell them Barry told you this machine is the very best . Hey , I 've got something for you on this special occasion . A William Shatner novel . First edition . But isn 't there something we 've been ignoring , gentlemen ? Huh ? Isn 't there a big , burning question that concerns all of us , when it comes to you aliens , or sliders , or whatever you clowns want to call yourselves ? Huh ? Isn 't there ? All right , all right , all right . What about the swelling welfare rolls , huh ? That 's right . What happens when one of you space clowns breaks his leg ? Who is gonna pay your hospital bills , huh ? Huh ? All right , wait a minute . What happens when one of you guys takes a high-paying job on this Earth ? Are you not , indeed , taking the bread out of mouths of decent , hard-working Americans right here ? Huh ? Huh ? Yeah . All right , hold it . We 'll get back to that subject in a minute . But first , these announcements about upcoming shows on " Lipschitz Live . " I was just bird-watching . Oh , my God . It seems to me your father and MacArthur Mallory are most insistent that this consummation take place . Are you hurt ? Only my pride . And maybe this ankle . I 'm sorry to have spurned you . I hope you 're not insulted . Believe me , it 's nothing personal . I think you 're very beautiful . And any man would be honored to merge with you . You really are different , aren 't you ? So I 've been told by more people than you realize . Look , I 'm sorry to have put you through this . But you just look so much like him . Then you believe me ? Well , I 'm not sure I buy this whole parallel world story . But I have never known Colin Mallory to turn down sex , and I 've never seen him display this sort of feelings towards his father that I have seen in you . Then , will you help me ? I have to get somewhere , and I haven 't got much time . What 's your hurry ? Stay with me . You know , being rich is a pretty good deal . But I 'm not your Colin . I know . But I like you better . You 're very sweet . You 're much like Colin was maybe eight , 10 years ago . I 'm flattered . Unfortunately , I think you might find me inadequate . I 'm not very experienced . I was counting on that . And I have other obligations . I was utterly perplexed . I had never seen a wormhole go unstable before ... That 's my brother . And I must get to him as soon as possible . Can you help me ? Because of this world 's extensive television system . Sure . Come on . The RF radiation that was emitted in the EM spectrum totally threw off the magnetic anchoring point of the wormhole , therefore sending us into a state of spatial flux . Did I mention that I met the female version of myself ? Oh , hey . Did you have sex with her ? Did you ? Yeah ? Yeah ? Yeah ! Did you ? Now , well , that 's more like the happy couple that I know . So , where are you two off to ? Station KKRP . What on earth for ? To buy it . Yeah . We realized there are still a lot of independent stations that have not yet joined our empire , so we thought we 'd buy KKRP as a wedding present to each other . Good thinking . Son , I had you figured all wrong . Hey , why don 't you guys take the limo and go in style ? And while we 're at it , I think we 'll buy that channel that shows nothing but science fiction programming . Come along , dear . The guy 's a phony ! The guy 's a phony ! You can 't astral-project in a sweater vest ! Maggie , Colin , Remmy ! Come down to KKRP right now ! He 's a phony ! Don 't go away . I 'll be right back . You watch Lipschitz . You never miss an episode , you think you 've seen it all , the flying chairs , the transvestite cat fights , the on-stage shoot-outs , but you haven 't seen it all " until you 've seen " Lipschitz : Too Hot for TV . A never before seen plus the infamous comedian episode . You haven 't seen Lipschitz ... Keep the change . ... until you 've seen Lipschitz : Too Hot For TV . Order your own copy for only ... What 's going on ? Who is this guy ? Where 's Roxanne ? Colin , so help me , if this is another one of your half-baked ... Where are they ? Who ? Roxanne and that imposter . Imposter ? What are you talking about ? They 're not here . The bridal suite is empty , but that crazy talk show is on . Then Colin must 've got the message . Great . So it looks like he 'll make the slide . The question is , will we ? We need a car now . I 'm taking the limo , Dad . I just gave you a limo so you could buy a television station . That wasn 't me . I don 't understand . That was your Colin 's exact duplicate . Actually , it was our Colin , and we want him back . And I want Roxanne back . And the money , too . Look , we could take a cab . No , no , no , I don 't take cabs . We 'll buy another limo . Perfect . All right , so let me get this straight . Now , you moved an entire population from one world to another ? No . Not exactly . That would be going against the Prime Directive . You can 't travel to other worlds and interfere with their cultures . What are you talking about ? There is no Prime Directive . Maybe that 's in your universe . There are strict rules to inter-dimensional behavior . You are really starting to piss me off ! Hey ! Are we loving this ? Oh , yeah ? Come on , let 's hear it for them , huh ? Huh ? Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me . Oh , good grief ! Excuse me . Excuse me . Can I see your producer , please ? Can I help you ? I produce " Lipschitz Live . " Yeah , let us in . We own this show . Which means we own you . Wait , aren 't you ... The big merger , today ? Yeah , Colin Mallory , corporate magnate . And this is my mergee . Oh , oh , go right in . I 'm sure Barry will want you on the show right after these sliders . So how much time , you think ? Less than 10 . That 's pushing it . Mmm-hmm . Not getting cold feet , are you , son ? I never really got along with Roxanne 's family . And frankly , she hates me . Hate ? That 's a harsh word . Resentment is probably what she feels . Besides , this is business . You don 't have to get along with people you 're in business with . That 's what it 's all about . Business . Somehow , I always thought when I got married , it would be , well , more romantic . Romantic ? You been talking to your mother again ? All right , let me ask you this . How much time until your next slide ? I have got a minute and change . How about you , disco ball boy ? Oh , I 'll be moving on shortly . Oh , so you 're gonna slide away , too , huh , Potts ? I prefer the term astral projection . Excuse me , people , coming through . Important people . Move it . Come on , toots , shake a leg . Where 's the producer ? I 'm Colin Mallory . I own this place . We 've already got a Colin Mallory . What are you talking about ? I 'm the real one . Will you just let us in ? I can explain everything . Well , almost everything . If you really want a show , why not have another Colin Mallory ? Listen , this is Colin Mallory 's identical twin . Kidnapped at birth . Raised by dolphins . Just let us in . All right , all right , all right . Go , go right in . What is this ? You 'll see , freak . Thanks for believing in me and helping me . I really do wish you were my Colin . I do , too . In a way . I gotta go . Folks , seriously , I am leaving in less than a minute , alone . And I just would like to say goodbye . To my friends , to my brother . I 'm coming with you , bro ! Hey , hey , who 's this ? Another slider ? Hey , Q-Ball . Don 't leave without us , bro ! What do we have here ? We have a weirdo slider reunion ! Hey , how about that ! Those crazy sliders . I tell you . Hey . Yo . Hey , it 's a " Lipschitz " first ! Colin ! Roxanne , I ... That 's his other brother ? Hey , what 's with Colin and the gold ? Oh , it 's a long story . I 'm getting married . Five , four , three , two , one , zero . Oh , man , I can 't believe this ! Hey , come here , guys ! Cheese and crackers . They said it couldn 't happen , but it did ! Trans-dimensional travel ! Four people transported from one plane to another . And you saw it on " Lipschitz Live ! " Amazing . So , can we get this marriage contract changed ? I think so . The lawyers didn 't witness the consummation . Hey , there was no consummation . Was there ? You didn 't do anything with that guy , did you , Roxanne ? No . Then , can 't we get married ? I hope so . But is this really a happy ending ? Stay tuned and find out , because this young lady could be married to an alien in another dimension . What happens if that guy comes back ? There 's only one way to find out . You gotta keep watching " Lipschitz Live ! " Come on !

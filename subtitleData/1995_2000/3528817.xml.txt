 I will change my opinion if someone offers a better one . Until then , I am leaving Moya at the next planet with shipping traffic . Pass me those and don 't help yourself . We 're stronger as the sum of our parts , kids . We are under no obligation to function as a unit , John . Zhaan , I understand that , we all have separate goals , but ... Oh ... sala manila , what the hell is that ? That 's krawldar , a delicacy , even for pagans . Yeah ? How long was it under your butt getting delicate ? Wait a minute , whatever the rest of you decide , - I will not abandon Moya . - Good , suit yourself . - You 've got nowhere to go anyway . - I confess my consternation at agreeing with D 'Argo . But if Moya is no longer able to Starburst then we are all at risk , hmm ? - Can I say something ? - No ! Look , Moya has been very good to us , and now you want to abandon her ? I want to see my son , and that is not likely to happen aboard a pregnant biomechanoid ship . - RygeL , what do you think ? - Well ... Moya has been , for as long as I can remember , our protector , our home , our companion , and our friend . - Amen . - However , as relationships grow they also change . Do you think we can trade her for a faster vessel ? Moya is not a possession , Your Lowness . if you ignore the messenger , which is effortless , the message is sound . Perhaps we have outgrown our usefulness of ... Who made this shellack ? The recipe called for chicken all I had was space rodent . Moya is protecting her baby , D 'Argo ! Do you blame her ? That is selfishness masquerading as reason . He 's right , you know , we all want to leave the Uncharted Territories and return home , but you ... Yes , you would be more content to stay . I want to get home as badly as anybody else , and this is where the wormholes are . Fine , so stay , but be honest about your motives , Crichton . - I 'm sorry , you 're on their side now ? - No . I know , I just got here , but can I please say something ? - No ! - No ! Excuse the intrusion , but Moya and I would Like a word about your deliberations . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you guys . The DRDs have ears . No wonder you guys have been flying around in circles . Moya is aware of your concerns over her condition and regrets not being more responsive to your needs . Please don 't misunderstand , Pilot , we ... we simply ... Do not wish to be captured because of her pregnancy . Yes . We 're just having a discussion , Pilot . That includes thoughts of abandoning us . - You want us to stay ? - Of course , we are most fulfilled when serving others . Your presence is gratifying and comforting . Let us talk a little while longer , Pilot , your points are well taken . You may talk all you want , but please prepare for immediate Starburst . I ... I thought Moya couldn 't Starburst for another 50 arns . Her energy is low , however , she shares your concerns about being recaptured , and wishes to prove to you all that she is capable . Ah no , that won 't be necessary , Pilot . Starburst in 5 microts . Now , this really is ... my favourite on the table . Smoked pronga sinew . It 's quite easy to make , really . - Are you alright ? - We must have hit something . In Starburst ? - What 's that noise ? - Zhaan ? Zhaan ? Are you okay ? It 's my arm , the fibres are torn . Pilot , what 's happening ? Pilot ? Pilot ? Pilot ! I 'm alright , Chiana , I 'll heal . - Where 's Rygel ? - Rygel ? - Where is he ? - Rygel ? What the hell is that ? I 'll check Command . You , look after Pilot and you , you do damage assessment . - D 'Argo ! - D 'Argo ? He can 't just disappear like that . Pilot or Command ? Command . You , fix her arm and then straight to Command . Go . Aeryn ? - John , what 's happening ? - I don 't want to die ! Pilot , are you there ? Crichton , where are the others ? You tell me what happened ? I 'm unsure ... still running analysis . - Is that a star ? - Unknown ... Attempting to close radiation filters ... D 'Argo , Aeryn and Rygel have disappeared ... What happened ? Did we hit something ? Still unknown , quantify ' disappeared ' . Here one second , gone the next Disa - Elvis has left the building - appeared . These readings are all over the map . Whatever 's happened , most systems are out , propulsion , guidance , comms . Even my DRDs aren 't responding . This is nuts , nothing seems to be working . How 's Moya ? Frightened , and in great pain . - What is that out there ? - I will labour to discover that once the DRDs reestablish internal tracking . I show Rygel on Tier 8 and Officer Sun in Maintenance Bay 3 , - Still searching for D 'Argo . - Keep lookin ' . - I said no , Chiana . - You can 't stop me ! I know how to fly a Transport Pod , and I 'm getting off this ship . Not without everyone else , you 're not ... How 's the arm ? Oh , useless until the fibres regenerate . Pilot 's found Aeryn and Rygel . - Does he know what 's happening ? - Not yet he 's still a little freaked out , so he could probably use some company . Okay , I 'll go straight to the den . The comms don 't work . Rygel is on Tier 8 . You 'll have to find him on foot . Me ? Get frelled ! Listen ' sunshine ' , you want to be part of this crew ? - On your good days . - This is one of the good days . I thought you were junior Miss , tough Chick of the Universe ? Yeah , when I can kiss or kick or cry my way out of it . This is way , way , way different . You bet your ass it is and Pilot can 't get the outer doors open , so you can fly that pod around on its pad . Chiana , it 's going to be okay . Pilot 's on the job . Tier 8 . Rygel . Aeryn ! Aeryn , where are you ? Oh come on , Aeryn . Give me some kind of sign . Pilot ! Aeryn , are you here ? What the hell is this light ? Pilot ! Zhaan ! Pilot ? Pilot ? Is anybody here ? Is anybody here ? Crichton ... Crichton ! I ... I can 't ... Crichton ... That 's the same noise ... as the Maintenance Bay . Aeryn ! Aeryn ! Aeryn ! What the hell ? No ! No ! Can 't you hear me ? You okay ? Can you hear me ? You , you 're alright ? You 're okay ? My head 's hurting . Yeah , yeah . Have you found D 'Argo ? What ? D 'Argo ? No , no ... Have you seen ... Rygel ? Rygel ? Little guy ? Have you seen him ? Come with me . There are doors between the Moyas . This way ! Come on ! Yeah ... Look for D 'Argo . Yeah , and Rygel , yeah . A - e - r - y - n ! A - e - r - y - n ! Well , look at you ! Rygel ! Yellow light . Doesn 't hurt . I can hear , this is ... this is good . - What 's so damn funny ? - You ! You ! You 're making less sense than usual , but in a cute way . Cute ? I don 't know what you 've been smoking , buckwheat , but we 've got a serious problem here . Nothing a good meal won 't solve , I 'm sure . What is up with you ? Up ? Everything 's up ! Everything 's up , up , up ! Rygel , listen to me , Moya has a serious problem . Whatever she hit caused some kind of ... kind of fracture . I don 't know , I mean , we 're all here , but we 're not in the same time or place , in space . - Have you seen D 'Argo ? - D 'Argo ? I don 't know , nobody 's here , not even Pilot . I was quite frantic at first , then I realised I quite like being on my own . Yeah , that 's what we usually prefer too , but right now we stick together . And then the Trawlian Priest turns to the Calanese Cleric and says , doesn 't bother me . You should have seen her mother . No , no , no , no ! His mother ? Oh , what am I doing ? Entering into the spirit of things , I 'd say . Rygel , look around at this place . Do you remember what happened ? Yes ! Nobody liked my cholian curd salad . No , no , no , no , no , no . Afterwards , there was a collision . Yes , there was a collision , yes , but we survived , so why worry ? There 's ... there 's something happening to Moya ... and us . - You don 't make jokes . - No , no , I don 't tell jokes . And I don 't laugh at them , it 's this place , it 's doing something to us . Yes , yes , it is doing something to us but we 'll both feel better once we 've eaten . Where there 's a way in , there 's a way out . Hey Guido , you see that ? Yes , I did . It was an hallucination , Crichton . Just an hallucination . It was real , Rygel . It was real , I mean , we both saw it . But it didn 't come back , and it didn 't hurt us , didn 't take the food . We can find a way out of here . It 's hard to find , you 've got to listen for a weird , strange noise , something out of the ordinary . Weird noise ... Does my stomach count ? No , that is not funny , that is not funny , Rygel . Look , I gotta get out of here before I end up like you . What , handsome with a great sexual prowess ? Shut up ... Just shut up . No ! I gotta get out of here . Either help me , help me ? Leave me alone ! I 'll be in the galley with the food , and the monster . There 's my noise . Okay , Alice , once more into the looking glass . We can 't find them , Pilot . False information yet again . The DRDs still show Officer Sun on Tier 2 . Rygel outside the Centre Chamber ... - D 'Argo in ... - Competent ! You got it wrong , Four Arms , they 're nowhere . Your inability to locate them does not negate the fact that they are there . Then why can 't we see them ? - Because ... - Because you don 't have x - ray vision , do you ? - John , where have you been ? - Right here . Pilot , what do you know about parallel realities ? Temporal shifts ? Objects occupying the same space at the same time ? More information , please . There are at least three other Moyas right here , right now . Do you know the mathematical hypothesis , Dimensional Schism ? Light and sound disjointed into base elements . Red , blue , yellow . Hypotheses don 't just materialise , Pilot . Tell us what 's happened to us . Starburst is technically the seam between space - time dimensions . Moya 's power cells allow us access , and we simply ride out the energy stream until we 're pushed out , at random . Pushed out at random ? - Not now , Chiana . - What do you mean , not now ? We go into this Starlurch thing and we don 't even know where we 're going ? At the next appropriate moment , you are welcome to leave . Tell us what happened , Pilot . In her haste to accommodate so you wouldn 't abandon us , Moya entered Starburst without adequate thrust . At the moment , we appear to be ... Stuck . Wild guess here . - We 're still in Starburst ? - Regrettably , our insertion vector was wrong and subsequent fluctuations ... Screw the science lesson , Pilot . You should have told us that we 're still in Starburst . Now we are stuck into what ? Whatever 's on the other side . You saw a creature ? What kind of creature ? Well , the kind we eat , or the kind that eats us ? Is it possible that you saw a fragment from another dimension , John ? If what Pilot says is accurate , yeah . I 've always wondered what could be beyond height and width , depth and time . - Nausea . - Spirituality . That 's a good wish . Pilot says we don 't have enough power to pull free . What are we going to do ? First thing , protect ourselves in case that creature is the eat us kind . You two find some weapons , I 'm going to work with Pilot . - What do you have in mind ? - Get the others , bring ' em back . Follow this sequence exactly , and when the ion backwash reaches maximum , funnel it all to reverse propulsion . I 'll try . Any deviation will result in failure . I said I 'll try . Look Pilot , why is Moya being schismed off by this deal , but not you , me , the others ? Relative densities ... The heavier the substance , the more pronounced the fissure . Even now , connected to Moya as I am , the effects are becoming noticeable . And we are being drawn further in by the moment . - And when we get pulled apart ? - Molecula dispora ... You know Pilot , Moya did not have to go into Starburst until she was ready . Now is hardly the time for recriminations , Commander . It wasn 't a recrimination . We should have been more up front about our feelings . How 's she doing ? Same as us ... scared . Well , we 'll do what we can . She knows . You 'll be happy to know we have a plan . I 'll be happier to know if it works . First thing , we find the others . - We ? We 're going with you ? - D 'Argo and the others may be injured , Chiana . Do I get a say in this ? - No ! Look out ! We stay together , the whole way , Chiana , no roaming . - Yes , mother . - No , Mom , plan has changed . You stay with Pilot , if that creature comes back , just ... shoot it . Even if I was still a full Pa 'u , I wouldn 't hesitate . Right here ... - You ready , Pip ? - Ah ... Pip means ? My favourite travelling companion . Before I got here , did they believe anything you said ? I thought you said this red light hurt your head ? It does . - Well , not to me . - I 'm so glad . Come on , let 's get ... D 'Argo ! You 're alive . Barely , this light affects thinking and motor functions . Not to me . I saw you earlier on . What the hezmana happened to you ? It 's way too much to go into right now . Suffice it to say that Moya had a little problem during Starburst . She 's wedged herself into another dimension and split off into at least four distinct parts . Have you ever heard of anything like this happening before ? D 'Argo , I haven 't heard of anything like anything before . My planet doesn 't even go to the moon anymore . I 've heard of it ... my ... my people 's weapon scientists once ... once poked a hole through another dimension . Once it widened , they lost control . - Yeah , what happened ? - No one 's sure , but a whole solar system , four populated planets , dissolved into tiny chunks . - That 's why I want to get out of here . - We will . That thing help ? Barely , I only retch every once in a while now . Look ... we gotta get the engines started ... in each of Moya 's four incarnations in order to get out of here . - Pilot isn 't here to operate them ? - It 's alright ... He told me what to do . I was going to tell you about that . Look ! - It 's trying to come through from the other side . - Let 's discourage it . - Know how to use that thing ? - I 'm scared grotless , not stupid . One , two , fire ! What happened to three ? We did it . - Does not feel like a victory . - Not at all . No , no , no button , then lever slide . - Look , I can stay , you go get Aeryn and Rygel . - You are in no condition . - Well you 've been here longer . - You can barely stand . Now you , you say that this light doesn 't affect you . Yeah ... No ... no ... Yes , this light doesn 't affect me . No , I won 't stay alone and no , I won 't stay alone . Just take the girl , I 'll be okay . Well , you know how to get out in case something goes wrong ? Yes , above the Strategy Table , now go ! Alright , give us half an arn , then fire up everything in reverse . I remember from the first seven times that you told me . Not here , go ! Go ! I do not want that here . Doesn 't affect me . - Are you sure about this ? - Just go up ! - What if the creature 's waiting ? - Then piss it off ! - How ? - Pretend it 's me ! Okay , mu ... much better . - Are you alright ? - Aeryn , this is genius . I modified flight headsets to block out acoustic wavelengths , that 's all . It 's not bad for the girl who hates to do homework . Well , it 's military tech , it 's battle tested . Why did you not shoot at that thing ? - I don 't know . - You don 't ... Brilliant instinct , Crichton . Have you seen my Prowler ? Oh yeah , I was here for that show , you missed it . Look , Pilot thinks Moya 's been wedged into another dimension . - That thing 's trying to get into ours . - Yeah . - Have you found the others ? - Well , Moya 's separated off into separate environments . D 'Argo 's in one , Rygel 's somewhere else , and we 're here . Clearly , you found a route to get through . Yeah , but it 's not going to matter if we get sucked in any farther . - Is there a plan ? - Yep . - Well ? - Pilot needs more power . All the engines have to be on full reverse at the same time . That should have been the first thing you told me , Crichton . Yeah , I know , I was busy . Aeryn wait , let me show you what to do . I know the sequence for full reverse . Get on to the others ! Pilot was pretty specific about what he wanted . I have some of Pilot 's DNA , remember ? Pilot was ... very specific . Rotate blue crystal , trim yellow disk , extinguish orange light , open copper , rods , black handle pressed halfway , dial tri - connector open , hot progression purple green , orange gold lights , - green knob ... - maximum , thrust . It 's going to be harder to doubt you in the future . Well I apologise for my strengths . - Give me half an arn then fire it up . - Got it ! Chiana ? Sparky ... Sparky ? Careful , careful , don 't slip and fall and die . I 'm so glad to see you two are safe . He said you 'd have that look on your face . Well , I was worried about you . Well I found Rygel , and I managed to bring him here and then we started talking , and ... - Do you know any good jokes ? - Not besides the one I 'm living . Alright , Mister Serious , what are you doing ? Putting Moya 's propulsion system into full reverse . Oh ! Reverse . Ha ! No Dominar from the House of Rygel ever travels in reverse ! Well , turn around and pretend you 're going forward . You stay here with Napoleon and if for any reason the engines shut down , - restore the green knob . - Ignore the green slob . Restore ... the green ... knob . Do that , and I 'll let you take a Transport down to the next planet , okay ? - Crichton , that 's outrageous ! - Green knob . Good girl . Hang tough Sparky , enjoy the personality . Oh , there is no expanse of the mind , the will cannot traverse or physically the distance laid across the universe . There 's blessings , many in the stars , save one lamented curse , that 16th Rygel , glory me , must travel in reverse . There 's a little dance that goes with that , but I can 't do them both at the same time . I wish you people would stop pointing guns at me . When you didn 't show , I was beginning to think I was in the wrong place . Pilot reports full reverse power you did it , John . - What about the creature ? - Well , I keep shooting at it but it keeps coming back . Well , we 've got to hold it off until Pilot can get us out of here . - Your vestments ? - I suddenly realised I had forsaken priesthood , - but not in my soul . - Why did you put them on now ? I ... I fear we may die here soon . Whole sections of the ship are being swallowed up . Pilot , it 's getting worse . Crichton . - Pilot , report . - Not good . Despite Moya 's best efforts we 're still being drawn in . - There is one very long shot . - Anything , Pilot ? Moya could , willingly , lose the baby . - No ! - No way ! It will definitely increase her power quotient , though I 'm not sure if it is enough to get us free . Pilot no , we cannot ask Moya to make that sacrifice . We should not have attempted Starburst when we did . Our insecurities have brought us to this place , besides , the baby cannot survive if we don 't . Pilot , listen to me ... whatever happens , we go together ... we keep the baby . John ! Shoot it ! Moya is very scared , please shoot it ! Don 't fire . It 's coming through . John , the hole 's widening ! Prime numbers ... These scratches are grouped in prime numbers . 3 ... 5 ... 7 ... 11 ... prime ! - It 's trying to communicate . - You bet your blue ass . This isn 't an attack , Zhaan ... It 's an invitation . I urge you to shoot it ! It 's trying to communicate . I know it ... It 's not attacking . John , no ! What if the hole closes up ? Then I 'll be dead a few minutes before you . That 's all . - Who are you ? - Unimportant ... Your container has breached our existence . Is that where I am ? In your dimension ? There can be no overlap . This is the expanse between ... your mental organ is unable to interpret the chasm to your existence . You got that right , pal . My function is to repair breaches . Does this happen a lot ? Never before with living material . Bad news , pal , we are living . Can you help us get out ? I must destroy all material . - The breach is fatal . - Whoa , whoa , hang on , give us a chance . We 're trying to back out . That path will tear the rupture beyond restoration . So what are you saying , there 's no way ? Forward . Forward ? I thought you said we can 't exist in your existence ? I will attempt to conduct you back to the space you began ... Starburst ? I can guide . You must provide your own thrust forward . Wait , wait , wait ! What if we don 't have enough power ? Forward ... Wait ! Did you hear it ? Did you hear it ? Hear what ? You barely got your head inside the hole and out again before it closed . - The creature , I talked to it . - Commander ... - there wasn 't time . - There was for me . You 've got to tell Moya to stop resisting , she has to go forward . Starburst forward . - I will not ... - We don 't have a choice . You tell me what to do and I 'll relay it to the others . Pilot , trust me . - Reverse the final four controls . - Right . Give me 500 microts , then go . John , John , what if you 're wrong ? Oh , you were going to pray anyway . 500 ... 499 ... 498 ... 472 ... 471 ... The engines are in full reverse . Did it work ? Shut it down ! Wrong direction . - We have to go forward . - No , no , that is suicide . No , it 's the same control sequences , just reverse the last four commands . Can you explain to me how you arrived at this decision ? No , no , no time , just wait 300 microts , then forward . I have no time keeping device . One mississippi one ... one mississippi two ... one mississippi three ... three hundred , forward . One mipipippi ... two mipipippi , three mipipippi ... four mipipippi ... Aeryn ? Aeryn , are you there ? - Where have you been ? - On the run . - Where are you ? - I 'm trying to get out of here . I didn 't know if you were coming back . I 'd never leave you . - Something the matter ? - Yeah . We got it wrong , we have to go forward . - Just tell me what I have to do . - A 150 microts from now ... full ... maximum thrust . - You know how to do that ? - Yes , of course I do . Hey look , this dimension thing 's chopping up the whole ship . - Do you know a way I can get to quarters ? - Well ... the lower levels have gone , you might want to try Tier 7 through the Ion Backwash Chamber . - I 'm going to head back to Pilot 's . - A 150 microts ... - A 130 now , good luck . - Back at ya , baby . 52 ... 51 ... Oh there you are ! The other runners came through here arns ago ! Still auditioning for Star Search , I see ? No , I have a new philosophy , Crichton . What used to be important isn 't and what should be important never will be . Great , that way when this whole thing screws up and we die , you 're not going to be whinging in my ear , right ? Hey ! Why don 't you relax ? Join in the fun ? Give me seven seconds , baby . We 'll come or go together . Oh hell , we 're screwed . Should I disrobe so it 's memorable ? Yes . I 'm alive . I fail to see the source of your amusement . No , no , no , you did not say that . I did , I was very shameless in my youth . - And that worked ? - Of course not ! The girl screamed and I was almost arrested . And when they didn 't give it back , we beat the gris out of them . - Should I be telling you this ? - My dear , I 've kicked more ass than you 've sat on . Oh yes , I spent all evening listening to them gripe and whine about me but of course , they didn 't realise I was their Dominar . I admire your openness to criticism , Rygel , when did you tell them who you were ? At their trial , of course ! Everyone is it just me , or is this the best food that we have ever had ? Nothing like the taste of death to clear the palate ? I suppose there isn 't a thing here that I couldn 't live on for a cycle . Except ... except maybe this . Now I was assuming that because of the lack of taste in that . That it was a garnish . Those are Grandmother Crichton 's famous buttermilk biscuits . What 's in them ? Self - raising flour ... salt ... shortening , buttermilk , touch of honey . But we have none of those ingredients , John . Yeah , maybe that 's the problem . I 'm sorry to interrupt your meal , but ... how can you all be so jovial after our near miss ? We were affected profoundly by it , Pilot . How are you two handling it ? Well enough to alleviate your concerns about our Starburst problems . There 's been a change in the status of Moya 's baby . - Is she in any danger ? - Doing fine . Actually ... more than fine . - We 're going to have a baby ? - Yes ... There 's no exact timetable for Leviathan gestations , but Moya feels confident the day is coming . Well , in that case , tell her if she 's so inclined , when it is born she can name it after me . - That would only work if it was a runt . - Watch it , girly ! This is one of the good days , people . - To a healthy ... happy ... baby . - Yeah ... Yes ... Thanks .

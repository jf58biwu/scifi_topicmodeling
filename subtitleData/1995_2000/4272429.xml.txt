 - [ Announcer ] Last Season . - What We Have Is The Corpus ... Of An Extraterrestrial Biological Entity . The Ice Core Samples I Took , They Can 'T Be Faked . [ Mulder ] I Refuse To Believe That It 'S Not True . So You 'Re Saying It 'S All Been Orchestrated . A Hoax . Which You 'Ve Been Used To Perpetuate . - [ Gunshot ] - He Said The Men Behind This Hoax ... Gave Me This Disease To Make You Believe . Early This Morning I Got A Call From The Police ... Asking Me To Come To Agent Mulder 'S Apartment . The Detective Asked Me- - He Needed Me To Identify A Body . Agent Scully- - Agent Mulder Died Late Last Night ... From An Apparent Self-Inflicted Gunshot Wound To The Head . When We Speak Of Life Beyond The Earth , What We Generally Mean ... Is , Of Course , Intelligent Life , Something Resembling Our Noble Selves . It Is Highly Probable That There Are ... Such Intelligent Forms Of Life ... In Other Galaxies In The Universe . [ Sighs ] And It Is Even More Probable ... That Many Of These Forms Are Vastly More Intelligent Than We . [ Mulder Narrating ] I 'Ve Held A Torch In The Darkness ... To Glance Upon A Truth Unknown ; An Act Of Faith Begun With An Ineloquent Certainty ... That My Journey Promised The Chance Not Just Of Understanding , But Of Recovery ; That The Disappearance Of My Sister 23 Years Ago ... Would Come To Be Explained ; And That The Pursuit Of These Greater Truths ... About The Existence Of Extraterrestrial Life ... Might Even Reunite Us . A Belief Which I Now Know To Be False And Uninformed In The Extreme . My Folly Revealed By Facts Which Illuminate ... Both My Arrogance And Self-Deception . If Only The Tragedy Had Been Mine Alone , Might It Be More Easy Tonight To Bring This Journey To Its End . [ Phone Ringing ] [ Man ] Agent Mulder ? Agent Mulder . Yeah . There 'S A Matter Of Security . Something I Hadn 'T Anticipated . Just After I Left Your Apartment- - Who Are You ? Just After Our Last Conversation , I Was Followed- - Who Are You ? Are You Listening , Agent Mulder ? Are You Hearing Me ? We Can 'T Speak Right Now . I Have Reason To Believe That These- - Did They Give Agent Scully This Disease ? Did They Do This To Her Because Of Me ? They May Be Listening , Agent Mulder . They May Be Watching You , Everything You Do And Say . Are You Listening , Agent Mulder ? Agent Mulder ? [ Exhales ] Agent Mulder ? Put That Out ! Back Away ! Get Away . [ Gunshot ] [ Machine Beeps ] You Have No New Messages . [ Beep ] - [ Mulder ] Keep Going , F.B.I. Woman . - Mulder ? What Are You Doing ? Why Are You Sitting In My Bedroom In The Dark ? It Was Too Crowded In My Apartment . I Couldn 'T Sleep . I 'M Not Kidding , Mulder . Good . 'Cause Neither Am I. There 'S A Dead Man On The Floor Of My Apartment , And It 'S Only A Matter Of Time Before He Starts To Stink The Place Up . What Are You Talking About , Mulder ? What 'S Going On ? Apparently Somebody Thinks My Life Is Interesting Enough To Put On Videotape . My Apartment 'S Been Under Electronic Surveillance For At Least Two Months . Look At This . Courtesy Of The U.S. Government . That 'S The Dead Man In Your Apartment ? Yeah . He Works- - He Worked For The Department Of Defense . How Did He Die , Mulder ? Gunshot Wound To The Face . Have You Contacted Anybody At The Bureau ? I Can 'T Do That , Scully . I Can 'T Go To The Authorities With This . - What Are You Talking About ? - This Man , Ostelhoff , Worked For The Military . Are You Beginning To Get The Picture ? Do You See What 'S Happening Here ? That The Hoax Is Connected To The Military , Just Like Kritschgau Said It Was . This Hoax , Your Cancer , Everything . It Just Doesn 'T Lead Back To The Military . It Leads Right Back To The F.B.I. What ? This Man Ostelhoff Was Set Up In The Apartment Directly Above Mine . I Caught Him Trying To Destroy Phone Records On Which The Same Number Was Called 17 Times . This Is The P.B.X. Operator At The Bureau . Yeah . Who Would He Be Calling At The F.B.I. ? - I Don 'T Know . - Mulder , How Long Has This Been Going On ? Maybe Since The Beginning , Since You Joined Me On The X-Files . That Would Mean That For Four Years We 'Ve Been Nothing More Than Pawns In A Game ; That It Was A Lie From The Beginning . Mulder , These Men . You Give Them Your Faith And You 'Re Supposed To Trust Them With Your Life . There Are Those Who Can Be Trusted . What I Need To Know Is Who Among Them Is Not . I Will Not Allow This Treason To Prosper . Not If They 'Ve Done This To You . Mulder , We Can 'T Go To The Bureau Making These Accusations . But As They Lie To Us , We Can Lie To Them . A Lie To Find The Truth . [ Police Radio Chatter ] [ Mulder Narrating ] Let The Truth Be Known Though The Heavens Fall . The Web Of Lies Entangling Us Can Now Be Connected ... Back To The Very Institution Which Brought Us Together . The Facts Supported By A Byzantine Plot , Executed By Someone Inside The F.B.I. , Who , If Named , Agent Scully ? Could Be Tied To The Hoax Meant To Destroy Me ... And To The Terminal Disease Inflicted On Scully . In Four Years I Have Shared My Partner 'S Passionate Search For The Truth . And If My Part Has Been A Deception , I Have Never Seen Her Integrity Waver Or Her Honor Compromised . Is It Him ? But Now , I Ask Her To Lie ... Yeah . To The People Lying To Us- - A Dangerous Lie To Find The Truth ; To Find The Men Who Would Be Revealed As Its Enemy , As Our Enemy . As The Enemy Within . Agent Scully . Is It True ? Yes , Sir . Are You All Right ? I 'M , Uh- - I Don 'T Know What To Say . They Asked Me To Come Down And Identify The Body . Well , How 'D You Make The I.D. ? The Word From Alexandria P.D. Is It Was Self-Inflicted . A Shotgun Blast To The Face . I Saw Mulder Earlier This Morning . He Was Wearing The Same Clothes . I 'M Very Sorry . Agent Scully . Section Chief Blevins Wants You In For Questioning On This . He Believes You Have Information You Haven 'T Come Forward With . The Military Connection To The Conspiracy We Had Pierced Was Now Undeniable . The Man Who Lay Dead In My Apartment Worked For The Department Of Defense ... At Its Advanced Research Facility . What I Might Find Here , I Was Uncertain Of , But My Crime Had Provided Me Access . As Long They Believed Scully 'S Lie That It Was Me Lying On That Floor , I Might Learn Truths Here . But If Our Lies Were Discovered , Both Scully And I Would Be Discovered With Them . Agent Scully , Please Have A Seat . Some Time Has Passed Since You Were First In This Office . Yes , Sir . Four Years . From All Reports , Your Work On The X-Files Brought You Very Close To Agent Mulder . Yes , Sir . We 'Re All Sorry About What 'S Happened , Agent Scully . But That 'S Not Why I 'M Here . You 'Re Here Because We 'Ve Been Informed By The Department Of Defense ... That Prior To Agent Mulder 'S Accident ... You May Have Been Contacted By A D.O.D. Employee . Yes , That 'S Right . And That He Gave You Classified Information . He Had Information About The Discovery Of What Agent Mulder Believed To Be An Alien Corpse . He , Uh- - He Said The Body Was Part Of A Hoax . He Provided Evidence Of This ? N-No Hard Evidence , Sir . No . Agent Scully , I Suggest You Tell Us Everything You Know . If You Have Any Knowledge Of This Man , You Should Speak Up Now . What Knowledge ? His Name . Whatever You 'Re Withholding , You 'Ll Be Asked To Explain Yourself Tonight ... At A Joint F.B.I. Panel I 'Ve Asked Assembled On This Matter . Is This The Man ? Michael Kritschgau ? Yes . [ Man On P.A. , Indistinct ] Hey ! How 'D You Get In Here ? Through The Front Door . You Can 'T Bypass Security . You Can When You Have The Card . Put That Away . Put It Away . You Knew My Apartment Was Being Surveilled . How ? [ Chuckles ] Come With Me . [ Lock Clicks ] I Was Followed From Your Apartment The Night We Spoke . Someone At The F.B.I. Is Involved . This Man Ostelhoff Was In Contact With Somebody- - How 'D You Get His Card ? I Found It On A Dead Man . You Know What That Is , What You Have In Your Hand ? It Gives You Level Four Clearance . Level Four Clearance . That Means I Get To Dine At The Officer 'S Club ? You Have Access To Everything . Things I Don 'T . Things I Can Only Tell You About . I Need To Know Who Did This To Scully . What You Can Have , What You May Find , - Is So Much More Than That . - What ? What You Want Most Desperately Of All . The Cure For Scully 'S Cancer ? [ Woman ] Federal Bureau Of Investigation . How May I Direct Your Call ? Communications Center , Please . One Moment . [ Line Ringing ] - Communications , Holly . - Holly , Dana Scully . Dana , I 'M So Sorry About What 'S Happened . I Just Heard . Holly , I Need Your Help On Something . I Was Hoping That You Could Help Me With Some Information . What Do You Need ? I Have Some Calls Placed At The Bureau On Consecutive Dates . On The Sixth , Seventh , Eighth , Ninth And Tenth . They Came In To The P.B.X. Operator . The First Was At 11 : 21 . The Next At 11 : 14 , 3 : 07 , 2 : 02 And 5 : 12 . They Would Have All Been Transferred To The Same Extension . - And You 'Re Looking For That Extension ? - Yes . I 'Ve Got Five Calls Matching Those Times And Dates ... Transferred To An Executive Level Extension . - Whose ? - It 'S A Branch Extension . It Could Be Anyone At That Level . Would Assistant Director Skinner Be At That Extension ? [ Keys Clacking ] Yes . Thank You . Okay . You Take Care Now , Dana . [ Phone Rings ] Yes ? [ Man ] Special Agent Scully ? - Yes . - This Is Dr. Vitagliano ... At The Paleoclimatology Department At American University . You Asked Me To Look Into These Ice Core Samples For You . Right . I 'M Sorry That I Haven 'T Gotten Back To You . You Might Want To Come Down Here To The Lab . There 'S Something I Know You 'Re Gonna Want To See For Yourself . What Am I Looking For ? Level Four Is A Biological Quarantine Wing . It Houses A Series Of Labs And Medical Facilities- - An Elaborate System For The Storage Of Vast Quantities Of Dna . Dna From Whom ? Virtually Every American Born Since 1945 . Every Immigrant , Every Indigenous Person ... Who 'S Ever Given Blood Or Tissue To A Government Doctor . This Is What I Was Telling You , Agent Mulder . This Is The Hoax Into Which You 'Ve Been Drawn . The Roots Go Back 50 Years To The End Of World War Ii , Playing On A Virulent National Appetite For Bogus Revelation ... And A Public Newly Fearful Of Something Called The Atom Bomb , The U.S. Military Command Began To Fan The Flames Of What Were Called " Flying Saucer Stories . " There Are Truths Which Can Kill A Nation . The Military Needed Something To Deflect Attention Away From Its Arms Strategy- - Global Domination Through The Capability Of Total Enemy Annihilation . The Nuclear Card Was Fine As Long As We Alone Could Play It . But The Generals And Politicos Knew That What They Could Not Win Was A Public Relations War . Those Photos From Nagasaki And Hiroshima ... Were Not Faces Americans Wanted To See In A Mirror . Oppenheimer Knew It , But We Silenced Him . When The Russians Developed The Bomb , The Fear In The Military ... Was Not For Safety At Home , But For Armistice And Treaty . The Business Of America Isn 'T Business , It 'S War . Since Antietam , Nothing Has Driven The Economy Faster . We Needed A Reason To Keep Spending Money . When There Wasn 'T A War To Justify It , We Called It War Anyway . The Cold War Was Essentially A 50-Year Public Relations Battle , A Pitched Game Of Chicken Against An Enemy We Not Much More Than Called Names . The Communists Called Us A Few Names Too . " We Will Bury You , " Khrushchev Said , And The Public Believed It . After What Mccarthy Had Done They Ate It With A Big Spoon . We Squared Off A Few Times In Cuba , Korea And Vietnam , But Nobody Dropped The Bomb , Nobody Dared . What Does Any Of This Have To Do With Flying Saucers ? [ Kritschgau ] The U.S. Military Saw A Good Thing In ' 47 When The Roswell Story Broke . The More We Denied It , The More People Believed It Was True . Aliens Had Landed . A Made-To-Order Cover Story For Generals Looking To Develop The National War Chest . They Opened Official Investigations With Names Like Grudge , Twinkle , Project Blue Book , Majestic 12 . They Brought In College Professors And Congressmen And Fed Them Enough Bogus Fact , Enough Fuzzy Photos And Eyewitness Accounts That They Believed It Too . They Even Hooked Doug Macarthur , For God 'S Sake . I Can 'T Tell You How Fortuitous The Timing Of It All Was . Do You Know When The First Supersonic Flight Was , Agent Mulder ? 1947 . Soon Every Experimental Aircraft Being Flown Was A U.F.O. Sighting . When The Abduction Stories Started Up , It Was Too Perfect . We 'D Almost Gotten Caught In Korea , An Ambitious Misstep . China And The Soviets Knew It . The U.N. Got All Heated Up At Us . Germ Warfare . We Were Accused Of Using It On The Koreans . Yeah . It Was Developmental Then , Nothing Like What We And The Russians Have Now . The Bioweapons Used In The Gulf War Were So Ingenious ... As To Be Almost Undetectable- - Developed Right In This Very Building . And All These Reports Of Abductions , You 'Re Saying They 'Ve All Been Lies . Not Lies , Exactly , But Citizens Taken Unsuspecting And Tested- - A Classified Military Project Above Top Secret And Still Ongoing . You 'Ve Heard The Recent Denials About Roswell , About The Military And C.I.A. ? What 'S Been The Effect ? Even Wilder And More Widespread Belief . The American Appetite For Bogus Revelation , Agent Mulder . But I 'Ve Seen Aliens . I 'Ve Witnessed These Things . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] You 'Ve Seen What They Wanted You To See . The Line Between Science And Science Fiction Doesn 'T Exist Anymore . What This Is About Is Control Of The Very Elements Of Life- - Dna . Yours , Mine , Everyone 'S . Then Why A Hoax ? Why Create Hard Evidence , An Alien Body That Could Be Disproved ? The Body You Found Was So Good , So Believable , That Only A Directed Scientific Examination ... Would Have Proven The Fraud . Scully Would Have Known . The Timing Of The Hoax Was Planned So That Agent Scully ... Wouldn 'T Be Alive To Do An Examination . You Went Along With All This . You Let Them Do This To Scully . I Paid The Price , Agent Mulder . When My Son Came Back Sick From The Gulf War , That Was My Retribution . I 'M Helping You Now , But Not Unselfishly . You Believe There 'S A Cure For Him In Here Too . I Have To Think There Is . Michael Kritschgau . May We Talk To You ? What About ? D.O.D. Is Detaining You For Questioning . Would You Come With Us , Mr. Kritschgau ? Sir . I Was Told That You Needed To See Me , That There Was Some Urgency . It Seems I 'Ve Been Left Out Of The Loop . Left Out ? You Were Watching Mulder . You Had A Man On Him . No One Bothered To Inform Me Of This . I Know Nothing About A Man . I Will Not Be Cut Out Like This . You Need My Expertise . Is This Being Run From D.O.D. ? If It Is , I 'M Unaware Of It . I 'Ve Always Kept Mulder In Check . I Put This Whole Thing Together . I Created Mulder . Agent Mulder Is Dead . Our F.B.I. Source Confirmed It This Morning . Mulder Killed Himself . Mulder Was An Asset . Without His Partner , We May Have Underestimated His Fragility . I Never Underestimated Mulder . I Still Don 'T . As You Had Asked , I 'Ve Tested Some Of The Cellular Material ... Found In The Ice Core Sample . Because We Couldn 'T Identify It As Either Plant Or Animal , Only As Some Kind Of Chimeric Hybrid , I Put Some Of The Individual Cells In Media ... Containing Fetal Bovine Serum , And The Cells Began To Divide . Well , Then They Were Animal Cells That You Found . They Are Not Classifiable . What Do You Mean ? You Said There Was Mitotic Cell Division . When The Cells Began To Divide , They Didn 'T Just Multiply . They Began To Go Through The Stages Of Morula , Blastula , Gastrula . They Began Somatic Development ? The Beginning Of A Life-Form . Growing Into What , I Don 'T Know . [ Mulder Narrating ] I Had Come Here Looking For Answers , Hoping Not Only To Lay Bare This Conspiracy Against The Country And The Men Behind It , But To Finally Learn The Truth About The Possibility ... Of Intelligent Extraterrestrial Life . Now With What I 'Ve Heard , My Beliefs Seem More And More Improbable . The Possibility Of A Cure For Scully Somewhere Inside These Walls ... Is My Only Hope . But If I Might Find It And Somehow Save Her , The Very Existence Of This Cure Would Mean With Certainty ... That I Have Believed In A Lie From The Start . [ Scully Narrating ] I Had No Way To Reach Agent Mulder ... To Tell Him What I Had Discovered- - An Unidentified Microscopic Life-Form Whose Very Existence ... Held The Possibility Of Revelation . Was This Organism- - Extracted From The Ice ... Which Had Entombed The Alien Corpse- - The Germ Cell That Might Give Proof Of Extraterrestrial Life ? Or Was It Just The Opposite ? The Scientifically Engineered Creation Of A Chimera- - An Unclassifiable Biological Product Designed To Set Up A Hoax , Manufactured To Create The False Beliefs ... That Have Long Driven Agent Mulder . I Now Began To Realize That The Answer To This Question ... Might Exist Within The Life-Form Itself- - Biological Proof Of Its Connection To The Cancer Invading My Body , To A Virus Living Inside This Organism ... To Which I Had Been Exposed During My Abduction Three Years Ago . I 'M Still Not Sure What You 'Re Hoping To Find Here . I Need To Do A Southern Blot ... To Run The Culture That You Showed Me Against My Own Dna . You Said That The Unclassified Cells You Looked At Under The E.E.M. Were Full Of Virus . Right . What Are You Looking For ? A Match . And I Need It Before 7 : 00 . Tonight ? Not Gonna Happen . Not Unless We Have A Blazing Hot Probe . It 'S Got To Happen . Everything In My Life Depends On It . What Are You Doing Here ? I Was Gonna Ask You The Same . No You Weren 'T . You Followed Me Here . Why Are You Following Me ? Is This More Dirty Work You 'Re Doing For The D.O.D. ? Why Don 'T You Tell Me Something ? Tell Me What You 'Re Doing Here . I Want An Answer From You . I Want An Answer From You ! This Isn 'T Your Job ! My Job Is To Direct The Agents Under Me . To Question Their Motives When They 'Re Lying About Investigations . To Take Steps To Cease Or Censure Those Actions . Your Lie Is On Record , Agent Scully . And What About Yours ? On My Desk I Have The Pathology ... And Forensics Reports For The Body Found In Mulder 'S Apartment . Now , You Have To Answer For Yourself In Five Hours . As You Compound The Lies , You Compound The Consequences For Them . All Lies Lead To The Truth . Isn 'T That Right ? And What About Your Lie , Agent Scully ? What Does It Lead To ? The Truth About The Men Behind What Happened To Me ; About My Abduction And The Tests ; About Being Exposed To Something Against My Will ; About Being Put On A Table And Having Something Implanted In Me ... And Having My Memory Stolen , Only To Have It Returned ... Along With A Disease That I Was Given . Is That Your Justification ? Is That What You 'Re Gonna Tell The Joint Panel ? Are You Afraid Of That ? Well , Considering The Dead Man ... In Mulder 'S Apartment Was Murdered In Cold Blood ... And You Willfully Misidentified Him , Yes , I Am Afraid . But I 'M Only Afraid For You . You 'Re Gonna Use That Against Me , Aren 'T You ? You 'Re Gonna Use Me As I 'Ve Been Used All Along , To Preserve The Lies . Where Is Agent Mulder ? Your Silence Won 'T Save You . Not With These People . And If You Lie , I Don 'T Know If Anything Can . Except Proof . [ Scully Narrating ] The Cruelest Ironies Are Those Consecrated ... By The Passage Of Time , Chanced And Occasioned By Shocking Discovery . I Had Joined Agent Mulder On The X-Files Because Of My Background In The Medical Sciences . My Assignment Was To Question His Work , To Debunk His Investigations ... And Rein Him Back Into The F.B.I. Mainstream . Now , As Fate Would Have It , I Am Calling On These Very Same Skills ... To Prove That He Has Been The Target Of A Scheme ... Orchestrated By Someone Close To Us In The F.B.I. ; Someone We Have Trusted Above All Others , Involved In A Highly Organized Plot ... To Keep A Dangerous Secret From The Light Of Day . I Could Only Guess At What Agent Mulder May Have Uncovered On His Own ; What He May Have Found To Confirm Or Deny ; What He Has Long Held To Be A Conspiracy To Control ... The Public Inquiry Into The Government 'S Knowledge ... And Contact With An Alien Race Or Races . If He Had Hoped , As I Do , To Learn The Identity Of Those Who Sought To Destroy Us , I Had , With The Discovery Of This Unidentified Microorganism , What Could Amount To Forensic Evidence . Hard And Undeniable Genetic Evidence ... Of A Connection Between The Conspirators ... And The Cancer Which Has Now Metastasized In My Bloodstream . [ Scully Narrating ] I Have Few Short Hours To Conduct These Tests ... Before I Must Appear Before An F.B.I. Panel To Explain Myself . And As I Am Ready To Lie To Them About Agent Mulder , I Am Also Ready To Confront Them With Proof- - Proof Extracted From This Tiny Organism ... That Could Blow Open A Conspiracy Of Global Consequence . [ Mulder Narrating ] If Agent Scully And I Had Been Led To Believe The Conspiracy ... Meant To Destroy Us Has Its Roots In The Department Of Defense , That Fact Seems All But Irrefutable Now . I Have Gained Entry To A Large Storage Facility By A Hallway ... Connecting Underground To The Pentagon . On Hundreds Of Rows Of Shelves Are Materials That Reveal Nothing To Me ... Of A Cure For Scully 'S Cancer . And Now , As I Have Reached The Terminus Of This Space , What Appears To Be An Old And Antiquated Filing System Seems My Only Hope ... Of Finding What This Man Kritschgau Has Assured Me Exists . If His Own Desperate Search For His Son 'S Cure Has Eluded Him , I Now Share His Desperation ... That Among These Drawers Is A Sign , A Glimmer , Some Small Confirmation That The Journey Which Has Brought Me Here ... Has Not Been In Vain . [ Ringing ] - Yes ? - I Had Orders To Contact You ... In The Event Scott Ostelhoff Entered The Building . Is He There ? His Key Card Was Scanned Through The Level Four Entrance . He Used The Subterranean Access To Breach The Pentagon . Are You Sure It 'S Him ? I Can 'T Ascertain That . Do You Want Me To Apprehend Him ? Don 'T Do Anything . I 'M On My Way . [ Scully Narrating ] If My Work With Agent Mulder Has Tested ... The Foundation Of My Beliefs , Science Has Been And Continues To Be My Guiding Light . Now I Am Again Relying On Its Familiar And Systematic Methods ... To Arrive At A Truth- - A Fact That Might Explain The Fate That Has Befallen Me . An Investigation That Began Without , Now Turning Within . Taking Cellular Material From The Unidentified Life-Form ... And Isolating A Virus Contained Within It , Then Matching The Dna From This Virus ... Against That Which I Believe Has Caused My Cancer . I Hope A Picture Will Develop . A Picture That Might Confirm My Darkest Suspicions ... About The Source Of This Disease Invading My Body , In Hope Of Providing Evidence That Its Cause Is Not Without Blame ... Even Though Its Cure Remains Unknown . If Science Serves Me To These Ends , It Is Not Lost On Me ... That The Tool With Which I 'Ve Come To Depend On Absolutely ... Cannot Save Or Protect Me , But Only Bring Into Focus The Darkness That Lies Ahead . There It Is . I Don 'T Understand . My Dna Hybridized With The Viral Dna From The Cell Culture . But That Means ... The Material From The Ice Core Sample- - You 'D Have To Have Dna From The Unclassified Chimera Cells ... In Your Own Body . I Know . But How ? And How Did You Know ? I Believe That I Was Exposed To This Material , And It Is Responsible For Giving Me A Serious Illness . What Kind Of Illness ? One Which Cannot Be Cured . [ Mulder Narrating ] If I Did Indeed Have The Cure For Scully 'S Cancer , I Was Now As Dependent On Her As She Was On Me . As I Had Breached This Facility , I Needed To Find My Way Out To Safety ; Depending On Scully To Weave Her Story ; To Tell Her Tale ; To Make Them Believe The Lie . Agent Scully , Please Have A Seat . Thank You . Agent Scully , We 'Ve Had A Brief Discussion , But Will You Restate The Matter We 'Re Here To Put To Rest . Yes , Sir . Four Years Ago , Section Chief Blevins ... Assigned Me To A Project You All Know As The X-Files . As I Am A Medical Doctor With A Background In Hard Science , My Job Was To Provide An Analytical Perspective ... On The Work Of Special Agent Fox Mulder , Whose Investigations Into The Paranormal ... Were Fueled By A Personal Belief ... That His Sister Had Been Abducted By Aliens When He Was 12 . I Come Here Today , Four Years Later , To Report On The Illegitimacy Of Agent Mulder 'S Work . That It Is My Scientific Opinion ... That He Became , Through The Course Of These Years , A Victim- - A Victim Of His Own False Hopes ... And Of His Belief In The Biggest Of Lies . You Were Contacted By A Man Who Claimed He Worked For The Department Of Defense , A Michael Kritschgau , Who Told You That Mulder Had Been Taken In By A Hoax . - Yes , Sir . - [ Door Opening ] He Told Me A Story Which Detailed Point-By-Point ... The Systematic Way In Which Agent Mulder ... Had Been Deceived And Used , And How I As His Partner Had Been Led Down The Same Path- - Losing A Family Member Due To My Allegiance ... And Contracting A Fatal Disease Which I Was Being Told Was Engineered ... By The Men Who Were Responsible For Agent Mulder 'S Deception . [ Blevins ] Were You Able To Convince Agent Mulder Of These Facts ? [ Scully ] What I Couldn 'T Tell Agent Mulder- - What I Had Only Just Learned Myself- - Was That The Cancer Which Had Been Diagnosed In Me ... Several Months Earlier Had Metastasized , And The Doctors Told Me Short Of A Miracle ... It Would Continue To Aggressively Invade My Body ... Advancing Faster Each Day Towards The Inevitable . I 'Ll Have Security Stop Him At The Entrance . No , It 'S Okay . Let Him Go . Early This Morning ... I Got A Call From The Police ... Asking Me To Come To Agent Mulder 'S Apartment . The Detective Asked Me- - He Needed Me To Identify A Body . Agent Scully- - Agent Mulder Died Late Last Night ... From An Apparent Self-Inflicted Gunshot Wound To The Head . [ Door Opens ] Agent Scully , These Accusations That You 'Ve Made- - - You 'Ve Been Given A Disease . - Yes , Sir . They 'Re Extremely Serious Charges . Yes , Sir . But I Have Proof ... Against The Men Behind This ... Of The Lies That I Believed . What I Have Here Is Proof Undeniable ... That The Men Who Gave Me This Disease Were Also Behind The Hoax , A Plot Designed To Lead To Agent Mulder 'S Demise , And To My Own , Planned And Executed By Someone In This Room . What I Have Here ... Is Scientific Evidence- - You . Somebody Get A Doctor . [ Electronic Beep ] What ? What Is It ? It 'S Deionized Water . It 'S Nothing More Than That . [ Child ] I Made This !

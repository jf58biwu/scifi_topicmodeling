 We interrupt this program for a breaking news bulletin . 90 miles and counting- - that 's how far officers- - of the Nevada highway patrol have pursued the blue car on your screen . In a wild chase right through the heart of Elko at speeds approaching 100 miles an hour . Live on the scene in Carlin is Chuck Pickering in the Fox 11 news chopper . Chuck , what can you tell us ? Benjamin , we 're heading west following route 766 , where it feeds off the I-80 . Now , just under an hour ago , troopers attempted to pull over the blue car- - which we understand is stolen . That occurred on the 80 , east of Wells . Now , since then , this driver has stopped for nothing and nobody . Any word yet on who the driver is ? None at this time . What we do think , though and what we 've passed on to the Highway Patrol- - is that from our vantage point we 've seen another person in that car . See , right there . A hand . It just moved . See , in the back seat ? Now , we could possibly have a hostage situation here . And , obviously , the sooner they bring this vehicle to a stop ... Unit six , ready at milepost 13 . Coming your way , six . Well , that did the trick . The automobile seems to be coming to a stop . Chuck , what did they just use there ? It looked to be a special tire-puncturing chain . And now the officers are approaching the car . One of them has opened the door , and he has hold of the suspect . He 's pulling him out . He doesn 't seem to have a weapon . He may not be armed but from our vantage point , it looks like he doesn 't want to get out of that car . Vicky ! Vicky ! Please get it out of my head . Vicky ! Vicky ! No ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Vicky ! No ! Let me go ! I got to go ! Vicky ! No ! ... Hostage appears to be okay . The Highway Patrol has her now . But Chuck , it looks like that driver is still fighting . Yes . He 's definitely putting up a bit of a fight . He seems to be a man with a few choice words on the subject as you can see . They 're trying to restrain him . I tell you what . We 're going to move back and try to get a wider angle . See , there 's the woman ... What the hell ? She 's ... Vicky ! Vicky ! There , see ? She 's banging her head against the window . - What the hell just happened ? - CUT ! CUT ! CUT ! Yeah ? Uh , Virgil Nokes ? I 'm Agent Scully . This is Agent Mulder . We 're with the F.B.I. Jehovah 's Witness ? No , sir . Federal Bureau of Investigation . But we do have a free copy of " The Watchtower " for you if you 'd like . Uh , sir , this is just a routine check but , uh , we understand that you recently placedan order for ... 5,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertilizer . Oh , you people . Come on in . - Sugar beets . - Excuse me ? I grow sugar beets . I figure I got better things to do with my fertilizer than going ... around blowing government buildings sky high . Yeah . Well , as we said , sir this is just routine . So routine , it numbs the mind . I got my AG card and my papers 'round here somewhere . Help me look for them , will you ? ... As we reported earlier a wild police pursuit ... ended in tragedy this morning with the death of a 36-year-old female hostage . This was the scene west of Elko , Nevada , one hour ago ... - Hey , Scully , take a look at this . - ... died mysteriously while in custody . We once again want to warn our viewers this footage is extremely graphic . Now the hostage is still inside the car . It appears that she is banging her head against the window ... At this time , highway patrol officials are refusing ... to identify the woman or to speculate on how she died . Though they do stress it was not the result of a gunshot . A preliminary Coroner 's report is not expected for a day or more . Meanwhile residents of Northern Nevada who first witnessed ... Thank you , Captain . That 's no problem . We 'd be happy to help . - Mm-hmm . - We 'll be happy to help what ? See you soon . Mulder , we 're not going to Nevada . Come on , Scully . Just one quick side trip . No . Sorry , Mulder . We have a whole new assignment . Running down people that buy fertilizer ? This is scut work , bozo work- - This is the F.B.I. equivalent of being made to wear an orange jumpsuit ... and pick up trash by the side of the highway- - they mean to humiliate us . Look , Mulder , like it or not , humiliated or not , we 're on domestic terrorism now and , yes , this is ... This is a punishment ... but if we want to get back to where we want to be we have to follow orders . We can 't freelance . You saw that news report . What did you make of that ? I think that the obvious assumption is that the woman was shot , regardless of what the police say . Maybe it was a sniper . In the words of their captain " she just sort of popped . " And what about this guy who supposedly tried to take her hostage , her husband ? Looked to me like he was trying to warn the cops before she died . Now , the sun will rise in America tomorrow regardless of whether ... or not we 're at yet another farm investigating yet another enormous pile of doo-doo . We can be in and out in a day . Nobody has to know . S-s-somebody ! Please ! It 's starting ! Somebody ! Why can 't we see him ? Well , hopefully later . He pitched quite a fit in his cell- - screaming a bunch of nonsense that we were going to kill him the way we killed his wife . You know , he 's not a particularly stable individual . Captain , he may need medical attention . He 's getting it . Our doctor 's with him now . I mean , after whatever happened to his wife- - which I 'd like to stress was not our fault- - we 're not going to take any chances , you know ? Patrick Garland Crump of Montello , Nevada . 40-year-old roofer . No history of mental illness . No prior record . He 's got one now . That Barracuda he jacked on the Utah state line ? He yanked some teenager out of the window threw his wife in back and took off . Excuse me . What do you think ? I 'm thinking while we 're here I might take a look at Mr. Crump 's wife . I 'm going to stay here and see if I can see Crump . Captain , where 's Montello ? Little town right here . So that 's where it started . That 's Crump 's home . Then he headed east in this direction ... on the 5 about ten miles to the Utah border where he stole the car . You got it . Yeah , but you caught up with him in Wells . Where 's that ? - That 's here . - So that means that he started ... off in this direction . Then all of a sudden , he turned around and he headed west ... To Wells . Why ? The former Vicky Jenkins Crump . I 'm hoping you can tell me what I 'm looking at ' cause this is a new one on me . There 's no gunpowder residue ... No carbon stippling . There seems to be no evidence of an entry wound whatsoever . There is none . It 's all exit , but how that could be ... ? I 'm finding what look like fragments of petrous bone embedded ... in the remaining portion of the auditory canal . In fact , I seem to be looking straight through to the osseous labyrinth or what 's left of it . It 's almost like a little bomb went off in her ear . - May I ? - Please . There seems to be some kind of tumefaction within the lateral sinus . Patient is a white male , age 40 , no known history ... No , he just went rammy on me . Accucheck is normal . We did a narcan push ... but he keeps getting worse . Okay . I.V. beta blocker and topical nitro . I don 't know if you 're going to get to talk to this fella after all . Five 's a crowd , buddy . Whoa . Something must have worked . Heart rate 's dropping . BP 's headed south . I don 't understand ; what 'd you just do ? Hell if I know but I 'll take it . Oh , God . Come on , Mulder . Hey , you , out ! This lab is quarantined . Go ! - Mulder ? - Yeah . Mulder , it 's me . You know how to pick them , I 'll tell you that . Look , I have no idea what killed this woman but I have to assume it 's communicable . Yeah . Another body has been found just outside of Montello- - same apparent cause of death- - some kind of massive aneurysm or rupture . - Uh-huh . - And Mulder , I 've called the C.D.C. They 're on their way but Patrick Crump may be infected . So you need to quarantine his cell and make sure that anybody ... who 's had any close contact with him whatsoever has been quarantined as well , and that means you , Mulder . You 're to have no contact with him whatsoever . Mulder ? Well , that 's going to be a little tough , Scully . Drive . Where are they ? Route 789 , heading west . We 're keeping them in visual plus ... we 're in phone contact ... not to mention the strings we pulled to keep this off local TV . - Where are they going ? - Crump won 't say . Wherever it is , though , he ain 't getting there . - Roadblock ? - We 'll shut him down east of Tuscarora- nice , clean , remote space we can own . - All right . I want the C.D.C. on-site . I want the officers making the arrest to be wearing level ... two or better anti-contamination suits . I want the car decontaminated . I want Agent Mulder and Crump decontaminated . - I want them quarantined separately . - You got it . Crump says that if we don 't pull back our escort he 's going to shoot your partner . You just leave me the hell alone ! Now ! How about if we just pull over and let me out , too , huh ? - I must be cramping your style . - Just ... Shut up . It 's you people . - Figures . - What figures ? Shut up . Hey ! No ! No ! That is ... so stupid , Crump . - Shut up . - That is so stupid . You shut up and drive , you understand ? - What are you doing ? - What ? What am I doing ? - What the hell are you doing ? - I 'm composing a sonnet . - I 'm slowing down for a light . - Go ! Go ! Crump ? Is this what happened to your wife ? This same thing ? If you stop moving , you die ? I think I saw this movie . Why didn 't you tell anybody ? Why didn 't you tell the police ? Oh , geez . I don 't know how well you recall the last 30 seconds ... but your life is in my hands regardless of whether or not you hold that gun . - It 's right here , boy . - Just tell me everything you know . - That may be the only way I can help you . - You people put me here ! Shut up . I 'm guessing we got two or three miles before the roadblock . - What roadblock ? I got rid of the cops . - Check your window . Oh , God . Men , if we get stopped ... Subject 's turning off 789 about a mile east of your position ... and is heading north on a fire road . Looks like he 's going to miss you . Say what ? - What 's the report , Captain ? - They lost them . They were last seen on a forestry service road . Trees were too thick . Our helicopter lost sight of them . How did Crump know to avoid the roadblock ? That 's the question . I was hoping your Agent Mulder would manage to steer him toward it , but ... Maybe Agent Mulder steered him away from it . - Why would he do that ? - Maybe he knew something that we don 't . Agent Scully , I 've got the cell cultures from the second victim . Anything ? So far , I 'm seeing no evidence of infection in either victim . So then , we 're in the clear ? No , no . Not necessarily . I mean , something killed these people . Sorry . Excuse me . Scully . Agent Scully ? , Please hold for Assistant Director Kersh . - Agent Scully . - Yes , sir . How is Southern Idaho ? Agent Scully ? Southern Idaho ? Think carefully . Sir , I am not currently in the state of Idaho . No , you 're not . In the course of prosecuting our assignment in Idaho , Agent Mulder and I came across a situation in Nevada ... which we both strongly felt needed our immediate attention . I eagerly await your report . In the meantime , agents of our Las Vegas field office will be available ... to assist you in tracking down Agent Mulder . Thank you , sir . Oh , Agent Scully ... I think , at this point I want to see him alive even more than you do . Can I see that for a minute ? This man worked at Silver State Power reading meters . Yes . What if he read the meter at Vicky Crump 's place ? Crump ? Crump , what else can you tell me about what 's happening to you ? Mr. Crump . You call me by my last name , you say " mister " in front of it . - " Mister . " I got you . - Not Crump . Mr. Crump . I can think of something else I 'd like to call you . I could put " mister " in front of that , too if you 'd like . You know , what kind of name is Mulder , anyway ? What is that , like ... - like , Jewish ? - Excuse me ? Jewish ... It is , right ? It 's Mr. Mulder to you , you peanut-picking bastard . Now , Mr. Crump what can you tell me about what 's happening to you ? - What ? - You 're going ... - The wrong way . - What do you mean so " The wrong way " ? - Go this ... Go this way ! - I can 't ... I can 't go ... I can 't go left . There 's only trees there . Crump . It 's west . Huh , west ? You got to head west . It 's just like you did with your wife . You took her and you headed west . It 's not just motion ; it has to be in one direction . Is that right ? What the hell happened to you ? Okay , I want a thorough search with an eye to the usual disease vectors . You got it . I think we 're witnessing the same pathology here . We need to get a blood sample . Let 's go . Try to hold him still ! Hang on . Let me sedate him . One more time . You woke up this morning ... then what ? We have been through this . You woke up this morning but you didn 't go to work . Why ? It was raining . You don 't shingle in the rain . I was up at 6 : 00 , reading the paper . What was your wife doing ? Cooking , man . Breakfast . She was just putting breakfast on the table when the ... - You looked up . - I looked up , and I saw that she had this nosebleed she didn 't even know she had . - What caused it ? - What do I ... I 'm ... I 'm , like , Quincy ? How the hell should I know what caused it ? It just happened . Ten , 15 minutes later , she just ... Starts getting sick . Said she got a headache that just ... keeps getting worse and worse . Then she starts ... screaming . I didn 't know what the hell to do . I just , uh ... I got her in the truck and ... Taking her to the hospital ... but then it seemed like the faster we went the better she 'd do ... but just as soon as I try to slow down or stop ... I 'm sorry about your wife . Sure , you are ... You and the rest of your Jew F.B.I. - Crump ... - Oh , yeah . You think I don 't know , huh ? You think I 'm just some ignorant pudknocker , don 't you ? But I get it , man ! I see what this is ! I am not sick and I do not have the flu . Vicky and me were just some kind of ... Government guinea pigs . - You think the government did this to you ? - Hell , yeah . Who else ? You see it all the time on the TV : they 're dropping Agent Orange , they 're putting radiation in little retarded kids ' gonads ... Oh , yeah . You sons of bitches sneaking around my woods at night- - I seen you . You think I don 't know ? Well , on behalf of the international Jewish conspiracy ... I just need to inform you that we 're ... almost out of gas . The trailer looks clean- - no readily apparent vectors . Dogs , housewives ... Whatever this thing is , it doesn 't discriminate . There are zoonotic pathogens which spread among species . Look at that . The Crumps have a neighbor . Hello ! Hello ? Doctor ? Hello ? Hello ? Oh , no . It 's ... It 's okay , ma 'am . It 's okay . - Who are you ? - It 's all right . I 'm sorry . Go away ! Go away ! It 's okay . It 's okay . Okay , Crump , we got about one more mile . I 'll make it fast . You ready ? Here goes nothing . Hey , turn on the pump ! Number four ! Three ! Number three ! Turn it on ! You got to pay before you pump , buddy ! Hey , dammit , that 's my car ! Where the hell do you think you 're going ? One deaf woman survives unscathed while everything else around her dies . Why ? What ... What are you doing ? The pathology of this thing ... It affects the inner ear ... and this area right here is ground zero . What if what we 're looking for is some kind of a sound ? Seriously ? Oh . Excuse me . - Scully . - It 's Van Gelder . Agent , I don 't know what the hell your partner 's thinking ... but not only is he actively evading my officers , now he 's stolen a car . - Come again ? - You heard right . He left behind a crazy note addressed to you . - You there ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah . Read it to me . " Crump sick ; will die if stopped same as wife . Must head west to keep alive . No roadblocks ! " Exclamation point . - This make any sense to you ? - Take him at his word . Let him through . Let him through ? Look , uh ... No offense , Agent Scully but how ' bout you run that by your superiors ' cause frankly , I think they 'll say different . I 'll take that under advisement . Agent Scully , again , I got to say I feel like we got a situation here that ... Faster . I 'm doing 70 . You got to go faster . It 's getting worse . Okay . Yeah , yeah . That 's good . Okay . Hey , uh ... The Jew stuff ? No offense . I mean , uh ... A man can 't help who he 's born to . That was an apology , right ? Gee , I don 't know if I can see to drive my eyes are tearing up so bad . Whatever , man . Why are you doing this ? - Why am I doing what ? - This . It 's not in your best interest to make me question that right now . How do I know you ain 't doing exactly what they want you to ? Hmm ? Driving me all around creation , experimenting on me ... How do I know it ain 't that ? I guess you don 't . I ain 't saying you are . I 'm just saying ... That 's no way to treat a man ... take away his dignity like that . It ain 't right . Better just to kill him . That 's all I 'm saying . Hey , you got to stay alive if you want to stick it to the government . If you die , you let them off the hook . Am I right ? - Huh ? - You 're right . You 're damn straight . We 'll figure this out . You 'd better figure quick . We 're running out of west . Lieutenant Breil ? My name is Dana Scully . I called in regard to the electrical equipment the Navy is maintaining ... - in the town of Montello . - Right . Listen , I don 't know if there 's ... been some miscommunication between you and your Washington office , but , uh ... - My Washington office ? - Yeah . I was under the impression that I 'd explained this to the F.C.C. ' s satisfaction . Oh , I 'm ... I 'm so sorry to make you run through it again , uh ... For my official report to the , uh ... To the F.C.C. Okay . At 6 : 17 yesterday morning during a test of our ground conduction radio system ... a situation arose in which our equipment experienced a brief power surge . That 's what interrupted television reception in the four-state area . However , steps have already been taken to insure this won 't happen again . The ground conduction radio- - th-that would be Project Seafarer ? The specifics of what we do here are classified , ma 'am . Sure , sure . Um ... Would you happen to know what effect such a surge might have on , uh ... On an organism ... Say , a ... Say , a human being ? - Theoretically speaking . - Theoretically speaking ? Well , that 's classified as well , ma 'am . - Crump ? - Mr. Crump . Mr. Crump ... What is it , Mr. Mulder ? Mulder , are you okay ? Yeah , aside from terminal cell phone withdrawal ... That , and I got to pee . Where are you ? I 'm just about to board a justice department jet ... Hopefully , I 'll overshoot you . - Headed where ? - I don 't know , Mulder . You tell me . I 'm guessing wherever the hell route 36 ends but we can 't stop , Scully . I 'm kind of at a loss as to what to do next . Well , I think I have a loose theory as to what caused this . - Well , lay it on me . - Okay . Mulder , you know what E.L.F. waves are ? Extremely low radio transmissions ? Yeah . It uses an antenna , like , 50 miles long . The military uses it to communicate with the trident submarines , Project Seafarer , Project Haarp . Well , Seafarer has an antenna array stretching beneath the edge of Patrick Crump 's property . Now , ELF fields have been shown to ... To produce biological effects in human tissue ... inducing electrical currents , altering chemical reactions . Not to mention that as a potential weapons application it 's been referred to ... as " electrical nerve gas " or may be behind the so-called " Taos Hum . " What if some overload some ... Some hum from this system ... could somehow match the resonant frequency of the human skull ? I mean , what if it could induce a like hum that could ... That could somehow exert a ... a rising pressure on the labyrinth of the inner ear in a sense shattering it ? But with constant movement somehow ameliorating that pressure making it bearable . - But why only westward movement ? - I don 't know , Mulder , I don 't know . I mean ... I mean , maybe it has to follow certain lines of force electrical or magnetic . The big question , Scully , is what do we do about it ? Well , I think I know , Mulder , but it 's nothing that Mr. Crump is going to like . We 'll be there . What ? Well , whether they did this to you intentionally or not , you were right . They did it to you . So , what do we ... what do we do ? Your one chance is that we meet my partner at the end of the highway . There , she will insert a long , large-bore needle into your inner ear ... hopefully relieving the pressure . Now , when we get there she 's going to have to work fast . She 's only going to have one chance . She 's not going to be able to use any anesthetic ... and it will probably leave you deaf . But I 'll live , right ? Well , that 's what it 's all about . All right , man . Let 's do it . Mr. Mulder , could you go a little faster , please ? - Just a little more is all I need . - Sure . Just a little bit faster . Get ready ! " Justice department jet : 2.6 turbine hours round trip at $ 1,400 an hour . Car rental- - over-mileage , out-of-state use penalties : $ 346 . Compensation to one Walter R. Duncan ... for unauthorized use of his 1968 Caprice station wagon : $ 500 . " Why don 't you bill me ? I 'll bill your partner instead . You too obviously relish the role of martyr . Okay . So are we done here ? Back to the bozo work investigating huge piles of manure ? You can always quit . - Sir , Agent Mulder has been through a lot . - And you apologize for him a lot . - I 've noticed that about you . - I 'm not apologizing for this . Because of his work , the D.O.D. is shutting down their antenna array in northeastern Nevada . Our participation in this case has saved lives . I don 't see you proving that . The Department of Defense admits no culpability whatsoever . Furthermore , they say the closing of the facility was coincidental . Right . Don 't misunderstand me , Agent . I don 't care if you and your partner saved a school bus ... full of doe-eyed urchins on their way to Sunday bible camp . You no longer investigate X-Files . You are done ... and the sooner you and Mulder come to recognize that , the better for both of you . Big piles of manure .

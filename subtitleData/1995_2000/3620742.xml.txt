 Mom ! Watch me . OK , Billy . Mom ! You 're not watching ! Mom ! Billy ? My little boy ! - Mom ! - Hi . Josh , I was just coming in . They know you 're supposed to wait . - They 're looking for you . - Who ? Who 's looking for me ? Hey , what is it ? Go look , Mom . Mrs Underwood . We tried to call you . You must 've already left . What is everyone staring at ? What is going on ? Billy ? My beautiful boy . I 'm just going to shine this light in your eyes , OK ? You 're doing great . Good . Nothing to it . - He won 't speak ? - No . Not even to his parents . - Are they here , his parents ? - They 've been here around the clock . I took his prints. it 's him . Boy should be a teenager by now , but look at him . - Explain to me how that can be . - l can 't say , Sheriff . I 'm just here to find out who took him . I talked to everyone at school . No one saw him come back , or how . The boy just come out of the blue . - Are those the case files ? - Yeah . Plenty more where those came from . There 's just not much in ' em . We never even had a suspect . Have them set ' em over there , would you ? Set those on the table . What we 've got here is a healthy seven-year-old boy who was born 17 years ago . A healthy boy who won 't speak . Excuse me ? Are you finished with Billy ? - Mr and Mrs Underwood ? - You 're with the fbi ? I 'm Agent Scully , this is Agent Doggett . We are investigating this case . It 's a miracle , isn 't it ? Mrs Underwood , whatever your son has been through , it has somehow affected his physical condition . So we 've been told by every doctor here . We just want to take him home . - After ten years , can we do that ? - Not yet . I want to talk to him first . How you doing , Billy ? My name 's John . I 'm gonna have a seat over here . is that OK ? is that all right ? Billy , I want you to know that you 're not alone . I 've talked to lots of other boys and girls who 've been hurtjust like you . Sometimes when they talk about it , the hurt starts to go away . You wanna talk about it , Billy ? Maybe you think bad things happened to you because you 've been a bad boy , but I 'm here to tell you , that 's not true . The bad guy is the one who took you away . And it 's up to you and me to get the bad guy . See , cos as big and tough as I am , I can 't do it alone. I need your help . Can you tell me about him , Billy ? What 's his name ? What did he look like ? You remember this , don 't you , Billy ? Would you like to have it back ? What is he doing ? All I want is his name . Who the hell do you think you are ? He 's only a little boy . Mr Underwood ... - You think this is a game ? - A serious game . One we have to win . Have you really worked kid cases before ? Child abductions ? I worked the Child Abduction Task Force . This kid can help us . This is a biological impossibility . That 's your area of expertise. I just want to put the person who did this out of business . Billy just didn 't show up . He got away , or was let go . If he can talk , he can tell us by who , or he can look at photos and point to the man who did this , so this doesn 't happen again . You are ignoring the fact that he is still seven years old . " Failure to thrive . " lsn 't that the term ? Aren 't there diseases that delay puberty and so on ? I told you . He 's not sick . Good . Then he can talk . We 're home , honey . Safe at home . I 'm going to go pay the sitter , Doug . You bring Billy in . Are you glad to be home , Billy ? A lot 's new here , son . You have a younger brother now . Josh . You see that big dog out there with him ? That 's Sparky . Would you like to go play with him ? Sparky ! Get down ! What 's gotten into you ? - Knock it off ! - What 's the matter , Doug ? The dog just went off . Sparky , what is wrong with you ? Come on , let 's go . Honey , it 's all right . He just didn 't recognize you , that 's all . He 's a nice dog . He just doesn 't realize that you 're part of the family . But you are , Billy . And we 're just so glad that you 're finally home . You going to sleep here , too ? - What time is it ? - l spoke with the doctors who treated Billy . - l looked at his charts . - Did you find something ? Yes and no . What showed up is that Billy is the same boy who was taken ten years ago . - We know that . - No . I mean the same boy . He has no cavities . He has no tooth decay . He still has four baby teeth he 's never lost . He had a routine blood test six weeks before he disappeared in 1990 . His cell counts , his enzymes , his hormone levels , they are all exactly the same as they were ten years ago . - How can that be possible ? - lt 's medically impossible . So what 's the punch line ? Where are you saying he 's been ? There are X-Files cases that describe similar paranormal findings . Alien abductees who came back with anomalous medical stats . These words , " anomalous , " " supernatural , " " paranormal . " They purport to explain something by not explaining it. lt 's lazy . I 'm not saying that I can explain it , Agent Doggett . But this is definitely not normal . I went back to the witnesses at the crime scene , to this guy Ronald Purnell . - He was detained but dismissed as a suspect . - What 's your interest in this guy ? He 's a high-school dropout , convicted of possession , arson and shoplifting since 1990 . These are juvenile records . These are sealed by the court , Agent Doggett . - We 're not supposed to have these . - We 're at a standstill . - And you 're breaking the law . - l want to catch this guy , whatever it takes . We love you so much , Billy . It 's so good to have you back , to be tucking you in . Sleep tight . - What does that mean ? - You 're blind to what 's going on . Ten years we prayed for this . Every night we prayed to God . - l prayed for our son . He 's not the boy I knew . - What do you expect him to be ? - They told us this will take time . - Even Josh is afraid of him . - He is nothing to be afraid of . - l wish I could believe that . How can you sit here and say these things to me ? Anybody in there ? Hello ? Ronald Purnell ? Yeah . Can I talk to you ? Can you come out , and we could have a conversation ? - ls this about my probation ? - lt 's about a boy named Billy Underwood . You know that name ? Ring a bell ? - No . - lt does to everybody else in this area . He vanished from a school fair you were at ten years ago . You remember him now ? Yeah , I remember him . - You think he 'd remember you ? - Me ? You . Your face . You 're a trip , man . You know that ? This has nothing to do with being stoned or violating your probation . All I 'm asking is that we go see Billy . See what he says . - See what he says where ? - Where ? Wherever . Wherever you want. I 'll make sure he 's there . You 're not making sense , dude . Just leave me alone . Billy ? Honey , are you here ? - What ? What are you doing ? - Joshy ! Are you hurt ? No . You 're bleeding ! Where did that come from ? I don 't know . Billy . Billy , honey , what are you doing here ? Please , Billy . Answer me . Just got word back from the lab . Ran the blood twice . No doubt about it - it 's the little boy 's . - l thought you said he wasn 't cut . - You 're misunderstanding . It 's the other son I 'm talking about - Billy , the boy who was kidnapped . - That doesn 't make sense . - Billy wasn 't cut either . No , but he definitely handled the knife . His prints are on it . - Where 'd he even get it ? - His father 's never seen it before . He 's no hunter . Never cleaned an animal , which is about all a knife like that 's good for . Except for killing , of course . Well , I hate to say this , but I think the best thing for Billy and his family is if he 's removed to an institution to be observed by people experienced in these things . You mean remove him ? Take him away ? After all his family 's been through ? This is not a normal child , Agent Doggett , and this is not a normal act . You make it sound like he 's possessed . Call the exorcist . He 's a kid who 's been through who knows what kind of hell . How do you know he 's not trying to communicate something ? And what 's the message ? Yes , he 's a kid , Agent Doggett . You 're right . He 's a kid who materialized out of thin air , unaged . Do you not somehow recognize how strange this is ? Did anybody notice this ? This symbol ? Yeah . Yeah , I was going to mention that to you , cos it 's kinda weird . - Weird how ? - We tried everything to find that boy , and who abducted him - went so far as to bring in a police psychic , ten years back . - Came up with that very same symbol . - How exactly did he come up with it ? She . Sharon Pearl . - Couldn 't say how it came to her . - l 've seen this symbol before , too . You have ? I 'll be damned . We love you so much , Billy . Whatever happened , we wanna put it behind us . Be a family again . And if you could help us to understand what you 're going through , we could move forward . No , we 're just going to see a doctor , someone you might want to talk to . We 're coming right back . Nothing 's gonna happen . Mommy won 't let anything happen to you . I just want you to get the help you need so we can all live here together and be happy . OK ? Come on , sweetie . I 'll take him , Doug , if it 's such a strain on you . If you think a shrink has the answers , fine . I just don 't want this to ruin our other son 's life in any way . Billy ? Where 's Billy ? Dad ! I don 't want no trouble . Whatever you 're doing , do it somewhere else . You ever get off your lazy ass to do anything but hassle me ? Watch your mouth. I got company comin ' , and he won 't take your lip . Who ? Tell him to stay out of my face . - Get away from me . - Where you goin ' , weirdo ? You steal those clothes off a fat man , or did you just shrink ? You gonna get your butt in this trailer , traveling ' man ? Yeah . All depends on what you got in mind . Testing , one , two , three ... This is great . Now I 've got a psychic who 's gonna tell me what 's wrong with my son . I understand your misgivings , but perhaps you can look at this as just another avenue . - An avenue to what ? - We 're gonna solve this case . We 're gonna find out who did this to your son . And then what ? What am I left with ? A kid who stabs knives into his brother 's mattress ? You don 't know the half of it . He gives everyone but his mother the creeps . I just know that this is gonna tear your family apart . And you can 't let it . You 've got to save them from the damage this can do . I 'll be happy to save what I can . Come on , Josh . Let 's go . - ls this going to happen ? - Shouldn 't you be telling us that ? You 're no doubt confused , Agent Doggett . I take psychic readings , not see through walls . Sorry to keep you waiting . Mrs Underwood , I 'm Sharon Pearl . I consulted on your son 's disappearance back in 1990 . And you 're Billy . Ms Pearl ? Are you OK ? There are very powerful forces at work here . Working through this boy . Drawing him to his brother . I feel this force ... I feel this force ... coming through you . You lost someone just like Billy . What 's happening to her ? My God . Hey , fartknocker . Where are you goin ' in such a big hurry ? What 's the matter ? Got something in your ears ? Don 't touch me , Cal . Listen to him . No wonder he wears them baggy britches . Our Ronnie 's a big man now . Your old lady said the cops came and talked to you . I am talking to you , not the side of your head . Better mind your p 's and q 's , Jones . Or I 'm gonna tell them what you did to that little boy . I 'm gonna tell them what you got buried out there in the woods . What 's going on with you two ? Talkin ' about cars . Well , they 've got her stabilized , and it looks like she 's gonna be OK . - lf you 're at all curious about her condition . - l 'd be more curious if I believed it . Believed what ? The act . - You think that was an act ? - lt 's pretty standard fare , isn 't it ? Float a few choice revelations as if they came from on high , roll around the floor . You saw that symbol appear on her forehead . It 's a damn good trick . Don 't ask me how she does it . - Agent Scully , please . - No. I think you ought to hear this . Now listen to it backwards . What 's that ? It 's a child singing . Lyrics . You hear that , under the noise ? - Now ... - What 's he doing here ? Get away from me . Ronnie , open up the car ! Stop the car ! Agent Scully , he 's got Billy ! Get out of the car ! Now ! Don 't move , Ronnie . Where 's Billy ? I thought you said Billy was in the car . Where 's Billy ? I 'm gonna go pay . You want anything ? Josh , are you OK , buddy ? Dad , can I ... ? Mister ? Pony ? Hey , pony ? Hey , there you are . Help ! - Count to ten , Agent Doggett . - He took Billy . He couldn 't have . How you gonna back that up , with Billy missing ? Not five minutes earlier I saw him enter his home with his mother . I saw him riding in the car with Ronnie . Why else would Ronnie take off like he did ? It 's impossible , like everything else about this case . Like how Billy can be in his home one minute , and in Ronnie 's car the next . - Everything about this case is impossible . - This kid is the key . I 've been saying that from the beginning , and I 'll say it now . Agent Doggett , Agent Scully , I got bad news on top of worse . Josh , the Underwoods ' other little boy , has disappeared . I 'm notjokin ' , not even close . I got the parents out here now . I 've gotta talk to this kid , Agent Scully . I 'm absolutely sure . Have a seat , Ronnie . I know what you 're gonna ask . But I got no answer . Well , there can be only one answer , right ? I mean , why else did you go to the house ? You went there for Billy , to get him back . - No . - You had him in your car . - l don 't know how he got there . - Then why go to the house at all ? Because I didn 't believe you . Mom ! Didn 't believe what ? What 's so hard to believe , Ronnie ? - You said I could talk to him . - You needed to . After all those years , you couldn 't live without him . You wanted him back . All those years , Ronnie . All those years . Where 'd you keep him ? - Man , you don 't understand . - You were sorry you let him go . No , I ... I couldn 't let him go . - Who else knew about him ? Your mom ? - No . - Where 'd you keep him ? - l didn 't . - What did you do to him ? - l didn 't do anything . I took care of him . I sang to him , so he wouldn 't be afraid . Afraid of who ? Who was he afraid of , Ronnie ? Somebody else involved ? Somebody else make you do it ? He take that other kid , too ? Billy 's brother ? He take him ? You 're afraid of him , too . You 're a victim , just like those other kids. ls that right ? You , me , Billy . This is our chance , man . What 's his name ? fbi ! Cal Jeppy ! Come out ! It 's OK , Josh . You 're OK . We 're not gonna hurt you . Agent Doggett ? He 's on the run . He 's in the woods ! Watch your fire ! There may be another boy ! Down on your knees ! - Hands in the air ! Where 's the kid ? - He 's in the trailer . Other kid ! - There 's no other kid . - Billy Underwood ! There 's no other kid . Get this man in cuffs . Read him his rights . The kid 's over ... I don 't believe it . OK . The clothes , the age and condition of the bones , the location of the grave . There is no doubt that that is Billy Underwood 's skeleton in that grave . We spent time with this boy . Doctors took his blood . You examined him . I can 't accept it . I can 't believe we 're asking them to . I know . But the forensic evidence is going to come out , and what then ? - What if I 'm right ? - What do we do ? - We move on , let it go , case closed ? - l know where you are with this . I have been there . You 're feeling that you 've failed , that you have to explain this somehow . - And maybe you can . - Not if that 's Billy 's body , I can 't . Maybe that 's explanation enough . That that 's not Billy 's brother in that grave , too . That that man who did this is never going to be able to do it again . Isn 't that what you wanted , Agent Doggett ? Don 't ask me to believe that this is some kind ofjustice from beyond the grave . All I 'm saying is that maybe you succeeded , whether you 're willing to see that or not .

 Inthe21stcentury , thepopulation ofthe Earth kept increasing . Our new government announced a policy to prevent it . It prohibited free sex between men and women . Only people selected by computer could have sex to make offspring . All sex is controlled under the government 's management system . But one woman came out to fight against the system . She acted very efficiently and organized a resistance group . And the group became a threat to the new government . The new government planned to assassinate her , as leader of the group . So they aimed for the 20th century . Hey ! What 's she doing here ? She might be excited from watching us . Hey , girl , what are you doing ? Do you want to join us ? You will catch a cold without any clothes . Why don 't you come inside and join us ? Hey ! Who are you ? Don 't come near me ! What are you trying to do ? No ! Stop ! Give me your clothes . This is the only thing I have left . W ... What ? No ! Stop ! No ! Stop ! Automatic Stroke . Electric Moan Brush . Z Lotion . You are the first customer who bought so much stuff .

If I give it to you for free ... can you tell your friends about this ? You get me ? I 'll tell my friends . Thankyou very much . Well , how would you like to pay ? With my body . See you . Hey , what are you doing ? ! . I 'm sorry ! Yes . Are you Kota Sera ? Yes , I am . Why ? I guess it 's still there . Wh ... What are you doing ? I 'm sorry . Who are you ? I 'm Kaoru . I came here to tell you something . Impotent ? Why do I have to become impotent ? To make your body incapable ofhaving children . Then your daughter ... the leader of the resistance , is never born ! And the resistance group will never be organized ! The new government thought this up . I see . And they sent a woman cyborg , T69 Terminatrix , to this time . She can destroy men 's ability to perform by having sex with them ! She 's a terrible cyborg ! Are you listening to me ? ! . Ah , yeah . I followed the Terminatrix and came here to protect you ! The future ofhumanity depends on your penis ! The Terminatrix might be here already . She looks just like a human girl . Even I don 't know who she is . The only clue is ... Wait a minute ! Mr. Sera ! We just got off from work . Let 's go and have a drink together . I have to go home now . - Don 't say things like that ! - Mywife will start to complain . Just hold on , both ofyou ! We 'll do it next time . I 'll come again . I 'm sorry . Oh well , then let 's go , just the two of us ! The usual place . Here we go ! Your omelet is ready ! Yes , yes .

I 'm really tired of it ! That 's true ! My neck became very stiff recently . Hey , I can give you a neck massage . As much as you 'd like ! Really ? And over here too ! What are you doing ? Why are you here ? She looked up my skirt . You have to be careful of the woman who has no underwear . Is she your friend ? No , not at all ! Hey , Kota ! We 'll get in trouble ifyou bring high school students here ! It 's not what you think , Boss ! He 's right , Boss . Well , anyway , why don 't you come back here afteryou graduate ? - Let 's go home ! - No , you don 't understand . - No ! - Let 's go ! - Sorry it has to be this way . - Please ! I said no ! Come back afteryou grow up ! See you ! I didn 't think Kota would ever deal with a high school student . What are you talking about ? Doyou think I would have sex with a kid ? It will never happen . Master , what do you want ? Kota ... I know you 're working here just to pick up girls . You 're still young . I didn 't want to be mean , so I overlooked it . But ifyou start flirting with a high school girl in my bar again ... I 'll fire you ! Understand ? Yes . Are you sure ? No , wait ! No ! I just got married . My wife is very scary when she gets mad . Call me Queen . My Queen . He came to our bar today . He 's got the same name as mine . Yes . But he looked a little nerdy . He has the same name , but he 's totally different from you . Well , in this case , the Kanji ofyour name , " Kota , " has an erotic translation . Well , Kota is a person who likes to have sex . This is very true . Your joke is bad . Kota means copulating . What was my best record so far ? Six times . Well , I 'll have to make a new record tonight ! Let 's work hard ! Don 't destroy me ! You 're late . I was waiting foryou . Here , hurry , hurry ! I 've been waiting for a long time . What are you doing ? I 'm glad that I waited . Do you want a beer ? No . We don 't have much time . What are you doing ? ! . No ! No ! No ! Stop ! No ! Stop ! No . Here ! Hey , wait ! - Kota ! Kota ! Kota ! Help me ! - Don 't worry . I 'm very good at this . Are you a high school student ? Well , no . What are you doing in this kind of place , so late at night ? Well . My brother . I 'm waiting for my brother to finish . - Your brother to finish ? - Yes . We got a report that a high school girl was robbed this morning ... on herway to school and that her clothes were taken . - Come with me ! - No ! - Just come with me ! - No ! I 'm sorry . Wait ! Stupid Kota ! This is the room . What 's wrong ? It seems like something happened . I remember it was loud yesterday . Oh , somebody is being carried out . Oh , no ! It 's Mr. Sera ! Mr. Sera ! Remember I showed you his business card yesterday ? He has the same name as yours . I can 't believe this ! Is he alive ? Yeah . He 's still breathing . Let 's take him to a hospital . But this is terrible . I 've never seen this kind of thing . His penis is all crushed and bent ! Isn 't it ? Yes . Here , why don 't you carry that side ? I feel sorry for Mr. Sera . He said that he just got married . I guess he can 't have any children . But , I wonderwhat kind ofwoman he slept with ? You , too , have to be careful , Kota . Stop it ... don 't . It 's just a joke . A joke . I don 't have time for this . Let me borrow your clothes ! - What are you talking about ? - I need clothes . Please let me borrow your clothes . Help me ! Welcome . Welcome , please sit anywhere you want . Yes . Hey , Kota . I heard you worked hard with Momoko last night . Uh ? Well . That sounds fun ! Don 't be jealous ! By the way , I have a very interesting story . Huh , what ? What would you like to drink ? Well , I ... Hey , we have a special drink called " Kota 's Love-Love Cocktail . " I always recommend it to a first-time customer . But only when it 's a beautiful woman , like you . Then I 'll take it . Oh , yes . What ? His penis was crushed and bent ? I don 't want to talk about it . Even though I 've never met him , when I think about what happened ... to someone who has the same name as mine , I feel strange . Welcome ! Here you are ! You have cool eyes . Well , what can I get foryou ? Well ... We have a special drink called " Kota 's Love-Love Cocktail . " I 'd be very happy to make it foryou . Then ... I 'll take it . Great ! Hey , what is this Love-Love Cocktail ? Don 't you know ? He put some eye drops inside and it makes people get really drunk . Then he says , " Lady , it 's dangerous to go out drunk , so I 'll take you home . " Then after that ... So he does use an old trick . Yes , it 's a dirty trick . He 's a hard worker . Yes , he will never learn . You have a strong aura . Here you are . - This is foryou . - What ? I ordered it because I wanted you to drink this . But , I 'm working now . Who is she ? ! . How desperate is she ? ! . It 's her ! You sure are very aggressive . Ah , but this cocktail is ... Oh , well ... Ah , lucky ! I 'm very lucky tonight ! What the hell is going on ? Hey , Kota ! Get up ! Hey , Boss ! I 'm going home now . Please take care ofthis . Yes , sir . Are you all right ? Finish up yourwork . Good night , Boss . You really are an aggressive girl . Ah .. that feels good . A little lower ! Good ! Ah , it 's you ! She 's ... ! She 's the Terminatrix ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Kota ! Let 's use this ! Hurry ! Hurry ! She 's coming ! Quickly ! Hurry ! This is why I came here . Do you understand , now ? Well , somewhat ... But all right then , I 'll be careful . Where are you going ? ! . She will come to your apartment ! Didn 't you see what happened to the person who had the same name as you ? ! . I saw . I 'd die ifthat happened to me . She 's a machine . She will never give up . She just does what 's been programmed in her and follows those instructions . Then what can I do ? I know ! I 'll get a vasectomy . Then I can 't have children , so she won 't have to make me impotent . Right ? Ouch . Why did you say that ? ! . Your daughterwill never be born ifyou do that ! Then ... In the time that I 'm born ... it 's a time when men and women can 't love freely . The government computer selects mates for men and women . They calculate and select people in terms of ... what kind of child should be born and how they should raise them . The computer is managing human life . And people are summoned one day , without any advance notice . They put several men and women together in a cold room ... Set us up in one line . A man who I don 't even know ... Ifyou don 't get pregnant ... they summon you again , a short while later . And you have to sleep with a different man . I was just like other people . I didn 't question the system . But after I met Hanako , I realized that system is wrong . Hanako ? Your daughter 's name . I realized all the people are different and we all have different thoughts . So , I was very happywhen I was told to travel to this time . I wanted to see what it was like . But ... But ? I 'm so disappointed . I was expecting that 20th century men were more sweet and strong . But , you just like to pick up anywoman . When I went to the hotel , some man pulled me inside a room and forced me ... Did he do something to you ? I ran away . I see . I understand , so don 't cry anymore . I will beat him up , if I see him next time . All right ? What are you guys doing ? This place is prohibited foryou to enter . I 'm sorry . It 's not safe around here . There 's a woman pervert who 's been recently coming out around here . Woman pervert ? Yes , she steals the clothes of high school or college girls ... and then runs away . Oh , I understand . I 'll call you if I see a strange person . All right . Please do so . It 's dangerous , so you should get out ofhere , too . Yes . Pervert woman ? Stop ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop ! Let 's go . This is my secret hideout . Kaoru . Huh ? Can 't you sleep ? You too ? Yeah . Hey , Kaoru . What ? The person who was attacked by the T69 just got married ? Yes . He can 't have children anymore . Kaoru . Huh ? How do you write the name of my daughter Hanako ? " Splendid child . " Am I going to name her ? She said so . What kind of a girl is she ? She is very beautiful . She is sweet , and smart . She is very active . I respect hervery much . I see . She told me about you all the time . About me ? Yes , she said you 're a very good father . She said you are her ideal man . Really ? Am I ? I think men in the 20th century aren 't so bad . Yes . She also said she looks just like her father . Me ? Yes . I think she looks like you a little bit . She looks like me and is beautiful ? But I don 't believe her name is Hanako . Why ? I feel like it 's a very outdated name . I don 't think so . You don 't ? No . Yeah , I guess not . Yes . Kaoru is a good name too . So is Kota . This was the place that my boss owned a long time ago ... but he went bankrupt and sold it to someone . So , it ended up becoming like this . I think ... I 'll buy this place someday . I want people to come here , listen to the band ... and drink and have fun all night . I didn 't know you had a dream . Of course I do . Can people also dance here ? Yes . Oh , it 's cheek-to-cheek dance time . Uh ? What is it , Kaoru ? You have lots of energy . Huh ! Don 't come near me ! Kota , get out of here ! What do you want ! ? Ouch ! Ouch ! Hey ? She stopped . She stopped moving . Is she broken ? I don 't know , but let 's get out ofhere ! Wait a minute ! She 's a really good-looking girl , when I look closely at her . Don 't be silly ! Untie this rope quickly ! Well , she treated me so bad , so I want to treat her bad now ! Look at her breast ! See ! What did you do Kota ? Well ... ah ... Kota ! Don 't get an erection ! I don 't know if I can do that . No good ! It started to get hard . Idiot ! Kota , use this to block ! No , it 's not that hole ! What ? One sheep ! Two sheep ! Three sheep ! Kota ! What ? It seems like she 's really broken this time . Yes , she is . I 'm glad that you were able to protect this place . Yes , I 'm glad too . Hey , Kaoru . What ? I didn 't have a chance to askyou , but ... who is the mother of Hanako ? I thinkyou know . I have a message foryou from Hanako . My mother ... the person who you love most is ... somebodyyou have to find on your own , without anybody 's help . By myself ... So , let 's split here . But what are you going to do from now on ? Don 't worry about me ! Just go . But ... You play a very important role . So , please go . I understand . Well , then ... Good-bye . Kaoru ! I found her !

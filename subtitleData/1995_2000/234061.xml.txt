SCHOOL PICTURES , MOSTLY . THAT 'S WHERE HE SAW AMY JACOBS . SO WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME ? I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT YOU 'RE GOING THROUGH . IT MIGHT FEEL GOOD TO TELL SOMEBODY . I FEEL LIKE IT 'S HAPPENING ALL OVER AGAIN . YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL WHAT SHE 'S GOING THROUGH , CAN 'T YOU ? I DON 'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN . - LUCY , SHE NEEDS YOUR HELP . - THERE 'S NOTHING I CAN DO . - LUCY- - - [ Car Approaching , Stopping ] WAIT HERE A SECOND , OKAY ? [ Door Opens , Closes ] WHAT 'S GOIN ' ON ? WE 'RE HERE TO ARREST LUCY HOUSEHOLDER . WHY ? I THINK YOU KNOW WHY , AGENT MULDER . WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING ? MULDER , THE BLOOD ON LUCY 'S UNIFORM WAS AN EXACT D.N.A. MATCH . LUCY WAS COVERED IN AMY JACOBS ' BLOOD . SHE DIDN 'T DO IT , SCULLY . MULDER , IT 'S INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE . [ Eubanks ] AGENT MULDER ! - WHERE IS SHE ? - SHE WAS JUST HERE . WELL , SHE 'S GONE NOW . PLEASE ! I-I 'M THIRSTY . YOU SHOULDN 'T HAVE RUN . I WAS TAKING CARE OF YOU .

[ Door Slamming , Echoing ] [ Mutters ] [ Chattering ] YOU 'RE GONNA DRIVE HER AWAY WITH THIS . SHE 'S BEEN DRIVEN AWAY , MULDER . A HALF-DOZEN WITNESSES PLACED HER ACROSS TOWN AT THE TIME OF THE KIDNAPPING . I 'M WELL AWARE OF THE FACTS . THEN TRUST ME ON THIS . SHE 'S NOT WORKING WITH WADE . HOW 'D SHE GET THE BLOOD ON HER ? SHE MAY HAVE BLED IT . SHEBLED AMY JACOBS ' BLOOD ? YES , IT MAY EXPLAIN WHY THERE WAS SO LITTLE OF IT ... - ON THE CARPET IN AMY 'S BEDROOM . - [ Man ] AGENT EUBANKS ? - LINE THREE . - I DON 'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS NONSENSE , AGENT MULDER . WE 'VE GOT A YOUNG GIRL 'S LIFE AT STAKE . I HATE TO SAY THIS , MULDER , BUT I THINK YOU JUST RAN OUT OF CREDIBILITY . [ Paper Crumpling ] HE 'S WRONG , SCULLY . YOU 'RE PROTECTING HER BEYOND THE POINT OF REASON . I 'M PROTECTING HER BECAUSE I THINK SHE 'S CONNECTED TO AMY JACOBS . JUST NOT THE WAY EVERYBODY ELSE THINKS SHE IS . DID YOU CONSIDER FOR ONE MINUTE THAT THE PERSON SHE 'S CONNECTED TO IS CARL WADE ? CARL WADE . WHY WOULD SHE BE CONNECTED WITH CARL WADE ? FOR THE SAME TWISTED REASON THAT ABUSED CHILDREN CRAVE THEIR PARENTS ' LOVE ... OR HOSTAGES DEVELOP SYMPATHY FOR THEIR CAPTORS . I MEAN , MAYBE LUCY DEVELOPED SOME KIND OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCY . AFTER FIVE YEARS IN A DARK PIT , I 'M SURE SHE DEVELOPED SOME KIND OF CONNECTION WITH WADE . JUST NOT THE KIND THAT YOU 'RE SUGGESTING . IT MAKES MORE SENSE THAN THE NOTION THAT SHE 'S BLEEDING AMY JACOBS ' BLOOD . I DON 'T HOW TO EXPLAIN IT , BUT I THINK THAT WADE 'S ABDUCTION OF AMY ... TRIGGERED SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL RESPONSE IN LUCY . SOME KIND OF EMPATHIC TRANSFERENCE . MULDER , YOU CAN 'T- - THAT 'S HOW I ACCOUNT FOR WHAT LUCY 'S GOING THROUGH . THAT 'S HOW I ACCOUNT FOR THE IDENTICAL WORDS THAT CORRESPONDED TO AMY ... AND THE SPONTANEOUS WOUNDS AND BLOOD AS WELL . THEN WHY DID SHE RUN ? IF SHE 'S INNOCENT , WHAT WAS SHE RUNNING FROM ? BECAUSE SHE 'S AFRAID . YOU DON 'T SEE WHAT YOU 'RE DOING , DO YOU , MULDER ? YOU ARE SO CLOSE TO THIS THAT YOU JUST DON 'T SEE IT . WHAT DON 'T I SEE ? THE EXTREME RATIONALIZATION . YOUR PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION WITH THE VICTIM- - OR , IN THIS CASE , THE SUSPECT . YOU 'RE BECOMING SOME KIND OF AN EMPATH YOURSELF , MULDER . YOU ARE SO SYMPATHETIC TO LUCY AS A VICTIM- - LIKE YOURSISTER- - THAT YOU CAN 'T SEE HER AS A PERSON WHO 'S CAPABLE OF COMMITTING THIS CRIME . YOU DON 'T THINK I 'VE THOUGHT OF THAT ? I HAVE . AND NOT EVERYTHING I DO AND SAY AND THINK OR FEEL GOES BACK TO MY SISTER . YOU , OF ALL PEOPLE , SHOULD REALIZE THAT SOMETIMES ... MOTIVATIONS FOR BEHAVIOR CAN BE MORE COMPLEX AND MYSTERIOUS ... THAN TRACING THEM BACK TO ONE SINGLE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE . AGENT MULDER ! WE 'VE GOT A MAN ON THE WAY IN WHO SPOTTED WADE . YEAH , THAT 'S THE GUY . I OFFERED TO FIX HIS FLAT . TRIED TO DO THE GUY A FAVOR . HE WENT WACKO ON ME . STARTED FREAKIN ' THE MINUTE I GOT OUT OF MY TRUCK . WHAT ABOUT THE GIRL ? WAS SHE WITH HIM ? I DIDN 'T SEE ANYONE ELSE . - GUESS SHE COULD HAVE BEEN IN THE TRUNK . - CAN YOU GIVE US AN EXACT SPOT ? YEAH . RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE . - WHICH WAY WAS THE CAR HEADED ? - WEST . INTERSTATE 12 , COUNTY 15 , NORTH . 903 . LOOK AT THIS . RIGHT OFF THE 903 . - EASTON ? - THAT 'S WHERE LUCY WAS FOUND 17 YEARS AGO . [ Arguing , Indistinct ] [ Tires Squealing ] [ Engine Starting , Chugging ] IT 'S A SMALL TOWN , SCULLY . SOMEBODY 'S BOUND TO KNOW WADE 'S FACE , WHERE HE LIVES . BUT WE ALREADY STICK OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB , MULDER . IF WE START CANVASSING MAIN STREET , SOMEBODY 'S GONNA PICK UP THE PHONE TO HIM . BUT HE 'S A PHOTOGRAPHER , RIGHT ? YEAH . HE SHOULD HAVE AN ACCOUNT HERE . [ Seat Belt Clicks ] [ Whispers ] GO . [ Sobbing , Gasping ] AMY ? MULDER ? YEAH ? WHAT 'S HAPPENING ? DID YOU FIND HER ? [ Footsteps ] WHERE ARE THEY , LUCY ? TELL US WHERE WADE TOOK AMY . I DON 'T KNOW . ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THAT GIRL , LUCY , AND YOU 'LL BE TRIED AS AN ACCOMPLICE . - WERE THEY HERE WHEN YOU ARRIVED ? - NO . - YOU HAVEN 'T SEEN HIM ? SPOKEN WITH HIM ? - I SAID NO ! - THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE ? - I DON 'T KNOW . JUST SHOWED UP FOR NO REASON IN PARTICULAR ? THAT 'S WHAT YOU ASK US TO BELIEVE ? I 'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE . A LONG TIME AGO . IT WAS WHERE HE KEPT ME . [ Eubanks ] SO , WHY ARE YOU HERE NOW ? TAKE HER OUTSIDE AND PLACE HER IN CUSTODY . NO . I 'LL TAKE HER . COME ON , LUCY . AGENT MULDER- - IT 'S ALL RIGHT . [ Car Door Opening ] HE HASN 'T TOUCHED HER . NOT YET . HE WANTS TO , BUT HE CAN 'T . THAT 'S WHY HE TAKES THE PICTURES . WHAT ELSE , LUCY ? TELL ME WHAT ELSE . IF HE CAN 'T HAVE HER ALL TO HIMSELF , THAT 'S WHEN HE 'S DANGEROUS . THAT 'S WHEN HE 'LL START HURTING HER . LUCY , YOU CAME HERE TO HELP HER . NO ! WHY ELSE WOULD YOU COME BACK HERE , IF NOT FOR AMY ? YOU 'RE SHARING HER PAIN . I CAN 'T . YOU 'RE THE SURVIVOR . YOU 'RE THE STRONG ONE . NOW AMY NEEDS SOME OF YOUR STRENGTH .

[ Continues Coughing ] MULDER , THEY FOUND WADE 'S CAR NORTH OF HERE . THEY 'RE IN THE WATER . WHAT ? THERE 'S A RIVER NEAR HERE . I THINK THAT 'S WHERE THEY ARE . BUT THE RIVER 'S EAST , AND THEY FOUND WADE 'S CAR A MILE NORTH . WELL , WADE LIVES HERE . HE KNOWS THESE WOODS . HE COULD BE DOUBLING BACK . [ Scully ] DID SHE TELL YOU THAT ? NO , BUT I THINK THAT 'S WHAT SHE 'S TRYING TO DO . MULDER , WAIT ! [ Sighs ] STAY WITH HER , AND GET WORD TO EUBANKS THAT WADE MAY BE HEADING TOWARDS THE RIVER . - [ Coughing ] - [ Coughing ] PLEASE . STOP . I CAN 'T . [ Siren Wailing ] COME ON ! THEY 'RE COMIN ' ! I CAN 'T ! PLEASE . [ Sobbing ] [ Siren Continues Wailing ] NOBODY- - NOBODY 'S GONNA SPOIL US . NO ! NO , NO ! [ Screaming Shrilly ] [ Gasps ] CAN YOU SIT UP ? CAN YOU BREATHE ?

THEY 'RE WORKING ON LUCY HOUSEHOLDER . [ Coughing ] I 'M COLD . I WANT TO GO HOME . IT 'S GETTING DARK . WE HAVE TO GET HER OFF THE RIVER . [ Woman On Police Radio ] RESCUE 22 , CLEAR FREQUENCIES . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED . SHE STARTED COUGHING , THEN SHE COULDN 'T BREATHE . BY THE TIME THE E.M.S. GUYS GOT HERE , SHE WAS ALREADY GONE . [ Chattering Continues On Police Radio ] [ Man On Police Radio ] THIS IS UNIT 11 . COPY THAT . - HOW 'S AMY ? - SHE 'S EXHAUSTED , BUT IT LOOKS LIKE SHE 'S GONNA BE FINE . THE DOCTORS WANT TO KEEP HER FOR A DAY OR TWO , JUST TO BE SURE . HOW SERIOUS WERE HER INJURIES ? WADE MUST HAVE LEFT HER ALONE . THERE WERE NO INJURIES . HE MUST HAVE DRAGGED HER THROUGH THE WOODS FOR AT LEAST A MILE . I KNOW , MULDER . I CAN 'T EXPLAIN IT . SHE DIDN 'T HAVE A CUT ON HER . AND NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW . EVERYONE 'S JUST RELIEVED ... TO HAVE HER BACK AGAIN , TO HAVE HER SAFE . THEY FINISH UP ON LUCY ? YES , THEY , UH- - THEY BROUGHT IN THE STATE PATHOLOGIST LAST NIGHT . SO I STOPPED BY TO GET THE AUTOPSY REPORTS ON MY WAY . SHE DROWNED , DIDN 'T SHE ? [ Sighs ] THEY FOUND FIVE LITERS OF WATER IN HER LUNGS . SHE SAVED AMY 'S LIFE . MULDER , [ Intakes Sharp Breath ] WHATEVER THERE WAS BETWEEN THEM , YOU WERE PART OF THAT CONNECTION- - DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT ? LUCY MAY HAVE DIED FOR AMY , BUT WITHOUT YOU , THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE FOUND HER . I THINK SHE DIED FOR MORE THAN AMY . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? I THINK , FINALLY , IT WAS ... THE ONLY WAY SHE COULD ESCAPE . THE ONLY WAY SHE COULD FORGET WHAT HAPPENED 17 YEARS AGO . IT WAS FINALLY THE ONLY WAY SHE COULD OUTRUN CARL WADE . CLOSED-CAPTIONED BY CAPTIONS , INC . LOS ANGELES [ Child ] I MADE THIS !

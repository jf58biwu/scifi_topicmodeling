 Welcome to The Falls . Please enter your code now . Welcome to The Falls . Please enter your code now . Welcome to The ... Welcome home , Mr. Kline . Oops . Did you get some on you , Dave ? Didn 't want you to get fined . Just trying to be neighborly . Got to be up to code . Shroeder 's out there painting our mailbox ! You know what I 'm going to do ? I 'm going to paint the whole damn house pink . - Dave . - Forget about the mailbox , huh ? I 'm going to make this whole damn place look like you won it selling cosmetics . How about that ? That 'll show these Nazis . Honey , would you just calm down . Rules are rules . They 're repainting our mailbox because it 's " Desert Sienna " instead of " Desert Sage " . - I mean , this guy is a freakin ' weirdo . - Hon ... what 's that package ? I don 't know . It doesn 't say who sent it . Tasteful . Boy , the neighbors would really hate that . Honey ... What is it ? Stay here . Dave ? Honey ? ! SEVEN MONTHS LATER Take a look at this . Honey , what do you think ? Is this place us or what ? You must be the Petries . Hi . Welcome . Welcome to The Falls . I 'm Rob ... - ... and this is my lovely wife , Laura . - Rob and Laura Petrie . We pronounce it " Pee-trie , " actually . Like the dish . Well , it 's so nice to meet you . I 'm Pat Verlander . I live six doors down . - I 'm the neighborhood welcome wagon . - Pleased to make your acquaintance , Pat . I really must say , it 's already ten after 5 : 00 . I don 't think you 're going to make it . - I 'm sorry ? - The 6 o 'clock cutoff ? All move-ins are required to be completed by 6 PM . It 's in the CCRs . It 's one of our rules . - The photos did not do it justice . - Guys , fast , fast now . Come on . - The previous owners left it so clean . - What do you do for a living Mr ... Petrie ? - That 's right , isn 't it ? - Yeah , I , uh ... I work mostly at home which is great for Laura because she gets me all to herself . This place really is immaculate , Pat . I , uh , I wouldn 't mind sending a thank-you note to the previous owners . Th-that 's sweet . Um ... Good . Okay , move it , people . Come on . - Rob and Laura Petrie . - Yes . - " Pee-trie . " Win Shroeder , next-door neighbor . Welcome , welcome . Hi , Win . Nice to meet you . Now , don 't you folks worry . We 'll have you moved in before 6 : 00 . - Time ? ! - 5 : 19 . Uh ... pardon me , neighbor . Thanks . Oh , thank you . Thanks . Thank you . Thank you . Excuse me ! - I 'll get that . It 's okay . - No . No , don 't be silly . It 's heavy . I got it . - Oh , no . I 'm ... I 'm so sorry . I 'm really sorry . - Mike . Mike , Mike , Mike , it 's okay . - It 's okay , Mike . Go help Gordy . - Send me any bills . I 'm ... I 'm sorry . I 'm Cami Shroeder , by the way . Win 's wife . Nice to meet you . I 'm Laura . - Where 's this go ? - Uh , you can put that in the driveway . Whoa , whoa ! Hold on , hold on . Let 's ... let 's talk . Um ... A b-ball fan , huh ? Shooting hoops ... That 's , um , that 's not good . That 's definitely going to stand out in your front yard over there . - Stand out , Win ? - Well , as in , uh ... not be aesthetically pleasing to the eye . But , hey , you know , maybe you can get special dispensation from Mr. Gogolak , president of our Homeowner 's Association . I 'd take it up with him . But in the meantime , um ... let 's keep that in the garage . - Just ... put it in the garage . - Okay . Let 's finish getting you folks moved in . Let 's go , people . Let 's move ! Move ! Oh , yeah . Nothing weird going on around here . Hey ... ooh , wait a minute . You didn 't let me carry you over the threshold . - You ready ? - Let 's get it on , honey . All right , then . Thanks to our friendly neighbors there will be no fluorescein bloodstain enhancement . Not that it makes much difference . This place is so clean you could build computer chips . Okay . 6 : 01 p.m. , February 24 . Agents Scully and Mulder in the former home of David and Nancy Kline who disappeared without a trace last July . The Klines were the third such couple to disappear since this neighborhood was built in 1991 . All were apparently stable professional people with no history of violence , domestic discord or mental illness and it took a family member or employee to realize that they were gone including their cars and a few personal items . What local police found in each case was nothing ... Just impeccably-manicured homes and a community of neighbors who professed total ignorance that anyone had disappeared . That 's pretty surprising considering how nutty this bunch is about being neighborly . The local police department were at a dead end so they turned to the FBI . AD Skinner , in assigning us this case , thought a fruitful approach to the investigation would be if we went undercover posing as prospective home buyers as this planned community would seem to hide a dark , possibly murderous conspiracy of silence . You want to make that honeymoon video now ? - Rob and Laura Petrie ? - " Pee-trie " . Mulder , if we ever go undercover again I get to choose the names , okay ? Fine . - This tells me that you 're not taking this seriously . - I 'm taking it seriously . I just don 't understand why we 're on it . It 's our first catch back on the X-Files . This isn 't an X-File . Sure it is . It 's unexplained . What do you want , aliens ? Tractor beams ? Admit it , you just want to play house . Woman , get back in here and make me a sandwich ! Did I not make myself clear ? Hi . Well , you didn 't need to do that . Oh , please . I have more dishes than I need . I just usually use one and then ... wash it . Uh ... - I 'm ... uh , Mike Raskub , by the way . - Hi . Big Mike , for obvious reasons . I just live the next street over . That 's a caduceus . Are you a doctor , Mike ? No , a vet . Veterinarian . If you folks are thinking about getting a dog or any pet I 'd be happy to check it out for you , no charge . Just , uh ... you 're not allowed to have over 16 pounds of pet . That 's one of the CCRs . Mighty nice of you , Mike . I , uh ... gosh , with all this hospitality , I can 't believe the Klines ever left . That , uh ... that was their name , wasn 't it ? The , uh , the Klines ? I have to go . Mulder ... The name ... is Rob . What you got there ? Looks like whoever cleaned this place maybe missed a spot . That look like blood to you ? How 'd it get way up there ? I , uh ... didn 't really learn much about them . He just said he works at home , which tells me she 's got money . - Well ... seemed nice . Cute couple . - Mmm , very cute . Uh , they 're a nice couple . What do you think , Gene ? Ladies , my compliments to the chef . Cami ? Sissy ? These Petries , are they going to play ball ? " Pee-tries . " Uh , so far , so good . I 'm keeping my eye on them . Um ... Mr. Gogolak ... Don 't you think that , uh ... maybe this time it would be better if we told them ? Mike ... you and I have been through this before . - We ... we don 't know yet if we can trust them . - It 's just that ... There are so many ... so many rules . I think that maybe they would be able to keep up with them better if they knew what happened if they don 't . It 's the neighborly thing to do . I really think we should do this . Son ... Godspeed . Thank you . - Um ... can I , uh , use your ... ? - Second door to the left . There 's Glade under the sink . Gordy , how about you go make sure he finds it . - Gene ? I can talk him out of this . - Win . The boy 's a weak link and a strong chain can 't survive with a weak link . ... is instinctive and necessary for survival . Failure to conform within the tribal structure can often prove lethal . When group elders suspect such an outcast within their midst tribal members gather in a circle to perform a ritual chant in the belief that this will expose the unwitting conduit of evil . The chanters eventually settle on the so-called misfit and he or she ... Oh , no . No ... No , I fixed it ! I fixed it ! Morning . Oh ! Oh , Rob , Laura . I 'm so sorry . So , good morning . So how was your first night ? Peaceful ? Oh , it was wonderful . We just spooned up and fell asleep like little baby cats . - Isn 't that right , Honeybunch ? - That 's right , Poopyhead . Win , are we in the right place ? I thought this was Big Mike 's house . Yeah ... Yeah . I 'm just helping out . Mike had to leave town on business . What kind of business ? I thought he was a veterinarian . Veterinarian business , I guess . I just know he 's gone weeks at a time . - I 'll just leave this here then . - Let me take those . Just ... tidier-looking than leaving them on the front porch . - Be more aesthetically pleasing , huh ? - Exactly . Say , would you two like to join Cami and me for dinner this evening ? - About 6 : 00 ? We eat early . - That sounds great . Thanks . Great . Oh , Win , uh , you mentioned , uh that I could talk to someone about putting up my basketball hoop ? Who was that again ? Mr. Gogolak , was it ? All right , then , let 's see . Basketball hoop and backboard . Portable . Nope , I 'm sorry . It 's not allowed . - You 're kidding ? - I 'm afraid not . Rules are rules . It may not sound like anything , a simple basketball hoop , but from there , it 's just a few short steps to spinning daisy reflectors ... - ... and a bass boat in the driveway . - In other words , anarchy . It may sound tough but ours is a system that works . That 's why The Falls is one of the top-ranked planned communities in all of California . Most of our homeowners have been here since day one . I love the decor here , Mr. Gogolak . Is it , um ... Occidental ? Well , it 's , uh , Nepalese and Tibetan , mostly . I go there twice a year on business . I run Pier 9 Imports . I can get you a great deal on rattan furniture if you 're interested . Indoor only . Outdoor use is prohibited by our ... CCRs . SCROEDER RESIDENCE 6 : 37 PM Uh-uh , Scruffy . Go on , now . Sweetheart ? Did you use the dolphin-safe tuna this time ? Dolphin-safe all the way , Honey . - We always use the dolphin-safe . - You 've got to love those dolphins although they 're pretty tasty , too . So ... Where 'd you two meet ? - Actually , it was at a UFO conference . - Flying saucers ? Interesting . Wouldn 't have thought you folks would have been into that . Well , it 's not me so much as Laura . She 's quite the New-Ager . I mean , she 's into those magnetic bracelets and crystals and mood rings , what have you . I mean , God bless her she 's a sucker for all that stuff . Well , I wouldn 't have guessed that , would you ? - No kidding . - Yeah . You know , Win , uh , when you , uh when you told me this morning that Big Mike was out of town on business ... I don 't think that 's true . You don 't ? - No , ' cause we called his office , didn 't we , Honey ? - We did . - Yeah . We 're thinking about getting a dog so we wanted to call him and ask him his advice , whatever , and see if maybe his office had a forwarding number and they said , you know ... - That he wasn 't there . They didn 't know where he was . - Yeah . Do you know where he is , Win ? Really couldn 't tell you . It 's got to be something really freaky-deaky , hunh ? I mean , for him to lie about it like that ? Maybe he 's got some wild secret life going on . But every community has its dark underbelly don 't you think ? We don 't have any underbelly . As far as I 'm concerned this community is the American Dream . Um ... I 'm sorry . I , um ... realize that it 's past time that I walk Scruffy . - Would you like some company ? - Yeah . So is this the American dream ? This place ? Oh , uh ... Nice neighborhood , you know ... just a lot of people who want the best for their families . So it 's just not your dream . You know , Cami , I-I 've noticed that you 've , uh , walked us past Mike 's house ... twice . Are you worried about him ? No ... I don 't really know what you mean . Scruffy ! Scruffy , come here ! Scruffy , no ! Scruffy ! Scruffy , come out here ! Scruffy ! Scruffy , come out of there . Let me take a look . Do you see him ? Scruffy , Scruffy , it 's okay , it 's okay . I got you . I got you . Oh ... - What you got there ? - Deep breath . That 's a close one , huh ? Yeah ? Let me wipe that off . That 's a good boy . Okay , let 's get you home . Come on . - All right , Lieutenant . - Here . Caduceus . Thank you . Local PD came up blank on ... Mike Raskub . No activity on his credit cards . No sighting of his ' 97 Mercury Villager . Yeah , there 's no sign of him in his house . I didn 't see him in the storm drain , either . I take it he 's dead , Scully . Laura . Win Shroeder ? Mmm , maybe Win cleaning up . Cleaning up for who ? - I don 't know . - Mulder , speaking of cleaning up , whoever taught you how to squeeze a tube of toothpaste ? Hey , what do we know about this stuff ? I 'm driving down to San Diego tomorrow and have it analyzed . - All right . - Third warning . Toilet seat . Why kill Big Mike ? What 's missing here is intent . What would be the motive ? Compulsive neatness , or a lack thereof . Have you noticed how everybody around here is is obsessed with the neighborhood rules and the CCRs ? You know what ? You fit in really well here . And you don 't . Well , anyway , tomorrow I got a , uh , a surefire way of testing out my theory . Come on , Laura , you know ... We 're married now . Scully , Mulder . Good night . The thrill is gone . Bring it on . " Be like the others ... before it gets dark . " - Stay here . - Stop him , Win . - Stay here ! - Stop him ! Hey , Win . Want to play " horse " ? - What the hell are you doing ? - What am * I * doing ? - What are * you * doing ? - Damn it , Rob , get off of it ! - Help me get this thing inside . - Why ? What 's going to happen if we don 't ? Fine . That 's the way you want it ? - You were warned . - Warned about what ? No ! No ! Please ! Stop ! Cami ... you all right ? Mulder ? Mulder , is that you ? Sorry , Mulder . Somebody was in the house . Tidying up . Whoever it was , they put away my basketball hoop . Somebody 's looking out after us , Scully , which may not be a bad thing . - What do you mean ? - I got a look at that thing that 's been scaring everybody and I take it back . This is an X-File . How 's Cami ? What did we do wrong , Gene ? Was our welcome mat not to your liking ? Did I coil my garden hose clockwise instead of counterclockwise ? Hold the phone , now . - Are you saying that I had something to do with this ? - Who else ? The exact same thing , the thing you had me do to Mike . Who else would do that ? Son , you 'll want to take a deep breath and rethink that theory . It 's your next-door neighbor , Win . He 's a rabble-rouser . He 's trouble with a capital " T. " And you and I both know it only takes one rotten apple to spoil the whole bunch . Here we go . Yeah ... I 'm guessing there 's one of these in every yard . I think this is how this thing travels- - where it lives . In the ground . This huge creature you think you saw ? Look , Mulder , huge creatures aside do you care to hear what I think ? Always . These are the lab results from the San Diego PD . First of all , the stuff that we found on the fan blade , the dried blood and scalp hairs ? It 's neither . The blood is predominantly ketchup and brake fluid and the hairs are bristles from a scrub brush and the same goes for the sample we found on the dog 's muzzle . It 's coffee grounds , eggshells and motor oil with about 50 other constituents with a little mercurochrome for color . In other words , Mulder , it 's garbage . Which makes perfect sense because this entire neighborhood has been built upon an old landfill . A landfill ? We found this stuff everywhere because it is everywhere . It 's just beneath the topsoil and that protrusion in the front yard may occur from the venting of methane gas ... But ... Mulder , I don 't see how any of this has to do with the disappearances that we 're investigating . - It does . Somehow , it 's one and the same . The Klines ? - Yeah ? What if they 're still here . You mean buried in the yard ? Well , once we start a forensic excavation , our cover 's blown . What in God 's name are you doing ? ! - God ... ! - Putting in a pool . In the front yard ? ! Wh-wh-what are you , insane ? Have you even looked at the CCRs ? You-you can 't just put in a swimming pool ! It 's not a swimming pool . It 's a reflecting pool . I checked the rules . There 's no rule against putting in a reflecting pool . It 's very tranquil . You 'd like it . Let him dig his own grave . Hey . Mulder . The Klines aren 't down there . Maybe it 's time you called it a night . Tasteful , isn 't it ? Gogolak . - Hey , can you get an excavation team out here ? - Yeah . - We need to dig deeper . - Where are you going ? - To price some rattan furniture . Yes , this is Special Agent Dana Scully . I need a full forensic team to 450 Autumn Terrace . No , not tomorrow . Tonight . I 'm sorry . Can I call you back ? Jeez . Oh , God . It 's come for you , Laura . You can 't make a noise . Mike . - What happened to you ? - You have to get out of here . Why ? Wait a minute , who 's downstairs ? Mike ... - Who did this to you ? - The ubermenscher . It 's our fault . The original homeowners , we asked for it and now we can 't stop it . Stop what , Mike ? I tried to give it Shroeder . You know , tit-for-tat . Just like Shroeder did for me . Mike , listen , settle down . Okay . Just give me my gun . I 'm a federal agent ... The ubermenscher wants you , Laura . Your husband , he 's broken way too many rules . I 've been hiding in the sewer . I tried to warn him . Mike , just give me the gun . Give me ... FBI ? What did I do ? Let 's start with the Klines . You 're responsible for them being in little pieces in my front yard . You gave them that lawn ornament . The guy with the axe ? - Whirligig . - Yeah , whirligig . It 's tacky enough to break your rules and your CCRs , tacky enough to mark the Klines for death . And won 't that sound good in a court of law ? When the judge asks you who killed the Klines what exactly are you going to tell him ? A tulpa . It 's a Tibetan thought-form . It 's a living , breathing creature willed into existence by someone who possesses that ability ... An ability I think you picked up on your whirligig-buying excursions to the Far East . Why 'd you do it ? I mean , is it so damn important for everybody to have the same color mailbox ? It 's important that people fit in . But you didn 't know exactly what you were getting into , did you ? I mean , you can summon its existence , but ... you can give it life , but you can 't control it . - The best you can hope for is to stay out of its way . - Son , my lawyers are going to make you sound so stupid that not only will I never see the inside of a jail cell but you 'll be signing all your paychecks straight to me . Gene ? Win . You 've got two FBI agents living next door to you . Cheer up . It 's not for long . Scully ? Scully ? Scully ? Mulder ? - Scully ? - Mulder ? Scully , hang on . Come here . Help me with this . Win , come here . Win ... ! Win , wait a minute . No . No . He deserves what he gets . Mulder , it was here . Mulder ! Several residents of The Falls have now come forward to blame the deaths in the neighborhood on Home Owner Association President Gene Gogolak . These same residents deny Agent Mulder 's allegation that they were in some sense all responsible for the demise of Gogolak himself claiming ignorance as to what actually killed him . It would seem the code of silence that hid the sins of this community has not only survived but , in its creator , claimed a final victim . Meanwhile , The Falls at Arcadia has been named one of the top planned communities in California for the sixth year running .

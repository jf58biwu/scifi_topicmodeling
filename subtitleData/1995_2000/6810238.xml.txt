 - Simon , are you ready ? - Yeah . - .. reincarnation ... - Excuse me , Warden . It 's five o 'clock , sir . - How 's Neech ? - He 's still in with his wife . - No . I mean , how is he ? How 's he doing ? - Well , he won 't eat his meal . And he won 't see the chaplain . Told him to get the hell out . - What about the hired man ? - He 's travelling ' . - All right . Let 's get Neech prepped . - Yes , sir . If God can 't save his sorry ass , neither can I. Time 's up , Neech ! 2,000 volts , man ! You ain 't never comin ' back ! Freak ! Just like I 've always told you . I swear on my life , Neech . Time to go . I ain 't ever gonna love another man . You hear me ? I won 't . I won 't betray our love . Ever . It 's time , Neech . Time to go . That phone call 's gonna come . The governor is gonna come through . - Gotta go now . We 've got a hood if you want it . It 's your option . No . Is there anything you wanna say , Neech ? Last words ? Yeah . I 've been here 11 years , 56 days , and now you 're gonna murder me . The Lord says thou shall be merciful and just . I know no mercy . Allah says the spirit shall rise again and be reborn into this life . - The soul shall ... - You should begin , Father . The Lord is my shepherd ... I will return to avenge all the petty tyranny and the cruelty I have suffered . I will be recast , reincarnated . Reunion of spirit and flesh . Mark my words . Five men will die . Five men will go down ! This will be my justice ! This will be my law ! This will be my capital punishment ... .. and no stay of execution will be granted . For there is no prejudice . No evidence to be admitted , no lawyer ... Fry him . These men will die righteous death ! Napoleon " Neech " Manley . He was convicted in 1984 for double murder in the hold-up of a Florida liquor store . The gunman was killed . Manley was the getaway driver and got sentenced to death . He was put to death in the electric chair three days ago . He 'd been to the chair twice before , but the governor granted him last-minute stays . Third time 's a charm . What 's your interest ? Manley was interesting . He 's well read , charismatic . He became a writer . A prison philosopher . A week before his execution , ... .. word spread that Neech said he was gonna be reincarnated . He was gonna come back from the dead . Well , reincarnation has always been popular on death row . For obvious reasons . Apparently , this was more than a dying man 's hope against hope . - What do you mean ? - He didn 't just claim he was coming back , ... .. but that he was gonna take vengeance on five men who had mistreated him . Yesterday a death-row guard was found dead inside the cell that Manley had occupied . His death cannot be explained . - Has a cause of death been determined ? - Suffocation , near as we can tell . Must have been snuffed with a pillow . Any idea how a guard could get murdered in an empty cell like this ? No . Not with all the precautions we take . The guards all wear panic devices . Was the victim 's activated ? No . Apparently he never touched it . Reports say there were threats this might happen . There 's always threats of violence . Prison 's nothing but a police state . Do you give any credence to Neech Manley 's claims that he 'd come back for revenge ? Neech Manley ... Smart man . Very smart man . If he 'd stayed outside , I would have figured him for a Nobel Prize . But he made a mistake . Paid for it with his life . You put a man of that intelligence inside for 11 years , you 're gonna pay for it . What do you mean ? There 's bitterness and resentment in here , seven days a week , 24 hours a day , ... .. 365 days a year . It gets honed to a real fine point . So Manley planned this and is carrying it out with the help of someone else . Elaborate as Shakespeare . Now , you wanna see the victim 's body . Visitors coming through ! Woman on the block ! We 're holding the corpse until the state pathologist conducts the official autopsy . That information should help us solve the murder . Did Manley have many friends ? A man has to have friends here to watch his enemies . Mostly people were afraid of him . - Warden ? - What is it ? The body . I think you should take a look . You should get it into refrigeration or you won 't have anything left to autopsy . Oh , God ! I 've been told you believe Neech Manley 's claims . It 's not a matter of how or if he 's comin ' back . The question is when ... - .. is he comin ' back again ? - What are you saying , Speranza ? - Do you believe Manley killed that guard ? - How else would you explain it ? - A prisoner waits for an opportunity ... - Look around ! We ain 't got no opportunity ! But you 've got prisoners on work detail . A man slips away ... This is Q block . Death row . Don 't nobody come in and out without a guard watching ' . - And lately you got double that . - Why ? Cos everybody 's afraid of what they say can 't be true . - Neech is back . - Reincarnated ? He would have called it transmigration of the soul . - Into what form ? - You . Me . This mattress . I don 't know ! He didn 't specify . But he 's back . I can feel it . The man was electric . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? Pure energy . Would it be possible to see the cell where the guard was murdered ? I 'll open it up for you . - Any idea how he did it ? - Like I said ... Yes , sweet girl . Hi . Nothing 's been touched . It 's pretty much the way Neech left it . Did you know Neech Manley ? Oh , yeah . I knew him . What was he like ? Neech ? Neech was so full of BS he couldn 't stand it . How was that ? He started to believe that crap he 'd been preaching ' all those years , ... .. as if knowing ' all them religions made him some kind of god . - Who do you think killed the guard ? - I don 't know who killed him . But I damn well know who didn 't kill him . - Are you afraid at all ? - Me ? I just keep my ass covered and my eyes peeled . Same as always . Fornier ! Hey ! Down here ! I 'm gonna check back on your partner . - Everything OK in there ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Sh ! I 'm not gonna hurt you . I only wanna talk to you , OK ? I know who he 's gonna kill . There 's a list . One of the cons has it . A man named Roque . - Who are you ? - My name 's Parmelly . I want to help you . Agent Scully ? - I was just looking around . - Not a place for a woman to do that alone . Mulder . - I 'm ready to go now . - OK . I 'll be right there . - Guard ! - What 's wrong , Scully ? I 'm just ready to get outta here . I want every paintbrush and putty knife to be accounted for . Understand ? Come on , gentlemen , move it . - It 's the guard . It 's Fornier . - Come on , you guys . Break it up ! Get back ! I said get back ! They haven 't recovered the body yet , so it 'll be hard to establish an exact cause of death . What did your preliminary exam turn up ? Well , the head was severed below the jaw line with repeated blows from a putty knife . There were no other indications of trauma . From the eyewitness reports , there were already fly larvae infesting the flesh . That 's unusual given the time-of-death window . Not altogether . Here , let me show you this . Lucilia cuprina - better known as the greenbottle fly . They lay their eggs within a minute after death occurs . And they breed more rapidly in a hot , humid environment . In the anaerobic environment of the paint can ? On my autopsy on the first victim , the lungs were absolutely alive with infestation . Hm . What was determined to be the cause of that death ? Best I can figure , given the lack of indicators , he was suffocated to death . Either that ... or he drowned . You 've got a visitor , Roque . - I hear you have a list . - I prefer not to talk about it here . Not on the block . Guard ? Youse a dead man , Roque ! You hear me ? I 'm gonna peel that head like an onion . I 'm gonna break you off a big chunk ! You hear me ? He 'll tell you nothing but a bunch of lies ! You talk , punk , I 'm gonna make you my Maytag ! He 's a liar ! How did you come by this list you claim to have ? I heard Neech on the bars one night telling Speranza . - How many names are on the list ? - Five . Just like Neech said . So you knew those two guards were gonna be murdered ? I knew they were on the list , yeah . - Who do you think killed them ? - I don 't know . I just know who 's on the list . - You wanna make a deal , huh ? - That 's right . I want a transfer out of this hole . - Why ? Are you on the list ? - I ain 't saying nothin ' . Not until I get my deal . What if they don 't give you what you want ? Then they 're gonna see the other three die . I can 't make that deal . - You don 't have the authority ? - It 's not that . If I make that deal , ... .. every con with half a brain would come up with a scheme like that . What if it saves three lives ? Isn 't that a deal worth making ? My job 's about controlling anarchy . I don 't run this prison , I just patrol it . Basically , it 's war in here . We have freedom , they don 't . Anything these men want , somehow ... it finds its way in here . They want a prisoner dead , somebody 'll find a way to put a shiv in . - These are guards being murdered . - Yes . And if I back down now , ... .. all I 'll be doing is sending a message about the benefits of killing prison guards . There 's a conspiracy at work here . I don 't know who 's behind it , but I am gonna crack it . That 's my job . What the hell ... ? Guard ? Guard ! Guard ! Get in here ! I guess you 'll be able to finish up that autopsy now , Scully . - He had quite a library . - Yeah . Looks like Neech Manley knew his Bible . Listen to this : " I come in return to the beginning of the end to begin again the journey of souls , ... .. the godhead universal for whom there is no death , only life eternal . " - What 's that from ? - Neech Manley , 1994 . This goes on for hundreds of pages . References to the Hindu Atman , ... .. parabdha , the Rosicrucians , Zoroastrianism . He was obsessed with reincarnation . Being obsessed doesn 't mean you can do it . - Unless he knew something we don 't . - Like what ? The secret password ? Every world religion encompasses the idea of life after death . Millions , even billions , of people believe in transmigration or rebirth of the soul . Sorry , that 's not what I learned in catechism . Christianity teaches about the resurrection and ascendancy of the heavenly body . Do you honestly believe that Manley came back from the dead to kill ? - Is there another theory ? - A very good one . - And one much more believable . - That this is a complex scheme . The headless man planted at the warden 's desk is the work of a conspiracy of inmates . Or guards . OK , but imagine if it were true , Scully . Imagine if you could come back and take out five people who had caused you to suffer . - Who would they be ? - I only get five ? I remembered your birthday this year , didn 't I , Scully ? Well , here 's somebody we haven 't talked to yet . She should know better than anybody else . - Mrs Manley ? - Yes ? We 're from the FBI . We 'd like to ask you a few questions about your husband . I had this dream . Had it many times . That they put Neech in that chair ... .. and they flipped the switch , ... .. but that he wouldn 't die . You couldn 't kill him . He 's a powerful man . A very powerful man . Did he ever share his thoughts about dying with you ? - Neech wasn 't afraid to die . - Because of his beliefs ? Sometimes ... See , I only got to have personal visiting days right before the execution dates . There was three in the last 11 years . But sometimes ... .. I could feel the power of his beliefs right through that visiting glass . You think he 's come back , don 't you ? You know ... I think that if anyone could ... .. it 'd be Neech . Get up , Roque . Puttin ' on the chains . - Hey , man . For what ? - The warden wants to talk to you . - Other way . - Where we goin ' ? This way . Let go of my arm ! I 'm goin ' ! What you want with me anyway ? Stop pushing ' ! Hey , Roque . - I wanna talk to you about this list . - I ain 't saying ' nothin ' . Come on , Roque . You got a big mouth . What are you shutting ' up now for ? Hm ? Who 's on the list ? Am I on the list , Roque ? Am I on that list ? Is my name on that list ? You 're number five . How 's it feel to be on death row , Warden ? - Did you catch her body language ? - She was nervous . Or scared . Of what ? That her husband 's gonna keep his word ? A lot could have happened in her life in those 11 years . A lot probably did . - She thinks she 's on the list ? - I don 't know . But I 've been thinking a lot about that list , Scully . Scully . We 're on our way . That was the warden . There 's been another death . Who ? Roque . They found him beaten to death in the showers on death row . Gotta go now . God ! You scare me when you do that . Why ? You think it 's him ? - Where you goin ' ? - I 'm goin ' to work . Parm , I 'm scared . - You feel me ? I 'm shakin ' like a little kitten . - Hey ... Now what are you scared of ? What if somebody finds out ? I mean , what if ... Will you stop your worrying ' ? Everything 's gonna be all right . Hm ? He ain 't comin ' back , Danielle . He ain 't . Hey , you movin ' in ? I got room in my cell for ya , baby ! - Who found the body ? - One of my guards . - No one heard anything ? - Nobody who should have . I 'm ordering a lockdown until the situation is back under control . As far as I 'm concerned , anyone who had contact with Neech Manley is a suspect . Warden ? I warned you . That 's three . Warden ? Why Roque ? Neech hated Roque . They nearly tried to kill each other once . - Then why the other victims ? - He probably hated them , too . Did he have a history with the dead guards ? Neech had a small behavioural problem about a year , a year and a half ago . Fornier and the other men had to discipline him . - How badly was he beaten ? - He took his licks . So there 's a pattern here . They all had a violent history with Neech . - They all caused him to suffer physical pain . - What are you gettin ' at ? A lockdown may not solve your problem , Warden . - It 'll put a lid on it . - If it 's a conspiracy among inmates . But how many inmates could have gotten access to put that body in your office ? You 're saying the guards are involved . I 'm saying Roque may not be number three . Now , I need a name from you . I need the name of Neech 's executioner . - It 's confidential . - How many men know it ? Three men , including me . We place an ad , pay him cash . There 's no written record . - His life may be in danger . - There is no chance ... Look at it this way , Warden . If I 'm right , it 'll reduce your list of suspects to four . - I said three men knew that name . - I 'm counting Neech Manley . Mr Simon ? Perry Simon ? Couple of days ' worth of mail . Mulder . What is it ? Oh , God ! I told you , didn 't I ? You told me everything but what I need to know . - Who else is on that list ? - I can 't tell you that . - How 's he doing it ? - I really can 't tell ya . - You 'll let those men die ? - Ain 't my call ! They 'll pin it on somebody . They 'll pin it on you . - What 'll they to do to me ? - Solitary . One hour a week outside your cell , no contact with anyone . They say it can break a man . I can 't tell you , man . You 're afraid of Neech ? - I saw him . - You saw Neech ? Standing outside my cell . Big as life . Tell me who else is on the list , John . Who 's next ? I can 't tell you who 's on the list . - But I can tell you Roque wasn 't on it . - Roque 's not on it ? Mulder , can I have a minute ? I 've gone over Neech 's phone calls over the last two months . Over 30 were made to a man named Danny Charez . Twice as many as to his wife . And ? Charez has been here three times to see Speranza since the first murder . He could be working with him on the outside . Look , I 've got nothing to hide . OK , then . What 's your business with John Speranza ? I was trying to get Speranza a deal . - What kind of deal ? - Retrial , maybe . Reopen the case . I 've got connections with the government . - What kind of connections ? - I used to be an attorney . Actually , I represented Neech Manley . - You were Neech Manley 's defence lawyer ? - I was 26 . I was court appointed . I had no business on a death-penalty case . Why help Speranza now ? I heard about Neech 's death list . Word gets around . I know he blames me for him getting fried so I had to try something . You think Speranza 's got some sway with Neech ? I 'm just trying to save my ass . I 've been to the governor , Speranza , Neech 's wife ... - Why Neech 's wife ? - Maybe she 's got some mojo with him , too . Anyway , I got run outta there by her crazy boyfriend . - She has a boyfriend ? - Works at the prison . Waving a freakin ' gun in my face . Hello , John . - What do you want ? - Oh , no , sit down . Sit . - I 'm here to do you good . - What you talkin ' about ? I wanna be your advocate . I 'm gonna get ' em to look at your case again , pull a few strings . - And what do you want from me ? - Just call off the dogs . That 's all . What do you say ? Scratch my back , I 'll scratch yours . All right . I 'll have somebody from the governor 's office down here to see you by this weekend . Where have you been ? Out . Out ? What do you mean , out ? What 's with you ? You see who is sittin ' outside watching ' this house ? You see that car out there ? You know who that is ? Huh ? It 's the stupid FBI . - They came here tonight asking ' about you . - About me ? Said they saw you waving ' a gun in some lawyer 's face in my front yard . - That 's crazy ! - You said nobody knew about us . Now lookit ! Just lookit ! A woman gets lonely . Sometimes she can 't wait around for her man to be reincarnated . I think we should notify the warden . - Is that the man ? - That 's him . Parmelly . Yeah , give me Vincent Parmelly 's work sheet for the last week , please ? Thank you . - Now , you saw him with Neech 's wife ? - Yes . I hadn 't reported it , but that same guard cornered me ... - .. and made an overture for prisoner Roque . - He 's tied in with Roque ? Well , does it make sense to you that Parmelly is Neech 's assassin ? Parmelly 's a transfer in from out of state . He 's only been here six months . Well , according to an attorney we spoke to , he had brandished a gun at the residence . - What attorney ? - A man named Charez . - You know him ? - Everybody knows Danny Charez . He was found dead earlier this evening in his apartment . - Murdered ? - Suffocated to death , or so it seems . Well , he could be the fifth victim . I think somebody ought to go out and arrest Vincent Parmelly . Oh , my God ! No ... Neech ... - What the hell are you doin ' ? - He 's here . - What are you talking about ? - Neech . I saw him . Somebody 's here , but it ain 't Neech . They 're comin ' here ! - It 's you , isn 't it ? - What ? - You 're him . - You 're crazy , baby ! - Put that gun away . It 's the police out there . - I should have known . - Please open the door . - I should have opened my eyes . We 're federal agents . Open the door . - The way you touched me ... - Danielle ? - .. and the sound of your voice . - Point that gun away , Danielle . I 'm tellin ' you , they 're gonna put you away just like your old man . - Don 't you come near me . - You 're seeing ghosts . Mrs Manley , open the door . She 's got a gun on Parmelly . - Centre room , facing away . - On a count . - Drop your weapon ! - Put it down ! - Put it down ! - Drop your weapon , Danielle ! - Let 's get a paramedic in here ! - It was him . He came back . Forget it . I swear it was him . It was Neech . - No , go this ... - What you talkin ' about ? Go this way . Somebody wants to talk to you . Who wants to talk to me ? The warden 's office is that way . - We 're goin ' down here . - Uh-uh . No . Man , this is bull ! I ain 't goin ' for it ! What the hell is this ? Why do you want to talk to me in the shower ? Huh ? What the ... ? John ... - Hear about your friend Parmelly ? - He 's not my friend . Oh , he 's not your friend ? Well ... doesn 't matter any more anyway , does it ? You promised me a deal . Yeah , well , that was when there was a deal to be made . - Who else was in on it , John ? - I can tell you ... - Tell me what ? - I can tell you what I know . - Well , tell me what you know . - Neech 's list ... .. got one man left to die . What 's goin ' on out there ? What 's goin ' on ? Hey , leave him alone ! Speranza ! Hey , come on ! Why are we stopping ? You know , it just doesn 't make sense . - What ? - Laying it all on Parmelly . We 've been through this . He was only on duty for one of the guards ' murders ... .. and he didn 't know the name of Neech 's executioner . Then he was working with someone . - Why would he try to get you the list ? - To use fear as leverage for Roque 's deal . Neech hated Roque . He wouldn 't have done that , would he ? I don 't know . Maybe Parmelly didn 't stick to the original plan . I 'm sure shacking up with Neech 's wife wasn 't part of it , either . Maybe Neech 's wife killing Parmelly was part of the plan from the start , ... - .. so that he 'd take the proof to his grave . - I don 't see the motives . Do you ? I don 't think Parmelly killed anybody . Well , then who did ? Neech Manley ? Speranza and Neech 's wife both said they saw him . It 's over , Mulder . Let 's just go home .

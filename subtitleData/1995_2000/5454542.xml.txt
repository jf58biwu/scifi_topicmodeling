Let 's talk in my office . I love what 's you done with the place . ( fbi ) can 't pick up our conversation because of the frost . Look , if this is about what happened yesterday , you caught me off guard , it will not happen again . Oh , it was just a test . You know , you definitely not make a full use of your talents . In fact Tony says , you are the best " print man " he has ever seen . A real artist , he says . Well , I 've printed him a million dollars . Not saying anything . So show me . Excuse me . Come on , let 's see what you got . Which one is real ? They are both real . Guess I am an artist . You really think I wouldn 't find out who you are . What the hell are you talking about ? Tell me again . Once again . What happened in Chicago ? I told you , I was a " print man " for Tony T. What 's this ? Look at this . Jarod Puzo . Outstanding convictions for arson , extortion , fraud , outstanding warrants ¡ ­ you want me to continue ? Alright ... . I jump bail . I want it to lay low for a while . The last thing I needed was some punk making his bones by ratting me out . Ok . A few months back , couple of FBls infiltrated our organisation . - That 's not good . - Yeah .

Artist . " Federal Undercover Officer Found Murdered " " Fellow Officer Charged in Slaying " " Father Disgraced By Son 's Indictment " Your secretary said it was urgent . I 've got this surveillance tape of Satellite from Hartford office . Oh , my god . Do you know the shooter ? I think we both do . Mr. Lyle . Jarod contacted us , said Lyle 's been dogging him . Last report was he was dealing with Japanese Yakusa . Definitely Yakusa . The Yakusa punish by taking a little finger of the offending party . What 's the guy have to do to lose a thumb ? Couldn 't have a nice fellow . Question is , how was the bustard up to ? I know all the Center office is monitored . Disable the primary , the shots were from the backup units . Well , you know , all our people there are dead . Including the executive administrator , Mr. Strumps . Lyle . I want you to Hartford to clean up the mess . I am not a cleaner any more . My job is to find Jarod . You said Lyle was after Jarod , makes this your job . Somebody has to find out what else he was after . This is a ¡ ­ very delicate situation . You are the only person I can trust . Undercover agent Dean Clark was ringed today in the killing of Federal Officer Lester Knight . Our reporter caught up with Sean Flanagan , the US prosecutor who 's trying the case . You said ... that agent Dean Clark killed Federal undercover agent Knight ? Agent Clark has been charged for the homicide connection with the death of a fellow agent . They are both working undercover for the Molino crime family . I told the department not to say this time . " Father Disgraced By Son 's Indictment " He is the reason I joined RICO . I would never do anything to disgrace him . You said you were drinking with an associate of Joey Molino at the night Lester Knight was murdered . Yeah . Bobbie Two-Guns . Molino 's secondary command . They call him Two-Guns because he carries his match of thirty-eights . I told my lawyer that . Don 't you guys in the Public Defenders Office talk to each other ? So you were with this Bobbie the night that agent Knight was murdered . My assignment undercover was to take off Two-Guns . He was hanging out at Faye 's restaurant , ... me to go head to head with a bottle of gin . So , I started drinking , be assing . I got a call from agent Knight . He said someone was feeding RICO information to Molino . - Did he say who ? - No . He said " watch my back in the middle of the morning . " The same morning that agent Knight was found suffocated in a dry cleaner 's bag ? The same dry cleaner 's that you used . I was set up . Bobbie and I , polished off a quarter gin . I didn 't even remember leaving Faye 's . There is no way I could have driven over the bridge ... Knight 's , kill him and make it back home without running my car into a pole . I am telling you I was set up . The counterfeit plates come from Costa Rica . Two sizes : twenty 's , hundred 's . You have some work . You are an artist . I am getting to need the right materials . - You know the suppliers ? - Of course . - How much gonna cost ? - Hey , don 't worry about that . This deal goes down , everybody is getting fat . Hey , Joey , you got a call . - Who is it ? - I don 't know . You want me to ask ? No , just give me the phone . Hey , Faye , bring me Gibson . I 'll be right back . Is that Waikiki ? Yeah . You can see the Diamond Head in the background . It is beautiful . I suppose to go there on my honeymoon . Got put off . So , Faye , so nice girl like you don 't want a place like this . I can 't afford to move to Hawaii . Seriously , like this , sell this place and go . Joey , he sucked this place dry . I 've got no equity . How did you link up with a guy like Joey ? My husband died and left me the restaurant . I tried to make a go of it , but ran into some money trouble . Joey said he could help . Woo , big mistake . Hey , Faye , let 's go . You are the one who should get away from him , while you still can . - What happens to them ? - Nothing . They don 't exist any more . It has been a while since you work as a cleaner , Miss Parker , I am surprised . My father has his reasons . - What are we looking for ? - Anything that seems out of place or missing . Lyle wouldn 't pour out the heap like this unless this must be important . This got to be something around here . What is this ? Ah , this is an E-prong chip . - Most likely .. in the Blue Box . - Blue Box ? Each Center office has a dedicated hardware system from the mainframe , called the Blue Box . But , chips like this just couldn 't fall off . Blue Box is sealed shut . Like this ? Yeah , that would be it . What 's up ? A friend of my friend tells me that ten pallets of raw currency paper being stored in a warehouse in Brooklyn for one night . Tonight . Wow . You want to rob of the treasury department ? With uncle sam 's paper , no one but no one is going to be able to tell our bills , from the real deal . Hey . Picasso didn 't paint on toilet paper , did he ? Trust me . Did I say something funny ? " Trust me . " That 's the last thing Lester Knight said to me , standed right where you are . You slew that RICO cop here ? We locked him right where you are standing . I thought he gonna freeze to death but he suffocated first . I lost fifty bucks to Two-Guns on that bet . But hey , dead is dead , right ? I thought he had a dry cleaning bag wrapped around his head . I did that , to frame another RICO cop . I am an artist too , you know . Hi , Picasso , set it up . You will get enough paper to print a billion bucks . Have a big go , Picasso ! Yeah , baby . - Security shift changes in twenty , let 's move . - Yeah . Yeah , we got to go . The cops come . How do you know this ? Trust me , I know . Come on , let 's move . Come on . Come on , get out of here , come on . Put the hands up . Get them right from here . Stop the run . Right there . ... Get your hands off of me ! - You take Bobbie onboard . - Did you have to get me in nose ? They shouldn 't ... to take a bullet . Best to know there 's someone smelled like cat-food for at least a month . How long have you been staying in that fish bath ? Let 's just say the dry cleaner was not my business any more . No , no , no , leave them on . The more bruises , the less questions they are going to ask . Jarod , we put a lot of pressure on people of Chicago to .. for you . Now if you think Joey .. , we pull you out right now . We don 't want to lose another undercover agent . I am too close to bear out now . So why did you set up this phony bust ? Molino seems to know everything before we do . Looking for a link . And ? And , he gets a phone call . And he takes off before you guys get there . Could be a coincidence ? No . There is a rat on the ship . It 's a big one . Look , this wasn 't a rag merchan you morons boosted It was the US treasury department . I told you already . We were going to meet some friends and we went to the wrong warehouse . Flanagan , we got a couple of wags who got their brains dead How can you tell ? Now , who look stupid ? Us , or the guys who lost two undercover cops ? You guys know what you are looking at ? Twenty years . Funny . That 's what Dean Clark is looking at . Must be a real disappointment for you , fellows . You don 't get it real in the morning . The chance of putting Joey Molino away forever . So you guys get wise crack all you want . This time , I win . The game is not over yet . You can 't be serious . Molino 's lawyer is in Judge Driger 's chambers . Apparently somebody forgot to read these gentlemen their rights . What ? Oops . Cut them loose . Cut them loose ? You heard me . It looks like this time you lose . Well , I made a diagnosis . There is definitely certain chip missing . Isn 't there any way of determining what sort of information was stored on ? It 's impossible to know what 's on it , more specifically what 's not . Nothing is impossible . Keep working . So what happened at the warehouse ? The friend of the friend set it up . Turns out it had a poor violation . So with plan both ends against middle , so we would have to go back to start . Look , no things can turn out one hundred percent . But we got enough paper to make a score . And the friend of the friend ? Let 's just say that he won 't be talking to anyone any more . And I 'm mailing his wife a liitle present . Is that a tongue ? Look , the paper we got is good . So everything is gonna be okay . I am counting on it . - Oh , Bobbie . - Yeah . - I got you something too . - What ? The guy 's brains ? Something better . A little congrats for getting out of jail . That is your drink , right ? I can 't believe this guy . - Thanks . - Don 't mention it . All the panels and all the blue boxes , contain sensitive information , could jeopardize the operations if falling on the wrong hands . Lyle obviously knew it . He could get a price from one of these panels . Set himself up , make him move back into the Center . So this time he has to be dealt with full finality . Situation has to be cleaned , but has to play close to the best . You want me to set it up ? Daddy ? I am not an assassin . You are sure you do the right thing . It 's taking a lot of manuring to rebuild my position here . And Lyle 's reappearance make me look inefficient . Daddy . Angel , it 's about us protecting each other . If you don 't protect me , I can 't protect you . I am going home , and finish my present . - I 'll see you in the morning . - Later . Hey , Nicky , give me a ride , alright ? Can I get you something else ? I 'll have vodka and rocks , if you join me . - Twist my arm . - Let me get it . No , no . Not that . Joey waters it down , I keep the good stuff back in the freezer . Oh ... Wait ¡ ­ wait a minute . No , thank you , I will pass . I don 't want drink anything that comes from the place where , you know , the cop died . What are you talking about ? Joey told me how they .. the RICO cop in the deep freeze . Oh , my god . You didn 't know . That was the night Joey had me shut the place down early . I just thought ... I had no idea they killed someone . What about Dean Clark ? You know that undercover cop that was charged of the murder of Lester Knight , Is he here that night ? He was in the bar , he was drinking gin with Bobbie . He was so plastered they had to carry him out of here . Are you okay ? I am just pulling my head out of the sand . One cop is dead . And an innocent one is going to be executed for it . Hell ! How did I get here ? And how do I get out ? Central records please . Yes , this is officer 557E . I 'd like to get a copy of all the requests made in the last two days for a rap sheet on one Jarod Puzo . Yes , I 'll hold . Who ? Thank you . That 's all the information I need . You can 't take it all . I need change for the customers . Keeps all ... , Faye , your head 'll wind up on the wall next to your Hawaii shot . I don 't believe this . What did you say ? Hey , hey , Joey , Joey , the customers . You want the money to keep coming in this place , don 't you ? Where is Bobbie ? He didn 't come in today . He has married to the toilet . So much drunk . Mush . I 'll suppose to be across town . I can make the delivery for you . No one will be late with the gift . Alright . - Make suer it 'll be there by ten o 'clock . - Not a problem . I don 't want to get a phone call . Good evening , Mr. Flanagan . Where is Bobbie ? Plumbing problems . You are the white ass in the interview room . First impressions can be so misguided . You tell Joey , if he wants our arrangements to continue , I would need more money . The people have to be paid . - I understand . - Good . Just make sure you do . No doubt about it . Make sure that Broots takes focus on finding Jarod . You know how he is . We need proof for what happens on ADD goes on diagnosed . What did he ask you to do ? I tell Broots what to do . Your father . It doesn 't matter . I don 't believe you , Parker . Lyle shows up and suddenly you are a cleaner again for one job . What did your father ask you to do ? He wants me to handle the situation . To kill him ? Lyle has come in whatever he has come in . You sound like you actually believe it . I do . What ? What 's the name of it ? Lyle has been located in a hotel in Providence . What are you going to do about it , Parker ? To go and to handle the situation . And then ? And then I am gonna go home and sleep like a baby . Check . Mate . I warned you . - That seat 's taken . - Eugene Clark ? Maybe . I am a friend of Dean 's . You are a wise guy . You got some nerve coming here like this . I think it 's agaist the law to hit a federal agent . A federal agent ? You worked with Dean ? No . But I know he respects you . He would never do anything to hurt you . Look , I am not a father . But I am a son , and I know , the feelings that a son has . Wanting to grow up like his father . Wanting to make him proud . I used to think that was Dean . But last three months , I 've been wrecked my brain wondering where I went wrong . You did the best you could . I got to go . Mr. Clark . Dean is a good cop . Don 't give up on him . Lyle has been located in a hotel in Providence . What are you going to do about it , Parker ? What are you going to do about it ? This time he has to be dealt with full finality . What are you going to do about it ? I am not an assassin . This time he has to be dealt with full finality . Full finality . Finality . What are you going to do about it ? I am not an assassin . You 're sure you do the right thing ... . - Yes . - So close and yet so far . That 's become some one of an anthem for you , hasn 't it ? - Mr. Lyle . - Don 't be disappointed , Miss Parker . You can 't catch Jarod , what chance you to get with me ? You sound like you 're catching a cold , it must be dark and wet where you are . That 's temporary condition . We want the computer chip . I can 't do that . Now that I want to keep the rest of my .. If you excuse me , I 've got a running with a very anxious buyer . Twenty million dollars , Miss Parker . God bless me the American Dream ! You got something behind . You 've reached Hillman Marine . At the present , no one is availablt to take your call . Our normal business hours are from ... - Broots . - You have ever heard a place called " Hillman " ? Oh , yes , in Connecticut . It 's where the Center 's data backup warehouse is located . The what ? Every friday night at eleven fifty-nine PM , all the Center mainframe from all across country do this mass computer backup , and to this giant system from the Blue Boxes . Boxes . You think Lyle is trying to infiltrate the warehouse ? Can you think of a reason why he would ? It 's how he could decrypt it . What are you talking about ? The semiconduct panel he stole is encrypt . The code 's impossible to break . But if he were able to input this panel into the warehouse mainframe , at eleven fifty-nine PM , on ... tonight ! Tonight , when the backup occurs , it will automatically decrypt , whatever information is on it . What is how he gets twenty million for it . Twenty million ? Man , crime does pay . Alright , listen , is it located by a river , a lake , the ocean , something like that ? A river , yeah . He rented a boat . He does his business , he runs out to ... he escapes in a boat . Unless ¡ ­ Unless I make sure he doesn 't . Plates came in . They 've been delivered this afternoon . Excellent . Have them sent here . Here ? Yeah . Who is gonna surprised when we shut this dump down ? We print the money here and we 'll torch the place . What about Faye ? We can 't leave any witnesses , can we ? " Hillman Marine " Midnight stroke . How did you find me ? I hit redial . This is always the simple thing , isn 't it ? The chip . You know , twenty million dollars but two wages apparently out of the question . Why followed Jarod if this is what you wanted ? That was payoff the debt . Jarod is to win friends and influence people . I bring the man , all is forgivable . The Center welcomes ... We 'll see . So they sent you to clean up ? - Really gonna kill me ? - That 's up to you . Then why are you still talking about it ? It isn 't as easy as it looks , is it ? You know why you don 't want to kill me ? Because you are me . It is natural desire for poeple like us to dominate the fine . You and I have nothing in common . We bo ... We both recognise , that this notion of human equality just perpetuates mediocrity . But we are not mediocrity . Are we , Miss Parker ? We are independent . And independence , is the privilege of the strong . Tell me , Miss Parker . How strong are you ? Strong enough . How strong are you ? Test me . Nice working with you . Yeah . Mr. Flanagan ? I hold a restaurant called Jax . How did you get this number ? Some friends of yours are over there now setting you up to take a big fall . I hope you remember this call if I need help in the future . - Yeah . - There were some cops hanging around the bar . Cops ? I overheard one say Flanagan was going to set you up for a big fall tonight . I thought you should know . What the hell is this ? Turn around slowly and put your pistol on the pool table . So what the hell is ( cellophane ! ) And why you get to pay extra afford anyway ? What is this ? I just thought you 'd like to see how Lester Knight looked , after you and Joey killed him . Who are you ? Turn around and walk . Get in it . You are a dead man , Jarod . You hear me , you are dead . Woo , you need a chill out . It 's look cramp in there . Imagine how Dean Clark must feel in his cell . You are a RICO . Did you know about this ? What you think ! Well the truth is I am not really a cop or a mobster . It 's sort of complicated . Now each of you is responsible for the murder of Lester Knight . So I thought it will be really need if you feel like he felt . Listen , Jarod . - It wasn 't my idea about ... - Shut up , Joey . Shut up . Lester Knight found about Flanagan and Flanagan bumped him off . Yeah , you dumped the body and then you framed Dean Clark . Listen , Jarod , I 'll give anything you want . Actually you 've just given me everything I need . Jarod , please . You just you can 't leave me in here and die . It doesn 't really matter if you freeze , or you suffocate . Like you say , Joey . Dead is dead . - Hey . - Jarod , no . - Dead is dead . You are dead . It is a mess , Miss Parker . No head . One of his arms , both of his legs are missing . I 'm guessing he got chewed up by the prop of a very large boat . But it is him . Thumb is got away . Mr. Lyle . Put a gun on you . And made the choice for you . I 'll see you later . Miss Parker . Will you be alright ? I 'm just tired , Syd . I am gonna go home to bed . And I am feeling I am going to sleep like a baby . I ... on that semiconduct chip before Raines had it confiscated . It contained codes . It is a computer chip , Broots . No , no , no . I don 't think you understand . It contained genetic codes . Genetic codes ? - Yeah . - For what ? I think the properer question will be " for whom " ? And ? I am not a geneticist . I just can 't help wondering if it has ... it 's something to do with Jarod . How is my angel ? There were genetic codes on that stolen panel . Don 't worry about . That 's not important . Important enough to have me killed a man . Well , he is the enemy . You did the right thing . For who ? Smell like a cleaner .. can 't .. this life . Let 's rest , angel . You look like a hell . It 's a joke . After you testify in court , and all those blows over , send me a postcard from Hawaii . Hawaii ? I don 't even have enough money to get to Jersey . You do now . Where did this come from ? Joey 's private account . All the money he took from you . Plus interest . Who are you really ?

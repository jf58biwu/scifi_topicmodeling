 - Mr. Simon ? Are you ready ? - Yeah . Let 's go . Excuse me , Warden . It 's 5 : 00 , sir . - How 's Neech ? - He 's still in with his wife . No , I mean how is he ? How 's he doing ? Well , he won 't eat his meal , and he won 't see the chaplain . - Told him to get the hell out . - What about the hired man ? He 's traveling . All right . Let 's get Neech prepped . Yes , sir . If God can 't save his sorry ass , neither can l . [ Door Buzzes ] Time 's up , Neech ! 2,000 volts , man . You ain 't never coming back , freak ! [ Laughing ] [ Woman ] It 's just like I 've always told you . - I swear on my life , Neech . - Time to go . [ Tapping Bars ] I ain 't ever gonna love another man . You hear me ? I won 't . I won 't betray our love . Ever . It 's time , Neech . Time to go . That phone call 's gonna come , and the governor is gonna come through . Gotta go now . [ Door Buzzes ] We 've got a hood if you want it . - It 's your option . - No . Is there anything you want to say , Neech ? Last words ? Yeah . I 've been here 11 years , 56 days , and now you 're gonna murder me . The Lord says thou shall be merciful and just . I know no mercy . Allah says the spirit shall rise again ... and be reborn into this life . - The soul shall be recast , - You should begin , Father . - born unto new flesh . - " The Lord is my shepherd- - " I will return to avenge all the petty tyranny ... and the cruelty I have suffered . I will be recast , reincarnated , reunion of spirit and flesh . Mark my words . Five men will die . - Save it . - Five men will go down ! This will be my justice ! This will be my law ! This will be my capital punishment , and no stay of execution will be granted , for there is no prejudice , no evidence to be admitted , - no lawyer who did not perform his job . - Fry him . These men will die righteous deaths ! - [ Electricity Humming ] - [ Straining ] Napoleon " Neech " Manley . He was convicted in 1 984 for double murder ... in the holdup of a Florida liquor store . The actual gunman was killed in the pursuit . Manley was driving the getaway car and got sentenced to death . He was put to death in the electric chair three days ago . He 'd been to the chair twice before , but the governor granted him last-minute stays . Third time 's a charm . What 's your interest in this ? Manley was interesting . He was well-read , charismatic . He became a writer , a kind of prison philosopher . A week before his execution , word went through the prison ... that Neech said he was gonna be reincarnated . He was gonna come back from the dead . Well , reincarnation has always been popular on death row for obvious reasons . Apparently , this was more than just a dying man 's hope against hope . - What do you mean ? - Manley didn 't just claim that he was gonna come back , but that he was gonna take vengeance on five men who had mistreated him . Yesterday a death row guard was found dead inside the cell ... that Manley had occupied those 11 years . His death cannot be explained . [ Scully ] Has a cause of death been determined ? Suffocation , near as we can tell . Somebody must have snuffed him with a pillow . [ Mulder ] Any idea how one of your guards could get murdered ... in an empty cell like this ? No . It 's not supposed to happen , not with all the precautions we 're taking . I see the guards here all wear panic devices . Was the victim 's activated ? No . Apparently , he never touched it . [ Mulder ] According to our reports , there were threats this might happen . There 's always threats of violence in here . Prison 's nothing but a police state , basically . Do you give any credence to Neech Manley 's claims ... that he was gonna come back and take revenge ? Neech Manley . Hmm . A smart man . Very smart man . In fact , if he 'd stayed outside , I would have figured him for a Nobel Prize . But he made a mistake . Paid for it with his life . A man of that intelligence , you put him inside for 10 or 11 years , you 're gonna have to pay for it . - What do you mean ? - There 's nothing but bitterness and resentment in here ... 7 days a week , 24 hours a day , 365 days a year . It gets honed to a real fine point . So you 're saying that Manley planned this ... and is carrying it out with the help of someone else . Elaborate as Shakespeare . Now , if you want to see the victim 's body- - [ Guard ] Visitors coming through ! Woman on the block ! We 're holding the corpse until the state pathologist ... comes down this afternoon and conducts the official autopsy . That information should help us solve the murder . [ Mulder ] Did Manley have many friends among the prisoners ? A man has to have friends in prison to keep an eye on his enemies . A man has to have friends in prison to keep an eye on his enemies . - Mostly , people were just afraid of him . - Warden ? - What is it ? - The body . I think you should take a look . I suggest you get it into refrigeration , or you 're not gonna have anything left to autopsy . Oh , God . [ Mulder ] I 've been told you believe Neech Manley 's claims . It 's not a matter of how or if he 's coming back . The question is , when ... - is he coming back again ? - What are you saying , Speranza ? You believe Manley killed that guard ? - How would you explain it ? - A prisoner waits for an opportunity- - Hey , look around . We ain 't got but an opportunity ... to itchy-scratchy outside our cells . Yeah , but you 've got prisoners on work detail . Trustees . A man slips away . This is " Q " block , death row . Don 't nobody come in and out of here ... without a guard watching , and lately , you got double that . Why ? 'Cause everybody 's afraid of what they say can 't be true . - Neech is back . - Reincarnated . Well , he would have called it " transmigration of the soul . " - Into what form ? - You , me , this mattress- - I don 't know . He didn 't specify , but he 's back . I can feel it . The man was electric , you know what I 'm saying ? Pure energy . Would it be possible to see the cell where the guard was murdered ? I 'll open it up for you . - Any idea how he did it ? - Like I said , the man- - - [ Wolf Whistle ] - [ Man ] Yeah , sweet roja ! Nothing 's been touched . It 's pretty much the way Neech left it . [ Flies Buzzing ] - Did you know Neech Manley ? - Oh , yeah . I knew him . - What was he like ? - Neech ? - Neech was so full of B.S. , he couldn 't stand it . - How is that ? He actually started to believe that crap he 'd been preaching all those years , as if knowing all them religions made him some kind of god . - Who do you think killed the guard ? - I don 't know who killed him , but I damn well know who didn 't kill him . Are you afraid at all ? Me ? I just keep my ass covered and my eyes peeled . - Same as always . - [ Man ] Fornier ! Hey , down here ! I 'm gonna check back on your partner . - Everything okay in there ? - [ Mulder ] Yeah , we 're fine . Shh ! [ Whispering ] I 'm not gonna hurt you . I only want to talk to you , okay ? I know who he 's going to kill . There 's a list . One of the cons has it . A man named Roque . Who are you ? My name 's Parmelly . I want to help you . [ Fornier ] Agent Scully ? I was just looking around . Not a place for a woman to be doing that alone . Mulder . - I 'm ready to go now . - Okay . I 'll be right there . - Guard ! - What 's wrong , Scully ? I 'm just ready to get out of here . [ Door Buzzes ] [ Man Laughing ] [ Guard ] I want every paintbrush and putty knife ... to be accounted for , understand ? Come on , gentlemen , move it . It 's the guard . It 's Fornier . Come on , you guys . Break it up . Get back . I said get back . I guess they haven 't recovered the body yet , so it 's going to be difficult to establish an exact cause of death . What did your preliminary exam turn up ? Well , it looks like the head was severed just below the jaw line ... with repeated stabbing blows from a putty knife . There were no other indications of trauma to the head . From the eyewitness reports , there were already fly larvae infesting the flesh . That seems unusual , considering the short time-of-death window . Not altogether . Here , let me show you this . Lucilia Cuprina , better known as the green bottle fly . They can lay their eggs within a minute after death occurs , and they breed more rapidly in a hot , humid environment . In the anaerobic environment inside the paint can ? On my autopsy on the first victim , the lungs were absolutely alive with infestation . Hmm . What was determined to be the cause of that death ? Best I can figure , given the lack of indicators , he was suffocated to death . Either that ... or he drowned . [ Jail Door Unlocks ] [ Guard ] You 've got a visitor , Roque . - I hear you have a list . - I prefer not to talk about it here . Not on the block . Guard ? You 's a dead man , Roque ! You hear me ? I 'm gonna peel that head like an onion ! I 'm gonna break you off a big chunk ! You hear me ? He ain 't gonna tell you nothing but a bunch of lies ! You talk , punk , I gonna make you my Maytag ! He 's a liar ! How did you come by this list you claim to have ? I heard Neech on the bars one night telling Speranza . - How many names are on the list ? - Five . just like Neech said . So you knew those two guards were gonna be murdered . I knew they were on the list , yeah . Who do you think killed them ? I don 't know . I just know who 's on the list . You want to make some kind of deal , huh ? That 's right . I want a transfer out of this hole . Why ? Are you on the list ? I ain 't saying nothing . Not until I get my deal . Well , what if they don 't give you what you want ? Then they 're gonna see the other three die . - Can 't do it . I can 't make that deal . - You don 't have the authority ? No . If I make that deal , I might as well go into the deal-making business . Every con with half a brain would come up with a scheme like that . What if it saves three lives ? Isn 't that a deal worth making ? Look , my job is about controlling anarchy . I don 't run this prison . I just patrol it . Basically , it 's war in here . We have freedom . They don 't . Anything these men want , somehow it finds its way in here . They want another prisoner dead , somebody 's gonna find a way to put a shiv in . These aren 't prisoners . These are guards you 've got being murdered . Yes , and if I back down now , all I 'll be doing ... is sending a message about the benefits of killing prison guards . There 's a conspiracy at work here . I don 't know who 's behind it . But I am gonna crack it . That 's my job . Ohh- - What the hell ? Guard ! Guard ! Guard ! Get in here ! I guess he 'll be able to finish up that autopsy now , Scully . [ Scully ] He had quite a library . [ Mulder ] Yeah . Looks like Neech Manley knew his Bible . Listen to this . " I come in return to the beginning of the end ... " to begin again the journey of souls , the godhead universal for whom there is no death , only life eternal . " - What 's that from ? - Neech Manley , 1994 . This stuff goes on for pages . There 's references to the Hindu Atman , Prarabdha , the Rosicrucians , Zoroastrianism . The man was obsessed with reincarnation . Being obsessed with it doesn 't mean you can do it . Unless he knew something we don 't . Like what ? The secret password ? Every major world religion encompasses the idea of life after death . That means millions of people believe in some kind of transmigration ... or rebirth of the soul . I 'm sorry , Mulder . That 's not what I learned in catechism . Well , even Christianity teaches about the resurrection ... and ascendancy of the heavenly body . Do you honestly believe that Neech Manley came back from the dead to kill those two men ? - Is there another theory ? - A very good one , and one much more believable . That this is a complex scheme , that the headless man planted behind the warden 's desk ... is the work of a conspiracy of inmates . Or guards . Okay , but imagine if it were true , Scully . Imagine if you could come back and take out five people who had caused you to suffer . - Who would they be ? - I only get five ? I remembered your birthday this year , didn 't I , Scully ? Well , here 's somebody we haven 't talked to yet . - She should know better than anybody else . - [ Knocking On Door ] - Mrs. Manley ? - Yes ? We 're from the F.B.I. We 'd like to ask you a few questions about your husband . I had this dream . Had it many times . They put Neech in that chair , then they flipped the switch , but that he wouldn 't die . They couldn 't kill him . He 's a powerful man . - A very powerful man . - Did he share his thoughts about dying with you ? Neech wasn 't afraid to die . Because of his beliefs ? Sometimes- - See , I only got to have personal visiting days ... right before the execution dates . There was three in the last 1 1years . But sometimes ... I could feel the power of his beliefs ... right through that visiting glass . You think he 's come back , don 't you ? You know , I think that if anyone could , it 'd be Neech . [ Door Buzzes ] Getup , Roque . Putting on the chains . Hey , man , for what ? The warden wants to talk to you . - Other way . - Where we going ? This way . Let go of my arm ! I 'm going ! What you want with me anyway ? Stop pushing ! Hey , Roque . - I want to talk to you about this list . - I ain 't saying nothing . Come on , Roque , you got a big mouth . What are you shutting up now for , huh ? Who 's on the list ? Am I on the list , Roque ? Am I on that list ? Is my name on that list ? You 're number five . How 's it feel to be on death row , Warden ? Did you catch her body language ? She was nervous ... or scared . Of what ? That her husband 's gonna keep his word ? A lot could have happened in her life in those 11 years Neech was in prison . - A lot probably did . - You mean she thinks she 's on the list ? I don 't know , but I 've been thinking a lot about that list , Scully . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] Scully . We 're on our way . That was the warden . There 's been another death . - Who ? - Roque . They found him beaten to death in the showers on death row . [ Man ] Gotta go now . [ Gasps , Sighs ] Oh , God . You scare me when you do that . Why ? You think it 's him ? - Wh-Where are you going ? - I 'm going to work . Parm , I 'm scared . You feel me ? I 'm shaking like a little kitten . Hey . Now what are you scared of ? What if somebody finds out ? l-l mean , what if- - Will you stop your worrying ? Everything 's gonna be all right . Hmm ? He ain 't coming back , Danielle . He ain 't . Hey . Hey , you movin ' in ? Got room in my cell for you , baby . - Who found the body ? - One of my guards . - No one heard anything ? - Nobody who should have . I 'm ordering a lockdown of this facility until the situation is under control . As far as I 'm concerned , anyone who had contact with Neech Manley ... is a suspect . Warden ? [ Parmelly ] I warned you . That 's three . Warden ? Why Roque ? Neech hated Roque . They pretty near tried to kill each other once . - Then why the other victims ? - Neech probably hated them too . Did Neech have a history with the guards who died ? Neech had a small behavioral problem ... about a year , a year and a half ago . Fornier and the other men had to , uh , discipline him . How badly was he beaten ? - He took his licks . - So there 's a pattern here . A logic . All these men had a violent history with Neech . They all caused him to suffer physical pain . - What are you getting at ? - A lockdown may not solve your problem , Warden . - Sure as hell put a lid on it . - If it 's a conspiracy among the inmates . But how many inmates could have put that body in your office ? How many could have gotten access ? You 're saying the guards are involved ? I 'm saying that Roque may not be victim number three . Now , I need a name from you . I need the name of Neech 's executioner . - It 's confidential . - How many men know it ? Three men , including me . We place an ad , pay him in cash . - There 's no written record . - His life may be in danger . - There is no chance- - - Look at it this way , Warden . If I 'm right , it 'll reduce your list of suspects to four . I said three men knew that name . I 'm counting Neech Manley . Mr. Simon ? Perry Simon ? Couple of days ' worth of mail . Mulder . What is it ? Oh , God . I told you , didn 't I ? You told me everything but what I need to know . Who else is on that list , John ? - I can 't tell you that . - How 's he doing it , John ? - I really can 't tell you . - And you 're just gonna let those men die ? - Ain 't my call ! - They 're gonna pin it on somebody ! - They 're gonna pin it on you . - They 're gonna what ? - What are they gonna do to me ? - Put you in solitary . One hour a week outside your cell , no contact with anyone . They say it can break a man . I can 't tell you , man . You 're afraid of Neech ? - I saw him . - You saw Neech . Standing outside my cell , big as life . Tell me who else is on the list , John . Who 's next ? I can 't tell you who 's on the list . But I can tell you Roque ... wasn 't on it . - [ Door Opens ] - Roque 's not on it ? Mulder , can I have a minute ? I 've just been going over Neech 's phone calls over the last two months . Over 30 of them were made to a man named Danny Charez , - twice as many as to his own wife . - And ? Charez has been here three times to see Speranza since the first murder . He could be working with him on the outside . Look , I 've got nothing to hide . Okay , then . What 's your business with John Speranza ? I was trying to get Speranza a deal . - What kind of deal ? - Retrial maybe . Reopen the case . I got some connections with the government . What kind of connections ? I used to be an attorney . Actually , I represented Neech Manley . You were Neech Manley 's defense lawyer ? I was 26 . I was court-appointed . I had no business on a death-penalty case . Why help Speranza now ? I heard about Neech 's death list . Word gets around . And I know he blames me for him getting fried , so I figured I got to try something . You think Speranza 's got some sway with Neech ? I 'm just trying to save my ass . I 've been to the governor , Speranza , Neech 's wife- - Why Neech 's wife ? Maybe she 's got some mojo with him too . I don 't know . Anyway , I got run out of there by her crazy boyfriend . - She has a boyfriend ? - Works at the prison . Waving a freakin ' gun in my face . - Hello , John . - What do you want ? Oh , no , sit down , sit . I 'm here to do you good . - What you talking about ? - I want to be your advocate . I 'm gonna get them to look at your case again , pull a few strings up in Tallahassee . - And what do you want from me ? - Just call off the dogs . That 's all . What do you say ? Scratch my back , I 'll scratch yours . All right . I 'll have somebody from the governor 's office down here to see you by this weekend . [ Clanking ] [ Gasps , Muffed Screaming ] [ Danielle ] Where have you been ? - Out . - Out . What do you mean , out ? What 's with you ? You see who 's sitting outside watching this house ? You see that car out there ? You know who that is ? Huh ? It 's the stupid F.B.I. They came here tonight asking about you . - About me ? - Said they saw you ... waving a gun in some lawyer 's face in my front yard . - That 's crazy ! - I thought you said nobody knew about us . Now look it ! just look it . A woman gets lonely . Sometimes she can 't wait around for a man to be reincarnated . I think we should notify the warden . [ Engine Starts ] - Is that the man ? - That 's him . Parmelly . Yeah , give me Vincent Parmelly 's work sheet for the last week . Thank you . Now , you say you saw him with Neech 's wife ? Yes . I hadn 't reported it , but that same guard also cornered me ... and made an overture for prisoner Roque . - He 's tied in with Roque ? - Well , does it make sense to you ... that Parmelly is Neech 's assassin ? I don 't know Parmelly that well . He 's a transfer in from out of state . He 's only been here six months . According to an attorney , he had brandished a gun at the residence . What attorney ? A man named Charez . - [ Scoffs ] - You know him ? Everybody knows Danny Charez . - He was found dead earlier this evening at his apartment . - Murdered ? Suffocated to death , or so it seems . Well , he could be the fifth victim . I think somebody ought to go out and arrest Vincent Parmelly . Oh , my God . No . Neech . What the hell you doing ? - He 's here . - What are you talking about ? Neech . I saw him . Somebody 's here , but it ain 't Neech . They 're coming here . - It 's you , isn 't it ? - What ? - You 're him . - You 're crazy , baby . [ Knocking ] Put that gun away , Danielle . That 's the police out there . - This is Agent Mulder . Please open the door . - I should 've known . I should 've opened my eyes . Mrs. Manley , we 're federal agents . Open the door . - The way you touched me . - [ Mulder ] Danielle ! And the sound of your voice . Point that gun away , Danielle . I 'm telling you . They 're gonna put you away just like your old man . - Don 't you come near me . - You 're seeing ghosts . Mrs. Manley , open the door . [ Knocking Continues ] She 's got a gun on Parmelly . Center room , facing away . - On a count . - [ Gunshot ] - Drop your weapon ! - [ Scully ] Put it down ! - Put it down ! - Drop your weapon , Danielle . Let 's get a paramedic in here . It was him . He came back . Forget it . I swear it was him . It was Neech . - No , we 're going this- - - What you talkin ' about ? - Somebody wants to talk to you . - What kind of crap is this ? Who wants to talk tome ? Well , the warden 's office is that way . - We 're going down here . - Uh-uh . No . Man , this is bull ! I ain 't going for it ! What the hell is this , man ? Why do you wanna talk tome in the shower for anyway ? What the- - john . [ Laughing ] Hear about your friend Parmelly tonight ? - He 's not my friend . - Oh , he 's not your friend ? Well , it doesn 't matter anymore anyway , does it , huh ? - You promised me a deal . - Yeah , well , that was when there was a deal to be made . Who else was in on it , John ?

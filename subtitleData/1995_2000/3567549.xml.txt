 Previously on The Pretender . - I 've been thinking about Mom lately . - Me too . Every day . Unlike everyone else around here ... I 'm not afraid of your father . Things haven 't been the same since they got here . You pull a gun on me , no big deal , ' cause I know ... you don 't have the rocks to pull the trigger . - [ Gun Cocks ] - You gonna shoot me ? Cafeteria closed ? Uh , Miss Parker . Everyone 's supposed to leave the Centre for today 's fire security test . Then why are you playing with matches ? I don 't follow . Hayes , if you 're going to work for me ... you need to understand three things : First , keep the tie straight . Second , get a new tie . [ Chuckles ] And the third ? Candy 's for the clients . [ Clears Throat ] [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Beeps ] - What ? - [ Speakerphone . Mr. Parker ] Ah , there you are , sweetheart . - Daddy ? Is that you ? Unless you got another father somewhere I don 't know about . Listen , I tried you at the house . What are you doing at the Centre on a Sunday , especially this Sunday ? False alarm on Jarod . Where are you ? I 'm about to get on a Centre helicopter . I 'll be in Blue Cove tonight . But your vacation - I didn 't feel like layin ' around on the beach . I couldn 't forget what day this is . Thinkin ' a lot about your mother . - You have ? - Surprised ? [ Clears Throat ] Um , um - It 's just that you 've never called me like this ... on this day , I mean . Well , when you get to where I am in life , regrets start to eat you up . Listen , there are a lot of things I 've been ... meaning to say to you and to her ... for a long time . I 'm here , Daddy , for-for you . I 'll be there at 7 : 00 . Will you ? [ Inhales ] I was just leaving for the cemetery ... but we could go ... see Mom together . Yeah , for once it 'll be just - just the three of us . Wait for me . - I 'll be at home . - [ Dial Tone ] Daddy ? [ Sighs ] [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Mama , no . Mama , no . ! Let me go . Please . Oh , no . ! Oh , no . ! Let me go . I miss you , Mom . The anniversary of a parent 's death can be a heavy cross to bear ... especially alone . If you 'd like company at the cemetery ? Thanks , but I won 't be bearing the cross alone this year . Your father ? [ Sighs ] I have visited my mother 's grave every year on the anniversary of her death ... but my father would never talk about it . [ Inhales ] Why is it people wait until the end of their lives before ... they ... face regrets ? Regret is born of , uh , buried emotion . But your mother 's death is a wound ... a wound not even the Parkers can ignore forever . You 've never seen him grieve , have you ? Until you do , until you can share your grief with him ... it will never heal . Daughter ... sad . Well , well , well . Look what the cat dragged in . - Stealing office supplies ? - Hmm . Reviewing your past attempts to catch Jarod . - Not pretty . - [ Sighs ] Splash a little color on , love . It-You look depressing . [ Phone Rings ] - Daddy ? - Have you spoken to your father today ? - What the hell do you want ? - I want to help you . - Where are you now ? - I 'm leaving Blue Cove . What is it , Jarod ? Turn around and get back to the Centre as fast as you can . - Why ? - Someone is going to kill your father . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Jarod ] Someone has ordered your father 's assassination . My source says there 's a file in the Centre 's mainframe tagged " Arkham " . Apparently , it explains everything . Jarod , this is the wrong day for games . I know what today is , Miss Parker . The Centre took your mother away from you ... just like they took me away from mine . Don 't let them finish the job by killing your father . My father kept you in the Centre your entire life , Jarod . Why would you want to help him ? Because if he dies , my answers die with him ... and so do yours . [ Man ] Jarod , I don 't know about this . Mr. Conti , I 've spoken with Chris 's former counselors . We all agree he 's ready for this climb , both mentally and physically . [ Conti ] I wanna believe ... that hiking and mountain climbing are gonna help ... but ever since Chris 's car accident last year ... we 've tried therapists , retreats , vacations , everything . - I just want the old Chris back . - That 's why I 'm here . Chris lost his best friend . It takes time to heal from that kind of pain . Spoken like a man who 's experienced some loss himself . I 'm not giving up on your son without a fight . Chris . Jarod Crockett . Got a tough trail ahead of us if we 're gonna beat these other teams back to the base camp . You ready to climb this monster ? I 'm ready to go home . [ Sighs ] [ Broots ] The truth is , I 'd rather be home . I 'm missing my daughter 's dance class . The Arkham files , Broots . Focus . It 'd be a lot easier at my workstation . I don 't know why we can 't use the tech room . - Because the tech room is the first place they would look . - Who ? There 's nobody here . The people trying to kill my father . What ? - Oh , God . I 'm sorry . - Now you know what this is about . Okay . Arkham . Have you been able to reach your father ? His phone 's dead . So 's the radio on the chopper . He lands on the Tower helipad in ... four hours . [ Sighs ] Sydney , when he called , he - he was reaching out to me . - Careful , Parker . - [ Sighs ] He 's disappointed you before . Syd , you were there the day that my mother was killed . Did you ever see him - Hmm . Grieve over her ? Tell me . Moments after she died , your father told me never to speak about it - not to you , Jarod , anyone . He ordered me back to work as if nothing had happened . Then - [ Muttering ] What ? What ? Then he said , " Life goes on . " Hmm . [ Angelo ] Daughter sad . Everyone sad . [ Panting ] Daughter sad . Ah . [ Humming ] [ Chris ] This compass isn 't working right . - I think we 're lost . - I think you 're right . Whatever . It 's not my fault . [ Sighs ] You have to report positions to me . We 're a team out here . We have to communicate . [ Scoffs ] You guides are all the same . You 're all tryin ' to bug me out . Bug you out ? Yeah . Get me to communicate ? You want me to talk about stuff . Back off . I don 't need your help . You don 't have to go through this alone . Let 's just climb , okay ? [ Sighs ] Well , that might be easier than you think . " Jeep is dead . Have gone ahead to station . " You thinkin ' what I 'm thinking ? - What ? - Shortcut . We get this thing working , take the fire trail out of here ... - and we beat everybody to the cliff face . - I don 't know . Come on . We 'll get done faster . It 'll be our little secret . - [ Hood Unlatches ] - You 're good with secrets . Aren 't you , Chris ? I got it . ! I got Arkham . [ Squeaking ] - Arkham ? - What are you doing here ? I live here . You wheeze , and I 'll shoot you . [ Broots ] Uh , Miss Parker ? - We have a little problem here . - Open the file , Broots . I can 't . The file has a doorbell on it , and if I open it , a warning 's gonna be sent - Then whoever is behind this will know we 're here . Ding-dong . He already does . Do it . - [ Typing ] - Aw , it 's encrypting . - It 's turning into gibberish . - Did you see what it said ? - Uh , " Neutralization , 1900 hours . ' " - [ Sydney ] 7.00 p.m. That 's the exact time your father is due to land on the Tower helipad . So it 's true . You 're gonna murder my father . I have no knowledge of this . You son of a bitch . [ Alarm Blares ] I 'd say we 're all in the dark on this one , Miss Parker . - [ Alarm Continues ] - No computers , no phones , no power . Doors are electronically sealed . - Sublevel lockdown . - Designed to keep the Centre intact during a nuclear event . Or a palace coup against my father ? - Override the lockdown . - Impossible . If you think that I 'm gonna sit here like one of your caged - I 'm trapped too , Miss Parker . My oxygen tank is almost empty . Would I do that to myself ? Whoever is trying to kill your father now knows you 're here ... and they 'll come for you too . - Raines has a point . - [ Scoffs ] Now is it possible the lockdown has something to do with the fire security test ? There is no test , you moron . They wanted to clear the Centre . Now I 'm laying odds that Nosferatu has a sniper on the helipad . I don 't believe Raines had anything to do with this . Wake up and smell the oxygen , Syd . He 's behind everything . Can you unlock the Arkham files ? I 've got ' em on disk . It 'll take a couple hours , give or take . I 've got less than two or my father 's dead ! Do you understand ? Easy , Parker . Broots is doing the best he can . [ Sighs ] C-Could it be that the elevators have a backup power system ? [ Sighs , Gasps ] Hayes . - Who ? - My new Sweeper . I left him a voice mail after I called you two . His orders are to find me in the sim lab ... if he hasn 't heard from me within the hour . Well , that 's now . We 're in the clear . That 's if he got the message . Parker family motto : " Never depend on anyone but yourself . " [ Alarm Continues ] Give me the sim lab . This is Hayes . Hello ? Hello ? [ Gasps ] I 'm unable to contact the Centre , sir . Keep trying . Try it now . [ Engine Starts , Stalls ] Ah . Gonna have to push-start it . I 'm gonna pop the clutch . You give me a good push . - Think you 've got it in you ? - Yeah , whatever . - [ Grunts ] - You ready ? - [ Grunts ] - [ Engine Starts ] - Jarod ? - My brakes . ! Jarod ! Jarod ! [ Tires Squealing ] Jarod ! Jarod ! Jarod ? Jarod ! [ Raines ] The Centre 's original boiler system ... - extends through every sublevel , right up to the lobby . - [ Alarm Blaring ] - Damn ! - Tragically ironic how all this is happening ... on the anniversary of your mother 's suicide . Murder . And don 't talk about her . [ Whispers ] Please . Help me out of here . [ Young Jarod ] I 'll help you out of there . Miss Parker . - You okay ? - Why wouldn 't I be ? I just haven 't seen you in a while , since - since what happened to your mother . She killed herself , Jarod . She was sick . [ Sighs ] - What 's his name ? - They call him Angelo . Sydney says he 's special , but I can 't get through to him . Maybe I can . [ Jarod ] CrackerJack ? You never had them ? The snack with the toy surprise . Why would someone want a surprise in their food ? Surprise . [ Grunts ] - [ Broots ] You did it . - What about the elevator ? Oh , l-I found some tools , and-and look . These . Walkie-talkies . My father lands in 90 minutes . What about the Arkham file ? It 'll take three hours at least . [ Wheezing , Coughing ] Sounds like he 's got even less . I 'd better stay with Raines . His pulse is bad . [ Raines Coughs ] All right . Look , you don 't hear from us in 20 minutes ... I want you to forget Mr. Clean and get out . You 're my fail-safe , Syd , in case we get nailed . Wait , what ? What do you mean , nailed ? [ Alarm Continues ] Back , Broots . Stay here . Stop or you 're dead . Miss Parker ! - You can breathe now . - [ Gasping ] Oh . Who is it ? Sweepers , but I don 't know either one . Come on . Let 's go . Jarod ? Jarod . [ Groans ] Uh , oh . What happened ? You flipped theJeep . Does it hurt ? Oh . Only when I blink . - I gotta get you out of here . - [ Screams ] [ Panting ] I think I broke my leg . [ Groans ] Chris , you have to go get help . They 're - They 're gonna send a stretcher . When we don 't show up , they 're gonna come lookin ' for us . I could be bleeding internally . You have to get help . Just-J-Just climb ... over that cliff . There should be a road . You can do it . I can 't . I can 't . [ Miss Parker ] Sydney , we 're at the elevator . [ Grunts ] [ Clears Throat ] What ? Oh . That 's an old bullet hole . Well , they-They haven 't fixed that after all these years ? That 's the Centre , always trying to send a message . [ Both Grunting ] Chris , you have to go get help . Oh , God . Oh , my God . Listen to me . You have to go get help . - No , I can 't . No , I can 't do that ! - Yes , you can . [ Panting ] This is about your car accident , isn 't it ? It 's about how your best friend died . You listen to me . Accidents happen . People die . That is no secret . - Why do you keep saying that ? - Because I can help you if you let me . Let me help you . [ Panting ] Nick wanted to go for a shortcut that night . He was going too fast . We s - We spun out , and we hit a tree ... and it jammed the steering wheel into him . And what happened ? And then the cops got there , and his car was on fire ... and I was outside , and Nick was still inside . Nick died instantly . You can 't blame yourself for that . That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . He didn 't ! I let him die ! I let him die . I think you 'll enjoy this . I had one of those , uh , parental wake-up calls at breakfast . You know , time - [ Sighs ] sure flies . My little Debbie , she tells me she knows what she wants to do in life . [ Chuckles ] She 's 10 . Anyway - [ Clears Throat ] she says - You ever think of getting out ofhere , Broots ? - Excuse me ? - The Centre . Leaving ? Taking Debbie andjust going somewhere ... else . Yeah . [ Chuckles ] Actually , lots of times . Do it . Don 't worry about what other people will think . Don 't ... buy into the false ... security of staying put . If you think that that 's what you need to do , then do it . Do it for Debbie - [ Exhales ] but do it now . Because the next elevator you get on - [ Sighs ] [ Clicks Tongue ] I - I never knew your mother , Miss Parker ... but I - I bet the choices she made ... had everything to do with her little girl . So what does Debbie want to do with her life ? She says she ... wants to be just like you . - [ Laughs ] - [ Laughs ] There we go . We 're goin ' to the lobby . [ Alarm Continues ] [ Whispers ] Wait for me . Oh ! [ Grunting ] 'Ello , love . I 'm gettin 'real sick of you . Tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk . You should not have searched the mainframe . And where exactly are Broots and Sydney ? I thought stooges traveled in threes . By the way , fire drills are for pyros and grade-schoolers . Can 't blame a girl for trying . If you were at the cemetery , crying your little eyes out like you 're supposed to be ... you wouldn 't be in this tricky little mess , now would you ? Don 't you think it 's time to turn off the faucets ? How appropriate you die in this elevator . Just like Mummy . If there is one place I 'm not dying , it 's here . [ Bell Ringing ] - [ Cables Squealing ] - [ Grunts ] [ Squealing Stops ] - Miss Parker ? You 've been shot . ! - [ Groaning ] [ Broots ] Looks like a flesh wound . Must 've been a ricochet . - Yeah , off my arm . - You 're bleeding pretty badly - - It 's nothing . - No . Sit down ! - [ Groans ] Oh ! - I mean it . Where the hell are we ? - W-We 're on , uh , SL 26 . - Yeah , that 's right . - [ Screams ] Oh ! Ow ! Ow ! - [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - Oh . - Nice shot . - Oh . [ Groans ] - [ Tools Rattle ] Shh . I hear something . Wait , wait . You 're not going out there . Here . I wanna kill her , not screw her . Well , can you think of anything better ? [ Panting ] I got your back . Oh , now I feel better . Bet you never thought you 'd get paired with a coward , huh ? Is that what you are , Chris ? - [ Sniffs ] - Is that what Nick would think of you ? What happened that night ? We were inside the car , upside down , when I came to . And I looked over at Nick . He was stuck under the steering wheel . There was blood everywhere . And he 's lookin ' over at me , his eyes all scared ... like they 're beggin ' me to help him . Then the fire started comin ' in , and the smoke . And I just sat there , frozen . I can still see his eyes . What did you do ? I slid out of the car - [ Sniffs ] and I crawled away . [ Crying ] And the flames grew bigger ... and I could hear his voice calling me from the fire . [ Sniffs ] [ Crying ] I should have burned , Jarod ... 'cause I should have died . Nick was pinned inside that car . You couldn 't have saved him if you wanted to . No , ' cause I ran away . If you stayed in the car , Chris , you would have died . Your response was human . I ran away . I know what loss is like . I watched my brother die in a car accident . Not a day goes by that I don 't blame myself ... that I don 't ... think of something that I could have done . But as time went by , he forgave me . I hear his voice inside of me , just like you hear Nick 's . What would he want you to do now ? - [ Clattering ] - Wait , Miss Parker . Careful . Did you hear that sound ? Oh ! I 'm officially in hell . - Give me that walkie . - Angelo . Broots , how 's the Arkham file coming ? [ Typing ] Two hours . Great . My father lands in one . You gotta get me back to the lobby , Broots . [ Sighs , Typing ] Tasty . Tasty . Daughter ... sad . You miss your mother , don 't you ? She used to give me these . It 's just me and my daddy now , but he 's always working . My mom and I used to talk about things . She would brush my hair , or we 'd read together . My mom 's gone too . I talk to her though . Her voice is inside me , just like your mother 's is inside you . [ Angelo ] Mom . Trying to hurt Mom . D - Daddy . Trying to hurt Daddy . Daughter sad . - Mmm . - Wait . What - - Don 't touch that . - [ Typing ] He 's speeding it up . - Mmm . Goldenhawk down . - What ? There 's no sniper . She sabotaged the helicopter . Goldenhawk ... down . [ Beeping ] [ Broots ] It 's a distance-sensitive triggering device . - A what ? - A triggering device . As soon as the helicopter gets within 100 feet of the Tower ... an explosive device goes off ... the helicopter loses control and crashes . But it looks like an accident . Exactly . Toy surprise . I told you . I don 't want any . Ah . Surprise . It 's a D.S.A. And it 's dated the day of my mother 's death . - Where 's Jarod ? - He 's been taken to his space , Mr. Parker . - Mmm . - What happened to Catherine ? My wife was , uh , very sick . [ Young Sydney ] Troubled , yes ... but suicide ? You 'll never discuss this incident with anyone ... ever . Not with Jarod , and especially not with my daughter . Go home . Now . I want you back in this laboratory tomorrow , ready to work . Life goes on , Sydney . Life goes on . [ Crying ] Daddy sad . - God , no . - [ Sniffs ] You must save Daddy . - [ Crying Continues ] - Oh . Let 's finish this . [ Broots ] The boiler hatch should be right over there . [ Sydney On Walkie-talkie ] Miss Parker , where are you ? We 're at SL 26 , headed for the boiler . You 've got to hurry . Your father lands in less than 30 minutes . - Tell me something I don 't know . - Miss Parker , up there . The boiler goes all the way up to the lobby . Let 's hope I 'm not too late . [ Beeping ] Everything 's in place . Thirty minutes to Centre airspace and the triggering point . [ Groaning ] [ Sighs ] You ready ? Yeah , I think I am . Jarod , um - Hurry back . [ Exhales ] - [ Broots ] Maybe I should go with you . - No , I can move faster alone . Whoa . Whoa . Twenty-six floors in 15 minutes . Are you sure you 're okay to do this ? - Do you remember the code to the power bunker ? - I got it , Broots . - Okay . Good luck . - [ Groans ] - Oh . Aaah ! - [ Hissing ] Huh . [ Panting ] Oh . Yes ! [ Alarm Continues ] Oh . Syd , I 'm in the lobby . Hayes is dead . - Raines isn 't far behind . - [ Wheezing ] I 'm plugging him into the Centre 's oxygen system . Get the power on ! Put the walkie to his ear . - You don 't have time , Parker . - Do it ! Are you trying to kill my father ? [ Wheezes ] No . Who is ? The same people who killed your mother . - Who ? - [ Gasps ] - [ Wheezing ] - He 's blacking out . [ Whispers ] Thank you . Miss Parker , you got five minutes . [ Breathes Deeply ] - [ Beeping ] - [ Beeping ] [ Mr. Parker ] Centre 's in sight . It 'll be good to be home . [ Beeping Continues ] [ Both Grunting ] - Hello , love . - You just don 't give up , do you ? Drop the accent . Nobody 's buying it anymore . [ American Accent ] Fine with me , bitch . Too much damn work anyway . That 's the problem with you Parkers . You never finish what you started . You look finished to me . [ Rapid Beeping ] [ Beeping Stopped ] You okay ? Yeah . Nick would be proud . Yeah , I know . He told me . Thank you . Son , your dad 's waiting for you . Bye . [ Engine Starts ] [ Vehicle Departs ] - Sorry for the false alarm , but it was for a good cause . - Your leg is broken . I eat a lot of ice cream . Calcium . It 's good for you . [ Sighs ] Bridget will be dealt with . I want you to know . Let 's not talk about that now . [ Sighs ] God , it 's - It 's beautiful here . You 've never been back ? Not since the burial . Couldn 't bring myself to face her . From now on , every year we come here together . - The things I 've wanted to say - - You don 't have to say anything , Daddy . It 's just good to have you back . Are you okay ? Life goes on . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - [ Ringing Continues ] - [ Groans ] - [ Phone Beeps ] - Parker . [ Jarod ] I 'm glad your father is all right . - Thank you , Jarod . - You miss her . - [ Sighs ] Yes . - She misses you too . - How can you be so sure ? - Read the card .

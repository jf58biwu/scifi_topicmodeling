 At the beginning of the 21st century seismic activity continued to shake the world for three years . Millions of people died , and peace and order were virtually erased . The radioactive mutant bear 's blood contains a strong acid . If you use powerful attacks , your flesh will be melted by its blood . Kakugo , you must fight creatively . Impact ! My appearance is of little consequence ! My duty is to win at any cost ! My flesh is a means to victory ! You truly are unconcerned . That is the way , Kakugo . Stand back , Kakugo . You 're not fighting elegantly . My way is faster and guarantees victory . Zero Form ! Heart Rupture ! Fury ! There 's no sense in fighting without style ! Spiral ! In battle , you can be either elegant or brutal . Harara , is this your Zero Form ? Yes , Father . I fought creatively . Fury had already defeated the bear . Spiral was unnecessary . Yes , Sir . Harara , Kakugo . For what purpose do we train in Zero Form Martial Arts in the most isolated part of the world ? We train to fulfill our duty . And what is that duty ? To kill demons in human form . To protect those without fangs . Correct . In these times , people have lost all hope for the future . It is at these times that demons appear . For generations , we have protected innocent people from the shadows . Finally , the time has come . Open it ! Yes , Sir ! W-What is this ? This armor is called the Fortified Armor Shell . Zero Form Defense Arts and this Fortified Armor Shell are our legacy . One set is called Kasumi , and the other is called Zero ! Such fearful fury ... This armor is alive ! Father , Zero is shedding tears of blood ! So is Kasumi ! In order to create this armor , many honorable fighters were sacrificed and countless others have died . This is the time for the blood tears to be honored . I give Kasumi to Harara and Zero to Kakugo . Harara , become Kasumi . Kakugo , become Zero and fulfill your duty to the world . Yes , Sir ! Salute the Fortified Armor Shell ! Look , a flower ! It 's a flower ! It really is . I never thought I 'd ever see a flower . Life is amazing . Let 's leave it alone and not pick it . What 's that ? I am Hamuko . People call me Beauty . S-Stop it ! Why waste your time with this girl ? Just look at her face ! Don 't you think she 's ugly ? Just look at what 's on the inside . Stop right there ! Students from other schools cannot enter ! We 've admitted a newcomer . We live in dangerous times . You never know when a gang or a psycho could attack . We can 't trust the police . We must protect our school by ourselves . Attention , everyone ! Introduce yourself , new guy . I 'm Kakugo Hagakure . Take a seat next to Horie , the one with the ribbon . He smells like incense . I-I 'm Horie . Nice to meet you . Um , hello ... Same here . Hey new guy , want me to brush your teeth ? Cut it out , Haoka ! Stop it , Haoka ! Care to repeat that , Teach ? No , uh , nevermind ... I feel sorry for him . Whoever takes that seat always gets picked on by Haoka . Principal , I confiscated some booze from a student . Care to have some ? You 're indecent , Zenigata . I was just reporting to the police that Kazu Shimada and Hiroko Uchiyama are still missing . They 're probably dead already . They 're your students . Watch your mouth . Principal , we live in a terrible world . The earthquakes and radioactivity ... It 's pretty unlikely that anyone can live in safety . There 's looting , and thousands of corpses haunt the streets . That 's why we have to teach students , so that they can change this world . You 're too optimistic . You still want to fight after the battle 's been lost . Mr. Zenigata , what 's wrong ? The cockroaches are getting bigger all the time . Even if the earth is dead ... If you remember a song that encourages you ... Let 's strain our eyes to look for the light . Bite down and look up at the sky . You sing well , Horie . You sound like Madonna . No , I don 't ! Not at all ! I 'm me . The only me in this world . W-Well ... Being compared to somebody else doesn 't make me happy at all . Hey , what 's so funny , Hagakure ! Nothing . Hey , you listening ? You think you 're something special , don 't you new guy ? I 'll bet he does ! He thinks he 's better than us ! One more thing ... Horie is mine . Stay away from her . Nobody has the right to call someone theirs . Die ! It 's a dangerous world out there . I can 't let a wimp like you have Horie ! Stop it ! Stop it . I don 't belong to you ! Hagakure , are you okay ? Leave him alone . Let 's go , Horie . What are you doing ? Leave me alone ! I thought he 'd be cooler . What a wimp . That was disappointing . H-Help ! Pretty Cheri ! Hiroko ... Hiroko ! Stop that ! You still remember her ? I 'll shut your mouth . That 's the mark of eternal love . A kiss mark that can never be erased ! Classes are over for today . Form your arranged groups , and leave the school premises immediately . Leave the school premises immediately . Don 't worry , Horie ! You 're completely safe as long as I 'm with you ! Y-You should stay away from that Hagakure ! That 's none of your business . H-He 's got a dangerous look in his eyes ! Like a murderer 's eyes . He 's hiding something . Haoka 's right . I see . I 'm so glad . Hey , don 't be upset . All I want to do is protect you , Horie . Who does that ribbon girl think she is ? Why does she get to walk with three boys ? A monster ! How dare you call me a monster ! I am a queen ! Haoka ! That ... That 's Kazu ! That 's right , and I 'm going to love you three boys just like I did Kazu ! But you ... You 'll pay ! How could an ugly girl like you seduce three boys ? Y-You 've got it wrong ! They 're only walking with me ! Shut up ! Seems you use your sweet little voice to attract the boys . Accept the queen 's heel ! Oh God ! Who are you ? What 's this girl to you ? Everybody , get out of here quickly ! It 's dangerous ! Who 's dangerous ? You think you 're so smart . I 'll bury you . Get out of here now ! Run ! His voice ... W-What are you doing , Horie ? You 're in danger there ! B-But ... What are you doing ? Hurry up and run ! R-Right ! I have no desire to fight you . Please remove your leg . I want to remove you from the living ! All right . Anesthesia ! The anesthesia is harmless but will keep a seven ton person sleeping for three days . Did you see that ? W-Who 's the guy with the scarf ? But who is this woman ? Unbelievable . How could she wake up so soon ? She 's beyond human ! It 's impolite to splash something on a queen 's face ! T-This is ... I 'm known as the Tactical Evil , Hamuko ! The queen will shower you with hot candle service ! I 'll rip that armor off your body ! Show me your naked body ! I have no choice . I will use the Way of the Blow . Zero Form ! Active Straight Blow ! I hit your spinal cord through your stomach . You will never use your extraordinary powers again . Cold ... I 'm cold ... Help me ... He was eaten by that monster ! Horrible ... So cold ... I can 't see anything . It 's Shimada ! It 's Kazu ! Stop it , Horie ! It 'll melt you ! Yuck ! Kazu , hold on ! You 'll be okay . Everybody ... Everybody 's here with you . You 've really done it ! I 'm so hungry for love now ! What is ultimate love ? It means two beings become one ! It means you become a part of my flesh ! Those words have sealed your fate . I will retaliate ! Kakugo Complete ! I love you ! I love you , Cheri ! Love will win in the end ! Your love is an act of invasion ! Your devotion is corrupt . You will suffer as your victims have ! Impact ! Is everyone all right ? Yes , we 're fine ! Thank you for saving us . Who are you ? Zero . Zero ? Um ... Hey ? It 's too dangerous to stay here ! New Tokyo 's hell after dark ! But I should bury him . Wait . That 's no good ! Even if you bury him , a rat will just dig him up . Thinking about him is enough ! Step back , please . Shimada is ascending . Don 't ever come back to this hell . Hey , he disappeared ! Who is he ? He destroyed the Tactical Evil we created . The dust that giant moths scatter can penetrate a machine , jamming its gears and disabling it . This is New Tokyo Section 13 . It 's here that the giant cockroaches swarm upon their victims . It is impossible for human beings to survive Section in 13 . I am not a human being . My determination does not waver between right and wrong . I have only one dream . To create a utopia on this dying planet with everything in harmony . Sand , green , and you . Water , light , and breeze . So the mist between Heaven and Earth is gone , and everything is united . To do this there is only one thing that must happen . The death of humanity . The two-legged animal that persecuted you and destroyed the ecology . There is no need for humanity ! Did you hear Lord Harara 's goal ? Absolutely . We too are not human . Harara 's dream of fighting evil has never changed . We shall never forgive the humans ! Destroy the humans ! Destroy ! Destroy ! Destroy ! Destroy ! Destroy ! Destroy ! Destroy ! Are these the people who will fight me ? Yes . If you can defeat me , I will give you this castle . Food , soldiers , everything . A nice offer . You 'd better not say you 're joking . I , Jackal , in a mere second killed 63 wrestlers single-handedly . In order to create my own art of war I 've killed more than three thousand strong fighters . What 's he talkin ' about ? The prince is dreaming ' ! Time to wake up ! Die ! Zero Form . Ultra-Sucking Hand Attack ! Zero Form . Spiral Contact Hand Attack . What ? W-What happened ? Not paying attention ? I hear you can 't be reborn if you don 't smile before dying . Huh , I 'm barely amused . Bring me stronger fighters . I 'm afraid it 's impossible to find any human capable of fighting you . Bring me another thousand fighters like them . It 's boring to be all-powerful . Lord Harara . I don 't want dinner . I 'm sorry to report that Tactical Evil Hamuko fought against an armed citizen and lost . What ? It was not a group of soldiers but a single armored fighter . When I found her , the battle was already over ... You 've said enough . Show me . Yes , Sir . T-This is ... Do you recognize him ? My younger brother . I didn 't think he was still alive . He calls himself Zero . Oh ? I wonder who he is . I wish I could 've seen it . The hero called Zero . He was so cool ... Right Ponta , Pyonsuke ? Yes , he is . He 's so strong ... What 's that ? I-It 's another monster ! I don 't like your uniforms . Zero , what 's wrong ? I feel it ... Someone is screaming . Someone is being attacked . What ? Engage ! Kakugo Complete ! Help me ! P-Ponta ! Shit ! I won 't lose to someone in a uniform . N-No ! Red Heat ! Evaporation ! Zero ! You did it ! Be careful ! I only got rid of part of it . The rest of it is coming . Something strange is approaching fifty feet away ! Fifty feet ... We 'll fight together ! Yeah ! No . Please leave ! What 's that ? Get out of here ! His voice ... Horie , hurry up ! Who ? Who burned my cherished flower ? Who destroyed my individuality ? I did . Why did you burn it ? It was hurting people . Oh no ! Without my flower , my individuality , I 'm just another faceless nobody ! I 'll get you ! Impact ! Plug in ! 130.000 volt electric sound ! Mike on ! Win ! Live start ! Vocal in ! We don 't need schools ! We don 't need teachers ! We don 't need uniforms ! We don 't need deviation ! What a horrible voice ! Drum starts ! A billion beats ! Get rid of those who will take away your individuality ! Red Heat ! Ultrawave ! Evaporation ! Wait ! If you use Evaporation , its flesh will explode ! That is an electric generator ! All right ! Ultra-Dehydration Dust ! You are indeed nothing ! Let the wind take you away ! Is everyone okay ? Yes , we 're fine ! Thank you for saving us again , Mr. Hagakure ! You are Mr. Hagakure , aren 't you ? You must be with that voice . Hagakure ... Mr. Hagakure ! You are him after all ! You 're hurt ... It 's nothing . W-What 's that costume you 're wearing ? Fortified Armor Shell Zero . My father 's legacy . Father ! You 'll pay . You will pay ! You are no longer my brother ! Stand aside , Kakugo . Whoever stands in my way is destined to die . I may not be skilled enough to fight you ! But I 'll defeat you even if my body 's ripped to shreads ! What wonderful spirit . The snow will be dyed with your blood ! Impact ! Spiral ! Goodbye , Kakugo . Your dying smile is beautiful . Kakugo , our path is not to be paitence beyond reason but to win beyond reason . Mr. Hagakure ... I will protect you ... With my own hands . With my armor . Nobody knows why Harara killed his father , Oboro . But when a cursed spell echoes in the castle hidden by vermin and fog Kakugo and the armor unite , to be the impact that destroys evil . Harara , Kakugo , it 's time to don the Fortified Armor Shell ! Kakugo 's long regimen of fasting and training in cold isolation has now led him to the trial of uniting with his armor , Zero . Fortified with spirits from Kakugo 's warrior ancestry ... The 200 pound titanium suit was equipped with armor , a gas mask and various other defenses . It could automatically equip itself , and sustain an injured warrior for 40 days . How am I ... How am I to unite with you ? Zero ... Your body feels so cold ! Tears of blood ! I can try to give you my warmth . Zero took Kakugo 's warmth , sending him into a deep sleep ... Fortified Armor Shell are strong-willed . Only a deserving fighter may wear it . Otherwise he will be sacrificed to the armor . Kakugo ! Harara ! Even if it feels as though your bodies are being torn apart you must unite with the armor . Kakugo did not know how long he 'd been sleeping but when he awoke ... Zero you feel warm . This feels almost like living flesh . Are you telling me to put this on ? The Fortified Armor Shell merged its own 's nervous system with Kakugo 's inextricably and painfully tying them together . Next . What do ... I do next ? Z-Zero ... Zero ! I will restore you to what you once were . I am asking my god with all of my heart ... Please let my sons and the armor be united safely . Join this titanium to me . These spirits ? We are the will of Zero . We are spirits that animate this Fortified Armor Shell for the sake of peace . Kakugo , you are welcome as a most deserving bearer of this armor . Zero , complete ! I wish I had a sweetheart ... Have you ever even kissed a girl ? Yeah , his mother . You poor things ... You are all students from Gyakuzyuji school , aren 't you ? You all look so alone and sad oh you poor things ! Who 's the girl ? She 's beautiful . She 's not wearing any- - Will you let me ... Will you let me make love with each of you , if you don 't mind ? One by one , okay ? Like a carpet ! Hurry up ! You 're a real-life Andromeda ! You poor thing , this is your first time , isn 't it ? It 's sucking me in ! We can 't wait any longer ! Hurry up ! Horie is on her way to see Kakugo ... He is the bravest and cutest boy I know ... This is it . Who is it ? Guess there 's nobody here . Uh , hello ? Hey , Hagakure ! Horie 's here . Horie . Hi ! W-Well , I figured since it 's Sunday , and you 've just moved in I 'd stop by and help you clean up , and uh , stuff . Welcome . Wonder who that could be . Who 's there ? Please help , three boys attacked me ! Come inside , maybe I can help . I can 't stand up . Could you ... carry me ? Kakugo , what is it ? Please get some clothes for her . H-How about this ? What 's that ? It 's so beautiful . Please don 't get too close . The armor can be dangerous . Hagakure sleeps with it every night , you know . Oh , stop teasing him , will you ? You poor thing , you have only a doll for a sweetheart . Hey , Hagakure , I can go and see if I can find a doctor . No , it isn 't safe out there , I 'll go . Don 't worry . I 'm a fast runner . It 'll be better if I go with you . We 'll go , too . Hagakure . Finally , we 're alone . Thought they 'd never leave . Don 't you think I 'd make a much better sweetheart for you ? Better than an ugly doll ? I don 't know what you think this is but I don 't appreciate such shameful behavior in my home . Get dressed , I 'll wait . I would never give in to someone like her . What 's wrong ? What ... what is this ? It 's making me dizzy . Megumi , are you okay ? Sexual Mesmerize Exhale ! W-What ? Because ... Because I have to have you . Tactical Evil ! Double Big Tit Bomb ! Zero ! Prepare to counter-attack . Engage ! Kakugo complete ! Oh , Kakugo , you seem to have a relationship with that doll , don 't you ? Oh , you 're all alone , you poor thing ! Double Big Tit Bomb ! Ultra-wave ! Oh , that felt wonderful . You 're a real operator , Kakugo . Ultra-wave doesn 't work . What 's happening ? What 's that ? What 's going on ? You poor thing , don 't you know what to do with a helpless girl ? The attack was only 3 % effective . Your so-called attacks only serve to pleasure me . I look forward to the next one . Pleasure ? You must attack me more ! A flaming bomb attack would end this battle now but I could set the dorms on fire . Using a chemical weapon isn 't much of an option , either . So , it looks like ... I 'm going to have to be direct ! Kakugo , you poor dear , you are acting so strangely . All right , chop me up if you want ! She 's recovering from every attack ! Your cuts are too clean . A clean cut lets her recover quickly . Got it ! Poor thing , he seems to be talking to himself . I 'm coming to you , dear ! Momentum jet ! That hurts ! Accelerating momentum ! Rest in peace . Where could these creatures be coming from ? My brother , just as I thought . Mr. Harara , he has arrived . I 've waited for you , Eikichi . Mr. Harara , you should be kinder to me . You asked such an old man to climb all the way up here to see you . Watch your tongue . Eikichi , I don 't think you 're an old man at all . You seem to be quite active . You look to me to be filled with incredible energy and life . You flatter me too much , Mr. Harara . I am in need of you . You are the only one who bothers to show kindness to a geezer like me . Harara , I am very honored to work for you . So , who do you want on ice ? I am counting on you , Eikichi . Whoa , how can I believe such a story ? It 's true ! Hagakure is the coolest , isn 't he , Haoka ? Hagakure is my absolute hero . Look , here he comes . Good morning ! Good morning . We all heard about what you did yesterday . Good morning . Yep , I cleaned your desk for you . Oh , I hope I didn 't annoy him . Thank you . R-Really ? You are very welcome . I feel strange . I think ... I 'm starting to have feelings for her . Guys , look , an intruder ! Who are you ? You are trespassing on Gyakuzyuji school property ! I beg your pardon ? An old man like me is very hard of hearing . Leave the premises immediately . What ? Did you just insult my age ? I didn 't say that . What ? Did you call me an old geezer ? We are members of the Armed Security Committee . Leave ! You young fools are making fun of me . It 's a pity you all have to die so young ! Ultra Coagulate Saliva Blade ! Look , here comes Hagakure . Oh , I suddenly feel fat . Hey , Horie ! Look at this , he has iron bearings in his body . Hagakure , you 're a little strange , aren 't you ? Your pierced nipple is just as weird . Okay , attention everybody ! Swimming in the infrared ray pool once a week is not just playtime . It 's very important to make sure your bodies are protected from the New Tokyo viruses . Female students should remove their suits ! What a sleaze ! He is such a creep . He 's monitoring us . What 's the principal doing there ? Don 't they all look adorable . Oh , to be a young man again . What 's this ? That 's him , Eikichi . He is your sole target . Even if he is unarmed , be careful and fight with everything you have . Anything you say , Harara . How wonderful the little girl tastes ! Horie , I 've got to save her . But-but how do I ... Haoka , run ! Hagakure ! Leave it to me . B-But , you don 't have your armor ! No matter . Hagakure ! Now run as fast as you can . But ... Horie , hurry up . Hagakure Kakugo . Who are you ? Why do you know my name ? You don 't have to answer him . Go , Eikichi ! Yes , Sir . Are you ready , young man ? Let my body take in ... Zero Form Iron ! That was easy . What 's going on ? The iron bearings in his body were given to Kakugo by his father , Oboro . At Kakugo 's command they absorb into his flesh , and melt into his blood . The metallic blood rises through his skin and hardens into a shell of armor . With this armor , Kakugo 's defensive capacity is increased by 56 % . In all my ninety years I 've never met such a gritty young man . I can see that this iron skinned warrior will be tough . I need a little help from a friend . Another creature ! My friend , let 's fight together and get rid of him . He 's capable of shooting bullets from his mouth . I can 't keep my distance . Contact ! Golden Ball Flash ! Ultra Coagulate Holy Water Bullet ! Zero Form can follow the wind . You 're very quick . Dual bullet attack ! Hagakure 's hurt ! Horie , look at his body ! The Student Guard ! The secret of living a long life is to kill the young . And you are next ! He can 't be human . He never seems to feel any pain or emotion . It 's like he 's some kind of robot ! You 're wrong . He is feeling pain . Huh ? Look at Hagakure , he 's bleeding . Dammit ! We need to help him somehow ! I got it . He needs the armor . But we don 't know where it is ! Guys , here it is ! We brought this . I 'm pretty sure he carries his armor in here . But , how the hell are we supposed to get it to him ? Hagakure . Oh , give it to me , Horie . Don 't die , Kakugo ! Put this on , quick ! You idiot ! Get away ! You 're noisy ! Haoka ! You bastard ! Engage ! What ! Kakugo Complete ! Another metallic shell ? You are showing great disrespect with this nonsense of yours . Is this the attitude you show towards the elderly ? I 'll be sure to teach you some manners ! Manners or no manners you will pay for what you 've done . What ? You are not a kind boy . My bullets aren 't having any effect on him . In that case ... I can feel your pulse and breath oh I 'm in heaven ! I will now crush this rude little boy . You are not in heaven ! Without his little friend , Eikichi doesn 't stand a chance . Mr. Harara , what are you going to do ? I don 't have to explain . I will fight against him . I will put myself into Eikichi 's consciousness . Please stop this now . If you and Eikichi unite , you will feel the same pain as he does . If Eikichi dies , you will as well . Makes it interesting . I 'm begging you , please don 't kill me . If you wish to live , then answer my questions . First , tell me why you 're here . Second , who are you working for ? Zero Form secret art ! Unite me with the demon ! What happened ? His moves have suddenly changed . His fighting spirit ... That move ! Long time no see , Kakugo ! That voice is ... Did you forget your long lost brother ? Did you forget this terror ? The Spiral move ! There is only person in the world who can do it . The human demon , Harara ! Kakugo , Harara ... Now you must go out in the world and protect the innocent from the evil . Your training is complete ! Thank you for your guidance , Father . B-Brother , is there something wrong ? Harara , why are you laughing ? Father , you have been cheating me . Joining Kasumi brought me to my senses . Cheating you ? Our duty is to protect humanity but the reality is that humanity doesn 't deserve to be protected . They are horrible creatures , Father . Brother , what are you talking about ? You foolishly allow conceit to dominate your judgment . Harara Hagakure , born to this world from a human body has died at the tender age of 14 . I am the same person and yet quite a different one . Brother what happened ? My body is now super-human . It 's flexible and strong . I don 't have to fight for anyone except myself now . What happened ? Kasumi ... Kasumi did this ? What ? You have the eyes of a demon . Get out ! Zero Form is a special power created to protect innocent lives . The holders of this power are forbidden to use it for their own selfish purposes , Harara . The powers of heaven have chosen me to command Zero Form . Engage ! Free of conscience . My spirit is nobler than a human 's . My true self has blossomed . There is no flower nobler than the human spirit . If you compare the Kakugo family to a flower ... then our spirit is the maple which blossoms alone in the cold mountains ! Engage ! Coil ! Impact ! Spiral ! Iron Wall ! Father ! I shall never forgive you . You are no longer my brother . Spiral ! Kakugo ... Father . I 've failed you . I don 't stand a chance against the powers Harara now possesses . The technique , the strength there 's no way I could ever defeat him ! Kakugo ... Do you remember the story I told you as a child ? The one about the tortoise defeating the rabbit in a footrace ? Yes , I remember . It is not a fairy tale , my son . Father ! I remember . I remember ! I will avenge the murder of my father . I will send you to hell ! Thousand-arm bullet strike ! You let your anger get in the way again . You had a moment of weakness . Shame on you , Kakugo . I must contain the anger in my mind . No , my anger must go to my legs and support me . You waste your time protecting these pathetic little weeds ? I have never seen such a disgusting scene . My dream is to get rid of such troublesome creatures . You won 't live to see it come true . Do you really think you can defeat me ? Something 's wrong , I can 't control this body . It 's rigor mortis , Mr. Harara ! Eikichi 's body is mortally wounded he 's bleeding to death . Please separate yourself from him right now otherwise your life is also in danger . Doesn 't matter . Kakugo doesn 't care if we both die . I 'm too bored with life to care , myself . Mr. Harara ... This is no time for you to be cavalier ! Rigor mortis . I can only wish . Spiral ! Impact ! Mr. Harara ! A mere tickle ! My duty is to protect the innocent . Hagakure ... Zero Form Protection is not a power to be used selfishly . It is only for those who cannot defend themselves . Using the power to protect the innocent gives them a prayer for the future . Kakugo Complete !

 Welcome to Gattaca . You keep your workstation so clean , Jerome . It 's next to godliness . - lsn 't that what they say ? - Godliness . I reviewed your flight plan . Not one error in a million keystrokes . Phenomenal. lt 's right that someone like you is taking us to Titan . Has the committee approved the mission ? There 's talk of delay . You shouldn 't listen to talk . You leave in a week . You 've got a substance test . If you have to take a substance test , report to the testing center . Jerome . Never shy . Pisses on command . - A beautiful piece of equipment . - You tell me every time I 'm here . Occupational hazard. I see a great many in the course of any given day . Yours just happens to be an exceptional example . Why didn 't my folks order one like that for me ? - Have I ever told you about my son ? - No . Remind me to sometime . So you 're about to go up . One week left . Please tell me you 're the least bit excited . I 'll tell you at the end of the week . Congratulations , Jerome . Thank you . How many launches are there in a day ? A dozen ? Sometimes more . You 're the only one who watches every one of them . If you 're going to pretend like you don 't care , don 't look up . The most unremarkable of events . Jerome Morrow , Navigator 1st Class , is about to embark on a one-year manned mission to Titan , the 1 4th moon of Saturn . A highly prestigious assignment . Although , for Jerome selection was virtually guaranteed at birth . He 's blessed with all the gifts required for such an undertaking . A genetic quotient second to none . There 's nothing remarkable about the progress of Jerome Morrow . Except that I am not Jerome Morrow . I was conceived in the Riviera . Not the French Riviera . The Detroit variety . They used to say that a child conceived in love has a greater chance of happiness . They don 't say that anymore . I don 't know why my mother put her faith in God rather than her local geneticist . Ten fingers , 10 toes , that 's all that used to matter . Not now . Only seconds old , the exact time and cause of my death was known . Neurological condition , 60 percent probability . Manic depression , 42 percent probability . Attention deficit disorder , 89 percent probability . Heart disorder : 99 percent probability . Early fatal potential . - Life expectancy : 30.2 years . - Thirty years ? - The name for the certificate ? - Anton . No . Vincent Anton . Yeah . That 's a good name . I know he 'll do something . You 'll do something . Vincent ? I quickly thought of myself as others did . Chronically ill . Every skinned knee and runny nose was treated as a fatal threat . The insurance won 't cover it . If he fell- - - But I was told that everything- - - There 's nothing I can do . Like most other parents then , they wanted their next child to be conceived in what has become the natural way . Your extracted eggs , Marie have been fertilized with Antonio 's sperm . We have screened two healthy boys and two very healthy girls . Without predispositions to any inheritable diseases . All that remains is to select the most compatible candidate . We may as well decide on gender . Have you given it any thought ? We would want Vincent to have a brother to play with . - Of course you would . Hello , Vincent . - Hi . You have specified hazel eyes , dark hair and fair skin . I 've eradicated prejudicial conditions : Premature baldness , alcoholism , propensity for violence , obesity . We didn 't want diseases , yes . But ... . We would like to leave a few things to chance . Give your child the best start . We have enough imperfection built in . Your child doesn 't need any additional burdens . This child is still you . Simply the best of you . You could conceive naturally 1000 times and never get such a result . That 's how Anton came to be . A son worthy of my father 's name . - l 'm proud of you , son . - See how much he 's grown . By the time we were playing at blood brothers I understood there was something different flowing through my veins . I 'd need a lot more than a drop if I was going to get anywhere . We played chicken . When our parents weren 't watching we used to swim as far out as we dared . It was about who would get scared and turn back first . Come on , you coward ! Of course it was always me . Anton was the stronger swimmer and had no excuse to fail . Three hundred million , 350 million , 400 million . Maybe it was my love of the planets orjust my dislike for this one but for as long as I remember I 've dreamed of going into space . Seven hundred fifty million , 800 million , 850 million . How many astronauts are there ? I bet I could be one if I wanted . Don 't eat that. lt 's Pluto . My goals didn 't change a lot in the intervening years . - Vincent . - Much to my parents ' dismay . Vincent . Be realistic . With a heart condition like yours ... . - There 's a chance my heart 's fine . - One chance in 100 . - l 'll take it . - They won 't . Listen , for God 's sake , you gotta understand something . The only way you 'll see the inside of a spaceship is to clean it . He was right . It didn 't matter how much I lied on my résumé . My real résumé was in my cells . Why waste money on training me when there are 1000 other applicants with a cleaner profile ? It 's illegal to discriminate . " Genoism , " it 's called . But no one takes the law seriously . If you refuse to disclose , they take a sample from a door handle or a handshake . Even the saliva on your application form . If in doubt , a legal drug test can become an illegal peek at your future in the company . Sure you want to do this ? You know you 're going to lose . It was the last time we swam together . Out into the open sea . Knowing each stroke out was one we 'd have to make back . But something was different . Every time Anton tried to pull away he found me right beside him . Until finally the impossible happened . Vincent ! Vincent ! For once in our lives Anton was not as strong as he believed and I was not as weak . That made everything else possible . Like others in my situation I moved around getting work where I could . I must 've cleaned half the toilets in the state . The underclass wasn 't determined by social status or skin color now . Welcome to Gattaca , gentlemen . No , we now have discrimination down to a science . There 's your cleaning material . Start here and clean to the back . I want to see my smiling face on that floor . Dreaming of space , Your Majesty ? Come here . Start by cleaning this space . I knew how far away I was from my goal when I stood right beside it . - Don 't clean the glass too well . - What do you mean ? You might get ideas . But if the glass is clean , it 'll be easier to see me on the other side . I knew it was just brave talk . No matter how much I studied the best test score in the world needs a blood test to match it . I had to go to extreme measures . The man who came didn 't exactly advertise in the Yellow Pages . Stand straight . - How did you hear about me ? - People . Any distinguishing marks ? Tattoos , scars , birthmarks ? No. I don 't think so . Are you serious about this ? I hope you 're not wasting my time . - l 'd give 100 percent . - That 'll get you halfway there . That 's an old edition , but I know it all by heart . By heart , huh ? - The commitment is binding . - You have somebody in mind ? For the genetically superior , success is easier to attain but not guaranteed . After all , there is no gene for fate . And when a member of the elite falls on hard times their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity . One man 's loss is another 's gain . He 's got impeccable credentials . An unbelievable expiration date . He 'll practically live forever . His IQ is off the register . Better than 20 / 20 in both eyes . And the heart of an ox . He could run through a wall . If he could still run . He was a bigtime swimming star . You could go anywhere with this guy 's helix tucked under your arm . - You look so right together . - We don 't look anything alike . Nobody looks at photos today . Christ , you could have my face . - How do I explain the accident ? - lt happened out of the country . No one knows he broke his back . As far as anyone 's concerned he 's still a fully productive member of society . - Just fill in his last year . - You 're a foreigner . They don 't care where you were born . Blood has no nationality . As long as it 's got what they want , it 's the only passport you need . - Who lives up there ? - Well , I certainly don 't . So began the process of becoming Jerome . Myopia is one of the most obvious signs of a disadvantaged birth . - lsn 't there another way ? - Surgery will leave scars . It 's contact lenses or a white cane . - Besides , the color doesn 't match . - He 's right . My eyes are prettier . I take 25 percent of everything you make . If it fails , all this equipment must be returned in seven days . - And you lose your deposit . - Wait ! You said 20 percent . - Twenty percent . - lt 's not negotiable . - l guess that 's it . - No . There 's still the height . - How tall are you ? - Four-foot-six . How tall were you before the accident ? - His profile says he 's 6 ' 1 " . - l can wear lifts . Even with lifts , you 're not that tall . So what ? No . No . - We never discussed that . - l thought you were serious . I am. I 'm not doing that . I won 't do that . Jerome never questioned my commitment again . I endured the pain by reminding myself that when I did stand up I 'd be exactly two inches closer to the stars . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Do you want to go dancing ? You had to be a right-hander . No one orders southpaws any more . " Jerome Morrow . " lt 's a nice name . - lt 's my name . - l can 't be you without it . What makes you think you can be me at all ? Look at this . - Look at it . - lt 's nice . I 'm impressed. ls it real ? Are you color-blind too , Vincent ? - lt 's silver . - So ? Jerome Morrow was never meant to be one step down on the podium . With all I had going for me , I was still second best . Me . So how do you expect to pull this off ? I don 't know , exactly . Your signature needs work . Soon we were put to the test . Jerome had been engineered with everything to get into Gattaca except the desire to do so . - Do you really want to be in there ? - Not in there . Up there . - What 's up there ? - That 's want I want to see , Jerome . Call me Eugene . My middle name . If you 're going to be Jerome , you better start getting used to it . - l gotta go . Where 's my sample ? - ln the fridge . Door on the left . - Which pouch ? - Any of them . - You think I should test it ? - lf you like . - What 's wrong with the machine ? - You 've been drinking again ! - l haven 't . - Christ , it 's 8 in the morning ! I haven 't . This is no joke . My interview is in an hour ! - There 's more vodka than piss ! - l had half a glass to celebrate . - Friday 's will be okay . - There 's only Wednesday left . Wednesday . That 's the one . Listen , it 's not too late to back out . This is the last day you will be you and I will be me . Well ? - Congratulations . - What about the interview ? That was it . I got it . Of course you got it . And that 's the way it was . Each day I would dispose of as much loose skin , nails and hair as possible . To limit how much of my In-Valid self I 'd leave in the Valid world . Eugene prepared samples of his body matter so I 'd pass for him . Urine for the substance tests . Blood for security checks and vials filled with other traces . Eugene gave me his identity while I paid the rent and kept him in the style to which he 'd become accustomed . Eugene had never been called " utero , " " faith birth , " " ln-Valid . " A " Valid , " he suffered under a different burden : The burden of perfection . I was now a member of a new and detested segment of society . One of those who refuses to play the hand that he was dealt . I am most commonly known as a " borrowed ladder . " Or a " de-gene-erate . " In the guise of Jerome Morrow I 've risen quickly in Gattaca . Only one of the mission directors has come close to exposing me . He may have more success exposing me in death than he did in life . - l think we can rule out suicide . - Excuse me , sir ? Nothing . Thank you . This will take a while . We may have to push things back . Irene , I want you to assist the investigators . - My work . That would put me behind . - l appreciate your sacrifice . - l won 't lose my place in line ? - Your place is assured . So kindly inform the authorities we will cooperate in any way although we can 't tolerate a major disruption . - Thank you , Irene . - Thank you , director . - How will this affect the mission ? - We 'll go ahead as planned . The launch can only be this week . Tragic though this event may be it hasn 't stopped the planets turning , has it ? - What happened ? - l 'm going up . When ? - End of the week . - End of the week ? That soon ? What about the mission director ? He 's dead . Are you serious ? They found him beaten so badly they had to check his name tag . You are serious . There 's nothing between us and ignition . I 'm going up . - The man was murdered ? - l didn 't do it . - lt 'll be crawling with Hoovers . - l 'll handle the J. Edgars . What if they do find something ? I 'll be out of their jurisdiction . We have to get drunk immediately . Good evening , gentlemen . I hear you 're leaving us , Mr. Morrow . - Yeah . Looks that way . - We 're going to miss you . - You 've opened the wine , I hope ? - Of course , sir . - Pour yourself a glass , Cavendish . - Thank you , sir . - How old ? - Me ? This specimen . - l kissed him five minutes ago . - l 'll see what I can do . - You want the full sequence ? - Yes . Thank you . Good luck . Nine-point-three . Quite a catch . Yes . Quite a catch . God , I 've told Cavendish . This has only been open five minutes ! A wine like this needs to breathe . Remember that . You know , they say when you 're weightless it 's the closest thing to being in the womb . I can 't believe you pulled this off . They 're sending you up there . Up there . You , of all people . You 'll be alone in that room for a year . Don 't think about it . - lt 's bigger than your tin can . - What are you going to do ? I have my books . I go places in my head . - l wish you had company . - l have visitors . None that you don 't pay . - l wouldn 't have it any other way . - What are you going to do ? I 'm going to finish this . What 's Titan like this time of year ? What 's Titan like ? Titan is exactly like this . The cloud around it is so thick , no one can tell what 's underneath . - Maybe there 's nothing there . - There 's something there . - You should be going , not me . - Why is that ? Because up there your legs wouldn 't matter . I 'm scared of heights . I 'm sorry . Do you want this ? I 'll save some for you , shall I ? - l 'm so sorry. I 'm really sorry . - You 're not that sorry . I 'm really , really sorry . Don 't give me a hard time . Give me a break . - Come on ! Help ! Help ! - l 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . - l wasn 't drunk . - What do you mean , you 're not drunk ? - When I walked in front of that car . - What car ? I stepped right out in front of it . I 'd never been more sober in my life . - Go to sleep . - l couldn 't even get that right . If at first you don 't succeed , try , try again . Go to sleep . I 'm proud of you , Vincent . You must be drunk to call me Vincent . - How much do you need ? - Twenty minutes . You can go . It 's all right , Irene . You 're excused . We found our man. lt 's the only specimen we can 't account for . - Every 10 years , things go our way . - Tell me about the eyelash . An unregistered ln-Valid . A janitor . He disappeared a few years back . - The specimen could be from then . - Nothing lays around here for long . Would a janitor come back after so long to kill a man he never knew ? His profile suggests he 's violent . It also suggests he 's a sick man . There 's a 90 percent chance he 's dead . That leaves a 10 percent chance he 's still alive . The owner of the eyelash is the murderer. I 'll do a cross-check- - - He has no living relatives . - That 's a damn shame , sir . Check the entry log . Alibis , grudges . I see a lot of dry eyes . The mission director was not universally loved . He was leading cutbacks in the program . With all due respect , sir ... . Whatever you say . Jerome the metronome . I could play the piano by that heartbeat of his . - We have a suspect . - That is a relief . Who is he ? We found an unaccounted-for specimen . Here 's his picture . - An ln-Valid . - We 're still following other leads . - l 'm posting this immediately . - l 'm curious , director . An advantage , I should imagine , in your line of work . - Your hiring practices . - Our " recruitment philosophy . " - Who do you have to be to be here ? - We don 't take common citizens . Are they all equally excellent ? Occasionally we 've had to accept candidates with minor shortcomings . But nothing that would prohibit someone from working in a field such as law enforcement , for example . Now , there are enough of the right kind to warrant a new standard . Bodies with minds to match . Essential as we push out further and further . Yet you still monitor performance . - To see they meet their potential . - And exceeding it ? - No one exceeds his potential . - lf he did ? It simply means we didn 't accurately gauge his potential in the first place . - All right ? - Terrific . This is the entry log for the last seven days . What about you , Irene ? Do you have an alibi ? - l was alone . - l find that hard to believe . Excuse me . I 'll take care of that for you , Mr. Morrow . I see I 'm not the only one who looks up every time there 's a launch . - Hello , Jerome . - Hello . - lt 's awful about the director . - Awful it didn 't happen sooner . Didn 't the director threaten to cancel your mission more than once ? - Yes , he did . - Somebody did you a favor . - Do they know who I should thank ? - They found an eyelash . - Does it have a name ? - Just some In-Valid . Jerome ... . l had you sequenced . I read your profile . I 'm sorry . Seems you 're everything they say you are and more . What about you , Irene ? You 're engineered just like the rest of us . Not quite like the rest of you . " Unacceptable likelihood of heart failure . " That 's how they put it . The only trip I 'll take in space is around the sun on this satellite . If there 's anything wrong with you , I can 't see it from where I stand . If you don 't believe me ... . Here . Take it . If you 're still interested , let me know . I 'm sorry . The wind caught it . Please check the latest Gattaca bulletin . Jerome. ls this the approach path we discussed ? - Absolutely , director . - Quite right . Quite right . Listen , I want what I ordered . It 's a completely different color . No. I 'm bored of talking to you . I 'm bored . I 'll call you back . That was about your hair dye . They 've sent me " Summer Wheat . " It 's too light . " Why don 't you try a change ? " We can 't use it . - l 'll probably have to pay for it . - We can 't stay here . - The idiots I have to deal with . - They think I killed the director . - What makes them think that ? - They found my eyelash . - Where ? - ln the corridor . It could be worse . They could 've found it in your eye . My picture is everywhere . I can 't turn around without seeing my face . - They 'll recognize me . - They won 't recognize you . - They 'll recognize me . - l don 't recognize you . They won 't accept one of their elite could 've suckered them for so long . No , we do as we planned . You 're Jerome Morrow , Navigator 1st Class . I 'm not Jerome Morrow . I 'm a murder suspect . What are you doing ? That 's more than a day 's worth ! - We can 't stay here . - Stop that ! Fine . Fine ! Leave if you want . But don 't take that stuff. lt 's mine ! I could 've rented myself out to somebody with a spine if I 'd known you 'd go belly-up on me at the last gasp . You can 't quit on me now . I 've put too much into this . Do you want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself ? Eugene , they are going to find me . You still don 't understand , do you ? When they look at you , they don 't see you anymore . Only me . Keep your lashes on your lids where they belong . How could you be so careless ? - l 'm going out . - Where ? Well , if I 'm gonna get arrested tomorrow , I 'm going out tonight . - Are you sure that 's a good idea ? - You said not to change anything . - Who 's going ? - l 'd say everybody . Everybody . If I don 't go , it 'll look suspicious . You don 't want to look suspicious , do you ? Thanks . Who ordered this ? What are we doing here ? I 'm following a lead . Forgive me , but I 'm a detective . I follow leads . - Why should the suspect be here ? - He 's an ln-Valid . - This is where the ln-Valids are . - He 's an ln-Valid . He 's an ln-Valid clever enough to go unregistered all these years . Do you think he 's likely to lie down for us now ? - What do you suggest ? - Go back to the scene . Draw a five-mile radius around Gattaca , sweep again . Random stops . - You 're a navigator ? At Gattaca ? - That 's what it says , doesn 't it ? It doesn 't say you 're crippled . I 'm not crippled . I hurt my leg training , you moron . How dare you question me . What 's your number ? All right , forget it . - Your number , you fucking flatfoot ! - What do you want ? An apology ? It gets to you that I can do what you can only dream of . I 'm getting off this ball of dirt ! How dare you question me . That 's harassment . My mistake . What 's your number ? What 's your number ? This is a crime scene . What 's this man doing here ? - What are you doing , old man ? - My job , sir . - This is evidence . - But it 's just trash . - You didn 't know ? - Oh , yes . Yeah . Wonderful , wasn 't it ? Twelve fingers or one , it 's how you play . That piece can only be played with 12 . - What 's all this about ? - lt 's probably nothing . No. I don 't want to give you a contaminated specimen . Get my meaning ? Thanks . You never know where those swabs have been . I want to show you something . Come on , we 'll miss it . Come on . We 'll miss it . What did I tell you ? - Strange . - What ? Your eyes look different . - l guess it must be the light . - Must be . Positive match. I 'm impressed . - The cup was used recently ? - Two samples , two days . Either the suspect returned to the crime scene to get a drink of water . - Or he still works there . - We checked all the service staff . I don 't think he cleans anymore. I think he 's there under false pretenses playing somebody else 's hand . - A borrowed ladder at Gattaca ? - Far-fetched , but not impossible . It 's hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers . He wouldn 't have the mental faculty or the physical stamina . Maybe he is an impostor and maybe the director found out . Let 's sample every employee intravenously . We 'd close them down for days . No , a fingertip or a urine sample . I suggest blood from the vein . I hope I 'm not out of line . It 's only a matter of time , sir . What 's with the plungers , Lamar ? You open up a blood bank ? The gentlemen of law enforcement are concerned that my methods may have been compromised . - Goddamn ! Are you out of practice ? - Let me look at that . - lt 's all right . - Luckily , we have enough . If you need any more , you can get it off his shoes . Irene . - So you didn 't do it after all ? - l guess somebody beat me to it . I guess . I leave in two days . I guess you know that . But ... . That 's the last . - Something 's not right . - He 's not here. lt 's a blind alley . No , we missed something . I say we test again . Test ? I cannot allow you to disrupt operations any further . - You have a murderer in your midst . - Your presence is more of a threat . The window for our latest launch is open for seven days every 70 years . - lt 's crucial we leave on time . - This mission means a lot to you . Your late colleague opposed it , didn 't he ? Take another look at my profile . I haven 't a violent bone in my body . My apologies . He won 't trouble you any further . This is not the only place we can look . Okay . Let 's start making the rounds . I 'm luckier than most . Not as lucky as some . - l know something about that . - You , Jerome ? What heart problem did you ever have ? Did you get yours broken once ? I had this crazy idea you were more interested in the murder than me . You 're right . That 's a crazy idea . Would you like to dance ? It 's funny . You work so hard to get away from a place and when you finally get your chance to leave you find a reason to stay . - A year is a long time . - Not so long . Just once around the sun . Hello , I 'm your detective for the evening . Please stay here . Don 't leave ! Am I speaking in some strange foreign language ? Check lenses , dentures , napkins , cigarette butts , saliva off cups . That 's a familiar face . Check him out . - l thought you wanted to dance . - Where are you going ? Just a minute . Jerome ! - Are you insane ? - Come on ! Where did they go ? Come on . Come on . - Don 't you understand ? I can 't do that . - You just did . Don 't touch your face . Don 't swallow . Clean his teeth . Vincent ! Who 's Vincent ? I ... . Don 't say anything . What happened ? The scars on your legs ? Remember the ' 99 Chrysler LeBaron ? I bumped into the front fender . Looked left instead of right . Did you just make that up , or do you use it all the time ? I use it all the time . You had something to do with the director 's death . That 's not true , Irene . Isn 't that the man from last night ? He 's nobody . He 's one of our best . I 'm certain he has nothing to do with this business . Jerome Morrow . You don 't look well , Jerome . Why don 't you go home ? - Can I help you ? - l 'm looking for Jerome Morrow . He 's ill . A little nausea . It 's quite common before a mission . Really ? I want to visit him. I understand you can show me the way . You don 't know who he is , do you , Irene ? - Hello ? - l need you to be yourself for the day . - l was never very good at it . - The investigators are coming by . - l 'm supposed to be sick . - So you keep telling me . - How long have I got ? - Not long . I guess he 's not home . - Hello ? - l 'm here to see Jerome Morrow . Yes , that 's me . Come up . I guess he 's home . Come in . Hello , sweetheart . Where 's my kiss ? Good to see you 're feeling better . Of course , now that you 're here . Who 's your friend ? How can I help ? - lt 's about the director . - Again ? - l hope it 's no trouble . - No , no . No trouble . - Forgive me for not giving you a tour . - Can 't we do this another time ? - This won 't take a moment . - Maybe he can tell me what I 've got . Who were you expecting ? - We have our man . - You have him ? - We have him in custody . - l 'll come right away . - How are you , Jerome ? - Not bad , Jerome . - How the hell did you get up here ? - l can walk. I 've been faking it . lrene. lrene. Irene . - Don 't touch me ! - Listen to me , Irene . I don 't even know who you are . - l 'm the same person I was yesterday . - No more lies , Jerome . My name is Vincent Anton Freeman . I 'm a faith birth or a de-gene-erate or whatever . But I 'm not a murderer . - You 're a God-child ? - We do have one thing in common . Only I don 't have 20 or 30 years left in mine. lt 's 10,000 beats overdue . It 's not possible . You are the authority on what is not possible . Aren 't you , Irene ? They 've got you looking so hard for any flaw , that that 's all you see . For whatever it 's worth , I 'm here to tell you that it is possible . It is possible . Congratulations , sir . His spit was found in the dead director 's eye . While I obsessed over an eyelash , your instincts pointed the way . So the ln-Valid wasn 't involved ? No , our friend acted alone . This mission meant everything to him . He knows that if they miss this launch , he won 't live to see the next one . Since nothing can stop the launch now , he 's very , very cooperative . - So will you celebrate tonight ? - Of course . I think she likes us . Yeah , sure . Just give her a little bit of time . She 'll get used to the idea . What was he like ? - The cop ? - Yeah . Just a cop . - Did you get his name ? - Actually , my name was the topic . - He 'll be back . - They have their man. lt 's over . No , it 's not over . I have to meet him . Vincent ? My God , you have changed . - Don 't you recognize your brother ? - Are we brothers ? Our parents died thinking they 'd outlived you. I had my doubts . - What are you doing here ? - l should ask you that question . I have a right to be here . - You don 't . - You sound as if you believe that . I committed no murder . You must be disappointed . You committed fraud . You 're in trouble. I can get you out of here . Do you have any idea what it took to get in here ? You 've gone as far as you can go . You come with me now . - There 's still a million miles to go . - lt 's over . Can you only succeed by seeing me fail ? God ! Even you are going to tell me what I can and can 't do now ? I don 't need any rescuing . But you did , once . Well , you 've got all the answers . How do you explain that ? You didn 't beat me that day . I beat myself . - Who are you trying to convince ? - Do you want me to prove it ? It 's not important , Anton . It 's forgotten . I 'll prove it to you . Do you want me to prove it ? I do . Vincent ! Vincent ! Where 's the shore ? We 're too far out ! - You wanna quit ? - We 're too far out . You wanna quit ? No . Vincent ! How are you doing this , Vincent ? How have you done any of this ? We have to go back . It 's too late for that . We 're close to the other side . What other side ? You want to drown us both ? You want to know how I did it ? This is how I did it. I never saved anything for the swim back . You couldn 't see , could you ? That night , crossing the street . You crossed anyway . If you 're still interested , let me know . Sorry ... . The wind caught it . You 're flying today , aren 't you ? Look at what a mess you 're in . - l have your samples ready . - l don 't need any where l 'm going . You might when you get back . Everything you need to last you two lifetimes . Why have you done all this ? So Jerome will always be here when you need him . - Where are you going ? - l 'm traveling too . - l don 't know how to thank you . - No , no . I got the better end of the deal . I only lent you my body . You lent me your dream . Not until you 're upstairs . - What is this ? - New policy . - Flight got you nervous ? - There 's a problem , Lamar . I never did tell you about my son , did I ? He 's a big fan of yours . Just remember that I was as good as any and better than most . - He wants to apply here . - l could have gone up and back . And nobody would 've been the wiser . Unfortunately , my son 's not all that they promised . But then , who knows what he could do ? Right ? For future reference , right-handed men don 't hold it with their left . Just one of those things . You 're going to miss your flight , Vincent . For someone who was never meant for this world , I must confess I 'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it . Of course , they say every atom in our bodies was once part of a star . Maybe I 'm not leaving . Maybe I 'm going home .

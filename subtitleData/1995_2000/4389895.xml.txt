 Sorry ! Obviously , Ensign Baytart doesn 't appreciate music . It 's the darn fluid conduits running through the walls . They conduct sound . You think when they designed this thing , they would 've ... The ship was built for combat performance , Harry , not musical performance . Nobody figured we 'd be taking any long trips . Where am I supposed to practice ? How about cargo bay ? Bad acoustics . We could get Baytart transferred to the night shift . Couldn 't do that . Could we ? So now you have an excuse to give your mother why you didn 't practice while you were gone . Look , I 'm trying to prepare for an important performance . Oh , really ? Are we scheduled to rendezvous with the Delta Quadrant Symphony Orchestra ? No . Susan Nicoletti and I have been working on a new orchestral program for the holodeck . Lieutenant Nicoletti ? The one I 've been chasing for six months ? Cold hands , cold heart ? Not when she plays the oboe . Chakotay to all senior officers . Please report to the Bridge . You know , Harry , I 've always wanted to learn how to play the drums . I am picking up communication satellites in orbit . They 're nonfunctional . Mr. Paris , take us in a little closer . Mr. Kim , scan the surface . Captain , this used to be a major trading spot . How long ago ? I 'm not sure exactly . If I had to guess ... EM signature indicates that a major solar flare occurred here 19 years ago . I 'd say about 19 years ... more or less . Looks like a glacial freeze . Caused by a solar flare that radically changed the weather patterns . It did a lot more than that . They were hit by magnetic storms and extreme levels of radiation . Those glaciers are receding . The biosphere seems to be recovering . Did anyone survive ? I 'm scanning the settlement . There 's evidence of advanced technology ... warp reactors , subspace transmitters ... but no life signs . Maybe they saw it coming and evacuated the planet . Indications are that any attempt at an evacuation would have been prevented by the atmospheric disturbances . What was the estimated population ? Approximately 400,000 . Captain . I 'm picking up something from the surface . I think we 're being hailed . I thought you said there weren 't any life signs . There aren 't . I scanned the entire surface . Must be an automated signal . Let 's hear it . I am Viorsa , planner for the Kohl settlement . Your sensors have activated this message . By now , you must be aware of the catastrophic disaster that has destroyed our home . A few of us have managed to survive in a state of artificial hibernation , programmed to end in 15 years from the date this was recorded . At that time , when the eco recovery has begun , we will attempt to rebuild our settlement . Please do nothing to interrupt our timetable . Their timetable was supposed to end four years ago . Looks like they didn 't make it . Mr. Kim , wouldn 't your scans have picked up suppressed metabolic activity ? I would think so , Captain . Unless ... Checking below the surface . Nothing one kilometer down . Two kilometers ... Wait a minute . I think I 've got something . 2.3 kilometers down ... extremely faint bio-signatures . Three humanoids . Can you detect a malfunction in their systems ? Something to explain why they didn 't wake up on schedule ? Not at this distance . But I am picking up two more humanoids at the same location who are dead . Are there any automated security systems ? We triggered a " do not disturb " sign . I don 't want to set off anything worse . No weapons of any kind , Captain . It is safe to transport the hibernation pods to Voyager , if that is your intent . It is . Prepare to beam them to Cargo Bay 1 . Mr. Kim , you 're with me . Janeway to Kes , report to Cargo Bay 1 . Bring your medical gear . Aye , Captain . Two humanoids dead . Three humanoids in deep stasis . Life signs apparently stable . Our messenger . Did the system break down ? Not that I can see . I 'm not reading any pathway failures in the hibernation pods . The circuitry all seems to be functioning . It looks like their brains are interconnected in a complex sensory system controlled by this computer . According to these indicators , Captain , their minds are active . Active ? What do you mean ? The encephalographic reading suggests they 're dreaming , but there 's some kind of interactivity with the computer . It 's not just scanning their brain functions . It 's sending a data stream back to them , as well . Could it be generating an artificial environment of some sort ? Artificial environment ? Years ago , Starfleet used a technology to assist deep space travel that kept the body in stasis , but provided a mental landscape to keep the mind active and alert . That sounds like a pretty good way to wait out a planetary disaster . For the moment , it 's as good a theory as any . So , what went wrong ? Why are they still in there ? The system was supposed to bring these people out of hibernation four years ago . However , it wasn 't left entirely to the computer . The programmers obviously wanted the people in the system to decide for themselves when it would be safe to come out . This was accomplished by a subroutine that periodically displayed atmospheric conditions to them . So , they should 've known years ago that the biosphere had recovered . Exactly . This subroutine has remained available to these people since it was activated four years ago . It 's literally an escape hatch . Perhaps it has malfunctioned . No . That 's what 's so odd about this . As far as I can tell , it 's working perfectly . Then why don 't they get themselves out ? I don 't know . Maybe they like it in there . I don 't think so . Doctor ? The two victims died from massive heart failure and there was evidence of prior neural trauma . I 'm sorry . What does that mean ? It could be evidence of extreme ... fear . Maybe it was caused by the panic that accompanies a heart attack . The readings suggest an extended period of mental stress . Sounds like we ought to get them out right away . Surely , Commander , you 're not suggesting we simply unplug them ? Why not ? Because you have three brains whose survival has depended upon careful monitoring by a sophisticated computer system for 19 years . The Doc is right . I have no idea how to disconnect them without causing neural damage . I just don 't know the system well enough . They know the system . Why don 't we ask them how to proceed ? How can we do that ? Implant a com-link into their brains ? We already have a means of communication ... the two unoccupied pods . We could add a backup life support system , using our own computer and medical stasis technology . The only way to help those people is to go in and find out from them what 's wrong . I don 't see any alternative . Neither do I. I 'll be monitoring your mental and physical functions . If we detect any unusual activity , you 'll be transferred onto our life support system and resuscitated . We 've tapped into the system 's recall subroutine program . I 'll give you five minutes to look around , then I 'm bringing you back . Consider this a test run . Understood . Inducing primary stasis . Autonomic nervous system link is secure . They 're connecting to the system . Looks like we made it . How do you feel ? Normal . These must be characters generated by the computer , but I don 't see our people . Neither do I. Uh , excuse me . We 're trying to find some friends . Well , that shouldn 't be difficult . We 're all friends here . - Oh , I 'm sorry . - Oh , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to bump into you . You 're new . Yes , we are . Where are you from ? Another town . There aren 't any other towns . We 're not getting very far . Perhaps I can help you . You are looking for friends ? That 's right , three of them . And when you find these friends ... ? We want to talk to them . Why talk when we can dance ? Let 's get out of here . You got it . You ! Take him . Harry . Harry ! Harry ! Harry ! Stop ! They 're aliens ! And they won 't be alone . Kill them , and their shipmates will shut down the program . Let him go ! We knew this would happen someday ... that a ship would find us . It was only a matter of time . Only a matter of time , yes . Who knows what kind of people they are ? Who knows what will happen to this world if you hurt them ? I do . I know . Bring them here ! Bring them here , bring them here . You 're like me . A little of this and a little of that . Ooh ! My , what a temper . That 's from your mother 's side , isn 't it ? Yes . You see ? I know everything . This is my world , my festival , and you 're here without an invitation . What is going on ? Who is he ? You will talk to me . I speak for them . And I speak for you , now . You don 't understand that yet . You don 't accept it ... but you will . Are you a life-form or some kind of computer virus that penetrated this system ? A virus , a virus He thinks I am a virus Well , perhaps I 'll be a virus today . Oh , this one 's got a mind full of technical and operational thoughts and ideas . Harry knows viruses . Stop this . I know you came here to get them and take them away . But if you do that , we 'll all disappear . Disappear . Because you 're characters created by this program . And once their minds stop interacting with the system , you won 't exist anymore . Ah , see the technical mind at work . It seeks diagnostics , data analysis . Well , here 's some more data for your mind to analyze and diagnose , Harry . Yes , I am merely what has been created and is being created by his brain , his brain , her brain , and now ... yours , and yours . Wha ... ? What 's this doing here now ? This is your work . That 's our wake-up call . It 's been a real pleasure , but ... we 're leaving . Come on . If you leave , one of them will die . One of them will die . Try it and see . If you leave ... he dies . He can do it . He 's already killed two of our colleagues . How is that possible ? I cut off their heads . But none of this is real . Of course it 's real . As real as a nightmare . The two we found dead , both suffered from massive heart attacks . Heart attack . Now , what might cause a heart attack ? Hmm . Unmanageable stress , perhaps ? Unmanageable fear ? The fear of losing a head , perhaps ? ! You scared them to death . What 's taking them so long ? Life signs are stable . There 's no interruption in brain wave activity . The recall subroutine is functioning . The window opened for them on schedule . Captain , the norepinephrine levels are rising . They 're well above baseline . Some of that is to be expected , but these levels indicate abnormal stress . All right . I 'm going to try to bring them out with our backup systems . Initiating resuscitation . The body temperature is rising . What happened ? Their bodies are returning to stasis condition , Captain . Someone is terminating the recall command from inside the system . Very wise of you , my technically minded fellow . Now , get rid of it completely . It 's an intrusion . It 's ruining the party . That would be a mistake . No mistake . A mistake if you refuse . You 'd be missing an opportunity . Trying to get the better of me ? Trying to trick me ? I know everything you know , Harry Kim . I know how much you miss Libby . I know how you can never hit that G-sharp in the Mozart concerto . Do you think I don 't know you 're trying to defeat me ? Fine . So you know . You 'll also know that what I 'm about to tell you is the truth . You 'd be smart to let one of us go . Would I ? This is your chance to send the outside world a message ... to tell them your demands . I have only one demand ... to exist . Then you 'd better let us tell them . Otherwise , you run the risk of our people shutting down the whole system , because I promise you , they won 't let us stay in here for long . How did this happen ? The system was designed to be adaptive , to observe and respond to our thoughts and adjust the environment to our wishes . Who wished him up ? It happened over months without our even realizing it . All of us had fears about survival , recovery . We never anticipated the computer would manifest those fears into him . Our only hope was that someone like you would come along and find us . It 's almost as though he can read our minds . He seems to know what we 're thinking . He 's generated by the system , and our brains are monitored by the system , so , yes , in a manner of speaking , he can . But there is a delay before he becomes aware of what we 're thinking . It takes a few minutes for our brain activity to be processed by the system . Well , I 've come to a decision , with the help of my friends . You , leave . You , stay . And tell your beloved Captain Janeway that if we die , they die , including you , dear Harry ... you who becomes my best friend as of today . Because she would never kill you , would she , Harry ? No . Why , she 's like a dear old mother to you , isn 't she ? Go ! Someone 's activated the recall subroutine . Captain , it 's Lieutenant Torres . Her body temperature is rising . She should regain consciousness in about ... 12 minutes . At least , we 'll finally get the answers to a few questions . Well , let 's start with the obvious question . If they 're demanding to exist , can we find a way to let them exist in this artificial world of theirs ? Not unless you 're prepared to leave one person in stasis permanently . I concur with Lieutenant Torres . The computer uses bioneural feedback from the participants ' brains to create the environment . Doctor , is there a way to speed up resuscitation ? Only by a few minutes . Anything more , we 'd be risking serious brain damage . Ten minutes would be about the best we could do . Ten minutes and all the hostages could be killed . Then it seems to me our first order of business should be to reduce the number of hostages . All we have to do now is decide how to negotiate with ... an emotion . With a manifestation ... of fear . Fear is the most primitive , the most primordial of biological responses . The ability to recognize danger ... to fight it or run away from it . That 's what fear gives us , but ... when fear holds you hostage ... how do you make it let go ? Maybe we should try to make them laugh . A good joke just ... uh , seems to make fear dissolve . Well , it does in me , anyway . I think something a little more responsive to The Clown 's demand . B 'Elanna , maybe you can come up with a way to modify the system so it can run without bioneural interaction . How do we negotiate without sending in another hostage ? Good question . We have to come up with a safer method of communication . I regret very much what has happened to you . You came to help . You didn 't deserve this . I regret so many things . Look . We don 't have time for regret . My people are working on a way ... right now ... to get us out of here , and we have to help them if we can . You 'll leave hope behind after a few months of this . Why does he do it ? We 're his canvas ... his blocks of marble . With us , he practices his ghastly art . Thinking about escape , are we , Harry ? Naughty , naughty . I don 't like those thoughts . We 're going to have to do something about them . He 's new . He can 't help thinking about getting out . He can ! You don 't think about it anymore . Oh , but he 's new ... and you 're old . New and old ... old and new . Well , then , the answer is to simply ... make you old , Harry . Are you afraid of growing old , Harry ? Is that what you fear ... being cared for by nurses ? Time for your medicine . You don 't like being helpless , do you , Harry ? You like to take care of yourself . Yes , I know how you hate to feel like the baby on the crew . Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho ! Oh , what 's the matter , Harry ? Ooh , does my costume frighten you , huh ? Ooh ! Coochie-coo . Yeah . Oh , look at little Harry fly ! Whoo ! Whoo ! There he goes ! Whoo ! Whee ! All right , that 's enough . This is not reality . It 's an illusion . When your only reality is an illusion , then illusion is a reality . Like the man said : " The only thing we have to fear is fear itself . " Oh , I thought we were going to be friends . Didn 't want to do this , Harry . No , I didn 't want to bring this up in front of the others , but I know what really scares you . I know when you were nine and your parents took you to that colony ... the radiation disaster ? Humanitarian mission ? You visited a hospital ! You remember . No . You wandered off by yourself where you weren 't supposed to be . The only thing we have to fear is fear itself . You saw people and things you weren 't supposed to see ... sick and dying ... Keep repeating : " The only thing we have to fear is fear itself ! " " The only thing we have to fear is fear itself . " And how about : " There 's no place like home ! There 's no place like home ! " Try clicking your heels together three times . Oh , but your legs are restrained , aren 't they ? Just like that little girl you saw on the operating table ? The doctor called for a scalpel ... She looked at you , her face filled with fear . Fear ... fear . Fear . Do you remember ? ! No ! Excuse me . You 're not holding that properly . Correct positioning of the index finger is necessary for optimal dexterity . Who are you ? ! I 'm Captain Janeway 's representative . I 'm here to negotiate with you . Are you well , Mr. Kim ? I 'm starting to feel better . You 're different . I don 't know anything about you . You 're not on the system . I would be pleased to tell you all about myself at a more appropriate time . For now , suffice it to say that I am here by a miracle of technology . Now , let 's get down to the issues , shall we ? How am I supposed to negotiate if I don 't know what you 're thinking ? I have a very trustworthy face . My Captain is prepared to give you exactly what you ask for under the condition you release all the hostages . Release the hostages ? ! We would provide continuing input from a simulated brain . A computer model that would generate ... Simulated brain ? Simulated ? I myself have a com ... It won 't work . It 's a lie . Tell ' em , Harry . I don 't know that for sure . Liar ! Viorsa ! Get over here . Tell him . It might require a recalibration of the optronic pathways ... Liar ! After all this time , do you think I can 't tell when you lie ? ! - The simulated brain ... - Would leave me at your mercy ! No . They stay . The Captain is prepared to risk the lives of the hostages rather than leave them under your control . Who is she to tell me what I have to do ? She 's the one out there with the " off " switch in her hand . She would never kill Harry . I 'd rather die than spend my life in here with you . She knows that . I won 't let them go . A compromise . Let some of them go . No . We 've studied your system . You only need one to survive . And if that one gets sick and dies ? No ! I need them all . Now go away and tell your Captain Janeway I 'm disappointed . I expected more from her . If we could just ... Go away ! Go away ! Go away ! I 'll be back . Go away ! Go away ! Go away ! Go away ! Well , I 'm sorry I don 't live up to his expectations . What 's your opinion of him , Doctor ? Unstable ... unpredictable . Everything you 'd expect from " fear . " Captain , the longer we allow this to continue , the more likely it is that he will take his frustrations out on the hostages . I agree . And I can 't allow that to happen . We 're going to have to mount some kind of rescue mission . Doctor , if we do simply disconnect the hostages ... There would certainly be brain damage . How much damage ? Could you possibly repair it ? Possibly ? Yes . Would Mr. Kim still be able to hold his clarinet when I was done ? Possibly . The brain is such an interesting organ . Could we switch over to a simulated brain without The Clown noticing it ? Oh , he 'd notice . He was very smart to reject the whole notion of a simulated brain . It just wouldn 't be the same . There is no way an artificial intelligence can replace actual brain functions . I 'll choose not to take that personally , Lieutenant . For what it 's worth , Mr. Viorsa suggested there would be a way to make a simulated brain function in this system . He suggested it would take ... a " recalibration of the optronic pathways . " I don 't know what he could have been talking about . The optronic pathways have nothing to do with the neural interface . It doesn 't make any sense . Then , perhaps he had another reason for saying it . How do the optronic pathways function in this system , B 'Elanna ? They ... they control the basic elements of the environment , access data banks that were programmed when the system was created . If we interrupt the optronic pathways , we could disassemble that entire world and its characters , piece by piece . If we can 't remove the hostages from the environment , then we might be able to remove the environment from the hostages . How did Viorsa manage to communicate this without The Clown knowing about it ? Perhaps it was because The Clown 's attention was divided at the time . And you 're going to continue to provide him with distractions , Doctor . B 'Elanna , how long will it take to block these pathways ? I 'm not sure how many there are , Captain . And I 'll have to do it manually , because we don 't know how to deprogram the system . You 'll only have a few minutes at best . Once " fear " knows what we 're up to , it 'll be a race against time to save the lives of those hostages . Bravo ! Bravo ! Go away ! I want to be alone . You 're ruining the festival . Don 't be a poop ! I can 't help it . I 'm feeling sorry for myself . Well , don 't take it out on us . Take it out on them . You people ... you wonderful people ... my friends ... You do know how to make a man feel better , don 't you ? Okay , then , what shall we play ? The insect game . Yes , yes . The insect game . You again ? You 're the one who ruined my mood . You and your sweet Captain . My sweet Captain has a new offer to make . No simulated brains . I want real brains . The Captain is prepared to give you ... a cloaking device . I already have a cloaking device . Thank you anyway . I 'm talking about a device that would shield you from being detected by any other interstellar visitors . There are almost 40 pathways to disable , Captain , but I should be able to get it done in under two minutes . Good . Let 's get started . We will return your entire computer system to the subterranean locale where we found it . With the help of Mr. Kim , and a team of Starfleet engineers , it will be an easy matter to install the cloaking device , which will ensure your safety for the foreseeable future . Harry , is this possible ? Yes . I don 't know if I believe you . I don 't know yet ... but I 'll know soon if you 're telling the truth . You can 't fool me . What does she want in return ? And don 't say the hostages , because I 'm not giving them up . You have to understand that the Captain 's primary concern is the safety of the hostages . She 's such a warm and noble person . I 'd love her to come to one of my parties someday . What if I promise to take really good care of my guests ? We could be more than friends . We could be ... colleagues . I 'm really not such a bad fella . What 's happening ? You tricked me ! It 's an attack ! It 's an attack ! Red Alert ! Red Alert ! You ... you warned them . You told them how it could be done ! Take him ! No , please ! No ! Twenty-two . More than halfway there , B 'Elanna . Captain , it 's Viorsa . His norepinephrine levels are rising sharply . No , please ! I didn 't do anything ! I didn 't do anything ! What is it ? Some kind of protection device . I 'm locked out . I 'll have to disable it . Viorsa 's norepinephrine levels are critical . Just ten more pathways . He 's dead ! Massive heart failure . Captain , this one 's norepinephrine levels are approaching critical . You 're next ! You 're next ! Restore the entire program . We 've lost . We 've won . We 've won . We 've won ! Start the music . Start the music . Celebration . Celebration . Celebration . Your decision to capitulate saved the lives of the other hostages , Captain . You should take some comfort from that . I don 't . Have I misjudged him somehow ? Is there another way to reach him ? Isn 't there more to " fear " than a simple demand to exist ? Why do people enjoy dangerous sports or holodeck adventures with the safety off ? Why , after all these centuries , do children still ride on roller coasters ? Fear can provide pleasure . To seek fear is to seek the boundaries of one 's sensory experience . But what does fear seek ... at the end of the ride ? You understand , don 't you , Harry , that we will have to punish you for your Captain 's little trick ? To the winner go the spoils , and you are the spoils , after all . We can talk about that later . For now , enjoy yourself . Well , you certainly know how to bring a party to a halt . I don 't get out very much . I bet . The Captain has sent me with an ultimatum . Ultimatum ? ! Ultimatum . She would give me an ultimatum ? Did Napoleon give an ultimatum after Waterloo ? Did Chulak of Romulus give an ultimatum after his defeat at Galorndon Core ? We won . We give the ultimatums around here . The Captain is prepared to shut down the system one minute from now , if you don 't agree to her terms . And scramble the brains of all my guests , including Harry ? I don 't think so . 52 seconds . She is willing to risk brain damage to the hostages , but she will end this , and end this now , one way or another . What are her ... her terms ? 43 seconds . She will allow you to keep one person on the system . The other hostages must be released . One ? ! Never ! I won 't agree . You have 30 seconds to avoid termination . I need more time ... time to think . Two ... let me keep two . 20 seconds . There is another provision . The one hostage you will be allowed to keep is Captain Janeway herself . She ... would choose to be with me ? Your time is up . Your answer , please . Yes . Captain , this is the Doctor . I 've returned to Sick Bay . Please turn to your emergency medical holographic channel . Did he accept ? Yes , Captain . Perfect . Good work , Doctor . Would you like me to return and supervise the evacuation of the hostages ? I don 't think that 'll be necessary , but you could help with the preparations at this end . Janeway out . We 're finished here , Captain . Initiate the recall subroutine and prepare to begin resuscitation . Kes , give me a hand getting hooked up to all this . Sparkling . I want everything sparkling for her arrival . Sparkling . Uh-uh-uh-uh . Harry , not so fast . They can 't have you until I have her . No more tricks . She 's coming . I can feel the system beginning to scan her brain . Hmm ... this really is such an extraordinary gesture she 's making . I am so moved . You don 't quite believe it yourself , do you ? The Captain would sacrifice herself to save the hostages . Sacrifice herself ? You can be so cruel , Harry . You don 't appreciate my hospitality . You 're here . You 're actually here . I don 't believe it . The arrangement was that the others would be released . You show remarkable trust , Captain . How could you be so sure I would keep my word ? I 've known fear . It 's a very healthy thing most of the time . You warn us of danger , remind us of our limits , protect us from carelessness . I 've learned to trust fear . Finally , someone who appreciates me . Am I blushing ? Let them go . Yes . Yes , of course . You may depart . Farewell , my friends . Do come back and visit . I 'll always be here . The recall subroutine has been activated . Body temperatures are rising . Initiating all backup systems . The hostages should regain consciousness in less than ten minutes . We 'll get you out of here , Captain . I promise . That won 't be necessary , Mr. Kim , but thank you . I can 't wait to get to know you ... to make you a part of me . As I understand it , it takes a few minutes before you become aware of my thoughts . Is that true ? An eternity of anticipation . And then what happens ? And then the fun begins . All systems functioning as anticipated . Resuscitation entering final warming . Bio-functions are returning to normal . Their own hearts are taking over . They don 't need supplemental life support any longer . Would you be honest with me ? Fear is the most honest of all emotions , Captain . You really want this to end as much as I do , don 't you ? Now , now , don 't even think about leaving . I 'm not going to let you go ... not after all this . Mirror ? Don 't we make a beautiful couple , Captain ? I 'm not Captain Janeway . Could have fooled me . I 'm afraid I did . Pardon ? I 'm nothing more than a holographic image of Captain Janeway , sent here by the same technique they used to send their Doctor . I 've been programmed to respond to you as Kathryn Janeway would . But ... but ... l-I feel you . You-you 're on the system . She is on the system , yes , but not in stasis . Captain Janeway and her crew modified the pods , so that she could be connected to the system without having to enter this environment . The goal was to let you sense her brain activity without putting her in actual jeopardy . You will be able to confirm what I 'm telling you as soon as you become aware of her thoughts . You know as well as I do that fear only exists for one purpose ... to be conquered . She tricked me . Did she ? Or was a part of you actually hoping to be defeated ? Isn 't that why you allowed Captain Janeway to come here ? Because you sensed she had the power to subdue you ? No . She lied . It was very unStarfleet of her . Starfleet Captains don 't easily succumb ... to fear . What will become of us ? Of me ? Like all fear , you eventually ... vanish . I 'm afraid . I know . Drat .

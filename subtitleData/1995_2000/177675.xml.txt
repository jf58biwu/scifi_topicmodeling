 [ humming ] That 's it ! I 've done it ! I 've just harvested an entirely new element from a totally unknown dimensión ! Let 's see , historical precedents dictate that I name it . Hmm . How 's this , ah , Reedium ? - Uh-huh . - It 's a joke , darling . Try ... " Goop , " Mr. Wizard . You 're taking the night off to go to the movies with Johnny and me . And it 'll be good for Johnny . All he does is mope around since he lost his girl , Crystal . - Sittin ' this one out , Ben ? - Yeah . My girl Alicia 's on her way over . We 're gonna march to my tune . Eatin ' munchies and watchin ' The Three Stooges . Don 't let anything disturb my new discovery , Ben . [ Sue ] Reed ! Oh ! [ laughs ] I got lots better uses for Stretcho 's gizmo than makin ' purple jello . Namely corn-poppin ' ! You know , this is ten times faster than Susie 's microwave . And it pops all the kernels . Man , I ... I am gettin ' hungry . [ roaring ] No ! No ! Please , no ! Wh ... No ! No , please . Go away . What 's wrong with me ? I 'm shakin like a snowbound sunbather ! - Don 't hurt me ! - That 's right , creature . Tremble ! Quiver in terror ! Such is the power of Psychoman ! The beast that you shrink from is but an illusión . No more than the symbol of your own deepest fear , fear of losing control over your beastly , inhuman strength . And as your fear grows , so grows the ... [ gasps ] Where is the element ? Ben ! Ben , who 's that ? What 's going on ? [ screams ] Alicia ! No ! Deal with it , Grimm ! Deal with it ! Remarkable ! I 've never seen anyone whose courage was a match for my fear ray . Huh ? It 's okay , sweetie . Hey , Benjy 's right here . Hey , rockpile , this guy must 've been one heavy-duty boogeyman . Tonight you better sleep with your night-light on . Yeah ? Well , scaring ' Alicia ain 't funny ! What is funny is you in a full body cast ! Ooh ! Let me show you how a pro does it . Fascinating . My scan of the armor 's molecular structure reveals that this Psychoman came from another dimensión . The same one my new element came from . Are you following any of this , darling ? Gee , afraid not , darling . Poor Reed , it must be so trying to have to explain everything to your backward wife . Really , Susan ! Such sarcasm is hardly called for , especially from a girl who moves her lips when reading the time . Hey , hey . Lay off of Sue , you egomaniacal egghead . She 's much smarter than you ever give her credit for . What 's the matter , you blue-eyed baby ? That orange hide turning ' yellow on you ? Come down here and say that , you glorified gas log ! Stop it , you two ! I can 't stand you when you act like spoiled children ! Now you 're the one acting like ... Hey ! Hey , hey . - What the ding-dong am I doin ' ? - More like what are we doing ? It 's this element . It must have some radioactive effect on the molecular structure of the brain 's chemicals . - It affects our thinking ? - And our emotions . In the wrong hands , it would give someone the unlimited power to manipulate people . Oh ... My head 's spinning . I need some air . Me too . Come on . Let 's go get a nice cup of coffee down at the café . And I want to store this , as Ben calls it , goop in my negative-field ionizer , where no one but the Fantastic Four can get at it . No one but the Fantastic Four ? [ tuts ] Well , then , I shall have to activate my membership . Ben just hates trying on clothes . - Really ? - And he 's impossible to fit . The popping buttons have put five salesmen on disability . You think he 's hard to fit ? Try buying a sports coat that 'll stretch 500 feet . Reed ! Hi ! That was quick , darling . - Where 's Johnny and Ben ? - Something 's come up . No time to explain . We 're needed immediately ! Well , uh , okay , sure , Reed . But Alicia ... Oh , I 'm fine , Sue . I 'll take a cab home . Hey , Alicia . Ben stayed to guard the ... Hey , wait a minute ! Where 's Sue ? Sue ? Why , she went with ... you . I love those mouthy meeces ! [ phone rings ] - Talk to me . - Ben . Reed needs you to bring Element F to him right away . - Bring what ? - The ... goop . We 're at the Avenger 's Mansión . - Ow ! - [ dead line ] Goodbye to you , too , Susie . I wonder why Susie wants this stuff , anyhow . - Taxi ... - Give me that container ! Or you will meet your ultimate defeat at the hands of ... Malice , Mistress of Hate . Forget it , lady . I ain 't giving ' nobody nothin ' . And Ben Grimm sure ain 't fighting ' no lady . [ splutters ] Y 'know , after some ruminating ' , I 've decided you ain 't no lady . Ow ! [ chokes ] - I can 't ... breathe . - Aw ! Poor little Thingy out of breath ? [ chuckles ] Take a hike , toots . That 's a good little superhero . Reed Richards ! You will die ! Yes . As I promised , Reed Richards will become your prey . But first , we return to my world to set a little trap . For the rest of my family ? So the next thing I know is I wake up in the alley alone . - Johnny , any sign of Sue ? - Sorry , brother-in-law . No luck . Hey , we 'll find her , Stretch . She couldn 't have just vanished off the face of the Earth . - Did you get the images ? - Sure . Right here . Ben , you said Sue told you to bring her Element F , right ? Yeah ? So what ? Well , the trouble is , I never named the new element . In fact , there 's only one being who might know its name . This heat-image tracer can replay pictures of recent events by capturing the residual heat images that remain behind . Right . They just had a clearance sale on those at Bloomie 's . Hey , that 's the dame , all right . Spiked collar , red cape . Reminds me , Mother 's Day is comin ' up soon . Look , it 's Sis ! [ Reed ] Now , if the coordinates match ... Malice , Mistress of Hate , is Sue . Oh , man . Mamma mia ! You mean I was goin toe-to-toe with Susie ? Hey , slow down , Reed ! Where are we goin ' ? To get Sue back ! If Psychoman 's hurt her in any way at all ... But why the Reducto-Craft ? Psychoman 's armor revealed he came from a subatomic dimensión , one that can only be reached by shrinking to microscopic size , then passing through a dimensional portal . Ah ... Figures ! Why can 't the bad guys ever live in Waikiki ? We 're now in a place no human 's ever been . A world within worlds , the Microverse . Because of our Reducto-Craft 's limited charge , we 've only got a half-hour to find Sue and get her back . After that , the portal closes up again , trapping us for ever . Get real ! How are we gonna find them in a half-hour ? It 's my guess Psychoman will find us . We 're hit ! Something 's jammed the micro-gyro . Johnny , take over ! [ Thing ] Speed racer ! Slow this rust bucket down or you 're gonna wear my breakfast ! Oh ! [ Thing groans ] Look ! Over there ! Flame on ! What ? Nothing . I could 've sworn I ... No . It 's just a barren wasteland . Actually it 's just the opposite , Johnny . Look at the shape of those crystalline structures . Notice their grid-like placement . What are you guys talkin ' ' bout ? Hey , yeah , almost like buildings or somethin ' . Exactly like buildings . We 've landed in the middle of a city . - Whoa ! - Hey ! What 's goin ' on ? No ! Flame on ! Help ! Flame on ! Flame on ! No ! No ! Lay off the kid , you creep ! Ain 't it enough you kidnapped Susie and swiped Stretcho 's goop ? Actually , Ben , I 'm afraid we 're the thieves . Say what ? If my theory is correct , the element I took from this dimensión belonged to Psychoman . It 's the fuel for his psychoweapons , which he obviously uses to enslave the inhabitants of this world with fear . Oh , a charming necessity , I assure you . Once I saw your amazing powers , I realized you could be enormously useful in controlling my subjects , as my fear police . So , with your lovely wife as bait , I lured you to my dimensión , and reduced you even more to your present puny size . And to force us to carry out your sick orders , you 're brainwashing us with your psychological torture . Call it a hobby . And now to continue . [ screams ] Let me at him ! Ah ... Interesting . If I reduce my molecular cohesión to a minimum ... All right . It 's Dr. Blob . [ Thing ] Whoa ! Takes a lickin ' and keeps on tickin ' ! [ Reed groans ] Oh , yeah . Stand back ! It 's clobberin ' time ! Flame on ! Back off , Ben ! He 's mine ! Huh ? Hey ! What the ... ? He shrunk ! No , Ben , he was never any bigger than what you see . - The rest was just an illusión . - Huh ? Well , maybe now he 'll stick to charades . Let 's move ! Only five minutes till the dimensional portal closes forever . And I 'm not leaving without Susan ! - Looking for me ... dear ? - [ all ] Susan ! Correction . Malice . Susan Richards was a pathetic creature . Someone to be ignored at worst , patronized at best . Someone you stifled and frustrated at every turn . Wait a minute . Hold on , Susie . Long-winded as he can be ... - Keep out of this ! - Dang ! Sis ! Why are you doing this to the ones who love you ? Liar ! And now ... my dear , devoted husband . Susan ! [ Reed groans ] It 's all over , darling . And now you are going to die . That 's right , Reed . It 's a force-field bubble inside your body . Growing , expanding , pressing outwards . - [ yells ] - Sue ! - For pity 's sake , stop ! - Silence ! Or I will crush you too , baby brother ! I 'm gettin ' real intimate here with my spleen . You got any brainstorms , Doc ? Just one . Susan ! Stop this nonsense at once ! I 'm in no mood to put up with your silly drivel ! What ? You dare speak to me like that ? Susan , I 'm ordering you to be quiet ! I 've indulged your tantrums for years . But now is not the time for such games . What ? Games ? Yes , games ! I 'm sick of coddling you . Face it , you never could carry your weight in this group . - We all know that . - That 's a lie ! Susan , I said shut up ! - I ... hate you ! - Yes ! Go ahead ! Hate me ! You weak , silly , spineless ... [ yells ] Very clever , Richards . But completely wasted . Pity , you 'd have made such exemplary fear police . I 'm afraid you 're dangerously over-qualified for the position . Malice , release them . As you say , master . [ groans ] My achin ' everything ! I take it now you 'll dispose of us ? With a little assist from my hate cannon . A hundred times more potent than my previous psychoray . Shall we test it ? Master , permit me to pull the trigger ! As you wish , my dear . Y 'know , what we need here is the world 's best marriage counselor . - This one 's for you , monster ! - What ? [ Psychoman ] No ! [ screams ] You ... ! - Attagirl , Sis ! - We got her back ! Thank heavens it worked . I forced Sue 's hatred beyond her means to hold it inside . The psychic explosión freed her from Psychoman 's control . You stupid , ugly , demented , loathsome weakling ! You failed ! You 're a miserable failure ! I 'll destroy you ! Destroy you ! Extraordinary . [ jabbers ] [ Reed ] He 's consumed with total self-hatred . Let him write Dear Abby . Meanwhile , we got one minute to boogie ! No sweat ! One boogie buggy comin ' up . [ Reed ] That 's it for Psychoman and his fear weapons . Maybe now the inhabitants of this world will get a little taste of freedom . Ben , Johnny , Reed . - I 'm so sorry about ... - Oh , I know , darling . It 's just good to have you back . Although you do look fetching in black . - Johnny , take the controls . - I 'm all over it . Cool . Aw , no ! Don 't let the kid drive ! [ Johnny laughs , Thing groans ] [ Thing ] I think I 'm gonna flash my head . [ Thing gags ]

 I can 't see anything . I need to go lower . The child is just below you , Jarod . Collapse is imminent . You have to abort . I can save him , Sydney . I can save him ! - You have to abort . - No ! [ Young Jarod Yelling ] No . ! You 're dead . - I coulda done it . - What ? Save him ? You can 't save everyone , Jarod ... no matter how hard you try . [ Squeaking ] [ Man ] Jarod Halstrom . [ Chuckles ] He was the coolest Ph.D. we 've had in this place . He had a private grant , rented the lab from the university ... and paid me mucho dinero . - What kind of research were you doing ? - Nada . All we did was eat Pez , watch Frankenstein movies and play with mice . - The live ones anyway . - Live ones ? Yeah , half of them were dead or comatose . See , Jarod used to inject them with something ... and then stare at them for hours . It was kinda ghoulish . Then he donated his little critters to the school when he left . Except for this white one . Jarod called him Jacob . Jacob ? - Hmm ? - Nothing . Well , Jarod used to carryJacob around in his pocket like it was his best friend . - They 're distant cousins actually . - [ Phone Ringing ] Excuse me . I have to get that . No dead fireman or wounded cameraman . Maybe he 's getting bored . Mm-mmm . Jarod will never be bored in the outside world . He 's trying to save lives . [ Siren Wailing ] We have a female , late 20s , leg fracture ... possible vertebral fracture with internal bleeding . We started her on an I.V. of normal saline , wide open . She 's coding ! Move ! Come on , come on , come on . Stay with me ! Stay with me ! [ Man Narrating ] [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Sydney 's missing when he 's here . Well , actually , he was a no-show at the sim lab . He left four sets of twins twiddling their , uh , 16 thumbs . Sydney 's a no-show for a roomful of human bookends ? [ Quietly ] Security reported some drugs missing ... from the Centre pharmaceutical lab . A nurse says she saw Sydney leaving there early this morning . - [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - I 'll talk to you later . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - [ Chattering ] - Your daughter needs you . [ Chattering Continues ] - Trauma five , stat . - She has a little girl . Okay , we 'll take it from here , Jarod . Jarod . - She has a little girl . - Someone get him off my patient . Jarod , we 're done . [ Water Running ] - All right , let 's go . - I 'm gonna stay here for a while . - She 's goin ' into surgery . - I know . I just wanna make sure she 's all right . Oh , no , no , no . Look . Okay , I 've been only driving with you , what , a couple weeks , right ? Take my word for it . You get too personal with a client ... that 's just energy you can 't spend saving the next one . All right ? We do our best for these people , then we move on . You can 't train yourself to think that way , this job will kill you . [ Man ] Not if I do it first . Why don 't I have proper treatment reports on your last five deliveries ? - Deliveries ? - Dr. Fletcher , meetJarod Randolph . I hope your partner 's better at driving them in than he is at doing his paperwork . I will get to that paperwork when I get a break , all right ? I promise . You better . [ Beeping ] [ Miss Parker ] Sydney made quite a heist from the Centre pharmacy . Cylin , triphenylmide ... d ... uh ... Diflutazenil . Uh , a reversal agent ... a neurostimulant and an antidepressant . Huh . Great . Great . Now Sydney will turn up in some hop house , and we 'll loseJarod 's trail again . Start decrypting his files . Maybe there 's a clue there . - Uh ... Um ... [ Clears Throat ] - [ Keyboarding ] You 're ... You 're invading my space . Close is good . [ Chattering ] Why is there a severed animal 's limb hanging from your rearview mirror ? - It 's a rabbit 's foot . - Technically , it 's a paw . What , you mean you 've never seen one of those before ? - It 's lucky . - Not for the three-legged rabbit . [ Dispatcher , Indistinct ] Sure , yeah . Coffee time . Would you guys keep it down ? I 'm trying to sleep here . You might get more rest if you turn down your music . Self-hypnosis . Trying to study while I sleep . The New England Journal of Medicine . I 'm impressed . Yeah ? Tell the admissions board at Atlanta . I am out of the E.M. T. business come this fall , with a little luck . Have you tried a rabbit 's foot ? - I 'm a four-leaf clover person myself . - Oh , man , Vargas is here . - Who 's Vargas ? - Max Vargas , State Board of Inspection . I didn 't think the inspection was going to be for another two weeks . This guy is a bigger pain in the ass than the suits at the hospital . Are those the same pains in the ass who call me at home looking for their paperwork ? You must be Randolph . What 's it like being independently wealthy ? - I beg your pardon ? - Well , you 've been here a month ... and you haven 't done your W-4 , so you must have a little nest egg stashed away somewhere . It must have slipped through the cracks . Well , it 's my job to fill in those cracks . Maybe you and I should go to the office and fill these forms in ... so the books have a semblance of order . Oh , uh , Mr. Vargas , Jarod and I have a union-guaranteed coffee break now . You 'll be using it to fill out these forms . I 'll have them on your desk first thing in the morning . See that you do . [ Rolling Thunder ] It 's sweet that you talk to him , Sydney . - Some people think they 're not aware . - Hmm . He needs to know he 's not alone . - [ Monitor Beeping ] - Jacob . I have discovered this experimental research ... the Halstrom Technique . Jarod sent it to me . It 's a long shot , but it 's our best hope . I promised you ... I would never give up . - [ Honking , Crashing ] - [ Young Jacob ] Sydney ! Sydney ! [ Monitor Beeping ] [ Mr. Chambers Reading ] " While Sydney Carton ... " and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room ... " speaking so low that not a sound was heard ... Mr. Lorry looked atJerry in considerable doubt and mistrust . " [ Jarod ] He 's a stockbroker from Alpharetta . His name is Jerry Mitchell . Queen of Mercy , this is Unit 45 . We 've got a male , mid 50s , possible head trauma , you copy ? Queen of Mercy ? County General 's closer . Queen of Mercy 's got the best Head Trauma Center in Atlanta . I understand that , but this gentleman needs immediate ... Stabilize him . I 'll do the driving . We could have had him in treatment at County eight minutes ago . Hey , our stockbroker couldn 't be in better hands . - That 's worth eight minutes of his time . - I hope you 're right . I made a judgment call . You got a problem with that ? No . No problem . [ Clears Throat ] Nothing obvious on Sydney 's e-mail . Phone records are all Centre related . You 'd think he 'd occasionally call a 900 number to spice up his life . What about his regular mail ? Medical journals , Plant World magazine . - Book of the Week Club . - Give me that . Annual donation to the Mount Pleasant Home . An historical society maybe ? It 's where he goes for Christmas every year . Dr. Corey . I owe you an apology . I should have relinquished the gurney . Once we 're in the E.R. , it 's your patient . Don 't sweat it , Jarod . At least your heart was in the right place . By the way , that young mother you brought in is going to be fine . That 's wonderful . I 'm not used to seeing an E.M.S. ' er get so personally involved . I find it difficult not to . Sometimes I feel like I know what my patient is going through . I know what you mean . Is that why you 're following up with Steven ? I 've seen this injury a hundred times ... and I 'm usually able to stabilize the patient , but this one ... It 's like I pulled out all the stops ... but he still got away from me . Steven is lucky to have a doctor that cares so much . Are you okay ? It 's just that you can 't always help them enough , and I don 't like that feeling . Well , I think that goes with the job . It doesn 't make it any easier to live with . You 're not thinking of transferring someplace else ? There 's a research position at Cornell Med . I 'm thinking I 'll have an easier time dealing with the mice . Don 't be so sure about that . Look , do yourself a favor . Really think about your decision . This hospital needs people like you . " It is a far , far better thing that I do ... " than I have ever done , " it is a far , far better rest that I go to ... than I 've ever known . ' " How about a break before we start the next book ? - He likes Dickens . - Dickens is hopeful . Even his saddest endings are uplifting . I brought you some cocoa . Appreciate your visits , Jarod . You 'd think you 'd get enough ofhospitals in your line of work . Well , this hospital could use some more volunteers . How 's Steven doing ? They started him on a new treatment called the trefoil therapy . It was developed at Yale . It delivers neurostimulants directly to the hypothalamus . Um , I have a friend who 's in a coma . They say it has a 20 % success rate . One out of five comes out of it . - And four don 't . - He fits the profile . They said if anyone would accept the treatment ... Steven would . He 's a fighter . - Right , hon ? - Right . Do you mind ? So , Steven was a wrestler . Took first place in the state finals his senior year . He was behind in two out ofhis five matches . But he came back . Pulled it out . Well , you must be very proud . He never gave up . We 'd cheer him from the stands . I think hearing us made him try harder . [ Jarod ] I haven 't been in many hospitals ... [ Jarod ] I haven 't been in many hospitals ... but I really do believe that people in a coma ... they hear everything that goes on around them . Enjoy the cocoa . [ Woman On P.A. ] Dr. Michaels to Admitting . Dr. Michaels to Admitting . " Chapter One . " Treats of the place where Oliver Twist was born ... and of the circumstances attending his birth . ' " Well , are you gonna open the letter ? Yes . Wait , wait , wait , wait . For good luck . All right . I 'll open it . [ Exhales ] Oh , my God . - I 'm ... in ! - All right ! You 're gonna make a wonderful doctor . I 'd better be . I 'm about to be $ 100,000 in debt . If it isn 't the invisible man . I should , uh , call my family with the news . I followed through on your paperwork . Not only have you not filed your payroll documents ... you don 't seem to have any documents that support your identity . As far as I 'm concerned , you don 't exist . I want your name , your address ... your Social Security number your next of kin , your references . The whole kit , the whole caboodle , I want it now . - Right after lunch . - You better get writing ... or I 'm taking you off the streets . [ Monitor Beeping ] Let 's increase the , uh , cylin to 436 milligram per liter . - And the diflutazenil , let 's go 275 . - All right . You 've been missing for three days , Jacob . I can 't keep covering for you with Mr. Raines . I 've had personal business . You never kept secrets from me . Sydney , I ... I have ethical concerns about our work . Don 't start with that rubbish . We 're not doing anything wrong . - Open your eyes , Sydney . - They are open , Jacob . I see the opportunity to do what we 've been working for all our lives . Get your mind off of your career for one second , will you ? I 'm talking about the children . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] [ Jarod ] Hello , Sydney . Any progress ? [ Sydney ] Halstrom 's Technique , it 's just brilliant . It could help a great many people . One at a time . How 's Jacob ? Nothing yet , I 'm afraid . Tell me , Jarod . Why are you doing this ? The medical profession . It 's about the relief of suffering . Remember ? [ Phone Beeps ] [ Whistling ] Hey , Jacob . Jacob , how you doing ? How you doing ? Did you have a good day ? Hmm ? - Dr. Corey , good morning . - Hey . I wanted to check on the status of the stockbroker that Rennert and I brought in yesterday . We damn near had to life-flight him to County . I thought this hospital had the best Head Trauma Unit in the city . Head Trauma was downgraded months ago , along with a third of our budget . You guys should keep up with current events . What 's with her ? She 's like you . She cares too much . [ Chuckles ] I can 't wait till Thursday . - What happens on Thursday ? - My transfer came through . - I am out of the E.R. - Sarah . They need you here . [ Chuckles ] Look , I have been through this with everyone I know . I 'll give your regards to the mice . [ Man ] Let 's go . ! Let 's move . ! Right in here . ! - [ Woman ] What do you got ? - [ Chattering ] [ Woman On P.A. ] Dr. Fletcher to Administration , please . Dr. Fletcher to Administration . Sydney . - So , who 's Mr. X ? - None of your business . Your business is my business . Jarod can wait . I can 't . Go pack your bags . You 're coming with me . You are not welcome here . All I have to do is call the Sweeper team . Mm-hmm . I have priorities . [ Monitor Beeping ] Who was on duty last night ? Who was on du ... Somebody was here last night ? Who was on duty ? Don 't you have that in one of your files ? - If I did , would I ask you ? - What did you lose ? There 's some personnel files missing , including yours , I may add . Well , I 'm not going to fill out any more paperwork . You won 't have to , Randolph . Jarod . Born in Seattle . Attended Millbrook Elementary . Photographic memory . And I 'm sure I have enough in here right now ... to run a background check on you . I 'm thinking about going into pediatrics . What do you think ? I think a doctor needs to have a strong sense of ethics . What ? Hey , where we going ? - [ Jarod ] Trying out a different route today . - Different route ? Mm-hmm . Peachtree Athletic Center to Queen of Mercy Hospital . It 's interesting . There are two other hospitals that are much closer by . Neither one of them are Queen of Mercy . - What are you talking about ? - Ethics . Steven Chambers was injured during a wrestling match . You and Rennert took him all the way from the athletic center to Queen of Mercy Hospital . Explain to me why a seasoned E.M. T ... would take a critical patient so far out of the loop . Jarod , we did the best we could . By my calculations , it takes at least 25 minutes ... to get from the athletic center to Queen of Mercy . What exactly did you do for him ? Watch him fall deeper into a coma ? Rennert made the judgment call . I looked at Rennert 's record for the last five years . He took at least 30 patients to Queen of Mercy Hospital ... that should have gone somewhere else . Thirty patients with expensive injuries ... that have insurance to pay for it . God knows how many other people ended up like Steven Chambers . A doctor has to have ethics , Julie . People 's lives are in their hands . There had been a ... a Hawks game that night , and we hit the spillover traffic . We just sat there . All I could do was to talk to Steven , you know , try to keep him awake ... while Rennert kept telling me , " We 're doing the right thing . " You could have filed a complaint against him . It was my first week under the reds , Jarod . It took all the guts I had just to tell him we were going the wrong way . Rennert , he warned me never to second-guess him in his rig . I didn 't want any trouble . I just ... I just wanna help people . [ Raines ] Broots . Mr. Raines . Where are they ? Who ? l-I 'm not sure . Um , that is , l-I know where I think they might be . - Tell me . - Well , uh ... They weren 't very specific . They both just took off without saying much . How 's your little girl ? You know , uh ... they ... they did say something about the Mount Pleasant Home . Sy-Sydney goes there from time to time . I know where he goes . [ Nurse ] I 've increased the dosage . You 're aware it 's three times more than you originally requested ? - Mm-hmm . - All right . I had no idea . [ Sydney ] Not many people do . Sydney , what happened ? [ Young Jacob ] I 'm talking about the children . What 's so troubling about children , for God 's sakes ? - Do you know how we got those children ? - I know what I need to know . No , no , you know what the Centre wants you to know . You ... You always do this . You always push away what doesn 't fit into your pristine view of the world . And all you wanna do is poison the good things in your life . - Sydney . ! - [ Crash ] [ Raining ] Jacob . Jacob ! Jacob ! - Jacob ! - [ Sydney ] It was my fault . I knew the road , knew every curve . Sydney , it could have happened to anybody . Uh-uh . A later simulation byJarod suggested otherwise . I should be the one lying in that bed . [ Monitor Beeping ] [ Monitor Beeping Faster ] Jacob . Jacob , are you there ? Jacob . " " I should not let you depart from me thus . ' " " You should , lady , and I know you will , ' rejoined the girl , rising . " You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness . " ' It 's a lovely story . I 'm eager to see how it turns out . For the best , I 'm sure . I brought you some coffee . Thank you . I don 't think he 's going to wake up . [ Jarod ] Don 't say that . I 've given up hope . I know Richard has too . He just won 't admit it . There 's still so much you could try . The hospital therapy ... It failed . The treatment 's run its course . Did they try increasing the dosage ? Increasing , decreasing , diluting . It 's just not working . There 's another therapy I know about . It 's called Halstrom 's Technique . You can 't give up . Steven 's fought so hard . There 's a boy in Cleveland . He needs a heart . We 're trying to decide what to do . At this point , it would take a miracle . Just in case , I want to finish this with him , so ... he knows how it ends . " " Of what use then is the communication you have made , ' said Rose . " This mystery must be investigated . " ' Jacob . [ Sighs ] - I can save him ! - You have to abort . I can save him , Sydney . No ! - You can 't save everyone , Jarod . - Well , I had to try . - [ Sighs ] - [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - Yes . - Sydney . Halstrom 's Technique ... it 's flawed . The effect is only temporary . Thanks , Jarod . Thanks . I have , uh , tried to come here as often as I can ... but my work keeps me occupied . I miss you . Were you aware all this time ? Jacob , the night of the accident ... it stayed with me . I promised you I would do everything in my power to bring you back . You shouldn 't be lying here . You didn 't deserve this . SL-27 ? - Why wasn 't I told ? - It doesn 't concern you . It 's Centre business . - Is he awake ? - I 'd like my question answered . - Answer my question . - He 's awake . - Is he talking ? - Not yet . - Don 't let him . - Sir ? Jacob is a threat to Centre interests . You have an obligation to protect those interests . Do you have a problem with that ? - No , sir . - A Sweeper team ... will be sent to assure you don 't . Make sureJacob never wakes up again . [ Rolling Thunder ] [ Phone Beeps ] Hey . Another day on the lifeline , eh , Jarod ? Hmm . Mr. Rennert , would you leave Mr. Randolph and me ... - alone for a moment ? - We were just about to start our shift . You and I are gonna have to cover a little ground before I let you out on the street again . All right . I ran a background check on you , despite your lack of paperwork ... and some interesting data spewed forth . Because the onlyJarod Randolph I could find in the state archives ... weighs 286 pounds ... and he 's black . It 's time you put your cards on the table , mister . I can 't even verify that you 're trained for this job . And despite the mountain of phone calls that I 've received praising you ... I need to know that the people you 're assisting are in the right hands . Well , I guess my luck just ran out . Gimme one good reason not to call the cops . [ No Audible Dialogue ] So , I heard that , um , Vargas rode you pretty hard last night , huh ? I think there 's gonna be some changes in this unit . [ Woman ] Unit 45 , this is Dispatch . We have a cyclist down on the corner of Peachtree and Dunwoody . [ Siren Wailing ] [ Man On Radio ] Nine-year-old male with a blocked airway , unconscious , not breathing . - [ Continues Indistinct ] - [ Woman ] We copy . [ Groaning ] - It 's okay . - [ Groans ] Gonna take good care of you . Just relax . Pupils are uneven . We should C-spine him . Look at that . Guy can afford a Rolex , you think he 'd invest in a helmet . Guess I 'm the lab rat now , huh , Doc ? [ Groaning ] Sydney 's in the lounge . Keep an eye out . Mr. Raines insists I watch . - [ Plastic Gloves Crinkling ] - We 're done here . He slipped back into the coma . He wrote something down first . I 'm happy for you . Somebody paged me ? - That was me , Dr. Corey . - Oh . Here . - What is this ? - Jarod wanted you to see this . Steven Chambers ? A case can be made for negligence on Rennert 's part . You may want to listen to this . [ Siren Wailing On Walkie-Talkie ] [ Rennert ] Uh , Queen of Mercy , this is Unit 45 . We 've got a down cyclist , uh , possible head injury . Queen of Mercy ? Grady Memorial is a faster run . I 'm not going through this again , all right ? Queen of Mercy 's my call . Rennert , this guy is fading on me . Then you keep him alive till we get to Queen of Mercy ! Come on ! [ Chattering ] [ Man ] Coming through , people . [ Knocking ] What are you doing here ? - Hey . - Hmm . Is this what someone 's life is worth to you ? Hey , I don 't know what this is about . This is about you and this ambulance driver ... endangering the lives of patients so you can cash in on their insurance . It 's about watching a young man 's lifejust fade away . Steven Chambers trusted you . You didn 't care about his life . All you care about is what 's inside this envelope . No , no , no , this is a setup , man . This is not fair . What 's not fair is Steven Chambers 's parents are gonna have to unplug the machines ... that are breathing life into their only son . - I 'm outta here . - Come with me , sir . Hey , wait a minute . What are you doing ? Hey ! Hey ! Oh , man . - Thi ... - Oh , Rennert . You might need this . " I have said that they were truly happy ... " and without strong affection and humanity of heart ... " and gratitude to that being whose code is mercy ... and whose great attribute is benevolence to all things that breathe ... " We need to do this . " Within the altar of the old village church ... " there stands a white marble tablet ... " which bears as yet but one word : " Agnes . ' " There 's no coffin in that tomb ; " and may it be many , many years before another name is placed above it . " But if the spirits of the dead ever come back to earth ... " to visit spots hallowed by the love , the love beyond the grave ... " those whom they knew in life ... " I believe that the shade of Agnes sometimes hovers around that solemn nook . " I believe it , nonetheless ... " because that nook is in a church ... " and she was weak and erring . ' " [ Sustained Tone ] " The end . " All done . It 's good that Oliver found a family . - Darling . - I know . [ Priest Praying , Indistinct ] [ Sobbing ] Godspeed , my son . [ Sobbing ] [ Takes Deep Breath , Exhales ] You were right , Sydney . Well , I have to get back to work . So , you 're staying . Who wants to be around a bunch of mice anyway ? - Where you going ? - Cleveland . [ Female Dispatcher ] Airlift four , what 's your E. T.A. ? [ Man ] Uh , we 'll be touching down in 15 seconds . Out . [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Monitor Beeping ] - Any change ? - No . Since he , uh , slipped back into the coma ... there 's been nothing . - It 's not fair . - What isn 't fair ? Some people , they just fight so hard , but they just don 't make it . Oh , you can 't save them all , Jarod . You may be a Pretender , but you 're human . Right . Halstrom 's Technique ... did it help at all ? It helped enough .

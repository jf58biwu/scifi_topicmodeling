 Man , this little piece ofwood ain 't gonna hold no twister ! - We need to dig a hole ! - Whaley ! Big hole ! The man oughta be givin ' us shovels ! This whole damn place is gonna blow away . Why even bother ? - Yo , boy , back me up here . - Shut up and hold it still ! I know you ain 't talking to me ! You a big man , huh ? Is that right ? Charlie Potatoes , big-ass criminal . Are you a bad man ? You a Iittle bitch ! That 's all you are ! You ain 't got no money . You ain 't got nothin ' . I 'II hold it still . Is that still enough for you ? Put down the hammer , Rawls ! Rawls ! - Messed up ol ' Whaley , did he ? - Messed him up good . - What 'd you go and do that for ? - The man pissed me off , boss . Who the hell doesn 't ? Box him . You can 't put me in that box . The storm 's comin ' . Should 've thought of that before you hurt Whaley . The hell with Whaley . You can 't put me in that box ! Boss ! You can 't put me in there ! You can 't put me in that box ! You can 't do it ! You 're gonna kill me , boss ! Boss ! - They 're sayin ' tornadoes all over the county . - I can 't be responsible for acts of God . - Good luck , Rawls . - Let me out ! Let me out ! Somebody let me out ! Help ! Somebody help ! Somebody help me , please ! Oh , hell . Hello , sir ? Oh , my God . - Should we arrest David Copperfield ? - Yes , we should . But not for this . This is Raybert Fellowes , superintendent of Road Farm 6 , Mississippi Department of Corrections . One of his guards found him in his office . Not a drop of blood in the place . One of his guards found him in his office . Not a drop of blood in the place . Maybe he was killed elsewhere . I don 't think so . It took 40 minutes to do it in the middle of a tornado . What do you make of that ? I don 't know . It 's not a simple bisection . There 's a Iarge amount of his abdomen missing . It almost looks like a burning , but it 's too localized . Maybe an industrial acid . There was no acid found in his office . Spontaneous human combustion . Scully . - Isn 't that where you 're going ? - " Dear Diary , today my heart leapt when Agent Scully suggested spontaneous human combustion . " Mulder , there are one or two somewhat well-documented cases . Mulder , shut up . - OK , what do you make of this ? - I don 't have a theory . But I know someone who does . Hell , yeah . It was Pinker Rawls who did it , though you got me as to how . - And who is Pinker Rawls ? - Inmate . Mean son of a bitch . He was the prisoner who supposedly died in the tornado that preceded Fellowes ' murder . So you 're saying that a ghost did this ? I 'm not puttin ' a word to it . That 's up to y 'all . AII I know is that Rawls hated the captain . Captain locked him in the box when the storm hit and Rawls didn 't like it . And when we found the box , biggest piece was about yea big , three miles from here . Now , this whole place was locked and boarded up tight . No man got in here . That 's all I 'm sayin ' . So we 're looking for a dead man ? I disagree . I think this Pinker Rawls is still alive . They never found his body . OK . At the risk of further ridicule , Mulder , what if this wasn 't a murder ? I mean , as I understand it , current theory on spontaneous human combustion is that climatic conditions play a Iarge part , so possibly a tornado may fit the bill . We 've got lightning , static electricity at a high potential . I can 't argue with that . But I do think it 's murder . Well , then how did Rawls or whoever do this ? How did he get in and out of a locked office , and prop a body up against the inside of a door ? Termites ? This is all he had in his bunk area . Wilson Pinker Rawls , age 34 . Eight years into 30 for robbing a wire office in Bay St Louis . $ 90,000 he stole was never recovered . Not in here . Hey , look at this . Ouch . His record dates to 1978 . Mostly small-time . History of violence throughout . I wonder who she is . Thanks , cutie . - You broke out the good stuff . - We 're worth the good stuff . Hey , Robert ? Can I show you something ? Just a Iittle food for thought ? Wait , they 're talking about the tornado . Take a look at this video . Take a look at this video . Hardest hit was a prison farm near the village of Stringer , where two deaths are reported in the storm . A funnel cloud with winds topping 150 miles per hour tore through the work camp , passing within yards of a barracks filled with terrified inmates . Among the dead , Captain Raybert Fellowes , the farm superintendent , a 28-year veteran of the Department of Corrections . A second casualty was a prison inmate , Wilson P Rawls , age 34 . - Excuse me . - Are you OK , June ? High winds apparently carried the man away . Though his body has not been found , Rawls is presumed dead . You got a gun pointed at you . Don 't try to run . I ain 't running ' . Hey , that 's store property . Take those off ! There 's somethin ' so nice about a brand-new pair of socks . - I don 't know what it is . - I said take those off , boy ! What you think ? That 's me , right ? - And room to grow in . - You got an attitude , I 'II say that . Get the hell over there . Turn around , hands behind the pole . This is Bobby in Security . I detained an intruder at the Value Mart at the Nine Mile Road and Route 60 . The door wasn 't jimmied . I don 't know how the hell he got in here . He 's in back . Yeah , I 'II hold . - Is that the guy ? - Yeah , could be , I guess . It was pretty dark . - How 'd he get away ? - Whoever he was . You got me . The guy 's like Houdini . Turned my back , he was gone . I had him right here . You had him handcuffed here . Can I see your handcuffs ? Do we have a last known address for Pinker Rawls ? Hey , hello ? Rawls ? - What 's up ? - You 're on the news , man . They 're saying you got killed . - Where is she ? - June ? She 's gone . Long gone , man . She left me , Iike , four years ago . You mad ' cause her and me shacked up ? I 'm sorry , buddy . Bo , I want what 's mine . I might have her address . You got nothin ' in there but your nine . Get the hell outta my house . Bo , are you gonna shoot me ? You gonna do somethin ' ? No . No ! This is Rawls ' last known address . The security guard 's car . Mulder . Gesundheit . Oh , my God . Pistol in his hand , the slide locked open , shell casings everywhere . But I don 't see any bullet holes anywhere , Mulder . Don 't recognize him from his driver 's license , do you ? Bo Merkle . This is his house . But Rawls used to live here , and he 's come back looking for something . $ 90,000 . The wire-office robbery eight years ago . That money wasn 't recovered . I don 't think he spent that in prison . Mr Merkle didn 't either , judging by the decor . Maybe she knows . That 's this house , isn 't it ? Yeah . - I can run down her name . - Yeah , I bet Rawls is looking for her . Yeah , this is Special Agent Dana Scully with the FBI . There 's been a murder here at 922 Washington Avenue in Jackson . We need crime-scene support on site as soon as possible . Thank you . Got a name to go with the face . June Gurwitch . There 's no current address though , and no record of her since 1996 . Maybe she changed her name . Maybe she was afraid she 'd end up like that . The state police put out an APB on Rawls . You might warn them not to shoot to kill . He seems to find that annoying . - Even if those were bullets ... - They are . Their composition 's been changed , just like the handcuffs and the prison wall . There is still no way they could pass through Rawls in the way you 're describing . Not without leaving him dead on the ground for us to find . I think they went through him . Like his wrist went through the handcuffs , - Iike he walked through that prison wall . - He walks through solid objects . Changing their composition . Making steel brittle , - turning bullets into powder . - flesh into carbon . How else do you explain what happened to Fellowes , or to poor Mr Merkle , who 's got no face anymore ? Where 's the science in this ? You 're talking alchemy . I 'm not saying it can 't be explained scientifically . Maybe it 's the tornado . You suggested it yourself : unusual climatic conditions , high electrical potential . I 'm sorry I even brought it up . - OK . We both agree on who he 's looking for ? - June Gurwitch . And do we have any idea of how to find June Gurwitch ? She has a sister named Jackie , and I have the address . Hello ? - It 's me . Is this a good time ? - No , Jackie . It is never a good time . The Jackson City Police just called me . Yeah . They 're lookin ' for you . - What 'd you tell ' em ? - Nothin ' . But they brought up Pinker and wanted to know what he might want with you . Pinker 's dead . I heard it on the news . Well , maybe you better call ' em , just in case he 's not . - June ? - I gotta go . June ? Hey , Jackie . That 's not very friendly , Jackie . Jackie . Tell me where she is . I 'm not tellin ' you anything . Jackie Gurwitch ? FBI ! Where 'd he go ? He left . Her son 's at a friend 's house . She 'II meet them there . She said that she didn 't tell Rawls where her sister was . Mulder , she said that he walked right through the wall . Bo Merkle 's car is down the street . That 's how he got here . - I don 't know how he left . - Maybe he left on foot or stole another car . Why would he leave without the information he wanted ? Maybe he 's still in the neighborhood . The local PD can search , but we have to go . - Where to ? - Meridian . It 's where June Gurwitch lives . Or June Burdett , as she 's now called . - Yes ? - Agents Scully and Mulder , FBI . We are looking for June Gurwitch . also known as June Burdett . also known as ... ? June ! What 's this about ? An escaped convict by the name of Wilson Pinker Rawls . We believe he may be pursuing Ms Gurwitch , with the intention of harming her . We believe he may be pursuing Ms Gurwitch , with the intention of harming her . Gurwitch ? I don 't understand . June ? Pinker 's alive , isn 't he ? Jackie ? She and her son ? They 're fine . - Who is Rawls to you ? - A mistake . The biggest one of many . We lived together . Are you sure you know who you 're lookin ' for ? One time , this guy cuts Pinker off on the highway . I mean , the kind of thing that happens to everybody every day . He followed this guy for 62 miles , right over the state line . 62 miles . Me pleading ' with him to stop . Follows the guy to his house . The guy 's smilin ' . He doesn 't know what 's coming . Pinker pulls a picket off a white picket fence and cracks that guy 's skull open with it . He 's not gonna stop . What does Rawls want ? The money ? 90,000 from the Bay St Louis robbery ? I didn 't know about that till they came to the door to arrest him . Pinker was already in prison before I found that money . By accident . So you took it . Eventually , yeah . I thought about it for about a week or two . And where 's the money now ? Put a down payment on this place . Bought a couple of sofas , chintz curtains , PC for Robert . I just wanted another chance . Look , I have a job , responsibilities . I can 't just disappear like this . It 's best you both stay under 24-hour guard until Rawls is apprehended . - It 's for your protection . - Her protection . This guy Rawls , he 's not looking for me . She took his money . - I 'm sorry ... - Excuse me . I 've got my own place . I promise to stay the hell away from here . OK ? How about it ? Look , I just want to get out of here , OK ? I didn 't break any laws ! Don 't discuss this with anyone , Mr Werther . I 'm forgetting it ever happened . Give me your keys . Get her outta here . I want a guard on her at all times . - Rawls was in the trunk ? - We took him right where he wanted . Mulder ? Think he 's trying to tell us something ? Scully , look at this . I assume Rawls wrote this with his finger , Iike the other . But look here . - He stopped at the mirror . - Or the mirror stopped him . - He stopped at the mirror . - Or the mirror stopped him . I mean , what makes an object solid ? What prevents one solid object from passing through another solid object ? electrostatic repulsion . Individual electrons repelling one another like magnets . What if Rawls ' ability has to do with electricity ? What would preclude it or contain it ? Resistance against electrical current . A good insulator , Iike rubber , Iike glass . Exactly . Rawls couldn 't pass through this . Say that your theory is correct , that he can walk through walls . Why go through all this over an old robbery score ? His $ 90,000 . He could get that anywhere , right ? It 's not about the money . It 's never been about the money . Yet he turned this place upside down looking for something . And I think it has to do with this . It 's a lien on unpaid hospital bills dating back to 1992 . The patient name is June Gurwitch . And this is an ICD-9 number , a hospital diagnostic code . - This particular one means ... - Pregnancy . Right . Specifically , C-section . This is seven years ago . Just a few months after Rawls was sent to a prison farm . " I want what 's mine . " This man 's looking for his child , Mulder . .. and will return in time to take part in meetings at the UN . A statewide manhunt is under way as escaped convict Wilson Pinker Rawls , a man previously thought to be a victim of Tuesday 's storm , continues to elude police . He is to be considered armed and extremely dangerous . In other news ... - I 'd Iike to call my sister . - Sorry , ma 'am . No calls . This is a nonsmoking ' room , ma 'am . Looks like Collins put up a fight . Guess it wasn 't enough . I can 't tell you what happened here , how Rawls got in . But he took the woman with him . - Where are they headed ? - He stole a station wagon . Last seen headed south . He has to intend for June to lead him to his child . - We gotta get there first . - Where ? We don 't have a name or address . June may not either , for that matter , if the child was adopted . I think our best bet is to go through state records , but it 's gonna take some time . We 're gonna need some equipment . Special issue . Pinker , I apologize . Look , I 'm really scared right now , OK ? Talk to me . please , please say something . Anything . Look , I 'm sorry about the money . Your money . I shouldn 't have taken it . It was wrong . I was wrong . Pinker , I can pay you back . What was it ? What 'd you have ? Dumb bitch . You don 't know what I 'm talkin ' about . What 'd you have ? Was it a boy or a girl ? A boy . A boy . A boy . A boy . A boy . What 's his name ? You know his name , don 't you ? - Trevor Andrew . - Trevor what ? Trevor Andrew . Trevor Andrew ... Rawls . You never were gonna tell me . I 'd have gone to my grave never knowing . But years later , million-to-one shot , I hear on the farm from a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy . You know what that means ? That means God wanted me to know . He fixed it so I 'd hear . And then he fixed it so as I had passage . And I 'm here . God 's will . What do you want with the boy ? He 's my son . Now you 're gonna take me to him . Can you also check her alias ? It 's Burdett . It was a live birth . That 's all you can tell me ? Yeah . Can you check on that , please ? - This what you were looking for ? - Yes . Thank you . AII right . Thank you very much . No match on Burdett or Gurwitch . Riot slugs . Rubber . Yeah . No ? Thank you . - It 's a boy . That 's all I got . - Sealed files ? No files . No adoption records . No records of foster care in alabama , Mississippi . Nothing . Maybe she didn 't go through official channels . Maybe the kid 's with a friend or a relative somewhere . Come on , Trevor . Trevor , put your toys away . Dinner 's almost ready . Trevor ? - I 'II get it . - No , go wash your hands . I 'II get it . This is Agent Mulder ... - June . - I 'm so sorry . You could 've saved me a trip . Where is he ? My boy , where is he ? Hi . I appreciate all you 've done , takin ' care of him . You 're a good mother . Better than some , I could say . Somethin ' smells good in here . What are you gonna have ? Hi , Aunt June . Hey , baby . Now you sit him back down and you feed him his supper . It 's all right . It 's gonna be all right . Don 't be upset . I ain 't mad at you , buddy . It 's OK , Trevor . Mama 's here , OK ? Come on . I 'm not gonna hurt you . It 's OK , buddy . Why don 't you come over here ? We 'II have a man-to-man . We 'II have a man-to-man . We 'II just have a nice talk . You and me . You 're Trevor , right ? Trevor Andrew . That 's your name . My name 's Pinker . But you can call me Pinky . Anyway , you and me , we 're gonna take a trip . Pinker . Shut up , please . You got some stuff you want to pack up ? Some toys and stuff ? Trevor ? - Jackie ? - Trevor , go . Go and pack some stuff , OK ? OK . He 's a good boy . Trevor , run ! Trevor ! Trevor ! Trevor ! Hey , buddy ! Hey , buddy . Hey , Trevor ! Hey , buddy ! Get him out of here , Scully . Don 't make me shoot you ! - Don 't make me shoot you . - Trevor ! Everything 's gonna be all right . We 're gonna get you to a safe place . Let 's go . Run ! Run ! Run ! Get inside , get inside . Get inside ! Get inside ! He 's my son ! Trevor ! Trevor ! Give me my son ! Trevor ! Give me my son now ! No ! Trevor ! I had to do it . He would 've hurt Trevor . God only knows what he was thinkin ' . What did he want ? Maybe another chance .

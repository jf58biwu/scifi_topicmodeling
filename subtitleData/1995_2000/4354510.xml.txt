 - Previously on The Pretender . - [ Sydney ] Think of Angelo as a sponge . Someone who can absorb the emotional and intellectual traits of others . He can help us find Jarod . You 've company now , Mr. Broots . Name 's Brigitte . - I 'm going to do my job . - I won 't allow you to compromise this situation . [ Clacking ] [ Young Sydney On Monitor ] A strange phenomenon has occurred with Jarod . He awoke this morning with seemingly no knowledge of his own identity . We must begin , Jarod . Why do you keep calling me that ? It is your name . So you say . I don 't even know what I look like . How does that make you feel ? Like I don 't exist anymore . I wanna know who I am . No doubt the years of pretended simulations ... have brought on this identity disorder . My concern ... is that if he continues to withdraw ... he will lose grasp of his true self ... permanently . [ Clacking Continues ] - [ Sam ] He 's gone . - What the hell is this ? [ Sydney ] I believe thatJarod is taking an interest ... in classical art . [ Miss Parker ] Aphrodite never had a balcony like this , Syd . Ask me , I think your Mr. Peabody is going through latent puberty . [ Inhales , Exhales ] Why else would he be sculpting women ? Dr. Clay . They are worth every penny I paid for them . How did you become such an artist ? Practice makes perfect . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Sydney ] Touch her face . Tell me what you feel , Angelo . Sadness . Hurt . Shame . Whose hurt , Angelo ? Whose sadness and shame ? [ Sniffles ] You 're telling me he can feel the same emotions ... as when Jarod made these things ? We 're still only beginning to understand ... Angelo 's gift as an empath . But he may be telling us whatJarod was pretending . Or the emotions aroused by the statues in the viewer . Or the emotions of the worker who packaged the Clay Dough . Hurt . And , uh - Sadness . Shame . A clue about my emotions , Syd . Happiness isn 't one of them . Nice picture , Chuckles . How long did that take you ? My daughter Debbie drew it . It 's a wonder she could draw anything at all with what went on this weekend . Well , aren 't you gonna ask me what I 'm talking about ? No . Because if I have to hear one more time about your ex-wife ... and the football team she 's dating , I 'll toss my toast . It 's not about my ex-wife . - What then ? - How do I know I can trust you ? I 'm outta here . Someone is watching me . This is the Centre . Somebody 's watching everybody . No , no , no , no . Not in the Centre . I had Debbie this weekend . Everywhere we went , I felt like we were being spied on . At the ice-cream parlor , at the zoo , even at home . Sit . I 'm telling you . Someone 's after me . Broots , do you have any tangible evidence of this stalker ? Oh , no , it 's the little things . Footsteps behind us . Rustling in the trees . When we got home last night , the light was out . Now , l-I always leave it on . So there 's a dim bulb in your house , Broots . We 've always known that . [ Angelo ] Hurt . Hurt ! Sadness . [ Monitors Beeping ] - It 's a shame . - A shame ? That mammaplasty you did . A beautiful young girl like that , and you only give her a 36-inch bust . Metz . Well , I had to build her to code . Any more than that , she 'd topple in an earthquake . [ Chuckles ] Topple ? That 's funny . [ Intercom Beeps ] You gentlemen serving dessert yet ? Ready to excise the defect . You 're running late . I 've got a rhytidectomy scheduled at 10 : 00 . No offense , Ray , but don 't you have a promotion ... to get passed over for or something ? Rhytidectomy . 10 : 00 . He seems a little irritable . He lost out running the Santa Barbara clinic . He 's been griping ever since . Do you wanna close ? Uh , actually , I would like to watch your technique . They say you leave less scarring than any surgeon on the coast . I leave none . - What 's your secret ? - Suture pattern and nerves of steel . And to think my old man laughed when I joined the macramé club . [ Chuckles ] Who 's laughing now ? Yes , Debbie , Daddy 's fine . I 'm just-just busy . I miss you too . Listen . Just stay with Mommy a couple more days ... and then you can come back , okay ? Good . And do me a favor , would you ? Draw me another one of these wonderful pictures ? Yeah , I got it right here . Uh-huh . I love it . I love you too . Okay . Be good , Peanut . Bye . Perfect alignment . The incision 's barely perceptible . Nice assist . Where did you say you trained ? Princeton Med . Postgraduate at Harvard . And the Clay Dough Institute . Clay Dough Institute ? That 's funny too . What isn 't funny is I haven 't received a paycheck yet . I didn 't become a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills ... just to sit courtside at Laker games . Don 't knock courtside . And trust me , the money will flow . We 're not treating Medicaid patients here . L.A. is full of rich , vain people under an unrelenting sun . It 's gold . I just bought a brand-new Boxster - cash . And as far as the perks , do you remember the bikini girl in Hellraiser II ? I 'm dating her . In fact , I designed her butt . Well , she must be twice as good as the Hellraiser I girl . You 're not still bragging about the bimbo construction business , are you ? - Dr. Brant . - Wade . You must be Dr. Clay . Christine Brant , chief of staff . It 's nice to finally meet you . You 've trained in maxillae facial trauma and endoscopic fracture repair . - Of course . - Great . We 've got an M.V.A. victim coming in with massive facial injuries . He 's yours . - I 'm on my way . And it was very nice - - Time is money , Doctor . Right . [ Brigitte ] Lose something , love ? I 'm sure it 'll turn up . Somewhere . Relax , Mr. Broots . I 'm here to help . With your Peeping Tom problem . - How did you know ? - Not important . What is , is that I believe you . The question is ... why your friends Parker and Sydney don 't . Well , it 's not that they don 't believe me . It 's just that - They couldn 't possibly think a man of your intelligence a fool ? Or is it that they have something to hide ? We know how to treat a man of your caliber . We can protect you . Who 's we ? The people you can trust . I hope you find what you 're looking for . Afraid . Daddy afraid . Daddy afraid . That 's one big ear , Jarod . You weren 't kidding , were you ? It 's a remarkable substance , this Clay Dough . Now , the name would imply that it was for cooking . But I find it useful in training for blepharoplasty , otoplasty and orthognathic surgery . You , my friend , are in need of some serious nooky . Nooky ? Is that another Clay Dough product ? [ Chuckles ] Not exactly . Any complications with your M.V.A. case ? Uh , no , but I 'll keep my eye on him during follow-up . He 's a county case . There is no follow-up . County cases are pro bono . They should be happy to get surgery at all . Pro bono ? I didn 't spend seven years in medical school to operate for free . Once a week . Brant 's rule . You know , I 'm beginning to wonder about this place . Money , movie stars . So far I haven 't seen one single starlet . For now you won 't . Brant does most of the surgery herself . And we get stuck with the freebies ? This whole " help the poor " bit is Brant 's big thing . And yours , Dr. Eubanks , if you want to stay at Surgicare . - Dr. Brant . - Get something straight , Doctor . Surgicare is not just about getting actors a part in their next movie . We 're L.A. County 's top provider of free reconstructive surgery . - [ Microwave Beeps ] - And if you want your share of the former ... you 'll do your share of the latter . [ Chuckles ] Nice ear . I should sew a bell to her neck . [ Woman On P.A. ] Dr. Macy , please come to the front desk . Dr. Macy to the front desk , please . [ Exhales ] [ Chattering ] [ Boy ] Hey , bus is here . Why are you doing that , Jarod ? Why do you keep calling me that ? I 'm nobody . You can 't hide from yourself forever . Jarod 's resistance continues . He refuses to participate in any simulation , to interact , even to eat . This self-imposed isolation is a new Pretender phenomenon . I am worried about his future . [ Doorbell Rings ] Can I help you ? Uh , hello . Uh , I 'm Dr. Clay from Surgicare . I 'm here to do a follow-up on Tricia . - Nobody 's ever checked on that child before . - That 's why I 'm here . Her friend who was driving the car ... God rest her soul , went straight through the windshield . I tell Tricia every day she 's lucky to be alive . Of course , she can 't see it that way . 'Cause of her face , she won 't leave the house , won 't see her friends . That child has a voice sent down from heaven . Mm . 'Cause of it , she had a full music scholarship . [ Quavering ] She 's never gonna use it now . Never 's a long time . - I see you like music too . - Oh , no , that 's Tricia 's . One ofher mystery gifts . Well , they started coming in the mail about a month after the accident . No cards , no return address . God bless ' em , ' cause it 's about the only thing that makes that baby girl happy . Can I see her ? - Tricia ? You have a visitor . - [ Knocking ] Hi . Huh . I see you like the blues . It 's my favorite too . I 'm Dr. Clay . Jarod . Can you fix my face ? I don 't know . It 's going to be very difficult to see through that . I don 't wanna do this . - Tricia . - It 's okay . You know , when I was your age ... I never left the house either . I stayed in for about 30 years . It 's a long story . When I got out , I realized what I was missing - trees , fresh air ... sunlight . Life 's a gift . Nothing is worth missing out on it . It was nice to meet you . Wait . [ Sighs ] You have beautiful eyes . What color are they ? Blue ? Violet . Violet . My new favorite color . [ Vehicle Approaches ] [ Engine Off ] [ Twig Snaps ] Hello ? Hello . [ Leaves Rustling ] Who 's there ? Hello ? [ Gun Cocks ] [ Dog Barking In Distance ] - A-Angelo ? - [ Car Door Closes , Tires Squeal ] [ Angelo ] Daddy afraid . [ Dog Continues Barking ] [ Jarod ] I need your expert advice . - Medicine or women ? - Both actually . These belong to a supermodel . Model or supermodel ? Super . The four-two fracture of the mandible . Do you think you could do the procedure without causing any permanent paralysis ? Is the pope Catholic ? I believe that 's mandatory . Look . In the hands of the master ... she will come out looking better than she did before . The seventh cranial nerve is near the site of the fracture . You 're absolutely positive that you can avoid it ? The most difficult part will be getting those incompetents in the lab ... to come up with the A-negative blood that she 'll need . Hmm . This supermodel , is she - is she seeing anyone ? I don 't believe she is . As a matter of fact , I would be glad to introduce you . Dr. Eubanks , this is Tricia Holmes . Hi . Hi . I remember you . The four-two fracture of the mandible . Just like the supermodel . And I 'm sure you remember the result ? The posterior ramus ofher mandible 's damaged ... and the right facial nerve has been severed . - What happened ? - Why don 't you tell me ? Were you late for a movie premiere ? Did you have a hot date ? Or maybe with charity cases , you just don 't give a damn . I might not beJoe P.C. , but I give my patients 100 % . Right . Except during follow-up . Guilty . But only of following Surgicare 's pro bono policy . Look . I am a damn good surgeon , and I sure as hell never would have done that . - Did you stabilize her fracture ? - Completely . And when you closed her , the nerve was intact ? Yes . The lacerations that she sustained weren 't that deep . Jarod , I didn 't do that to her . I swear to you . [ Sighs ] Well , if you didn 't do it ... who did ? And this closes it . It certainly does . Broots , one last question . Have you considered counseling ? I 'm telling you . If it wasn 't for Angelo , I 'd be dead right now . He saved my life . He 's a hero . So , Monkey Boy got out of the zoo . The question is how . Oh , I found this top security access card in his pocket . Who knows how he got it ? At least he saved you from whoever 's after you . What , you still don 't believe me ? Then what about these pictures ? Mm . Use them for your Christmas cards . It 's past his bedtime . Put him back in his space . [ Coughs ] Sydney , you still don 't believe me either ? I 'm not sure what to believe , Broots . I found these by the tree near your house - shell casings . It 's a nine-millimeter . This is standard Centre issue . Uh-huh . And these ... were with them . [ Beeping ] Miss Parker is after me . We 'll protect you , love . But nothing comes for free . Okay . [ Clears Throat ] What do you want ? - Miss Parker ? - [ Giggles ] I want to know every move she makes . Everyone she speaks to . You 'll need this . Oh , no , I , uh - I don 't know about that . Survival of the fittest . You know . Choice is yours . - [ Sneezes ] - God bless you . [ Clears Throat ] [ Sighs ] Bless me . [ Screams ] Angelo . Wait . How the hell did you get out ? Gimme those . Gimme that . That 's mine . This is my stuff . [ Chuckles , Sneezes ] It wasn 't Miss Parker . It was Brigitte . What about Sneezy ? I just passed her in the hall . What are you doing with that ? Miss Parker . Do you want me to hurt you ? No . No . These were found outside my house . Your shell casings and your cigarette butts ... all planted by Brigitte . [ Chuckles ] She 's the one that 's been following me . [ Casing Clatters ] Angelo . - Whose access card , Angelo ? - [ Sneezes ] Amateurs . [ Young Sydney ] Jarod . Jarod , where are you ? Jarod . My God . What are you doing ? Searching , Sydney , for me . Your name ... is Jarod . And you have a tremendous gift to offer the world . A gift that can help people . You just need to believe in yourself ... again . I wanna know what I look like . I wanna know who I am . [ Children Chattering ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] - Ancient history . - [ Chuckles ] That 's me in the drama club . I got the lead in the spring musical , Grease . I don 't think they wore leather jackets in ancient Greece . - Oh , that 's me in the choir . - Let me guess . - Soprano soloist . - Mm-hmm . Was there anything you didn 't do ? - Mm , never made the football team . - [ Chuckles ] I bet you can 't wait to get back to school to start all your activities . Who 's gonna wanna see a performer who looks like this ? Unless you can fix me , I 'm through with school . Tricia . I 'm sorry , but there 's nothing I can do . The nerve damage is irreparable . What did I do ? What did I do to deserve this ? You don 't know what it 's like ... being laughed at . Having people point at you like you 're a freak . I know what it 's like to be on the outside . And I know that I 'm stronger because of it . I don 't wanna be stronger . I just wanna be who I am . I just wanna be her again . She 's gone ... forever . Her gift isn 't . Her gift isn 't . I look around your room , and I see all the things that you 're passionate about ... and I know that your face is just a small part of who you are . [ Sighs ] Only you hold the key to your future . I know that life is a weird journey . But to live it , you have to be out there . Hello , Doctor . - How 's my baby ? - Making progress . I hope . This arrived . Oh , could you open that , please ? My arthritis is just knocking me down today . More gifts from the mystery friend . Tess , do all the gifts have the same postmark ? All from Santa Barbara . - [ Jarod ] Mr. Hawthorne . - Dr. Clay ? I am sorry about the urgency of this meeting ... but Dr. Brant was adamant this be dealt with immediately . Well , y-your phone call was a little vague . Is there a problem ? Someone has leaked information about Tricia Holmes . I 'm not here to pass blame or to play games . Dr. Brant wants it clear that if you don 't cooperate , all of this can go away . - I don 't remember every patient , so - - That 's a good answer ... for the medical board . - Medical board ? - Mm-hmm . They 're starting an investigation . I didn 't tell anyone . I swear . We need a statement that you saw nothing unusual that night . That will get the board off of our backs . Then Tricia Holmes ... she can go back and hide her disfigured face in the shadows ... while you and Dr. Brant enjoy all of ... this . Do we have a deal ? No . No ? No , I won 't lie for her anymore . It was 2.00 a.m. when Tricia Holmes was brought back into post-op . Dr. Eubanks , putz that he is , did an excellent job on her . She was resting calmly . Everything was calm . - And then Dr. Brant came in ? - She was freaked . She was in the middle of a chin implant on some movie star ... and the bone grafts needed for the procedure had been damaged . Brant needed a donor . She needed one quick . She checked out Tricia 's chart . Without even blinking , she grabbed a scalpel . My God , she didn 't even bring that poor girl back into surgery . She reopened Tricia 's face , and she harvested bone ... to put into her movie star client . And in her haste , she severed Tricia 's facial nerve . Brant gave me the promotion to keep quiet . I 've been trapped ever since . Ask Tricia Holmes about feeling trapped . [ Miss Parker ] Long day , Brigitte . You know what they say - A woman 's work and all that . You look tired . But then I guess stalking can be tough on a young thing . The late nights , the long hours . You know , you Americans have a whole other English . Sorry , love , don 't follow . Now that my father is back ... you 'd never get approval . So it must have been an independent move . You shot at Broots , didn 't you ? [ Scoffs ] If I shot Broots ... he 'd be dead . Not if scaring him was the intention . - So , who ordered it ? - Your guess is as good as mine . Raines . It 's just his style . It only makes sense to go after the weakest link . It was a very tough call . Get something straight . Broots may be an idiot , but he 's my idiot . The only one who terrorizes him is me . You pull a gun on me ? No big deal ... 'cause I know you don 't have the rocks to pull the trigger . But the next time you mess with one of my team ... I 'll put a bullet right in your blonde bonnet . And they said you weren 't a bitch . - They were being kind . - Hmm . For what it 's worth , I did shoot at Mr. Broots . However , I took no pictures . What 's the occasion , Jarod ? Oh , let 's just say it 's my little way of saying thank you ... for giving me the best job that money can buy . Well , you 're the best hire I ever made . [ Glasses Clinking ] No offense . You 've been rolling those charity cases at a record pace . Gives the rest of us an opportunity to focus on other priorities . Like weekends to Cabo . Rodeo Drive shopping binges . - Beach house renovations . - Guilty . [ Siren Wailing In Distance ] - [ Exhales ] - Are you okay , Christine ? Uh , it 's just , um - I haven 't , uh - I haven 't eaten . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Oh , I think you 've had one too many . If Wade would be so kind as to lend me his car , I will give you a ride home . [ Chuckles ] A chauffeur too . I really did hire the right guy . [ Keys Jingling ] - [ Engine Revving ] - What kind of champagne was that ? A very special year . You keep revving the engine like that , you 're gonna ruin it . Eubanks says this car can do 140 . - Let 's see if he 's telling the truth . - [ Tires Squeal ] Jarod . Jarod . Jarod . ! Dr. Brant ? [ Muzak ] Dr. Brant ? Can you hear me ? There 's been a terrible accident . - Am I okay ? - There 's just a little blood . - Oh , God . - No , no , no , no , no . Never mind that . There 's no deep trauma . It 's only cosmetic . - My face , is it bad ? - Don 't worry . The damage isn 't severe . I can repair you . [ Sighs ] Thank God . There has been one slight complication however . Complication ? Wh-What ? We have a high-profile client in the next operating room . A supermodel . She had a terrible reaction to a chemical peel . She needs massive skin grafts . But luckily , we have the perfect donor . - You . - Me ? I 'm not donating grafts . It 'll ruin my face . I 'm sorry , but there 's no other way . What are you , insane ? You can 't do that to me . Sure I can . Just like you did to Tricia Holmes . But look on the bright side , at least I 'm gonna tell you ... that I am going to harvest part of your body for someone else . That is what you did to her , isn 't it ? - Jarod , please ! - You cut out a piece ofherjaw ... to save your important client 's little chin implant . And then you severed her facial nerve in your haste , didn 't you ? Yes , I did that ! Now , please , let me go ! Sorry . Can 't do that . But I promise , I 'll try to be more careful with you ... - [ Whirring ] - than you were with her . No . No ! No . Jarod , please . Don 't . Don 't . - [ Groaning ] - Oh , try not to panic . Your face is still anesthetized . - What 's left of it . - You 're insane . Now , I resent that , Doctor . I did the very best I could ... considering I 'm not really a plastic surgeon . [ Snorts ] Voilà ! No . - No ! - Whoops . No . I don 't think she 's coming . You need to have more faith . [ Footsteps Approaching ] Oh , baby . - You look beautiful . - Thanks . Can I give you a ride ? Thanks , but , uh , life 's a weird journey ... and it 's about time I get back out there . Hey , you look great . [ Young Sydney ] Jarod . Jarod . This is what you look like . This is who you are . Brigitte did the shooting , but she 's not the photographer . We know . These just came this morning . What the hell is going on here ? Someone 's trying to terrorize us . - Who ? - Well , we 're working on that one . Angelo . [ Inhales , Whimpers ] l-It 's angry . Confused . Angry . [ Sydney ] Angelo . Who is angry ? Who ? Angelo . [ Scoffs ] This is a waste of time . [ Footsteps Departing ] I decide who lives or dies . I decide who lives or dies . I decide who lives or dies .

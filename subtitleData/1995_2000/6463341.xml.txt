 Hello ? Hello ! Hey ! I 'm sitting here , dude ! Sorry . We 're closed . Uh-uh . I was here before you turned off the light . Grandfather clause , man . I need a Super Patty Double with cheese ... The light was a mistake . We 're closed . Sorry . The light was on ! How bad do you want this job ? 'Cause I 'll call the head office right now . Super Patty Double with cheese . Supersize fries . Supersize Diet Sprite . Drive through , please . What the hell is this ? Customer service , man . Stop spanking it and get my food . Hey , in there . Guy ? You ... are your own man , and you control everything you do . Hey , yo , Derwood . Hey , Rob . Hey , Mr. Rice . How 's it going , Rob ? Have a good one , Lucy . You , too , Rob . Welcome to Lucky Boy . May I take your order ? Yeah , we 'll have it our way . FBI . Special Agents Scully and Mulder . We 'd like a word with your manager , please . That 's me . How can I help you ? Sir , would you do us a favor and gather your employees , please ? What 's going on ? We 're investigating a murder . A car was found in a reservoir ten miles from here . A body was found in the trunk of that car . What does that have to do with us ? Well , this was also found in the car . It 's a badge that 's only given to employees . Is that correct ? Yeah , " Free Fer " Fridays ... it 's our promotion where you buy one Super Patty and get one free . But , look , there 's four Lucky Boys in Costa Mesa alone and something like 30 in Orange County . - Thirty-two . - Yeah , long day . So let 's make this quick . Does everybody have their button ? We only wear them on Fridays . For " Free Fer " Fridays . Yeah , but does everybody have their button ? Hey , uh , you ... back there , what 's your name ? Derwood Spinks . Derwood . Do you have your button , Derwood ? Uh , no , I must have left it at home on account of we 're supposed to only wear them on Fridays . Well , I sure as hell didn 't leave it on no dead guy . I don 't believe that we said the victim was male . We 're going to ask everybody to step outside right now while we take a quick look around the premises . Who was the victim ? His name was Donald Edward Pankow . Does that ring a bell ? No . I 'm going to get some cigarettes . I guess I 'd better call the corporate headquarters and find out what they want us to do . Hey , Scully , check it out . You know how they say you never want to see the kitchen of any of your favorite restaurants ? Somehow , I don 't think Lucky Boy would make that list . My point being that this is a hell of a lot cleaner than all the others . Don 't you think ? I guess . So what are you saying , Mulder ? This place has been scrubbed from top to bottom to cover up evidence ? Maybe . Maybe I 'm thinking this was the crime scene . You 're saying Mr. Pankow had his brain very neatly removed from his skull right here in this kitchen ? It had to happen somewhere . But next to the shake machine , Mulder ? I think that we should be checking out employee lockers and not entertaining the idea that ad hoc surgery was performed here . I wouldn 't exactly call it surgery . What if this man 's brain was eaten ? I-It 's not sociologically unheard of . There are certain tribes in New Guinea that consider human brains a delicacy . Yeah , but , Mulder , we 're in Orange County . Yeah , what 's your point ? It 's just that nothing about the way the body was dumped suggests a fetishistic killing . The brain wasn 't removed intact . What if this man 's brain was eaten right out of his skull ? Through an inch - and-a-half opening that looks like it was cut with a hole saw ? Well , maybe it was cut , maybe it was punched . What look like tool marks to you look to me like something more organic . Like it was made by a ... a tongue or a proboscis . The proboscis of what ? I don 't know . Oh . Hello . Look at this . That look like blood to you ? Yes , it looks like it . What is that ? Next to it . Is that , uh ... Oh , my ... ugh . Is that brain ? Is that brain matter there ? No , I 'd say that 's ground beef . Ground beef . Yeah . Rob Roberts ? It 's Agent Mulder . Hello , again . Sorry to bother you at home . No . No bother . Yeah . Can I come in ? - Yeah , sure . - Great , great . Uh , what ... what can I do for you ? You live here alone ? Yeah , it 's just me . Uh-huh . Mom or girlfriend ? What ? Come on , man , who cleans up after you ? Neither . It 's just me . I-I live here alone . Well , bravo . You know , they say single guys are just bears who own furniture , but ... I mean , my place ... But here , you can smell the Pine-Sol . Thanks . Can I ... can I get you anything ? Yeah , a cheeseburger and a large order of fries . It 's a bad joke . I 'm sorry . Um ... Mr. Rice , your manager ... he told me that , uh ... you stayed late on Friday ? Is that right ? Oh , yeah , sure . Friday . The freezer had died on us . I stayed after to throw out the meat that was going bad . Yeah , did you volunteer to close ? Yeah . Yeah , okay . You volunteered . Volunteered . Um ... The , uh ... the 35 pounds of ground chuck that Mr. Rice told you to throw away ... what did you do with that ? - I threw it out . - Where ? In the Dumpster behind the restaurant . Hmm . That 's weird . Because that 's what I figured you did , so I checked the Dumpster , and it was empty , which is weird because it only gets cleaned out on Thursday and you would have thrown away the meat on Friday , so you 'd expect the meat to be there , right ? Mm-hmm . I don 't see how that 's relevant to this murder case anyway . Let me see if there 's anything else I wanted to ask you . Blood . You 're-you 're bleeding . I-I bit my lip . Mm . I think that just about wraps it up for me here . Oh , hey . I , uh ... I hope you catch the guy , huh ? Yeah . No , I already got a pretty good idea who it is . Thanks . What do you want ? Uh ... nothing . So take a hike . Uh , hi . This is a message for Rob Roberts . My name is Dr. Mindy Rinehart , and I 'm a licensed mental health counselor with the Lucky Boy Corporation 's Employee Assistance Program . I 'm talking to all of the employees at your restaurant about the recent unpleasantness that occurred there . Rob , I 'd love for you to come down to my office at 11 : 00 a.m. tomorrow morning . As it is a requirement of your employer 's insurance provider , this meeting is mandatory . I 'm in the Irvine Medical Park , Suite 308 . Have a good evening . Self-discipline . That 's the name of this game . That 's the one thing that separates us from the animals ... provided you have it . But where do you get it ? You can 't go down to the local convenience store and buy self-discipline . You can 't order it over the Internet . So where does it come from ? True story . I used to weigh 356 pounds . Do you believe that ? Well , it 's true . I lived to eat , ladies and gentlemen . My entire life revolved around eating because I was always hungry . My appetite was controlling me . Four-star restaurants , Denny 's ... it didn 't matter . And it didn 't stop . It didn 't stop till I took charge of my own life . It didn 't stop until I put on the brakes , and I said , " Whoa ... " ... Ricardo , you are your own man and you control everything that you do . " Oh , brother . What ? What ? Derwood . How did you get in here ? It 's a little skill I picked up in Chino . I did a nickel for attempted murder . You didn 't know I was an ex-con . Yeah , nobody at work did . Not until this FBI murder investigation whipped everybody up into a froth . D-Derwood , what can I do for you ? You know I got fired last night ? Stupid little pissant job where they make you wear a paper hat ... and they fired me . Plus , as far as that , uh , redheaded FBI agent 's concerned , I 'm the prime suspect in this murder . But that 's no skin off my nose , seeing as you did it . Diet pills . Yours , right ? See , I found them when I opened up on Saturday morning . I didn 't give them back 'cause I figured , hey , free speed , right ? But then there 's this whole flap about a murder , and I notice this . That ain 't ketchup , man . What-what do you want , Derwood ? I don 't know . What do you got ? TV , VCR . Ah , it 's all crappy off-brand stuff , but , yeah , I 'll take that and whatever money you got in the bank , and you get this , and I keep my mouth shut , and just maybe you can blow town before the long arm of the law reaches out and grabs you by the gonads . Maybe not . Cup ' em . Uh , hi . Uh , Rob ? I hate to bother you , but , uh , last night in the front of the building , there was a man in a parked car for hours . Did you happen to see him ? It was a maroon car . He was pretty clean-cut , so I didn 't call the police , but he was still there when I went to bed . G-Gee , Sylvia , I-I don 't know what to tell you . Well , he 's gone now , but just , you know , keep your eyes out in case he comes back . - You got it . - Thanks . So , I 'll call you tonight and let you know where to drop off my new VCR . Oh , and don 't try skipping town . You won 't get too far . Hey , just the man I wanted to see . How are you this morning , Rob ? Fine . Glad I caught you . Oh , hey , I was just ... I was just driving to your apartment , and I saw Derwood Spinks not a block from here . He wasn 't coming from your place by any chance , was he ? No , no . I haven 't seen him . Good . I 'd stay away from him . He 's our prime suspect in the Pankow murder . You think he did it ? Me ? No . No , I should say that 's the opinion of the Costa Mesa Police . And my partner . So he 's-he 's not your guy . No . No , I think we 're looking for somebody who has a compulsion to kill ... truly can 't help himself . Oh , quick question : the , uh ... the meat that you threw in the Dumpster . What about it ? The Dumpster had a padlock . - Yeah . - Who would have the key ? We do . And the trucking company does . H-Hey , wait . What-what 's your point ? I 'm just tying up some loose ends . Good , you got my message , Rob . I appreciate your coming . This will be really informal . There you go . I want to run through some things with you , but we don 't stand on ceremony here , so if there 's anything that you want to talk about , just go ahead and blurt it okay , okay ? Hasn 't been a run-of-the-mill week so far , has it ? No . The police have been at the restaurant and the FBI . I 'm sure this has been a very stressful time for you . Pretty much . So we want to keep on top of any potential problems that these stresses might cause for you . So let 's run through some standard questions together . Rob , have you been troubled recently by insomnia ? Bad dreams or nightmares ? Have you felt emotionally numb ? Do you ever see things that aren 't there or hear voices ? - Tell me , Rob , do you feel ... - This ... This murder ... this murder that happened . Yes ? What kind of a monster would do something like that ? I don 't believe in monsters . But I do believe in people , and sometimes they do terrible things out of weakness or sickness or fear . But I do truly believe that deep down inside , even the worst of us wants to be good . Rob , is there anything that 's troubling you that you 'd like to talk about ? I 'm sorry . I thought I put that on voice mail . Mindy Rinehart . Yes , Agent Mulder , what can I do for you ? No , I 'm afraid I can 't do that . I 'm sorry , but it would violate patient confidentiality . I , uh ... Excuse me , Agent . Rob . Yeah . I have to go to work now . Would you please call me later so that we could finish our talk ? You shouldn 't be here , Derwood . We would have mailed you your last check . Just give me my money , Rice . How you doing , killer ? You better have some money for me , too , huh ? There . Now please leave . With pleasure , pal . Boy , I ought to just make happy hour . Uh , since this is farewell ... when nobody was looking , I used to dip my boys in the coleslaw . Bon appetit . If somebody 's still in here , you 're in a world of hurt ! Rob ? You looking for these ? Deal 's off , buddy . You know that guy you iced ... Pankow ? I just heard he didn 't have a brain in his head . You 're one sick little freak , man . You got a lot of problems . If I were the FBI , I 'd want you real bad . Public enemy number one and all that . Lots of reward money . So I 'm going to turn you in myself , lucky boy . - Rob . - Hi . You said we should finish talking . Come in . I think I need help . Tell me why you think that . I have compulsions to eat . I-I get hungry , and I try to put it off for as long as I can , but then finally I just ... I get so hungry that I can 't help myself , and ... You binge then purge ? You eat too much and then cause yourself to vomit ? No . I just eat . But this makes you feel bad ? I guess it makes me feel like I 'm not a good person . Rob , there are so many different kinds of eating disorders . Men and women from every walk of life suffer from them . But if there 's one thing that they all have in common , it 's low self-esteem . And it 's a shame because low self-esteem can be like a fun-house mirror . It reflects back a warped and ugly image of ourselves . What do you think Cindy Crawford would look like in a fun-house mirror ? Weird ? Ugly ? And how would the most handsome man in the world look ? How would , say , Peter Jennings look in a fun-house mirror ? Ugly . And how do you look in this mirror ? Do you think that looks like a bad person ? An unworthy person ? I 'll tell you what I see . I see a nice smile . I see soulful brown eyes . I see good . Now , Rob , I want you to keep looking into this mirror until you see the same things that I do . There 's a meeting that I 'd like you to attend tonight . It 's every Monday , Wednesday and Friday . Now , you can talk to me anytime you want , but these people are the best . They can really help you . I have to go . You always hurry away . I appreciate it . And I want you to understand that I really am trying to do right . Hey , Rob , you didn 't tell me you had a friend in the FBI . What ? He 's upstairs . I told him all about that strange man in the maroon car , and he said he 'd look in to it . Afternoon , Rob . Sir , may we speak with you ? Derwood Spinks has disappeared . His car is gone along with some personal belongings . My partner saw Spinks in your neighborhood yesterday morning . At that time , you told Agent Mulder that you hadn 't seen Mr. Spinks . Is that correct ? I don 't even know him that well . If he was going to leave town , he wouldn 't come tell me about it . Who said he left town ? I don 't know . Isn 't that what you think happened ? No , no , no . Personally , I think he 's dead . I can 't speak for my partner , but I think that whatever it was that killed Donald Pankow also got to Mr. Derwood Spinks . Wh-What do you mean , " whatever it was " ? I 'll let you in on a little secret . We 've been able to keep it pretty quiet up until now , but Donald Pankow 's brain is missing from his skull . My partner was able to find something that was previously undetected . It was the tip of what can only be described as a tiny shark 's tooth embedded deep in the bone . I think we 're looking for some kind of genetic freak ... a carnivorous predator as yet unidentified . A monster , if you will . There 's no such thing . Don 't you believe it . This thing definitely qualifies . It has a biological imperative to eat . I think it even ate that ground chuck you threw away . Yeah ? Why ? Because it can 't kill with impunity and it knows it . It knows that the more it feeds on humans , the closer it gets to getting caught . But the hunger is always there . And it satisfies it any way it can . I 'm sorry , but this is like " good cop , insane cop . " Why are you telling me all of this ? I think you know why . Thank you , Mr. Roberts . We 'll contact you if we have any further questions . Watch out for that monster . Devil 's food with the white sugar frosting . It is like , deliver me from evil . Come on in . Come on . So I baked three dozen of these for my daughter 's school fund-raiser , and at 3 : 00 in the morning the night before , there they are ... all three dozen of them , lined up and calling to me . Well , you know , in the past , there 'd have been a good chance I 'd have gone through every single last one of them . But this night ... Small world , huh ? Is this your first time at a meeting ? Yeah . Does anybody else have anything they want to share ? Do you feel up to introducing yourself ? - Everybody 's really nice . - Anyone ? Don 't be scared ; it helped me . Uh , hi . My name is Robert Roberts . P-People call me Rob . Hi , Rob . I have an eating disorder . I 'm definitely a meat-eater , not a vegetarian . I 've always had these cravings my whole life , and just ... just recently , the last month or so , they 've just become too powerful to resist . Tell us about it . I guess it 's the taste I respond to the most ... salty and juicy . Kind of buttery . The-the texture of it inside of your mouth ... you know , y-your teeth just sink into it like this juicy cloud . And it tastes so good , you don 't ... you don 't even want to swallow it . You just want to work it around your taste buds until your eyes roll right back into your head . Anyway , it 's a real problem . Wait , your ex-husband did what ? He said I was too fat to ride in his sports car ... that I 'd just mess up the springs . So I sat on the hood and I bounced . And I didn 't stop until the police showed up . They sided with me . Hey , thank you , Sylvia . Good night , Rob . Good night , Sylvia . I 'll be right there . What the hell is going on ? ! Oh , my God ! Call the police ! Everything okay ? ! Mr. Derwood Spinks , alive and well . I 'm confused , Rob . Was he helping you redecorate ? I lied to you before . About what ? Derwood was ... was coming from my place the morning you saw him . He said if I spoke to you , he 'd kill me . What didn 't he want you to tell us ? Last Friday night , he hung out while I was cleaning out the freezer . He told me to go home . Said he 'd finish up . I didn 't know why the hell he was being so nice to me , but ... when I got home , I realized I had the key to the Dumpster . And when I drove back I saw him cleaning up all this blood . You must have been very scared . I was . But , you know , I-I should have ... told the truth from the start . Do you recognize this guy ? No . He 's a private eye . Sylvia Jassy 's ex-husband hired him to spy on her . But now this Steve Kiziak has gone missing . He was last seen parked outside your apartment . You didn 't notice him ? No , I didn 't notice anything . Well , maybe we should check with Sylvia again . I-I don 't think she 's home . Eh , well , we 'll track her down . Don 't worry , Rob , won 't be long now . Oh , my God . Rob , what happened ? It 's a long story . Wh-What do you want ? I , uh ... I was in the neighborhood , and I thought I 'd say hi . Hi . Rob , are you all right ? Did you do this ? No . Derwood Spinks did this . You know , he 's the one who ... Like I said , it 's a long story . Where are you going ? To a friend 's house . I have to leave , actually . As in now . Are you sure you 're all right ? - You 're not feeling ... - Yes , absolutely . I 'm-I 'm fine , you know ? It 's just that , when you came to see me yesterday , I sensed that there were things that you wanted to talk about but couldn 't . That was yesterday . Well , can we talk about them now ? Look , let me stop you right there , okay ? You don 't have to worry about me anymore . As of ... as of 10 : 38 a.m. , I am no longer employed by the Lucky Boy Corporation . I quit . Rob ... I 'm here as a friend . Well , then consider me cured . I had a breakthrough last night . Did you attend the O.A. meeting ? Yeah . How did it go ? It was a complete and utter waste of my time . I 'm sorry you felt that way . So they 're a bunch of fat people . So what ? M-Maybe they 've got , uh , what you would call a biological imperative to eat too much . Did you ever think of that ? Did you ? You know , maybe I 've got a biological imperative , too . So why is that such a bad thing ? ! Like the world 's going to end ? That is biology . You can 't fight biology . You can 't . Sounds like you 're saying you 're tired of feeling guilty . Bingo . And I am sick and tired of pretending that I 'm something that I 'm not . You killed that man , didn 't you ? What did you just say ? That 's why you feel so guilty , isn 't it ? Can you tell me why you did it ? Who have you been talking to ? No one . I realized it after our last session . You spoke to the FBI , didn 't you ? I haven 't spoken to anyone . And I won 't without your permission . But I am here to ask you to turn yourself in . I want you to get the help that you need . You don 't know what the hell you 're talking about . Yes , I do , Rob . No , you don 't ! You said ... you don 't believe in monsters , right ? How ... about ... now ? How about now ? Do you believe in monsters ? You poor man . What you must go through . Oh , my God . Step away , Rob . Step away . Dr. Rinehart , step away from him . - Don 't hurt him . - Rob , we tracked Sylvia down on the way to the landfill . You just can 't stop yourself , can you ? Get on the floor . Rob , get on the floor . Rob be that good person I know you mean to be . Why ? I can 't be something I 'm not . I made this !

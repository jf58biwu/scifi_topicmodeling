Of this , Crestline ? The alien that I killed , had a pocket computer and Big Mike to decipher the code and found evidence , As there are aliens in Crestline . I do not want to upset you , but I met a woman the city told me that frightened residents . I think I was misunderstood , I think you 're right . It 's okay . Do not worry , buddy . I have something for you . One of my boys was caught by aliens . Now his motorcycle yours . From now on we are Foster 's army . So , using the nickname " apostles " ? - Da - . The naked ! - What ? - These are more arrest warrants . Dude , I am . Attack , endangering life , blows ... - Attempted murder ... Man ! - Are on our side , Eddie . - I 'm not sure that 's a good thing . - How can you say that ? We struggled 24 hours a day to attract people to our side ... - And now you claim ? - Claims ? This is not a club of criminals . - You 're talking about a motorcycle gang - You know , Eddie ... - You like to spoil everything . - I do not wanna get other convictions . That might be much sought after chance . Try to have a little faith in human nature , right ? Listen , it 's not like I want you to ruin this moment , but our credibility is at stake . I have to go . I 'll call you tomorrow . - What ? - We have an address from Nick Randolph . Norton 146 South , we put a man on their heels as soon as I found them . - There are people there . - You mean there are aliens . It 's time to make a visit . You first . I will follow . - Attack the front or rear ? - With front . Come on , let 's go . - Break it ! - Get him ! All right ! - Guys , get him ! To destroy it ! - Yes ! - Yes ! Take that ! Hold it ! There ! Number to 3 to exit . One two Three ... I called the center and I explained the situation . We need the National Guard . Not enough evidence to get 24-hour protection from the National Guard . Why can not we find Nick Randolph 's body ? Because they buried him in the woods . I know these bastards . - Calm down , Harry . - With all due respect , but you and deputy ... We can protect everyone . Police in the capital said that we will send a team of help ... - Upon completion of bridge repair on I5 . - What do we do until then ? We 're sitting ducks , Randy . We must defend . I put on my deputy Jeff patrol . If you see " apostles " ... - You quickly call the state police . - How long will that take ? I think they need a few hours to repair the bridge . It takes too long . I suggest we gather more people and seek in the woods . Let the police do that , Harry . - I have the right to defend my home . - Protect your home and business . You have that right , but do not want to see vigilant in this city . First you shoot , then I will ask questions . - Hello , Miss . - Harry strengthening all . Yes , it is Harry . I 'll protect this town . - Certainly . - I know you will . What will you do ? I 'll call the Dennison Creek to see if I can ... - Borrow some help . - I volunteer . - Sorry , honey . - Shoot as any man in the city . Maybe even better than most . Can you tell me they 're old-fashioned , but you 're too important to risk . Two suspects escaped aliens so far there are rumors that he left town . - There are many places where they could hide . - You 're right . Here 's what we do . We go into town ... We in every home and fry them bastards . I have a better idea . - I found this last night in the house . - What the hell is this ? A quartz crystal . A woman in town told me that the company 's Nick Randolph , mine the crystals out of the village . So what 's your plan ? Crystals may have to do with the presence of aliens in Crestline . If so , should I put Eddie to check the archives . - Eddie ? Type publishing , Paranoid Times ? - Yes . - I love Eddie . - Me tooo . To check the archives , that 's fine but in the meantime I think we should look for houses . We must be careful , do not want to hurt anyone . - This is a war , man . - I 'm just saying we should care . Let me ask you something . If you could stop , all damage caused by World War II , killing 10 innocent you have done it ? 10 to 50 million people ? - I think yes . - What about 1000 ? - I think yes . - Then I understand . Sometimes you have to make sacrifices for the greater good . - How far are you willing to continue ? - I read journals , Cade . On the first day of alien invasion , 19 million people will die . I would say that they are willing to continue long and hard . What did you do ? You shot an alien ? Not me I shot him , Eddie , they did . - When ? What ? - To address Norton 146 South . - Check the information about the company . - For what ? Let 's see who bought the house . Also check who owns the land , extraction authorization , or property tax for 234 road . No problem . I think you 're right . This could be our big chance . Meanwhile sit still and relax . I will take a few hours ... - To get into the municipal system . - The sooner the better . - What ? - What do you mean ? - You look nervous . - I 'm not fussy . - Last night you were in the clouds . Last night I drank eight beers . Check crystal mines in this area . - What kind of crystals ? - I found something alien house . - Sounds like a quartz crystal with eight sides . - It 's impossible , man . What ? Quartz crystals are many out there , but hexagonal ... - Six sides , buddy . - Not this one , it has 8 friends . - I 'll investigate that . - I have to go . What can you do with an octagonal crystal ? - Do not shoot . - You 're back . Hi . - Anything ? - That 's what I wanted to talk . I know about the behavior of motorcyclists and looks quite aggressive ... Did you hear what happened last night to fill Olsen ? I was there . Hard to believe , but these guys could do a good thing . Are you crazy ? If I say it 's a conspiracy here in Crestline ... Which is led by a band of criminals more dangerous than the Apostles . They invaded this town long before the riders arrive . Motorcyclists were aware of this thing , and came to bring him to justice . You mean people mean injury and mutilation of justice ? I ask you to believe that there a possibility that their goal is a good one . Suppose it . What is their reason to devastate homes ? Perhaps it is necessary to catch criminals . You mean to catch criminals ... - You have to act like a criminal ? - Not really . You said that the end justifies the means . And you were wrong . Do not break the law to protect it . We have two suspects . Let 's go back to camp . I think we talked about checking the records ? Hey , man . It 's an opportunity . I have to go . Hey , where 's your hurry . I know you . - I do not think . - Yes , I know . - I think you 're confusing me with someone else . - He 's Dylan Chase . - Is the magazine " Independent Bikers " . - Nice to meet . See you soon . The riders said they had two suspects , whatever that means . Well , go back to the store and close it . I 'll call the state police . I 'm looking for Mr. Griffin ? - I am . - Hi . I am in Crestline . I heard that you own some myself in this area . Yes , but if you want to buy , you called too late . I already sold . I understand , I was wondering why you 've sold . I got a good offer . Suddenly appeared guys and I paid the asking price . It would have to be stupid to refuse . At least that 's what I thought at that point . The referi this you ? I do not know if you know your crystals but some have eight sides . I 've never seen anything like it . I thought I 'm not valuable until I closed the deal . I wish I knew then what I know now . Any idea what you can do with an octagonal crystal ? No , but I try to find out . - You Gua ? - Admit it from the beginning . You kindly to pull the scarf ? - I know nothing . - Shut up . Why did you run away from home last night ? I do not know what you mean . Norton House . Why did you run ? I live in Norton . - You Gua ? - No . - You Gua ? - No . Mincinosule . - Hey , take it easy ! - What are you doing ? - Not as it should be . - Please , let me go . - Why do I do this ? - Can you see if someone is alien ... - If you cut it and see that it heals . - What are you talking about ? You read my journals . Gua have the ability to heal . The wounds are healed instantly . - I just saved savior . - See Pacco ? We do not like aliens . Remove her scarf . What happens ? What happened to that guy ? You Gua ? - Gua ? I do not know what that means . - Nice try . Where are you going ? There 's at least one alien on the loose and go after him . - Let 's go . - I do not come . - What 's the problem ? - You killed an innocent man . Apparently I was wrong . Sorry for that , but I can not ... - You do not stop until you have . - What should you do ? To break people 's homes ? You 'll find them wherever they are in this town . - Not as it should be . - How should , Cade ? Do you have questions ? Come on man , wake up . - Innocent people should not die . - If some innocent people must die . You , me , him ... That 's Darwin 's theory , man . - That 's the law of survival . - Let 's go , Rafa . - Are you coming with us ? - No . To respect , Cade , but sometimes you have to make sacrifices for the greater good . That 's the way forward . Let 's go . - One of them disappeared in front of me . - Thank you , Jeff . All right . I sent Jeff in the Desert Devil . Saw no corpse . - But Harry ? He remained there , dead . - Jeff has seen . I must have hidden the body as that of Nick . Melissa , are you sure you saw what I mean ? I know it sounds strange , but talking about aliens . - Do not lie . - Do not say you 're lying . Not at all . - Sometimes the mind plays tricks on us ... - There 's no way . I was there . We have done everything possible to protect this town . I called the governor , state police , even the FBI . - Then we have to wait ? - What else have a choice ? - To provoke a war with these punks ? - Yes . I am a peaceful sheriff . My job is to protect lives , not to put them in danger . A reinforcements come , these cowards will get what it deserves . You were right , Eddie . These guys are bad news . I have more bad news , brother . Mina where he worked Nick Norton Randolph and his friends ... - It was closed this morning . - What a surprise ! But all I learned something about quartz crystals . The main component is silicon dioxide , which is also technology used in computers , communications equipment and frequency control . Continue . The more scientists have suspected that crystal 8 sides , that if it existed , could be used to implement and carry information up to 7 times faster than a normal silicon chip . That 's it . They pulled the crystal to improve communications ... - Or the ability of computers . - If you bring me a few crystals ... - I would be able to analyze . - Should not be a problem . Get out of there . A guy like you should not have be seen in the company of criminals . Yeah , thanks , Eddie . I followed the riders camp . I saw that man disappeared . - There was a man . - What do you mean ? - Disappear as not to remain bodies . - Who are they ? Aliens . I know it sounds crazy , but it is job Apostles in Crestline , hunting a team of aliens came to Earth . And I do . I was part of an alien experiment . I need your help . I need some crystals in your store . I think that aliens use them for experiments . I 'll bring them ? Send me some help , damn . Motorcyclists are out of control . I can not stop myself . Send me reinforcements now or to be more bloodshed . - Can I help you ? - These drivers have killed a man . If you mean Henry Chakinu know about it . Half of state police battalion reached in 15 minutes . Excellent . - Mr. Chase ? - Yes . - Why are you here ? - Writing an article . - Are you sure ? - I 'm sure . I feel that something is wrong with you . I do not know what is . Tell intuition , but I feel that not telling me the truth . As I said Sheriff , me confused with someone else . If something , please tell me . I 'll do some checking . And if you are not who you say you are ... - I 'll catch you . - Have a nice day . Get your hands off me , you bastard ! What are you doing ? Release me . What happens ? What are you doing here , guys ? Hi , Cade . I searched all over town . This place is full ... - For those crystals that you said . - Looks like we found aliens . - Hey , wait a second ! - No , wait . Maybe fighting the same war , but we different fighting strategies . Get out of my way . Let 's go . Admit you 're Gua and die without pain . Are you crazy ! - Flattery will get you nowhere . - Release me ! - You , Gua ? - What ? - Tell me about the crystals that you have . - I told you I do not know what you mean . Flinch Leave the woman to leave . You made a big mistake . - Go ahead and kill you . - I thought not kill people . Do not provoke me . By doing this , Cade ? We 're on the same team . We will check whether an alien after my methods . What is your method ? Since all I know . You 'll pay for that . Remember . Let her go . All right , put the gun down . Randy ! - What about the sheriff ? - Leave the sheriff . Come on ! Foster va muri . Let 's see if the sheriff arrived battalion . Where the hell 's the deputy ? Come on . What do we do ? Get the hell out of here . Protect an alien , Cade . That makes collaborator . - Go into the store . - No way . I thought you 'd say that . Forgot our mission . By law you must calc motorcyclists like a dog . Thank you . - Better go . - Why ? Randy ! - Hands up ! Do not move ! - What are you doing ? - It 's a killer . - Do not listen . - Get away from him , Melissa . Take your gun from the holster and put it down . Get it ! - What ? - Put your hands on your head . - What the hell are you doing ? - I think I found alien . Get in the truck ! Get in the truck or ... - I 'll shoot you now . - No ! - Melissa , no ! He 's one of them - What ? The aliens have the ability to heal quickly . He was shot and the wound has disappeared . - I know this man . - Do not know him at all . - Melissa is a murderer given search . - Shut up ! Please , put the gun down . - Get out of the way . - No . - Melissa , please . - You 'll have to shoot me . - Get out of the way ! - I 'm gonna kill . Anyway Gua died and escaped . If that 's your way , you 'll lose the war . The easiest way to overcome evil is to crush him without caring about who will be hurt ? Killing innocents is necessary in a war ? Nostradamus said that the method should be planned , today became my way clear . Contact life is God 's decision , if God does not exist ... not my decision . I can not , I will not shed innocent blood , even if it is only the prologue of terrible battles to come . Translation and adaptation Grizzly ( c ) thin

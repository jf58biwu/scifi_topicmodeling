 So today , everybody chose their tablefor the junior prom . Geez , Wyatt , stop whining and just ask somebody . I 've accepted that prom night 's going to be me and Gary trying to watch the playboy channel on scrblevision . Hey , Wy ! I hate my life . This is my junior prom date , Roxanne . - Roxanne , my mucho compade , Wyatt . - Hi . Wow , you didn 't tell me he works out . How did you two hook up ? Just in time for the prom and all . I was helping Roxanne with her social science project . It 's to prove that the average teenage male - thinks about sex every three minutes . - I broke the curve . I thought he was a total pervert till I realized he was thinking about me . Any lucky yet ? There 's still time to pitch in on a limo . The front runners are my mom and that lady in the park - who yells at stop signs . - Don 't worry . Some lucky girl is going to snap you right up . In fact , if I wasn 't going with the hair master here I 'd ask you myself . She 's crazy about me ! That little tramp . She was practically undressing you . Come on , she was just being friendly . Is there something wrong with your eyes ? - I can 't see any colors . - I 'll fix it later . I can 't believe that you didn 't nothing her coming on to you . She 's going with Gary . Why flirt with me ? The prom 's still a week away . I bet Gary doesn 't even end up going with Roxanne . It 's a bet . - On prom night , we 'll see who wins . - Why wait ? A laser disc ? This disc will show us who Gary goes to the prom with . It 's go your entire future lives recorded on it . Our entire lives on home video ? - Rated PG ? - That 's only because of Chett 's language . Let 's see what the future holds . [ screaming ] Oops , sorry . Too far . Wait . Go back . What was that ? Relax . That doesn 't happen for weeks . One crisis at a time . - [ soft rock music playing ] - There you go , Miss Cynical . Gary and Roxanne at the prom and they look as happy as ... Oh , you dog ! I can 't steal Gary 's girl . You think joining them on a date will help ? You said the future isn 't fixed . Everything I do today affects tomorrow , right ? Actually , that 's from the Terminator , but go ahead . I go to the movies with two of them . I act like a total jerk to Roxanne and make her hate me . - Wouldn 't it be easier to avoid Roxanne ? - It will never work . Even if she couldn 't see me she 'd still know I was out there . She 'd still think about me , fantasize about me . I want my bad . We do like ourselves , don 't we ? We still need to stop by Roxanne 's house . - My house ? Why ? - So you can change . You 're not going out wearing that , are you ? - What 's wrong ? - Yeah , what 's wrong ? She looks like something out of the Lollapalooza Sidehow . I do ? What are you doing ? Geez , hey , I 'm sorry . You look fine , really . No , no , he 's right . I mean , I 've never had much fashion sense . And ... well , I 'm just glad that somebody was finally honest enough to point it out to me . Thank you , Wyatt . Honey , I 've always thought you looked like crap . Wyatt , could you come with me tomorrow and help me pick out my prom dress ? - So , how did it go ? - We 've got a date tomorrow . That will how her . I don 't know what went wrong you 're too nice . You 're incapable of beg mean . I know what you need . What ? Essence of Chett . Lisa , how can you touch Chett 's dirty clothes ? It 's disgusting . You want to ditch Roxanne ? Well , yeah . You 've got to make yourself completely loathsome . We 're going to give you Chett 's personality . - And that 's where these come in . - Eww ! - There 's got to be another way . - Well , I could deform you . Maybe give you antlers or something . Gary better appreciate this . Go ahead . Chett me . [ belches ] Good luck . All right , you little frog sausage clear out . - I need to use the John . - Upado , Mr. Roboto . Take a hike . - What did you say ? - What 's the matter ? Getting hard of hearing , Sis ? Oh , prepare for a world-class butt kicking , snack weed . - Bring it on , pit whiffer . - Toe cheese . - Pucer butt . - Trouser chow . - Cud catcher . - Chuck mopper . Puke scooper . Well , well , well . - Looks like puberty finally kicked in . - Get bent . Que huevos , mi hermano . I have waited a long time for this day . I 'd hoped against hope that someday , you 'd be ready to live in my world . And that day has come . We are going to kick butt , little bro . [ voice breaking ] : I got to go write this down in my journal . So , how did it go ? Whoa ! How about you and me ta a few laps around the water bed ? Oh ! Lis , what 's going on ? It 's like I blacked out . - You became Chett . - I did ? - I don 't remember anything . - The magic briefs contain Chett 's essence . Whenever they 're with you , you have Chett 's personality . Look out , Roxanne . Here comes trouble . Ready , babe ? Let 's see if we can find something to cling to that luscious frame of yours . Sorry , Miss . I was looking for the can . Nice bra , by the way . Hello , ladies ! Mm-mm , very hot . Ow ! Scary ! Wyatt ? Wyatt , over here what do you think ? Oh , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . You got the goods . Put them up on the shelf where everyone can see them . Now that 's what I call a prom dress ? Who 's next ? Wyatt , I don 't know what 's gotten into you but I like it . Oh ! Boy , is that weird . What happened this time ? You totaled a dress shop , a taco stand and a tattoo parlor . So that explains this . On the bright side I 'm sure Roxanne never wants to see me again . Shall we check ? - Hold on a sec ! - Oops . I keep overshooting . I am proud to introduce your duly elected Queen and King Roxanne Adams ... - and Wyatt Donnelly . - What ? Oh , you double dog ! Just tell Gary the truth . The truth ? That I 'm destined to steal his prom date ? You 're right . We 'll let it be a surprise . What did you to to Roxanne ? Gary , I am so sorry . I don 't know how this happened . - I came over here to thank you . - Huh ? That prom dress is too hot . This will be the greatest night of my life and I 've got you to thank . Roxanne doesn 't really want to go to the prom with you . - What ? - She wants to go with ... - me . - How can you say that ? You don 't know what you 're talking about . You want proof , you got it . Luckily , our futures are direct-to-video . Chett , have you seen a laser disc lying around ? [ belching ] A what ? I can still prove this . We 'll have Lisa zap up a magic viewmaster or something . - Forget it . - Aren 't you listening ? - Lisa showed me the future . - Wyatt , stop . This jealousy thing makes you really unattractive . I got to run . Roxie 's waiting . Whoa ! Time to slap on your hip boots , bro . We 're going fishing . Fishing ? With shotguns ? Yeah , they got a whole pond all of big , fat koi just sitting outside the sushi hut . It 's almost like shooting fish in a barrel . Actually , it 's exactly like shooting fish in barrel . Sorry . I 'm not exactly in a koi shooting mood . You ... turning girly again ? That 's not going to happen . No . No way . I 'm cool ... Vomit puke . Vomit puke ? That doesn 't make any sense . What , are there rules ? Seems kind of arbitrary to me . Hmm . - Uh-oh . - Arbitrary to me . Big word . Big move . Get away from that damn computer . That 's half you problem . - Don 't hurt me ! - I 'm not going to hurt you but you 're at a delicate stage right now . You 're in serious danger of slipping back into girlhood . Brother . Let 's rock . We got a prom to get to . - What about the fish ? - Forget the fish . There 's a certain young ... lady I don 't want to disappoint . - If you know what I mean . - [ cackles ] Nuh ... what do you mean ? [ rock music playing ] Looks like they 're checking hand stamps . What will we do ? May we ? See you at the punch bowl . So , where is this babe you 've got staked out ? Eleven o 'clock . - CHETT : She 's with Wallace ? ! - Not for long . - The dork is going down . - [ chuckles ] You know , I remember my prom night . There was magic in the air . Chas Reskini threw a stink bomb in the girls ' rest room . Rocco Felzner let a wild badger loose on the dance floor . Oh , it was a special night . But the topper , the final stroke the ... - Piece de resistance ? - Oui . Was to be mine . I 'd stuff the ballot box so I 'd be prom king . When I went up on stage , I was going to drop trou and moon the whole damn prom . But assistant Principal Scampi was on to me . He stopped me before I could get on stage . Scampi ... Scampi ruined everything . Ballot box , huh ? Big bro , I got a job for you . Oh , my . Oh , my . We seem to have a problem here . What ? These ballots all say Wyatt Donnelly but you 're not marking it down right . Donnelly ? These ballots all say Ted Barger . Well , the handwriting 's a little messy but it definitely says Donnelly . Here , take a closer look . Oh , Donnelly . I 'm sorry . I see it now . - So , you having a good time ? - Yeah , this is nice . As nice as it would have been with , say ... - Wyatt ? - What ? Yes , of course . Nice than it would I 've been with Wyatt ? Yes , Gary , nice . What percent are we talking ? Ten , 20 ? Hello , everyone . I hate to interrupt your fun . But it 's time to crown our prom royalty . The envelope , please . I am proud to introduce your duty elected Queen and King Roxanne Adams ... and Wyatt Donnelly . Take your hand off my Queen , pit lick . Wy , what 's going on ? Okay , you old back shaver . Fork them over . Uh , Donnelly , I understand that we all like to let our hai down on prom night but that sort of familiarity really isn 't cool . Enough said , I trust ? Wyatt , I can 't believe this . Prom Queen . Let 's get on with the coronation . Get off her ! Where am I ? Oh , no . The prom . Geez , Gary , I 'm sorry . - What the hell do you think you 're doing ? - Sorry . - Lisa made me wear Chett 's underwear . - Say no more . Look at him . Helping out Wallace . He 's hopeless . Why do I always set myself up for disappointment ? I have no brother . Huh ? How did these get here ? Gary , are you okay ? Are you hurt ? It takes more than a punch in the face to ruin my prom . - I 'm breaking up with you . - That would do it . When Wyatt kissed me , I realized he 's the one like , not you . So , Wyatt , you want to dance ? Sorry , Roxanne , I can 't . Not after the way you dumped my best friend . - But you kissed me . - I wasn 't in control of myself . You got to understand . I was wearing my brother 's underwear . [ whistling ] [ clears throat ] Chester Donnelly . Ass-istant Principal Scampi . - That 's Principal Scampi now . - So I hear . You got a lot of guts showing your face back here . That 's me . Guts all over . You have 30 seconds to vacade school property . Or what ? Or I 'll contact your parents . This round goes to you , Scampi . But this battle 's not over . Not by a long shot . 20 seconds . Miss Bouvier , get your hot , little fanny up here . Who 's King of the prom now , huh ? Snot-nosed little weinies got a problem with that ? Uh-oh . Presenting the royal seal . I 've been looking for these . I hope this doesn 't affect my tenure . Captioned by Grant Brown

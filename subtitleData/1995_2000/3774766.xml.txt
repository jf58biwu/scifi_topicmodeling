 We 've become bored with watching actors give us phoney emotions . We 're tired of pyrotechnics and special effects . While the world he inhabits is , in some respects , counterfeit . - - There 's nothing fake about Truman himself . No scripts , no cue cards . It isn 't always Shakespeare , but it 's genuine . It 's a life . I 'm not goanna make it . You 're goanna have to go on without me . No way , mister . You 're going to the top of this mountain , broken legs and all . Many viewers leave him on all night , for comfort . You 're crazy , you know that ? For me there 's no difference between private life and public life . My life is The Truman Show . The Truman Show is a lifestyle . It 's a noble life . It is ... a truly blessed life . Tell me something I don 't know . All right . Promise me one thing , though . If I die before the summit , use me as an alternative source of food . You 're gross . It 's all real . Nothing you see on the show is fake . It 's merely controlled . THE TRUMAN SHOW Eat me , dammit . That 's an order . Maybe just your love handles . I have love handles ? Yeah , little ones . - Truman , you 're goanna be late . - Okay ! DAY 10,909 - Good morning ! - Good morning ! And in case I don 't see you , good afternoon and good night . - Morning , Truman . - Morning , Spencer . Hey , Pluto . - He won 't hurt you . - I know . It 's just me . Come on , Pluto . What is it ? An aircraft began shedding parts as it flew over Sea haven - - A few moments ago . Luckily , no one was hurt . How do you feel today ... ? That 's good . - Thinking of flying somewhere ? - Nope . This is classical Klyne . Forget about the perils of flying - - And let this music calm you down . " Dog Fancy ' , please . Thank you very much . Get me a paper , will you , Errol ? And one of these for the wife . Loves her fashion mages . - That be all for you , Truman ? - That 's the whole kit and caboodle . - Hank ! - Good morning , Truman . Good morning , Truman . Beautiful day , isn 't it ? - Haws your lovely wife ? - Good . Yours ? Couldn 't be better . - Nice talking to you . - You too . Think about that policy . Two for one . That 's a good deal . Doppelganger special . Hey , fells . Going in ? Go ahead . - Go ahead . - I 'm not that anxious to get there . Could I have directory assistance for Fiji , please ? Fiji Islands . Truman , did you see this ? I 'm sorry , ma 'am . If he 's in a coma he 's probably uninsurable . Yes , Fiji . Do you have a listing for Lauren Garland ? Nothing listed ... Do you have a Sylvia Garland ? S for Sylvia . Nothing ... Okay , thank you . - Lawrence . - I 've got a prospect in Wells Park . Wells Park ? On ... Harbour Island ? - You know another one ? - I can 't . I have an appointment . Dentist , or ... yeah . You 'll lose more than your teeth if you don 't meet your quota . They 're making cutbacks at the end of this month . You need this . Besides , a half hour across the bay will do you good . Thanks . Hello . Ferry 's still here , huh ? Thought I might have missed it . - One way or return ? - Return . There you go , sir . - Do you need any help , sir ? - You go ahead , I 'll be fine . Hi , honey . Look what I got free at the checkout . It 's a " Chef 's Pal " . It 's a dicer , grater , peeler , all in one . No sharpening , dishwater-safe . Wow ... that 's amazing . Truman ... you missed a spot . That is a beer . - I 'm thinking about getting out . - Yeah ? Out of what ? Out of my job . Out of Sea haven . Off this island . Out . What the hell 's wrong with your job ? You 've got a great job . A desk job . I 'd kill for a desk job . You should try stocking vending machines . Now there 's excitement . - Don 't you ever get antsy ? - Where 's there to go ? - Fiji . - Where 's Fiji ? Near Florida ? See here ? This is us ... And all the way around here ... Fiji . You can 't get any further away before you start coming back . There 's still islands in Fiji where no human being has ever set foot . So when are you goanna go ? It 's not that simple . It takes money , planning ... - You can 't just up and go . - Right . I 'm goanna do it , don 't worry about that . Bonus time is just around the corner . - Are you coming for a drink ? - No , I can 't tonight . I don 't like that weather , son . We should head back . Just a bit farther . Please ? - Okay . - Yes ! Daddy ! You 're soaked . Where have you been ? - We can scrape together 8,000 ... - You and Marlon ... - We can bum around the world . - And then what ? - You 're talking like a teenager . - Maybe I feel like a teenager . We have mortgage payments . Do we just walk away from our obligations ? - It would be an adventure . - We were going to try for a baby . - Isn 't that enough of an adventure ? - That can wait . I want to get away . See some of the world . Explore ! You want to be an explorer ... This will pass . We all think like this now and then . Let 's get you out of these wet clothes . Come to bed . You never see anything . They always turn the camera and play music . The wind blows , the curtain moves . You don 't see anything . " Dog Fancy ' , please . Thank you . Paper , Earl , please . I might as well get one of these . - For the wife ? - She 's got to have them . - Anything else , Truman ? - That 's the whole ball of wax . Dad ? Hey , what are you doing ? Get out of the way ! Stop those people ! Stop ! Stop ! Open the door ! Somebody stop the bus ! Stop the bus ! Somebody stop it ! Stop the bus ! It doesn 't sound insane at all . I see him ten times a week . I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon ... It was Dad . Dressed like a homeless man . And a businessman and a lady with a dog forced him onto a bus . It 's about time they cleaned up the trash downtown . They never found Dad 's body . If it wasn 't him , it was his twin ! Did Dad have a brother ? You know perfectly well that your father was an only child . Just like you . Sweetie ... You 're just feeling bad because of what happened . You sailing off into that storm ... But I 've never blamed you . And I don 't blame you now . Truman ... ? What are you doing down here ? Fixing the mower . - I saw my father today . - I know . Your mother called . You shouldn 't upset her like that . - What did you want ? - I made macaroni . - I 'm not hungry . - You know ... We ought to throw out that mower . Get one of those new Elk Rotaries . What 's he doing ? They got rid of her , but they couldn 't erase the memory . 10,910 NUMBER OF DAYS RUNNING - Are you okay ? - Excuse me . Sorry I fell on you . I 've been such a klutz all day . I must have sprained this ankle . - I 'm so sorry to fall on you . - Don 't worry about it . - I 'm Meryl . - Hi , I 'm Truman . - Truman , you 've studied enough . - I 've got to commit this to memory . Come on , an ice-cold brew sky . You 're goanna have to copy off me , so be careful . You 're a better person than I am . - See you later . - Bye . See you later , loser . Hi . - Konnichi-wa . - What ? - You take Japanese . - Oh , yes ... Lauren , right ? - It 's on the ... - Lauren , right . - I 'm Truman Burbank . - Yeah , I know . - I 'm not allowed to talk to you . - Really ? - I 'm a pretty dangerous character . - I 'm sorry . It 's not up to me . Girls have got to be careful . - You have a boyfriend , right ? - It 's not that . Was it Meryl , the girl I was with ? We 're not ... We 're just friends . - It 's nothing like that . - It 's how I look ? Not your type ? No . HOW 'S IT GOING TO END ? I was wondering that myself . Would you maybe , possibly sometime go out for some pizza ? - Like , Friday ? Saturday ? - I can 't . Sunday , Monday , Tuesday ? NOW - We have finals tomorrow . - Yeah , I know . If we don 't go now , it won 't happen . Do you understand ? So what do you want to do ? Please keep your hands inside the car ! This is my favourite pizza place . Tony , one large , extra plankton ! We have so little time . They 'll be here any minute . - They don 't want me talking to you . - Then don 't talk . They 're here . - What do they want ? - Listen to me . Everybody knows everything you do . They 're pretending . Understand ? - My name 's not Lauren , it 's Sylvia . - Lauren , sweetheart , not again . - Who are you ? - Her father . I 've never seen him before . Truman , don 't listen to him . Everything I 've told you is the truth . It 's fake . It 's all for you . The sky and the sea . Everything is a set ! Please , don 't listen to him . He 's goanna lie to you . - I want to know what 's going on . - Schizophrenia . We 've tried it all . Hypnotism , shock therapy ... Don 't worry , you 're not the first . - She brings all her boys down here . - Truman , he 's lying ! Get out of here . Come and find me . - I 'll see you in school . - We 're moving to Fiji . Sylvia ! Hey ! - Why didn 't he just follow her ? - His mother got really sick . He couldn 't leave her . He 's kind . Maybe he 's too kind . I can 't believe he married Meryl on the rebound . Come on , Sal . We 've already got this on the greatest hits tape . HOW 'S IT GOING TO END ? Close , but no cigar . Another beautiful day in paradise . But don 't forget to buckle up . He 's heading west on Stuart . Stand by , all extras . He 's turning onto Lancaster Square . My God , he nearly hither ! Something is wrong . Change frequencies . Sorry about that , folks . I guess we picked up a police frequency . It 's classical Klyne , and we 've still got some great music ahead . But buckle up . Remember safety . A good driver is a safe driver . CRACKDOWN ON HOMELESS City Fathers : " Enough is Enough " - Can I help ? - I have an appointment . - What 's happening ? - Nothing . - Just tell me what 's happening . - We 're remodelling . - It 's none of your business . - Tell me , or I 'll report you ! You 're trespassing . - Marlon ! - Truman , what are you doing here ? I 've got to talk to you . I 'm on to something big ! - You look like shit . - I think I 'm mixed up in something . A lot of strange things have been happening . The people on the elevator , there was no backing on it ... And the radio starts following me , talking about everything I 'm doing . - This is one of your fantasies . - I think this is about my dad . I think he 's alive . I 'll tell you about it later . I 'm being followed . Who ? It 's hard to tell . They look like regular people . - How about those two ? - Could be . It 's when I 'm unpredictable . That 's when they can 't ... Anything happen ... ? We have to get out of here . - You ready to go ? - I can 't . - You 're goanna get us both fired . - Okay then , let 's do it . Whatever you say , I 'm game . Your birthday comes but once a year ! Maybe I 'm being set up for something . You ever think that your whole life has been building toward something ? No . When you were hauling chickens , how far did you get off the island ? I went all over . Never found a place like this , though . Look at that sunset . It 's perfect . That 's the big guy . Quite a paintbrush he 's got . Just between you and me , Marlon ... - I 'm going away for a while . - Really ? My little clown ... Old carrot-top . The best photos ... - We should be getting your home . - Here 's us at Mt . Rushmore . Do you remember , Truman ? You slept the whole way there . - It looks so small . - Things do , when you look back . Look , Truman . The happiest day of our lives . - Look ! Jean , Jodie , Joanne ... - Doesn 't she look beautiful ? Well , she still does . There 's room for baby photos . I want to hold a grandchild before I go . We really should get you home . No , you stay . Relax . - Your favourite show is coming on . - And we have something to discuss . - A certain person 's birthday . - Oh , I see . There 'll be another " Lucy " tomorrow . Now it 's time for Golden Oldies . Tonight we present the classic : " Show Me the Way to Go Home " . You don 't have to leave home to discover what the world is about . We learn that no one is poor who has friends . Full of laughter , love , pain , sadness , but ultimately , redemption . The cherry scene will have you split ting your sides with laughter . There 'll be tears , too , when David and Jennifer are reunited . Let 's join the Abbots in Camden Village . Thank you , Sweetie . I need to talk to you , but let 's go outside . - I 'd love to , but I 'm really late . - What 's your rush ? There was that elevator disaster . It was on the news . The cable just snapped . The elevator plummeted ten flights . Right next door to where you work . What if you had been in there ? Anyway , I have an amputation on one of the women from the elevator . She 's very young . It 's sad . Wish me luck . I 'll cross my fingers for you . Excuse me . May I help you ? I 'm looking for my wife , Nurse Burbank . It 's very important . That 's not possible . She 's in pre-op . Sure ... Okay , fine . Can you pass along a message ? I had to go to Fiji . I 'll call when I get there . - When you get to Fiji ? - You got it . - Fine . I 'll tell her . - Thank you so much . Sorry . Let me help you with that . He 's here . Scalpel . I 'm now making my primary incision . - - Just above the right knee . - Nicely done . - Unless you 're family ... - It 's just a beautiful job . - I 'll let someone else tidy up . TRAVELLERS BEWARE IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU ! - I 'm sorry to keep you . - That 's okay . - How can I help ? - I 'd like a flight to Fiji . - When would you like to leave ? - Today . I 'm sorry . I don 't have anything for at least a month . It 's the busy season . Do you want to book the flight ? I 'll make other arrangements . Last call for Chicago ! All aboard ! Thank you . Windy City , here we come . Hi ! Hello ... - Mom , isn 't that you know you ? - Face the front . Everybody off , we 've got a problem . I 'm sorry , son . - Wasn 't his father from Chicago ? - His father was from Des Moines . - Why does he want to go to Chicago ? - He 's not going anywhere . Truman ? - Honey , are you okay ? - Get in . - Truman ... - Look . I predict that , in just a moment , we 'll see a lady on a red bike - - Followed by a man with flowers and a Volkswagen with a dented fender . - Truman , please ... - Look ! Lady ... Flowers ... - And ... ? - And ... - Truman , this is silly . - There 's the dented Beetle ! Yes ! You know how I did that ? They 're on a loop . They go around the block , they come back , they go around again . - I invited Marlon to barbecue ... - I won 't be here . We need more charcoal . Are you listening to a word I 'm saying ? You 're upset because you want to go to Fiji ? Okay , go . I think you should save for a few months , and then go . I 'm going to take a shower . Let 's go now . I 'm ready . Why wait ? Early bird gathers no moss , rolling stone catches the worm . Truman , what are you doing ? - Truman ... - Where shall we go ? - Truman , where are we going ? - I guess I 'm being spontaneous . Somebody help me ! I 'm being spontaneous ! Forget Fiji . We can 't drive to Fiji , can we ? - What about Atlantic City . - No , you hate to gamble . That 's right , I do . But I never have . And that 's why people go places . - I think I 'm going to throw up . - Me , too . Blocked at every turn . Beautifully synchronized , don 't you think ? - You 're blaming me for the traffic ? - Should I ? Truman , let 's go home . You 're right . We could be stuck here for hours . It 'll be like this all the way to Atlantic City . Let 's go back . I 'm sorry . I don 't know what got into me . - Can you please slow down ? - Yes , I can . - That 's our turn-off . - I changed my mind . What 's New Orleans like this time of year ? Mardis Gras ! Look , Meryl . Same road , no cars . It 's magic . Let me out . If you want to destroy yourself , do it on your own . I think I 'd like a little company . Oh , Truman ... You knew this would happen . You know you can 't drive over water . Let 's go home , where you 'll feel safe . Give me your hand ... You drive ! We shouldn 't be doing this . We 're breaking the law ! - Oh , my ! - You can do it ! You can make it ! We 're over ! We 're over the bridge ! - We 're over the bridge ! - We 're over ! FOREST FIRE WARNING EXTREME DANGER - What about that sign ? - They exaggerate . We 'll be fine . Do you believe that ? Truman , we 're on fire ! - It 's just smoke . You okay ? - Yes . - Want to do it again ? - No ! Truman , stop ! What do we do for money when we get to New Orleans ? I have my Sea haven bank card . So we 're just going to eat into our savings , is that it ? I 'll have to call your mother . I don 't know how she 'll take this . What now ? SEAHAVEN NUCLEAR POWER STATION - Looks like a leak at the plant . - Back up . Leak at the plant . The whole area is being evacuated . - Thank you for your help . - You 're welcome , Truman . Truman ... Truman , come back ! Stop him ! Truman ! Stay away ! - Thank you both for your help . - Next time he 'll be charged . I understand . Thanks again . Good night . Let me get you some help , Truman . You 're not well . Why do you want to have a baby with me ? You can 't stand me . That 's not true . I 'll fix you some Mococoa . Natural cocoa beans from Mt . Nicaragua . - No artificial sweeteners . - What are you talking about ? I 've tasted other cocoas . This is the best . What the hell does this have to do with anything ? - Tell me what 's happening ! - You 're having a nervous breakdown . You 're part of this , aren 't you ? Truman , you are scaring me . No , you 're scaring me . What are you goanna do ? Dice me , slice me or peel me ? There 's so many choices . Do something ! What ? What did you say ? - Who are you talking to ? - I didn 't say anything . - I wasn 't talking to anybody . - Talk to me ! - I don 't know anything ! - Stay where you are . Truman ... ? Thank God ! How can anyone expect me to carry on under these conditions ? It 's unprofessional ! Everything 's goanna be okay . It 's all goanna be fine . I don 't know what to think , Marlon . Maybe I 'm losing my mind . It feels like the whole world revolves around me . That 's a lot of world for one man . Is it wishful thinking ? Wishing you 'd made more out of yourself ? Who hasn 't sat in the john and had an imaginary interview on TV ? This is different . Everybody seems to be in on it . I 've been your best friend since we were seven . We got through school by cheating off each other 's test papers . Jesus , they were identical . But I always felt safe knowing that . Because whatever the answer was , we were right or wrong together . I stayed up all night in your tent so you could play North Pole . And I got pneumonia . Remember that ? You were out of school for a month . You 're the closest thing I ever had to a brother , Truman . Things haven 't worked out for us like we used to dream they would . I know what that feeling 's like . Everything slipping away ... You don 't want to believe it , so you look for answers somewhere else . But the point is , I 'd gladly walk in front of traffic for you . But the point 's , I 'd gladly step in front of traffic for you . And the last thing I 'd ever do is lie to you . And the last thing that I would ever do ... is lie to you . I mean , think about it . If everybody is in on it ... I 'd have to be in on it , too . I 'm not in on it , Truman , because there is no " it " . - You were right about one thing . - What 's that ? The thing that started all this . I found him for you , Truman . That 's why I came by tonight . I 'm sure he 's got quite a story to tell . Go to him . Easy on the fog . Stand by , crane-cam ... Crane-cam . Button-cam three . I never stopped believing . Go wide . Curb-cam eight . My son . - Move in for close-up ? - No , no ... Stay back . Fade up music . Now go for the close-up . All those years wasted . I 'll make it up to you , son . I swear . Dad ... Bravo ! Congratulations . - Okay , quiet down . Concentrate . - That was great television . - Christ of , it was brilliant ! - It broke my heart . Well done ! Congratulations ! Truman drinks Mococoa , world 's finest cocoa beans - - Grown on the upper slopes of Mt . Nicaragua . 1 . 7 billion were there for his birth . 220 countries tuned in for his first step . The world stood still for that stolen kiss . And as he grew , so did the technology . A human life . - - Recorded on a network of hidden cameras and broadcast live 24 hours a day , seven days a week , to an audience around the globe . From Sea haven , enclosed in the largest studio ever constructed . - - One of only two man-made structures visible from space . - - Now in its 30th great year , it 's The Truman Show ! What a week ! I was on pins and needles the entire time . I 'm your host , Mike Michelson . Welcome to True-Talk , our forum for issues growing out of the show . Tonight , something very special : An exclusive interview with the show 's creator . Let 's go live to the 221stfloor of the Omni-Cam Ecosphere . There we 'll find the world 's greatest tele-visionary . The designer of the world within a world that 's Sea haven : Christ of . I 'd like to thank you for granting this interview . We know your schedule is demanding , and how you guard your privacy . - This , sir , is indeed an honour . - Don 't mention it . The catalyst for the recent dramatic events - - Has been Truman 's father , Kirk , and his attempt at infiltration . This is not the first time someone has tried to reach Truman , is it ? We have had our close calls . It 's television ! I did it ! I 'm on The Truman Show ! But now , the first intruder to be a former cast member . - A dead one at that . - Writing Kirk back in , brilliant . Kirk started this whole crisis . He was the only one who could end it . Truman , no ! - That 's off limits ! - Why ? What 's over there ? Nothing . It 's dangerous , that 's all . You have to know your limitations . Let 's remind viewers why Dad was written outing ' the first place . As Truman grew up , we manufactured ways to keep him on the island . - I 'd like to be a great explorer . - There 's nothing left to explore . - Then I thought up Kirk 's drowning . - He 's feared the water ever since . When Kirk read the synopsis , he was disappointed , to say the least . I 'm sure that 's why he broke onto the set . But how do you intend to explain his 22-year absence ? - Amnesia . - Brilliant . Let 's take some viewer calls . North Carolina , you 're on with Christ of . Hi , Christ of . I was wondering how many cameras you got in that town . Somewhere in the vicinity of5,000 . Remember , we started with just one . He was two weeks premature , as if he couldn 't wait to get started . And his eagerness to leave the womb was the reason he was selected . In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - - For a show determined by an air date , only Truman arrived on cue . I believe Truman is the first child to be adopted by a corporation . - That 's correct . - The show 's made enormous revenue . Equivalent to the GNP of a small country . It takes the population of an entire country to keep it running . Since it 's on 24 hours , revenues are generated by product placement . Everything on the show is for sale , down to the very homes they live in . All of tin the Truman catalogue . Operators are standing by . Christ of , why has Truman never come close to discovering - - The true nature of his world until now ? We accept the reality of the world with which we 're presented . The Hague for Christ of . Hello . The Hague ... All right , let 's go to Hollywood , California . You 're a liar and a manipulator , and what you 've done to Truman is sick . Well , we remember this voice , don 't we ? How could we forget ? - Let 's go to another call . - No , no . It 's fine , Mike . I love to reminisce with former members of the cast . Sylvia , as you announced so melodramatically to the world ... Do you think because you batted your eyes at Truman once . - - Flirted with him , stole a few minutes of air time - - To thrust your politics into the limelight , that you know him ? That you know what 's right for him ? Are you in a position to judge him ? What right do you have to turn a baby 's life into a mockery ? Don 't you ever feel guilty . I have given Truman the chance to lead a normal life . The world , the place you live in . - - Is the sick place . Sea haven is the way the world should be . - He 's a prisoner , not a performer . - He can leave at any time . If his was more than a vague ambition , if he was determined - - To discover the truth , there 's no way we could prevent him . I think what distresses you , really , caller . - - Is that , ultimately , Truman prefers his cell , as you call it . That 's where you 're so wrong . And he 'll prove you wrong . These heated comments aside , it 's been a very positive experience . For Truman and for the viewers . Thank you for your time . Now that this crisis is behind us . - - Can we look forward to some exciting new developments ? The big news is : Meryl will leave Truman in an upcoming episode . A new romantic interest will be introduced . I 'm determined that TVs first on-air conception will take place . Another television milestone . It has been a singular honour and a pleasure . Christ of , thank you . Hey , Simeon . - Is he looking at us ? - You think he knows ? - Hello ... - Better call Christ of . Come in , Major Burbank . He 's back to his old self . That 's an unusual cat , my man . I hereby proclaim this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy . - Is he goanna go ? - Hallway camera ready . - That one 's for free . - Stand by , all house cameras . - Good morning . - Good morning . - In case I don 't see you ... ... good afternoon and good night . Good afternoon , good night ... - Morning , Truman . Haws it going ? - I 'll check . Vital signs are good . Hey , Pluto ! - Good morning ! - Look who 's here . Beautiful day , isn 't it ? We thought about the policy , and we 'll take it . Great ! Let 's go up to my office and sign the papers . - Next week would be better . - I knew it . See you guys . - See you next week . - Looking forward to it ! This isn 't about insurance . This is about the great variable . When will death occur ? Could be a week , a month , a year ... Could be today . Innocent sunbather , stabbed by the tip of a runaway beach umbrella . No way to guard against that . - Excuse me . - Truman , this is Vivian . The two of you are going to be neighbours . I guess what I 'm saying is that life is ... fragile . - Vivian , your office . - Sorry . I 'm sorry ... You do ? Oh , great . Let me take your information . Ready , two . Go to two . Back to medium ... and wide . I was just trying to train the kid to ... never mind . - What 's he doing in the basement ? - He moved in there when Meryl left . Why wasn 't I told ? Unpredictable behaviour has to be reported . - He 's just sleeping . I thought ... - This is the best shot we 've got ? - What 's on the clock-cam ? - Obstruction . - What happened ? - He was tidying up his garbage . I was goanna call you , but he gave up and fell asleep . - I want to check the set-ups ... ... for the insurance convention . Nice move . There you go . Isolate the audio . Give me a close-up on his torso . Still breathing . Where 's Chloe ? Call him . Tell him it 's a wrong number . - What took you so long ? - I had to wait for it . - They were busy . What 's going on ? - I don 't know . - He did nothing but stand around . - Shut up and watch . Then we went to night vision . He 's asleep . There ! Stop it . Zoom in under the chair . - Enhance it . - Is it ... ? My God ... - He didn 't go up the stairs . - Get Marlon over there ! Truman ... Surprise party ! I got a six-pack of cold brew skies with our name on them . Come on , pal . Come on , buddy . Shit ! Marlon , find him . He 's still in the room . - Come out , wherever you are . - Good . Keep it light . I know you 're in here . Check under the table . The closet , behind you . Gee , I wonder where he could possibly be . Lawn-cam ! - Say something . Keep it going . - He 's gone . - Cut transmission ! - Cut transmission ? - God in heaven ! - Give me the phone ! TECHNICAL FAULT PLEASE STAND BY We 've got every available extra looking for him . The crew , too . - What about prop cars ? - Accounted for . He has the world 's most recognizable face , he can 't disappear . Go find him , Pluto . Good dog . All this fuss ! If he could just hear my voice . Truman ! Truman ! Let me try . Truman ! It 's me , Dad ! Let 's talk ! Yeah , I know . We 're just about done with the square . We 've got to go back to Barrymore , check the interiors . Who 's watching the college ? Send someone over there . - Take another man , get down there . - Find the son of a bitch ! Get some batteries . He 's not goanna glow in the dark . We need more light . We 'll never find him this way . - What time is it ? - It 's way too early for that . Cue the sun . What time is it ? Christ of , what 's going on ? There 's rumours that he 's dead . The media 's having a feeding frenzy . Every network has a pirated shot of Marlon making an ass of himself . - The sponsors are threatening us . - We 're getting our highest ratings . - No sign of him . - Go back to town , join the others . Everyone else at first positions . Everyone is at first positions ? He 's got to be there somewhere . - We 're not watching the sea . - Why would we watch the sea ? - Sweep the harbour . - Bring up the harbour cameras . - Aren 't some of those out ? - Yeah , but we have the lighthouse . All buoy-cams , please . - Long lens , short-base cameras . - Why are we looking at the water ? Truman , where are you going ? - Sailing ? He 's afraid of the water . - Resume transmission . I got 2-1 he doesn 't make it . Just leave them in the car . Get off this mast-cam . You can 't see his face . Go to the cabin-cam . Perfect . That 's our hero shot . - Let 's get another boat out there . - I need to talk to the ferry guys . Come on , get it moving ! - I 'm just the bus driver . - They can 't sail . They 're actors ! How do we stop him ? Okay ... We 're going to access the weather programme ' now . So hold on to your hats . You got that ? No , I think we 'll want to localize the storm over the boat .

 Oil ! We 're all rich ! That 's what I like . We 're rich ! I like this world . Me too , man . I 've had dreams about this . Quinn Mallory , can I touch you ? Will some of that rub off on me ? What ? Haven 't you heard , man ? You hit the mother lode . Your house on James Street ? They just found a gusher in your back yard . You 're a millionaire , Quinn . Don 't celebrate so hard . You might hurt yourself . Did I just hear right ? There 's oil everywhere and everybody 's rich ? - Yes ! - Yes ! How much time we got ? About a minute . That sucks . That just sucks . Easy come , easy go . This looks like a good place . If I fixed the timer , we can get home . Why do we have to leave the party so quick ? Okay , here . I can 't believe how much is here . Come on . Watch out , Professor ! Look out ! Thank you . How could you ? I was trying to help you . Well done . What was that about ? Beats me . I guess he just doesn 't like to be kissed . Well , gentlemen , we 're in a world ... where they do not like to kiss pretty ladies for a little over two days . Great . We get 20 minutes in wealthyland , we 're stuck two days here in psychoville . Watch your step . What 's with this place ? I don 't know . But I think we should get off the streets . You 've got my vote . Hey , Faye 's . There 's a familiar place on this world . - On me ? - Cool . - I 'm starving . - So am I. I think it 's a natural consequence of sliding . I think first the terror , and then afterwards , the relief brings hunger . Agreed . - I want beef Wellington today . - I want a milkshake . Beef Wellington , asparagus , a nice vichyssoise to start with . What are you looking at ? Man , this place is cold . A few days here is going to be as tough as a weekend gig in Salt Lake City . That was Easter 1989 . All them people clapping on the off beat . My good woman , we haven 't even seen the menu yet . There is no menu . You got a problem with that , take it up with the CHC . Looks like airline food . Yeah , only not as good . Somebody do something . That 's the fourth cough . Will you do something ? We hit 911 . Any minute now , okay ? Don 't I know you ? Have you been in here before ? Never . Lord . You can take a man 's body and beat it . You can take his soul and try it . But to do this to a hamburger , it 's just downright unkind . Still , I 'm starving . Well , you 're certainly ahead of the game . Excuse me a minute . Where are your facilities ? Oh , no . What if you could find brand-new worlds right here on Earth ... where anything is possible ? Same planet , different dimension . I found the gateway . Sliders . I always wanted to do this . That is him . California Health Commission ? You 're cute with long hair . What is " Patient Zero " ? The first known carrier of a disease , the origin of an epidemic . No wonder the waitress was staring at me . You always think women are staring at you . We better get out of here before she thinks that 's me . You don 't have to say that twice . I got to pay good money for this food . What a world . Everyone stay where you are . This facility is under stage one quarantine . Which one ? It 's not the Q , damn it . Look at my skin , look at my eyes . Get him ! Stop right there ! Cut him off ! Go the other way ! Stop ! Got him ! He ain 't going nowhere ! You 're making it worse ! Be realistic , pal . You can 't do this to me ! It was just a cough ! Rembrandt , come on . It 's him ! Quinn , this is serious . I don 't think I like this world . Wonder what this Q does to you ? Come on , let 's go . You all right ? My head 's really pounding . I just feel dizzy . Mr. Brown , why don 't you use some of your new-gotten wealth ... and check us into that motel over there ? - You 're tired , that 's all . - Yeah . We need to sack out . I 'll get you some aspirin . Okay . I 'll come with you . Get us some Alka-Seltzer , just in case we eat out again . What is this place , some kind of medieval apothecary ? " Witch hazel . Soapwort . Wormwood . " This must be some kind of alternative pharmacy . - You know , like the one in Berkeley . - Oh , yes . Where any big-business medicine ... was described as a fascist tool of immuno-oppression . Feel-Rite Pharmacy . Hygienically approved . - Do you need directions or something ? - No , we need two rooms . Wonderful . - You got any vacancies ? - A few . We can just squeeze you in . Gomez , what is it ? What 's going on ? Mommy , we have customers ! So take care of it . We are a very clean establishment . Nothing lives here , no bugs , no germs . And everything is hygiene wrapped . You know , of course , we can 't allow any sick people in this motel . Hangover . Some of the fairer sex just can 't hold their liquor . You know how it is , being a man of the world and all . That 's right . There 's hot water in every room ... and complimentary Ovaltine served daily until 10 : 00 a. m . Whoa ! Told you to stay off them beers . Yes . Yes . It is you . You 're a hero to a lot of folks , man . You 're like Charlie Manson and the Night Stalker combined . You took a whole society down , Quinn , and all you had to do was breathe , man . You 're nuts . Yes . Yes ? Yes . Do you have any aspirin ? As in for headaches . Who 's got a headache ? You ? No , sir , I do not have a headache . A friend of mine has a headache . You wait here . I 'll see what I have in the back . Blistering idiot . - I 've been recognized . - Let 's get out of here . They 're coming for you . I just placed the call . They 'll be here soon . Back door . But don 't them take you alive , Quinn . When they blow you away , you will become a martyr , man . Come on , lad ! Chaos lives ! Quinn must die ! Back there ! Hold it , pal ! Put your hands on your head ! Get off me ! Go on . That 's it . He 's tranqed , guys . Come on , let 's go . Shot ? You saw him get hit ? They ambushed him . There was nothing I could do . - Did they kill him ? - No , I think they used a tranquilliser dart . They 've probably taken him to a protection area . What ? - A quarantine area for people with the Q. - Q ? Look , the Quinn of this world was a failing medical student ... who deliberately infected the general population with the plague . So ? He 's public enemy number one . If they 've got him somewhere , they 're going to announce it on the news . Then we 've got to get him out . We 've only got 28 hours before we slide . You may have to go on by yourself . What ? We can 't possibly take this plague to another world . What do you mean " we " ? She 's the one who 's ... I 'm not feeling too well myself . You , too ? Let 's see what we can do for her , while we still can . She must have been infected by the man she kissed on the street . She 's burning up . I 'll get some ice . It 's all right . It 's all right . You 're going to be all right . Just hold on . The fever must be producing hallucinations . Wade , just try to relax . Wade ? It 's all right . This will cool you off . That will help . Wade , listen . We 're trying to help you . It 's all right . I 've never seen anything quite like this . Stop it ! What are you doing ? Please do not resist . Stop ! Just relax . I know you think I 'm the guy on the wanted posters . I know I look like him , but I 'm not the one you 're looking for . You can cut your hair and shave your beard ... but you can 't change your fingerprints . God ! I know this is a little hard to swallow ... but I 'm not from your world . I come from another Earth . Initial decontamination complete . Q infection not present . What ? That 's impossible . Run it again . Please . Listen to me . Q infection not present . Damn it . You 're doing something wrong . Q infection not present . Must be something wrong with the equipment . I don 't think so . Let me examine him . He escaped on your watch , Dr. Stanley . You know you 're prohibited . He 's my patient , Dr. Morton . I want to see him . If you see him , I have to be present . And so remember , it is your civic responsibility ... to report all infected individuals to the California Health Commission . This message brought to you by the California Health Commission . And now , back to Amazing Bargains . Charlie , for the big question , come on over here . How much ? Mike , we all like to entertain , but in this day and age ... how can you trust the folks that enter your home ? They might well be carriers . - Can you afford to take that chance ? - Absolutely not , Charlie . That 's why on Amazing Bargains , we 're offering ... the entire self-protection biological purification kit at a low price . Great . How much ? This looks great . You get 5 pairs of surgical gloves . Five pairs ? And 36 bars of Medidine soap . It kills germs on contact . 36 ? That 's great . And Mike , this beautiful autoclave . It 's got a stainless steel pullout drawer . Wow , what is that for ? It sterilizes every utensil in your home . Great . How much for all this on Amazing Bargains ? If you bought all of this retail ... I can 't take any more of this . But on Amazing Bargains , everything is just $ 49.95 . $ 49.95 , what do you think ? More ! I 'll tell you what I 'll do , Mike . It 's the self-activating front door home protection unit . What does that do ? This actually sprays and sterilizes every guest that enters your home . - Automatically ? - Complete protection . She 's getting worse , man . She 's the colour of a wax candle I got back at home . You don 't look so hot yourself . It 's the Q. White nodules on the back of the throat . Looks like strep . You got it , she 's got it . - We 're all going to die here . - Pull yourself together , man . Pull yourself together . Let 's go and see what we can do for her . Wade ? Wade ! Come on . Wow , what is that for ? No ! No ! Stop ! If we don 't calm her down ... What do we do ? Wade ! Come on now . - Who are you ? - We 're old friends from back home . Come now , Miss Wells . There 's a nice cosy bed waiting for you at the Motel 12 . I 'm not going anywhere with you . I don 't even know you . My friends have arrived . I was told you asked for entry . Why are you here ? Who sent you ? No one . We were chasing after our friend . Your people took her . She has the Q. She belongs here . Is this a protection zone ? Hardly . You don 't know where you are ? No . But we do know who you are . Of course you do . Everyone does . They make sure of that . Quinn , I knew you would come back for me . She 's about to go red-eye . Red-eye ? What 's that mean ? - Final stage . Terminal . - Terminal ? How long does she have ? Each case is different . She seems to be on the fast track . I think I 'm dying , Quinn . There are things I should have told you a long time ago . Take her to 17 . She acts like she knows me . She doesn 't seem to be hallucinating , but I know we never met . If you have an open mind , I will tell you how . Want to know what I 've been doing that cured me ? Fine , I 'll tell you . I 've been sliding through an inter-dimensional wormhole ... seeing how many different ways people like you can screw up civilization ! A remembered hallucination . I 'm not your Quinn Mallory . Wait a minute . I tore up my knee playing football . Did your Quinn do that ? You know you did . Great . Bad knees follow me everywhere . Just hold on , honey . This man is a doctor . He 's here to help us . Good heavens . I have seen slaughterhouses that look more hygienic . That man , what qualification does he have as a medical practitioner ? What can he do for her ? He can only help alleviate her suffering . He 's taking a huge chance just being here . He could be jailed if the Board of Health found out . On this world , his kind of dedication is very rare . On this world . Frankly , your acceptance of our situation surprises us . We 're accustomed to a little more scepticism . I don 't have time to be sceptical . If you 're lying , you 'll wear that around your neck when judgment comes . So until I learn otherwise , I 'll accept who you say you are . How long have you been doing this ? Since my escape . At least here , people are allowed to live out their final days with dignity . The protection camps are worse than a living death . You 've been there ? Briefly . I was a medical student . I volunteered to be a lab subject to help out this doctor , Darren Morton ... one of our foremost researchers . He gave me the Q , swore I was all right , and released me into the population . Wait a minute . The government infected you ? I became Patient Zero ... dodging from one quarantine zone to another . The ones who are really accountable are the ones who make the policy ... the quarantines , protection zones . The rich live in sanitary conditions while the poor get sick and die . I don 't believe this . I mean , not in America . Maybe not in your America . But here , it 's the cold , hard truth . You don 't believe me ? Well , ask them ! This plague , why is it resistant to antibiotics ? - Antibiotics ? - Penicillin . What 's that ? Did you develop some kind of drug ? I 'm not your Quinn . We 'll find traces of it in you . I 'm not your Quinn ! We 're running a blood test now . Help us . Tell us what to look for . Or we 'll do an autopsy and find out for ourselves . If you kill me and cut me open , I can tell you what you 'll find . What ? I 'm not your Quinn . Oh , man . I know you 're hungry , but where 's your dignity ? We have no time for dignity . I know the food on this world is bad , but come on . Get this man something to eat . - I don 't want to raise false hopes . - False hopes about what ? There , you see ? Mould . With luck , I may be able to create an elementary antibiotic . Perhaps even a simple streptomycin . - Penicillin ! - How you going to make penicillin ? We got no tablets , no needles , and no time . You concentrate on finding a way of getting Quinn out of jail . Professor , let 's trust that they 'll have real penicillin on the next world . And if there isn 't ? We take a plague there . We become Patient Zero . I hope you know what you 're doing . So do I. Wade . It 's all right , sweetheart . You rest now . They found your friend . He 's being held at the CHC on Polk Street . Here . Thanks , anyway . I 'm a straight arrow . No , you don 't understand . I have a very good friend at the CHC . Her name is Dr. Eileen Stanley . You take this to her . She 'll know it could only come from me . Why do I have to go ? Because you 're the only one here who 's still healthy . Believe me , we can trust her . She risked her life for me once . I couldn 't say anything before with Dr. Morton standing there . - What are you doing ? - Be quiet . This room is monitored . Put this on . I really appreciate this . I know you 're taking a big chance . Let 's just find a cure together , that 's all that matters . Come on , let 's go . Don 't stop . Code red . They know we 've gone . Security . Hurry ! All systems respond . This way ! Stop , or I 'll shoot ! Almost there ! Right behind you . I repeat , stop or I 'll shoot ! Down the stairs ! He has a gun ! What 's all the commotion ? That 's it over there . You really do love driving cabs , don 't you ? Yes , it 's my destiny . You don 't know the half . There 's $ 100 . There 's two more where that came from if you 're here when I come back . I 'll wait . What was that ? This way . Got to get out of the light ! Come on , move it ! Oh , God ! No ! Do not attempt to move the wounded . Come on ! Quinn ! Quinn , come on ! Go on . You can 't let them catch you . I 'm not leaving you here . I should 've come with you the first time . I thought I could find a cure . Come on , Quinn ! Please , Quinn , forgive me . I do . Of course I do . - You 're not going to die . - Yes , I am . Don 't die with me . Come on , man , we have no time ! Let 's go ! Quinn , leave her ! Come on , man , move it ! We must first create a growth culture . The antibacterial substance is released into the fluid that the mould grows in . Antibacterial agents from moulds . We never tried that . Moulds are considered dirty , sources of potential infection , not cures . Yes , but they can be quite miraculous . And it will take a miracle for them to do it for me . - How is Wade ? - She doesn 't have much time . I 've never seen a Q progress so rapidly . That is because we are from different Earths . Different immunities . I feel so weak , Quinn . I 'm responsible , bringing you here , causing you so much suffering . Don 't blame yourself . Who else ? Because of me , the woman I love more than life itself is going to die . - You do ? - Of course I do , angel . I always have . I don 't want to die , Quinn . It 's me . But I 'm healthy . - Quinn ? - I 'm here . It 's so strange . Just hang on . We 're gonna make it . Did you find Dr. Stanley ? She didn 't make it , man . Optimally ... you want to introduce the antibiotic directly into the bloodstream ... either through a syringe or IV . Unfortunately , those resources are beyond us . Now what are you doing ? When I was a boy , my mother used to give me penicillin in a cherry syrup . Essentially water , sugar and flavouring . Do you really think it 's gonna work ? Frankly , Mr. Brown , I have no idea . Right . Why you ? There are hundreds of people here every bit as sick , sicker . Mr. Mallory , I am touched by your belief in my abilities . However , I should point out ... that there are three possible outcomes to my drinking this . One , it may do nothing . Two , it may cure . Three , it may kill . Bottoms up . If you don 't mind , I think I want to lie down . He 's burning up . Get him to a bed . Where 's the cab driver ? Over here , sir . Show us . Now , or I 'll see to it you get the Q. Let 's go . You all right ? You said you and the doctor lady , you were friends ? We were in med school together . We were lovers then . We would 've been lovers again if not for the Q. You , too ? Yeah , me , too . It was just a matter of time . And your friends ? There 's no change . And if we don 't slide out of here in 12 minutes , we never will . The doctor , he 's made up a bottle of the Professor 's mould juice . It 's ready to go , just in case . The fever 's broken . Oh , boy . Bring me that bottle . You 're okay . Rather confirms one 's opinion ... that biology is what you do if you haven 't got the maths for real science . Let 's move it ! Until you learn to calibrate your own doses ... I 'd suggest a large quantity initially ... followed by smaller doses every six hours for three days . Go to seven days if you absolutely have to , but no longer than that . CHC , nobody move ! Right there , stay right there ! Tear this place apart . I want him alive . Run ! This way ! All of you , against the wall ! Get her up . Go ! Move ! This way . Right up those stairs . Come on . How long ? Under a minute . Work , damn you . It 's Quinn , get him . Wrong Quinn , Dr. Morton . He was telling the truth . There 's no cure . There is now . It 's called penicillin , and I 'll be damned if I let you have it . Don 't be stupid , Quinn . You 're a wanted man . I could kill you right now and take it . Hold your fire . But you can 't control it , can 't keep it just for the rich . We know how to make it . We 've told other red-eyes in other zones . It 's over for you , the surgeon general , and everything you stand for . Three , two , one . Get back . Come on , get ready ! You did what you could for this world , now slide ! Give them hell ! Quinn ? I had the strangest dream . It wasn 't a dream . Am I going to be okay ? You 're going to be fine . You look so happy . I am happy . Everyone 's getting healthy again . We really made an impact now . We brought the people on the last world a cure . No matter what happens from here on in ... sliding made a difference . Get some rest . How is she ? A lot better . She just went back to sleep . Did you tell her about the cannibals ? No . Why stress her out ? She went through enough on the last world . Who do you suppose they 're going to eat first ? I suppose the young are more tender . Age before beauty . That 's a universal tenet . Don 't look at me . I 'm just a Chicken McNugget . You 're the Quarter Pounder .

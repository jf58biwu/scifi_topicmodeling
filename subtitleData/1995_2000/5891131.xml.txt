 Nina ! This needs to go out right away ! - What 's so urgent ? - It 's the phone company survey . I 'm very satisfied with my service . Nina ! - Mail this . - I 'll do it on my way out . - I 've got a blind date . - Well , that 's exciting . Why , is he driving ? It doesn 't matter . You 'll have to cancel . We have too much work to do . Why now ? You haven 't done any work in two days . I know . And now I 'm paying for it . If you want , you can invite your blind date here and tell him it 's a disco . That 's the best I can do . Can 't this wait until tomorrow ? No , Nina . You 're paid to do my bidding . - I was never paid to work for you . - What ? I am Dr. Albright 's assistant . When you showed up , they doubled my workload , and the only raise I got was the privilege of working for you . I think you 're starting to take that privilege a little for granted . You know , you 're right . I don 't deserve you . I quit . - What ? - Nina , you can 't quit . I need you . Let her go ! I guarantee you 'll never work in this town again . I 'm still working for Dr. Albright . I 'm just quitting you . Oh , no . No , no . No , that 's not how it works . We 're a package . You quit one of us , you quit us both . - Isn 't that right , Mary ? - See you in the morning , Nina . Ha ! Harry , I have great news . You 're going to be my new assistant . Whoa ! Assistant high commander Harry . - I knew this day would come . - No , Harry , my office assistant . You 'll find me to be an easy person to work for . My demands are simple . Simply someone who understands that working for me is in and of itself a reason to live . Well , It seems like I should be paying you . I considered that , but it 's impossible . You 'll be making virtually nothing . You 'll only have to perform the most basic of tasks . - You 've sent out mail before . - Nope . - Well , you 've stapled before . - I have not . Well , surely you 've used a paper clip . You mean those cotton things you put in your ears ? How many fingers am I holding up ? - Two . - You 're hired . Have some tea . Um ... there 's no tea in here . It 's pink tea , and it 's good tea . Kid , did you fall off the jungle gym or what ? What 's going on ? I 'm watching Dubcek 's illegitimate grandkid . - You 're late for tea . - Sorry . There 's no actual tea , right ? It 's pink tea , and it 's good tea . - The cake is pink , too . - The cake is pink , too . All right , maybe this is tea , but this is definitely not cake . Hi , Harry . What are you doing here ? I work here . Oh , you 're Dick 's new assistant . Yes , sir , I 'm the new guy . You know , at first , no one likes the new guy . People are threatened by the new guy , but other people are secretly attracted to the new guy . Hello , Mr. Dr. Solomon , Sir . Welcome back . " Welcome back . " Harry , unlike Nina , you are a gentleman . Here are your mail and your messages . I 've already taken care of the first two , and I restocked your stationery . - Thank you , Nina . - Harry , did I get any phone calls ? Oh , yes . It rang repeatedly . And , um ... who called ? Well , I don 't know . I 'm not clairvoyant . Of course not . But I 'm sure you filed my midterms . No ... but I did pre-lick all your stamps ... and I have placed them here on your filing cabinet for your convenience . Nice work , Harry . Now , when I want to mail a letter , I 'll just steam , scrape , and tape . So , anyway , she looks at me , and she says , " it 's pink tea , and it 's good tea . " Oh , that 's so sweet . I 'm not done with the story . It was imaginary tea . - Did she serve imaginary cake and muffins ? - Yes ! That 's so cute ! Is there some sort of imaginary bakery I 'm missing out on ? Oh , I always had Barbie tea parties . Oh , Barbie .. blond hair , tiny waist , legs up to her neck . - Who grows up to look like that ? - Yeah , who ? Yeah , who ? Why did everything seem possible at that age ? - Did you ever do your best friend 's hair ? - Yes . - Did you ever play dress-up ? - Wearing your mother 's clothes ? My brother Roy did that . - Ballet lessons ? ... ... oh , ballet ! Ballet ! On my recital night , I felt like Cinderella . Of course , I looked like one of the hippos in " fantasia . " Yeah , me .. no , I ... I looked cute . So , remember when we used to do ... what ? I can still remember taking my bow . My dad gave me a single white rose . I was his little princess . I want my childhood . Don 't we all ? - Tommy ! I 'm not coming out . I want to play Barbie . I feel like Tommy longstocking . That 's what I was going for . Now sit down . You 're ken . Okay , ken , so what do you want to do today ? Hmm , nothing that involves bending my knees or elbows . Okay , well , have a great day at work . I will . And while there , I 'll earn 25 % more than you because I 'm a man . That 's not fair . I 'm going to sue you in Malibu dream court . Don 't get your mink in a bunch , precious . Well , now you 're talking down to me . So now I have to rip your head off . You don 't play right . Baby . You forgot your head . Shut up ! So , Dick , you know what I overheard - at the water cooler ? - What ? That there 's this weird guy hanging around the water cooler . Dick , I 'm so glad you 're home . Read that . An application to little miss slippers ballet academy ? Yeah . I really need ballet lessons . - It 's imperative to my mission . - Can you get in ? - Do you have $ 150 ? - For this ? - Don 't make me beg . - No , lieutenant . Ple-eeeease ! All right ! Enjoy . I 'm going to be the best damn ballerina in that whole class ! Ooh ! My boyfriend drives a camaro . - Ooh ! Ooh ! - Harry , get up ! Yes , sir . - I want to talk to you about work today . - Oh ! It was the greatest day of my life . - It was a disaster . - I 'm glad it 's over . - Now I can stop pretending . - Hold it right there . There 's going to be some changes around here Harry . From now on , your desk will be your girlfriend . Her name will be Lucille . She will be the only woman in your life . Dick , I don 't like you like this . I don 't want you to like me because liking leads to loving , and loving leads to reproduction , and nobody reproduces with me ! - Understood ? - Yes , sir . Now get some sleep . Starting tomorrow , I 'm going to whip you into shape . Okay , but don 't touch the face 'cause I 'm a pretty man . Harry ! - My pencils are dull . - Talk to Dr. Albright instead . She 's riveting . Thank you , Harry . Sharpen these . That 's eight pencils at seven seconds each . And I want a progress report typed and on my desk in 50 seconds . Now go , go , go , go , go , go ! - Harry- - - Not now , Nina . I 'm on a deadline . Don 't you think Dr. Solomon 's making some unreasonable demands of you ? - Don 't be silly . - Harry ! Pee in this cup . I want to see if you 've been eating my mints . It 's fine . Dick 's just trying to whip me into a first-class assistant . Look , next time he starts to get on your case , you tell him to talk to the hand . Talk to the hand . - Well , I don 't know . - Harry , get out here .. now ! - Why is my out box full ? - Because the mail just came in . Why did you put it in the out box ? Because it came out of the mail . Why is my letter to the Dean in the in box ? The Dean won 't be back till tomorrow , but once he 's in , the in goes out . Things in the out box are going out . Well , why don 't we just get one big box ? That way we 'll put everything in there . - I mean , that 's 50 % less box . - That 's not how it 's done . Harry anyone with half a brain could do this job . What is your problem ? - Dick ? - Yes . Talk to the hand . Dick . Dick , look at me . Just try to keep your foot out of the egg salad . Look at me . Look what I learned Dick . Look . Ohhhhh ... .... Good . They taught you to squat . Money well spent . It 's not a squat ... . it 's a Plié . - What 's a Plié ? - A French squat . I 'm practicing for my recital . I 'm so excited . Everybody 's parents will be .. - Sally- - - Ooh , Tommy ! Oh , Tommy , you are stylin ' . Yeah , thank you . Will you please fix what you 've done to my head ? No , but I will let you borrow some of my barrettes . Well , that 'll look better . Dick ? I cannot wait for you to see the recital . I do a pirouette at the end . and the teacher says I look like a drunk bear . I 'll be there . Look at me , damn it ! I 'm your little princess ! Aw ! You look beautiful ! Thank you . Come on , Tommy . - I need you for the pas De deux . - What the hell ? - Harry , come watch me practice ! - Sorry , Sally . I have to sit here and silently glare at Dick . Am I going to have an emotional outburst , - or are you ? - You just did . - I did not ! - Ah-ha ! Harry , I hired you to replace Nina , but instead she 's turned you into her sassy doppelgänger . - Is that right ? - That 's right . You think so ? - I do . - Well you know what ? - What ? I 'm not taking it anymore . The carnival is leaving Dicksville . - I quit ! - You can 't quit . You 're fired . No-Ooo ! I 'm sorry things didn 't work out , but best of luck in your future endeavors . - Okay , see you tonight . - All right . Does this mean you 've come to your senses , and you 're going to apologize to Nina ? No , I will never come to my senses . I don 't need Nina . I don 't need Harry . I don 't need anybody . From now on , I 'm going to be my own assistant . Hello . Yes , I 'll be at the seminar . I don 't know about Dr. Solomon . Hold on a second . Dick ? Transfer it to my assistant , please . Okay . Dr. Solomon 's line . Who 's calling , please ? Uh ... I 'll ask him . The seminar ? Yes . I 'll ask him and get back to you this afternoon . - Dr. Solomon 's line . Who 's calling , please ? Hold on , please . I 'll transfer you . This is Dick Solomon . How can I help you ? No , no , no , you want Dick Sullivan in the English department . Transfer you ? I 'm already doing the job of two men . Next time , pick up a phone book , you moron ! - Dick , I think your phone 's ringing . Dick Solomon 's line . Who 's calling ? This is Luella from the Dean 's office . Please tell Dr. Solomon we need copies of all past purchase orders for the past 18 months . Uh , uh ... purchase orders ? Uh , yes , I dropped them off this morning . You never dropped those off ! You lie ! How do you know ? You weren 't even there . I can tell just by looking at you . I can 't work like this . Obviously not . Such mistrust ! Well , get out , then ! Fine ! I will ! Not so easy , is it , Dick ? On the contrary . All I have to do now is ... take Dr. Solomon 's exam to his 10 : 00 class . There 's only one here . I have 30 students . Well , that 's funny . They usually duplicate themselves . No , wait . Nina always made the copies . Oh , Nina made the copies , huh ? Then I can make the copies . I 'll just take this paper and walk out this door and turn to the , uh ... - the right . - Yes , I knew that . And then walk right into the , uh ... third door on the left . Don 't patronize me . It says " xerox " on it . Obviously . Okay . I put this under here , press this , enter the number " 30 , " and start . Piece of cake . " Paper jam " ? Okay , fine . I just press this , open this , remove the paper , and press this and " start . " " Now see key operator . " Well , that 's me . I 'm operating the keys . Me ! Damn you ! I 'm going to press " cancel . " Is that what you want ? - ' Cause I 'll do it . I 'll press it . - Stop it ! Damn you ! I 'm going to beat you with your own toner cartridge ! There 's my daddy . There 's my daddy . Dick ? Dick ? Her daddy 's not here . Her daddy 's a bad man . Dr. Solomon ! What happened to you ? - Oh , Nina , I was so ... - Oh , no , no , no , no ! Uh-uh ! I thought I didn 't need anyone , but I do . I need you . - Get off the carpet . - Why ? Don 't sit there . Nina . Nina , your place is beautiful . Oh , no ! But where are your file cabinets , your pencil sharpeners , your office furniture ? You think the only Nina that you see exists in the office ? You 're wrong . There 's another Nina . Will she work for me ? You don 't respect me . If you want me to work for you , I need your respect . Nina ... I respect you . - I don 't believe you . - What do you want me to do ? - Crawl on my hands and knees ? - Oh no ! Get up ! No , you respect- - okay , I 'll come back . - Oh , Nina , thank you ! I 'll see you at the office . Gypped . All I wanted was a normal childhood , but Dick just couldn 't let me have one . I felt so humiliated . I bet when you looked out into that audience and you didn 't see Dick there , - you felt like your heart was torn out . - Yeah . - And you felt betrayed and alone . - Uh-huh . And now you 're probably pretty much damaged for life , - and you 'll never trust anyone ever again . - Exactly . Yeah . Well , congratulations , Sally . You 've just taken your first step into childhood . - I have ? - Yeah . And now you take all this emotional damage and let it feed your adult neuroses . And the best part is that if you ever kill a guy or balloon up to 400 pounds , you get to blame Dick . Yeah . Tommy ! Sally ! Oh ! Sally , I am so sorry I missed your recital . Yeah , you did . Thanks , Dick . It 's my pleasure . - What for ? - You 've given me the most precious gift of all- - emotional baggage . Thanks . - You 're welcome . - Now I gotta go eat . I 'm sorry , Harry . I thought I didn 't need anyone . I thought I could do everything by myself . It turns out I was wrong . I do need someone , just not you . Well , it takes a big man to admit that . I guess it just goes to show you , you can 't work with your family . But , technically , we 're not a family . We 're more like co-workers . Well , it just goes to show you can 't work with your co-workers . Isn 't that the motto of the postal service ? Okay , this is how it works . - You put the paper in there . - I did that . - Press this button . - I did that . Right .. - Paper jam . - Not a problem . - Pull this out . - I did that . - Press this button . It 's not working . What is wrong with this ? ! Damn it ! Stupid ! Stupid ! The other side . Harder .

 My name is John Fitzgerald Byers . I was named after our 35th president , and I keep having this beautiful dream . In my dream , the events of November 22nd , 1963 , never happened . In it , my namesake was never assassinated . Other things are different , too , in my dream . My country is hopeful and innocent ; young again . Young in spirit . My fellow citizens trust their elect officials , never once having been betrayed by them . My government is truly " of the people , by the people , for the people . " All my hopes for my country , for myself ... all are fulfilled . I have everything a person could want : home and family and love . Everything that counts for anything in life ... I have it . But the dream ends the same way every time . I lose it all . The game is Texas Hold ' Em , gentlemen . Bring your wife ? You think I 'm sitting here , I 'd bring my wife ? Dumb ass brought his wife . 'Cause I 'm the man ; I say I 'm playing poker , I play poker . Meanwhile , your wife is back in Plano , boinking the mailman . - What 's your name again ? - Funston . Stewart Funston . You bring a little lady , Stewart ? - Not married . - Smart man , hundred . - You 's guys come to this every year ? Def-con ? - Every year . Ah , fold . - Wouldn 't miss it . - Yeah . Out ! So , you guys , uh , working on anything interesting these days ? Same old black ops crapola . You know what it 's like . Hey , we 're doing some neat stuff with neutron bombardment . Yeah , you can cook somebody 's brain in their skull , like hard-boiling an egg . It 's neat stuff . Speaking of crapola ... fold . Thank you . Oh ... a man of distinction . - So you in , Mr. Funston ? - Yeah . Looks like it 's just ... you and me . Another 200 . I 'll see your 200 and raise you one ... thousand . - He 's buying the pot stew . - Three clubs showing ... could be a flush . One thousand . And I raise you ... one thousand . The stones he has ... I see you work for Conglomerate . You guys make a great AE-135 unit . Oh man ... don 't freak ... don 't freak . I 'm on it . AE-135 ... Bingo . 442 J-stroke , A-135 air conditioning units for B-2 bombers . - Talk air conditioners . - Oh yeah , the AE-135 is a beauty . Keeps the B-2 's frosty , can practically see your breath . - How 'd you get all the bugs out of it ? - Ah , you know , trade secrets . Oh , come on , Stewart . You 're among friends . Seriously , how 'd you get past the delamination thing ? Delamination ... - Searching . - Oh , uh , I 'm sorry . I 'll see your thousand and raise you all you 've got . Systems tests , error rates ... nothing . Stall ' em . And fold ! You wanna know how we fixed the delamination problem ? We subcontracted the whole damn thing to the Japanese , then triple-billed the government . Same thing we always do . Queen-high flush . King-high . Al , call security . Have them pick up Mr. " Funston " here . - And his partner . - Delamination ... - ... you made that up ? - My advice to you , " Stewart , " or whatever your name really is ; poker is not your game . Hey man , you wanna thunderdome , let 's go . Three thousand dollars ... I told you to fold . It should have been me in there playing , why does Byers get to do the undercover ? 'Cause this ain 't Woodstock . Did we at least get some usable prints off the drink glasses ? What , are you kidding ? We had to leave them all behind . - How we gonna salvage this ? - We 're not . This convention 's a bust . Five days and three grand invested and we got bupkiss to show for it . Who was that player , anyway ? The guy who made us , he wasn 't wearing a convention badge . - Nobody ever said his name . - I think he 's worth looking into . CIA , open up . - Jimmy and Timmy . - Hey . Where were you guys today ? - Around . - Oh yeah ? Maybe snooping for some hot 411 ? - On the sneak tip ? - Maybe ... - Yeah , well maybe we were too . - And maybe we got some . Well maybe we did too . Ah , we got bupkiss . Buncha tight lipped defense contractors . Yeah , well I 'm gonna go way out on a limb here and say , it 's the t-shirt . Yeah , maybe both of you could wear one that says " I 'm stupid . " You just don 't get it , man . This says that I 'm on to them . This says that I comprehend the military industrial power dynamic . That 's what this whole thing is about ; wetworks , political assassination . - That 's their theme for this year . - Where did you hear that ? Oh yeah , like I 'm gonna reveal my sources . Suffice it to say , there 's some big new stealth assassination technology that 's supposed to be unveiled here . And I will be there , front row . - In the meantime , we 're hitting the restaurant . - Yeah , all you can eat lobster buffet . Free floor show ... plenty of boobage . You guys down ? You go ahead . I 'll catch up . - You 're one hell of a sad-sack , Byers . - Lay off about the poker game . No , that 's not what I 'm talking about . You 're the one who pushes the hardest for us to come to these conventions , then you get all squirrelly once we get here . You 're still looking for her , aren 't you ? - Susanne Modeski . - We met her at a convention . Ten years ago . In Baltimore . Now we both know what happened to her . - Most likely , she 's dead . - No . She was a brilliant scientist , too important to the government . Buddy , either way , I know we 're both hoping she 's in a better place than Las Vegas . Came on . All you can eat lobster . I almost won . Yeah , you and everyone else . Whoa , Byers , check this out . I 'm feeling lucky . - It can 't be . - What ? I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . Byers ... what the hell 's going on ? - Yeah , Scully . - Hey , Scully , it 's me . - Mulder , what time is it ? - 2 : 34am . - Listen , Scully , I need you on the next flight to Las Vegas . - Las Vegas ? Why ? It 's the Lone Gunmen . They 're onto something big . What , exactly ? It 's really important . Trust me . Yeah , I trust you , Mulder , it 's the Three Stooges I 'm not so sure about . Look , I can 't talk over an unsecured line . Please just get here . It 's an emergency . Okay . Okay , okay . Okay . - What if she calls him back ? - I trapped her cell number . If she calls him , it rings here . She 's gonna kick our ass . What do you need Scully for , anyway ? We 're up against agents of the government . We need our own government agent . And that would be Mulder . Why do you want just Scully ? - She 's gonna kick our ass . - Mulder 's too high profile . He 's virtually a household name to the black ops who kidnapped Susanne in Baltimore . Byers , I 've hacked into the hotel computers , Susanne Modeski 's not registered here . Are you sure you saw her ; are you absolutely , positively sure ? It was her . She 's here . I 've got to find her ! You 've gotta find some ice , you need a drink . Byers is trying to kill himself . Stop trying to kill yourself , Byers , it 's not deep enough . Come see what we got . Room 1066 , registered to our mystery poker player , one Grant Ellis . - New Mexico plates on his car . - Which come back listed " DoD motor pool . " Signed out from ... - Whitestone , New Mexico . - The advanced army weapons facility . Where Susanne worked . Ellis 's credit cards get billed directly to the Administrative Offices . He 's looking like he 's some kind of shadow government " poobah . " He brainwashed her . Well that 's what they do there ! The AH gas she developed . Call it psychological warfare , behavior modification , but it 's all about mind control . And undoubtedly , the process has been refined in the last decade . She ran from them , refused to take part in their tests , their crimes against the American people , there 's no way she would choose to be working for them now , working for that guy ... kissing him . Clearly he brainwashed her . I know a way to find out . I can 't get into the conference . The guard who threw me out is working the door . Let me go . CIA , freeze . That just keeps getting funnier . Where 's your girlfriend , Timmy ? Ah , out in the desert . There 's this naked chick who 'll teach you how to shoot machine guns . It costs 200 beans though , I told him he was a putz . What 's the matter , Byers ? Your bestest dog die ? What 's up ? Trying to figure out how to get into the Saguaro Room . Good luck . That 's the Holy Grail . Bug sweeps ... Casino security outside , government security inside . There 's no way any of us are getting in . I can get in there . And I will , too . When the time is right . Oh , go brush your hair , Michael Bolton . There 's a hole in their security , I 've got it all figured out . But there 's nothing worth hearing in there until tomorrow , when they unveil their new assassination technology . Again with the assassination technology . I need to get in there , Jimmy . I need to know what 's happening in there today . If you can really get in there , prove it . ... in combat can be established . Now , if you 'll take a look at the kill ratio productivity chart we 've provided for you and turn to ... - ... you 'll see that we 've experienced a marked ... - Oooh , there 's your fascist chickie , Byers . ... first and second quarterly periods of the previous year . But , before we 're tempted to pat ourselves on the back for this we have to remember these figures ... - Timmy ? - ... the current operations in Bagdad . These operations , originally budgeted for fiscal year ' 97 ... Damn ... Hold on ! Hold on ! You 're one of them ... You really screwed things up , Jimmy . - We had big plans for you . - Big plans ? Political assassination . I was right . I was right about the whole thing ! Every good plan needs a patsy . - Could you , uh , take this up , please ? - Sure . - Agent Scully . - Where 's Agent Mulder , I 've been trying to call him . He 's , uh , I think that his , phone 's messed up . He may be hard to reach for the next few hours , he suggested we work with you , bring you up to speed . By all means , bring me up to speed . Subject 's name is James Bellmont , over . - This way . - Oh , man . Jimmy . He just jumped ; no warning , no nothing . He just , dived right out in front of me . - Oh , God , it is Jimmy . - It 's not my fault . He was just standing there , and then he just dives under the bus . - This wasn 't a suicide . - You know this man ? What 's going on here ? Susanne , do you remember me ? John , what are you doing here ? I 'm here to save you . From what ? I don 't think you are yourself . I think that , uh , you 've been mistreated and confused , and , and , I 'm afraid that your , ... - ... your beliefs , your opinions , are no longer your own . - As in , I 've been brainwashed ? I don 't know what to tell you . I haven 't been . Your life may be in danger , Susanne . A friend of mine has just been killed . Murdered . What ? - And that man that you 're with ... - My fiance ? - I 'm sorry John , I , I think you better go . - No , wait . Wait . Ten years ago , I saw you thrown into a car . Kidnapped right in front of me . Did that not happen ? Did I just dream all of that ? It happened . But things got better . Sorry , buddy . That Susanne 's a popular girl . You 're absolutely sure you wanna be here for this ? Oh yeah . I 'm cool . Let 's just find out what killed him . Okay . James Bellmont , age 29 . Visual exam reveals injuries consistent with massive trauma . Multiple rib fractures with concomgent hemoraging , both internal and external . His spine is fractured and partially exposed . What if " they " did something to him ? You know , to make him pancake himself ? Who 's " they " ? You know , " them . " I 'll begin with the Y-incision . Langly , will you go over there and pass me the striker saw please , it 's right there on the counter . Are you okay , Langly ? Scully ? Scully . Wake up . Are you okay ? What happened ? I 'm thinking that you got a little queasy and took a header . You know blood and guts can bother some people . Yeah , I guess . You gonna be alright ? Sure , cutie . So ... you 're done with Jimmy ? Done , done , done . How do you roll this thing ? Scully ? What killed him ? My medical opinion ? - And that 's all you found ? - That 's all I know . Scully ? - What 'd you find out ? - Autopsy was negatory . Jimmy squished himself . And where is the scruptious Agent Scully ? She said she had something important to do . Man , she is seriously jetlagged . You got product already ? No , an earlier bird got the worm . ... it 's like they 're keeping tabs on us , watching us . Honey , you worry too much . The plan is still on schedule . Everything 's falling into place . We 've worked so long and so hard for this . It 's not her . They 're making her do this somehow . Buddy , now , I know something about the fairer sex . Trust me , you can bring a horse to water , but you can 't make her drink . - She would not marry that man . - You don 't know him like I do . How 'd you get in here ? One of you left this in my room . Grant Ellis saved my life . He 's saved the lives of thousands . I need to talk to you , John , I need to try and explain everything . C 'mon , let 's hit the slots . Watch your back . Mata Hari . You said something about a friend being murdered . Not that I can prove it . But I think he saw something he was not supposed to see at your conference . - You may be in danger . - I am . Always . So is Grant . I 've thought about this moment so many times . All the things I would say to you if I ever saw you again . And then there you were , at my door , and I ... They took me ten years ago . They did things to me . And it was like drowning every day ; under water , struggling to breathe , and one day , a hand broke the surface , reached down and pulled me up . I wanted it to be you , John . It was Grant . He worked for them on The Project . I didn 't trust him , not for years . Not until I realized that he was working against them in his own way ; stalling them , sabotaging their tests . He reminded me of you . - They 're just lucky I got a conscience . - How 's that ? If I unleashed my true kung-fu on this casino , I could break the bank within a week . And find yourself buried under six feet of desert dirt . - Hey guys . - Hey Timmy . I 'm sorry about Jimmy . Hey , Langly , the guys are all up in my room for a round of Dungeons and Dragons in honor of Jimmy . Lord Manhammer will be in attendance . I 'm gonna go play a little DD , uh , in memorium . That 's touching , man . - Scully ? - Aw , hey . Long time , no see . No , that 's not nice . I like Hickey . Cigarette ? You don 't smoke . But who 's got a match ? Well ... I just can 't decide who lights my fire . That 's it . Alright , you dandies , back off . This is Special Agent Dana Scully of the FBI . If you so much as touch her , you may be committing a federal offense . Come on , come on . We could have been stardust . Maybe next time . Hope you brought your wallet , my friend , just because this is a memorial ... game . What 's this ? Oh , we have got a game for you . Trust me , this is gonna work . - You didn 't tape this ? - No . Which means they surveilled us . They know our plans , they know everything . What is your plan ? To escape . This conference was our chance to slip out on the last day . Go public with our files , all our weapons research . We could finally make it happen this time . We 'd gathered up enough proof . The public is ready to believe now more than ever . They know everything . They 'll kill us , John ; Grant and me both . - Come on . - Hi . - Came on , settle down , settle down . - Okay , okay , okay , okay . I found Agent Scully-go-lightly holding court ... bar ! I 've never seen her drunk before ... God , this can 't be . She 's not drunk , look at this . - That was made by an injector gun . - Well , what the hell was she injected with ? ! It 's derivative of AH gas . AH , anoitic histamine , my latest creation . I could have developed it years ago , but I held off . I wasn 't about to let those bastards I work for get their hands on it . Grant thought that if we secretly developed a small batch , and then destroyed the notes , that we would have the proof we needed to go public . We 'd also have a weapon we could use against them . Who else has access to this anoitic histamine ? Grant and I are the only two people that ha that have the samples . - This will counteract the anoitic effect . - Hi , cutie . Just a little prick ... Bad trip ? Nah , she 'll be fine . She just needs to sleep it off . I don 't understand ; why would the government want to turn Scully into a bimbo ? That 's just a potential side-effect . Anoitic histamine impedes higher brain functions . - It promotes suggestability . - Mind control . Brainwashing . That explains Jimmy . They told him to commit suicide . And Scully . They made her forget her autopsy findings . But what is their larger purpose ? What are they planning ? Well , whatever it is , we better find out fast . Right on time . This is your weapon . All you do is pull the trigger . You will enter the Saguaro Room at 10 : 05am . This badge will give you access . Take a seat toward the back , and wait . At 10 : 15 , a break will be called . Rise , approach the target , and fire three shots . This brings us to the notion of acceptable risk . Of course , risk is defined as exposure , during both utilization and post-project evaluation . Now in a secure proving-ground , i.e. a domestic engagement , we have had great success . Now off-shore utilizations can afford a more comprehensive definition of acceptable risk . Proper target appraisal can provide a risk-free trial environment . A combination of political instability and lack of efficient infrastructure can offer a , uh , target area of nearly zero risk potential . - Authorized attendees only . - I 'm an FBI agent . Authorized attendees . Of course , risk management goes hand-in-hand with operational preparedness , and that happens to be our topic for the remainder of the session ... Al , I think this would be a good time to take a break , shall we ? Oh , yeah . Let 's take five everybody . Smoke ' em if ya got ' em . Oh my God . Somebody help her ... somebody ! - Susanne ... - Federal agent . Call for help . Winston Warbler , we need an ambulance , a woman 's been shot . - She 's bleeding , hurry . - We 're on our way . Who did this ? Who did this ! ? Shooter got away . Detain this man , get him outta here . Good work , party girl . I 'll take him from here . Wait a minute , where ... where ... where 're you taking me ? Susanne ? Can we have a moment , alone , please ? I 'll be fine . - We 'll be right down the hall . - Okay . Thanks for the tip . Big surprise , huh ? Since you programmed my friend to kill me . - No , Susanne , it wasn 't my idea . - You knew about it . You gave it to them . The AH . If I hadn 't thought to check Langly , if I hadn 't given him the antidote ... I don 't understand . Why save me ? Why save my life just to take it away ? - You know why . - You were done with me . - You had what you wanted . - " They " had what they wanted . The project was over . Honest to God , it wasn 't my idea . All those years you spent gaining my trust . You pretended that you loved me . What could they possibly give you for that ? What was it worth to you , Grant ? What was your price ? What did you get ! Life . They 'd kill me . Hello . I 'm so sorry , Susanne . County death records first , then the state tax rolls , come on ! Then the Clark County Morgue list that they misplaced the body . Yeah , Voltaire comidant . Why don 't you just zap me with the girly sting there and brainwash me again . I say do it , then we can make him cut his hair . Can you answer that ? Why me , she 's your little chickadee . Hurry up , come on . Come on in , Mata Hari . CIA , freeze . Let her go . Sure ... You know the best thing about killing you three ... I won 't have to dress like you anymore ... Oh , get him off me . Hi , cutie ... What do ya wanna do with him ? Police confirm an arrest has been made , this man Timothy Landau of Aldonaberta , New Mexico , has confessed to the murders of Grant Ellis and Susanne Modeski . - Both victims were government employees ... - Hello , Mulder ? Can you hear me ? - ... attending a conference in Las Vegas . - Hello , Mulder ? Can you hear me ? I 'm at the hotel . Where are you ? What do you mean , " what hotel , " Las Vegas . I 'm in Las Vegas , aren 't you ? You called me . What do you mean you didn 't call me ? Oh man , I am gonna kick their asses . Susanne Modeski is dead . Every computer in every county , state , federal office knows it . This is who you are now . Come with me . - You 'll be safer without me . - It doesn 't make a difference . - I told you , I 'm going public . - No , you 're not . You 've done more than enough . Leave it to us now , it 's what we do . It was meant for Grant . I want you to have it . Someday . So you wanna hit the slots ? You know , Byers , growing old with us ain 't so bad . Oh , shut up , Langly . You really want him to kill himself ? Got any quarters ?

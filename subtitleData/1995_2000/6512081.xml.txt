I got a plan . - This time tomorrow , Pam ... - Everything will be roses . Oh ... Dammit . I missed the meeting . Well , not yet . But only because it 's the longest in FBI history . - What are you doin ' here , then ? - I came looking for you . We took a five-minute break three minutes ago . Mulder , your cellphone 's not working . Did you oversleep ? Did you ever have one of those days you want to rewind and start over again ? Yes , frequently . But , I mean , who 's ... Who 's to say that if you did rewind it and start over , it wouldn 't end up the same ? So you think it 's all fate ? We have no free will ? No , I think that we 're free to be the people that we are . Good , bad or indifferent . - I think our character determines our fate . - All the rest is just preordained ? I don 't buy that . There 's too many variables . I meant to be on time to work today , but my water bed springs a leak , flooding my apartment and the one below me . So that makes me late . Then I gotta write a cheque to cover the damages , but I realise that that 's gonna bounce unless I deposit my pay . So now I gotta go to the bank , which makes me even later . Since when did you get a water bed ? I mightjust as easily not have a water bed , and then I 'd be on time . You might have stayed in medicine and not gone into the FBI , and then we would never have met . Blah , blah , blah . - Fate . - With every choice , you change your fate . Then let 's change yours . I will deposit your cheque . You gather your files , go to Skinner , give your report - before he takes it out on both of us . Endorsed my damn cheque stub ! Mulder ! - Don 't go in the bank today . - Excuse me ? Bernard 's in there . Please ... don 't go in the bank . - Do I know you ? - You pass me every day on the street . Every single day . This day . On your way to the bank . You go inside and everybody gets killed - you , your partner , Bernard . Everybody . - I pass you ... and then we 're dead . - Yes . Over and over . Only , last time , you looked at me like you knew me . Like you remembered . Please remember me . ( gunshot ) Don 't go . Drop your weapon ! - Drop it ! - I ain 't dropping ' nothin ' . You put yours down . - I 'll shoot her ! - What do you think I 'll do then ? Bernard ? That 's your name , right ? Bernard , she 's not dead . You 're not a murderer yet . You can end this the right way . Sir ... please ... Listen to them . Don 't hurt anybody else . A whole lot of police are comin ' _ You tripped the alarm . No ! ( explosion ) ( groans ) ( phone rings ) Yeah , I know . Yeah , I know . I ... I know already . I 'll pay for it . - ( thud ) - OW ! The cellular customer you are trying to reach is not ... - ( Pam ) Agent Scully . - Yes ? - Please . Don 't go inside the bank today . - The bank ? Cradock Marine , 8th Street branch , a block from here . Uh ... I 'm not following . Did you get separated from your tour ? I 'm here to see you . I 'm begging you , please don 't go this time . Don 't let Mulder go either . Um ... I 'm sorry ... Excuse me , miss . You 're not supposed to be in this area . If you walk in that bank , you 'll die . Both of you . ( scoffs ) Hey . I missed the meeting ? Huh ? No . No , we took a five-minute break about three minutes ago . Mulder , your cellphone 's not working . - Wow . That is so strange . - What ? I just got the sensation of deja vu . I 've been havin ' it all morning . - it 's fairly common . - Never to this degree . I mean , I woke up , I opened my eyes , I was soaking wet . It 's a long story , but I had the distinct sensation that I had lived that moment before . Well , you may have . Did you do a lot of drinking in college ? - What does it mean ? - Why does it have to mean anything ? Some Freudians believe the dej√© vu phenomenon to be repressed memories escaping the unconscious that represents a desire to , un , have a second chance , to set things right . - Set what kind of things right ? - Whatever 's wrong . It 's more likely that we 're talking about neurochemistry _ A glitch in the brain 's ability to process recognition and memory . - It doesn 't mean the memory 's authentic . - Yeah , but what if it were ? What if you 'd lived this moment before , and are living it again ? Yeah . So that I could right some wrong , or change fate . Right now I 'd say you 're fated to go to this meeting . No , actually , I 'm fated to go to the bank . Mulder ? What bank ? - Cradock , right down the street . - 8th Street . What ? S ... some woman stopped me in the hallway ten minutes ago . She knew both our names . She warned against either of us entering into the Cradock branch on 8th Street . She said that we 'd die . What did she look like ? Five-eight , thin , green eyes , dyed hair . Maybe you know her . Maybe it 's just somebody pulling a prank . I 'll use the ATM machine . I don 't wanna tempt fate . Next is federal crime projections . Who 's got the figures ? Right here . Um ... if you 'll all just bear with me one second . Federal crime projections ... - Do you remember me ? - You match the description . You 're the , uh , you 're the woman that gave a warning to my partner , aren 't you ? Uh ... have we met ? More times than I can count . Right here on this sidewalk . Usually you walk right by . You 'll pass a few minutes earlier , a few minutes later . Little details , they change . - But it always ends the same . - What always ends the same ? We keep having this conversation . We go inside the bank and we all die . That 's what you told my partner . Is ... is something going to happen inside the bank ? Is there gonna be a robbery ? Every time I tell you there will be a robbery , you run in there to stop it , and that 's when things go bad . Don 't you see ? We 're all in Hell . I 'm the only one who knows it . Something went very wrong on this day the first time around . Something got screwed up . Things didn 't end the way they were supposed to . And now it 's like a needle stuck in a groove . You 're saying this day repeats over and over again ? Until we get it right . Till my boyfriend doesn 't blow up that bank . I have tried everything to stop him . I 've hid his keys . I 've ... I 've drugged his coffee . I even called the police on it myself . He always gets here . He 's meant to . It 's you . It 's you and your partner every time . If it wasn 't for you , nobody would die . If it 's true , how come I don 't remember ? How come you 're the only one ? - That 's 50 times you 've asked me that . - What 's the answer ? I don 't know . I just do . Be glad you don 't _ Please ... you can stop this . You 're the variable . It has to be you . I have tried everyone else . All I 'm asking is you just walk away . .. that 's assuming these trends continue well into the coming year . Other DOJ projections estimate a larger - two to three per cent - drop in the overall homicide rate , versus the one to one-and-a-half per cent cited in the earlier Tanner study . - However , there 's some dispute that ... - Um , excuse me , Agent Arnold . - Where 's Scully ? - She just left . I sent her to look for you . Excuse me . Everybody , face down ! You know what this is ! Give me the money ! Oh , God ! Oh , God ! You ! On the floor ! ( woman ) Oh , God ! You 're gonna shoot us ? God ! He 's gonna ... - Shut up ! - He 's gonna shoot us ! Please don 't kill us ! - Please don 't do this ! Please don 't ! - Shut up ! Give me the money ! - Don 't shoot us ! Don 't shoot us ! - Dammit ! Shut up ! Hey ! Hey ! Get your hands up where I can see ' em ! Do it ! Do it now ! ( Mulder ) Drop your weapon ! ( laboured breathing ) ( whispering ) He 's got a bomb .

You 're extraordinarily late for it . Bank 's down the street . Cover for me , will ya ? ( car horn honking ) We good , Pam ? - Pam ? - I know . You just gotta go pick somethin ' up . No biggie . What is with you ? Why are you always in a mood ? Cos nothing ever changes . Things are gonna change . You wait and see . I 'll be ten minutes . Wait here for me . - ( Bernard ) Hey , you need to watch it ! - ( man ) You watch it ! - Do I know you ? - Do you ? - Yeah , you just look really familiar to me . - Do I ? Yeah . No ? All right , I 'm sorry to bother you . May I help the next in line , please ? ( softly ) He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb .

Excuse me . Agent Scully ? ( Scully ) Excuse me . It 's Agent Mulder . He said it 's urgent . - Mulder , where are you ? - I 'm at the bank . Yeah , I know where you are . What 's taking so long ? Scully , I need you to do something for me right now . - IVla 'am , will you come with me ? - Why ? - Just come with me , please . - What 's this about ? My partner said you 'd know . Take it . I 'm a federal agent . I don 't want us all to die in here . - What are you talking about ? - You 've got a girlfriend outside in the car . And you 've got a bomb . Something very bad is gonna happen here today . And I want you to know that I 'm not gonna let it happen . But if you walk out that door right now , I 'm not gonna stop you . - You 're in charge here , Bernard . - You 're damn right . You can change your fate . Everybody down ! You know what this is ! - No ! Oh , God ! - Get down ! If you don 't believe me , ask her . - Drop it ! - Get away from her , Pam . This isn 't gonna work ! - Drop it now ! - You drop it . - Listen to me . - Get her outta here ! You 're dooming her . You 're making her live this day over and over . Her , you , me , all of us !

( phone rings ) - Yeah . - Mulder , it 's me . - Oh , I 'm late again , aren 't I , Scully ? - No , not yet . But Skinner wants to see us as soon as possible . He 's asking for our report on the robbery yesterday . I 'll be there in an hour . - I 'd like to hear it , too . - Well , you were there , Scully . That 's not what I mean . You still won 't explain what happened . How you knew that Bernard Oates was strapped with explosives . Call it a feeling . And it was also a feeling that he had an accomplice waiting in the car ? I don 't think she was an accomplice . I think she was just tryin ' to get away . - Are you OK ? - I 'll be there in an hour . Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi

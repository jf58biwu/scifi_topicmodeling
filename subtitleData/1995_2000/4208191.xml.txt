 Subtitles by demonseye We 're running out of time . We have polluted and peopled this planet to the brink of extinction . We are destroying our world at a suicidal pace . We need a pollution revolution . And it 's not going to be easy because the world is addicted to petroleum . We have limited resources and we go to war to protect them . We need a new technology and this technology can 't be sold . It must be given away ... to everyone . We are in sight of a dream . There is a solution . The answer ... is all around us ... right here . Water . H2O . Two parts hydrogen , one part oxygen . There is enough energy in this glass of water to power the city of Chicago for weeks . It 's the ... hydrogen we 're after . This is what happens when we burn it . It 's perfectly clean . And you can burn it when you want to , in a car , in a turbine , or in your own basement power supply , right next to your water heater . But what if we could release this energy efficiently ? We will transform the world . Maybe we start to put an end to war . Of course , we ... have to make it work first . Morning ! Hey , James , how you doin ' ? Hey , Eddie , cold enough for ya ? It 's never too cold . Hey , Lu ! You want me to set up ? Yeah . Right away , uh ? - Hello , Mr. Shannon . - Hi . Mr. Shannon , the big man , how are you ? Tessidy ... Alistair . - You have a good trip ? - Very good , thank you . - Paul . - Hi , young fellow . Can I get you some , uh , coffee or something ? No , no , I 'm fine , thank you . I turn on the laser here . Now , we should focus the laser in the center of the bubble . - So , how 's it going ? Tell me . - You didn 't get my fax ? No , I got the fax . I just didn 't understand all the figures . We need to control the bubble . Yeah , the reaction regulators isn 't working . - I do believe this . But ... - I know . Eddie , did you computer-model your work last night ? No , I didn 't . I was , uh , too busy building it . We sustained fusion for 4.6 milliseconds . Stable ? It 's stable ... for 4.6 milliseconds . But , let me show you . Come . Come . The power input and the power output is fine at this stage . Now , the power output drops to nothing at stage three , so what happened ? - Paul ! - Yeah , okay . All right , I gotta go . Cross your fingers , everyone . Good luck . Mr. Chen , initiate laser . Initiate laser . Hydrogen separation in progress . Initiate hydrogen burn . Two million Kelvin and rising . Shut it down ! It 's unstable . Shut it down . We learned something very important today . We found another way that didn 't work . We need to keep our minds open and try again . Alistair . - It 's working . - Is it stable ? Yeah , it 's stable . - Completely stable . - My God ! - We go tomorrow . - Tomorrow , Alistair . Lily , talk to me . Temperature , gas flow , acoustic drive steadied . - The regulator has stabilized the reaction . - Lucasz . My spectrometer shows stable hydrogen production . We 're getting more out than we put in . Well , I think you 'd better ... sell your utility stocks . - Whoa , Mr. Chidi ! - Unbelievable ! You 're going to be famous . Thanks for everything . The share . We want more money now ! Thanks for your trust . - Stay on beat , for Christ 's sake . - I got it , I got it ! Here comes crazy Eddie ! Eddie , congratulations . I really am quite impressed . - Congratulations . - Thank you . I never agreed to keep anything from anyone . You know how I feel about it . That used to be cool . Mandela will get this information , China will find out ... You can go wherever you like , but don 't move an inch . I can 't begin to tell you what could happen if we ... This is no time to be talking seriously . No , no , no , everybody 's waiting . Come on , Alistair ! Okay , everybody . - Holy shit , we did it ! - Holy shit , we did it ! Your battery 's dead . There 's ice all over the dashboard . All over the dashboard ... - Come on . - How do I get home ? I 'll get you home . We 'll take my bike . Oh , yes , please ! - Where do you live ? - I live in England . No , sorry . Sorry , sorry . I live on-on Kimbark and 54th . - Kimbark and 54th ? - Mm-hm . Oh , no , we can 't . You 'll freeze to death . Um ... Let 's take a taxi . - Taxi , huh ? - Uh-huh . We got a better chance of getting picked up by a UFO . Mr. Chen , upload everything . I want to get it all on the Internet tonight . We 're gonna be waking up a lot of people . You 're damn right . Really wake ' em up . Barkley ... We don 't have the computer model real ready . We have the frequency . We 'll send it to you in ... one hour . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . In one hour . Where you going ? Chen ? - Here we are . - This is Alistair 's house . Isn 't he sweet ? He lets me live on the third floor . Mm . It 's this ... way . Is ... is this what drunk is ? - You 've never been drunk ? - Ooh . I 've never been this . Lily 's too serious . She 's no fun . I think you 're fun . Good night , Lily . Wow ! Alistair ! Alistair ! Chen ! Chen ! Chen ! Get ready . Shannon . - Paul ? Alistair 's dead . - Eddie ? I found him on the lab floor . - He was murdered . - What ? Just what happened here and what caused the explosion last night is still unclear . University officials say that this mill site had been converted into a site for the experimental production of hydrogen fuel . Now , University officials say that 's not supposed to be dangerous . One of the questions , of course , that law enforcement officials are trying to determine is whether foul play was involved . As we indicate , that 's unconfirmed . But we can confirm this . An FBI agent has said , and it was reported by a spokesperson for the Bureau , that there was no nuclear device that went off last night . There was no atomic explosion . As far as you know , all your people accounted for , Mr. Shannon ? Miss Sinclair ? Is this all the group ? Alistair didn 't come home last night . Lu Chen isn 't anywhere to be found . I phoned him and he 's not anywhere . I started CPR . Um ... I checked for breath , there was no breath . I checked for pulse , there was no pulse . I ... continued with the CPR . Have the locals move the perimeter back about 1,000 ft . You got it . Find me a friendly federal judge in the next two minutes . I want wiretap orders , search warrants on everyone that worked here . - I want it ten minutes ago . - All right . Inspector Ford , we understand you 've taken charge of this investigation . Can you tell us why is the FBI involved ? Ma 'am , we just had eight city blocks disappeared . The President of the United States talked to my boss at this morning . He wants answers . Tell me about Eddie . What do you know ? Does he drink , do drugs ? No . He 's just a machinist , an undergraduate ... working to get his degree . That 's the undisclosed cost of our cheap fossil fuel . Fossil fuel . Who 'd be interested in this technology ? Cheap , clean , abundant energy ? Who wouldn 't ? When you left the celebration , who was still there ? Eddie . So , Eddie , tell us again why you came back ? I 'd come back for my bike . You say you 'd just returned from taking Miss Sinclair home . That 's right . Her car wouldn 't start , so I took her home on the bus . Oh , what is your relationship with Miss Sinclair ? Uh ... We work together . I 'm a machinist , she 's a physicist . I was ... hired by dr . Chen . And who is dr . Chen ? He was dr . Barkley 's ... project manager . - Why did he hire you ? - Because I 'm a physicist . Gentlemen , what have we got here ? Sergeant ? I think we have Mr. Chen in the wind . Nick , what did you find ? Yeah , it looks like he did his packing with a shovel . This guy was in a hurry . Dr. Barkley expressed interest in a specialist in sonoluminescence . He knew about dr . Chen . So , with the help of some friends in the State Department , I managed to get him over here and onto the team . Oh , you have friends in the State Department ? We have influential members of the board . Really ? Who 's on the board of your foundation ? Ford . Various scientists ... Yeah . ... and industrialists . Your dr . Chen is missing . Any idea where he might be ? He may be dead . We have no comment . You 're Eddie . Eddie Kasalivich ! Reporters are saying that ... they killed him . Who killed him ? Who killed the man , Eddie ? You were there before the explosion . What happened ? What are you looking for ? We 're just examining the articles on his desk . I don 't see how you 're entitled to do that . Annette ! They have a search warrant , but they have no respect for a man 's life . I want a full inventory . These are very important and extremely sensitive scientific papers . We 'll give you a copy of everything we have , sir . Signed , if you please ! For two decades , doctor Barkley , an extensive Renaissance genius ... I have to go over to the university 's legal counsel . I can 't stay here tonight . Among the missing is dr . Lu Chen , who the authorities are still looking for , and may be considered a suspect in the incident . - This is insane . - They 're going to think he did it . Oh , no . - What is it ? - It 's from ... dr . Lu Chen . He ... wants me to bring the rest of the information , all ... all the data and-and meet him at the rendezvous in Shanghai . I 'm being framed . What are you talking about ? - This isn 't from Chen . - How do you know ? - He-he doesn 't write like this . - Well , then who sent it ? I don 't know who sent it . Where 's Chen ? You don 't think he did it ? Let 's , uh ... Let 's get outta here , okay ? Can I help you ? Oh , I sure hope so . We 're here and we 're looking for Mr. Paul Shannon . Oh , uh , he 's-he 's on the phone right now . - Excuse me ... - Excuse me , you can 't go in there ! You can 't go in there ! There 's an awful lot of explaining to do . I 'll call you back . What now , agent Ford ? Just received Eddie Kasalivich 's file . Seems he had to leave college for disciplinary reasons . He blew the hell out of the lab . I mean , this is a coincidence , Lord Almighty ! You knew this kid was kicked out of school ? He resigned . Under some pressure , wouldn 't you say ? There was some pressure , yes . - Kid blows up a science building ... - Minor structural damage , agent Ford . Interesting experiment . Might have worked . Didn 't you think this , uh , piece of information - was important for us to have ? - I don 't see the relevance . You don 't see some small connection here ? No , agent Ford , I don 't . How 's this ? The CIA tells me that Chen might be involved in espionage . This Kasalivich guy has a past that makes me nervous . And Miss Sinclair is receiving faxes inviting her to a rendezvous in mainland China . - Really ? - Really . What 's wrong ? That 's my place . Let 's get outta here . - A real shithole , uh ? - How much did they say this guy make ? Not much , he 's a student machinist . - Hey , Sheen , what are you doin ' outside ? - Stay warm , buddy ! Got a loft for your mother , Doyle . Very artistic . - Who 's upstairs ? - Everybody . Half the city . - Wanna check that cabinet ? - Yeah , I got it . Jesus Christ , you could put together almost anything in this place . I want all this . All right ! We need a total lab workup . It 's a ... neutron cappuccino machine . Oh , don 't touch it . - Hey , Nick ! What 's this ? - It 's a transmitter . - It 's a burst transmitter . - What 's it do ? It sends massive amounts of information by satellite ... probably to China . Ah ! Nick ! Doyle ! Calls flooded into the University Of Chicago from all over the world , asking for word about the professor . Expressions of concern came from the Royal Academy in London , from Paris , Moscow and all parts of the compass . But at the same time , critics say that Barkley was a Utopian dreamer . They point out that the research he was involved with was obviously far more dangerous than he realized . Paul . Shannon ! What 's going on ? - Tell me about the money , Eddie . - What money ? The 250,000 the FBI found in your loft . I don 't know what you 're talking about . - What about the burst transmitter ? - Transmitter ? ! Think hard . Jesus ... I suppose you 're not in secret communication - with dr . Chen in mainland China ? - It wasn 't Chen . - Do you have an attorney ? - No . I 've got a good one . He 'll negotiate your surrender to the authorities . Come upstairs with me . We 'll call him . - Surrender ? - They 'll wanna talk to you . - I 'm not going . - What do you mean you 're no going ? - We didn 't do anything , Mr. Shannon . - The FBI will figure that out . Someone 's settin ' us up . I 'm not going to the cops until I know more about what 's goin ' on . Eddie , you run , and you 'll have every gun-carrying idiot in the country looking for you . Look , talk to this ... lawyer . We 'll go somewhere safe - and we 'll wait till you work it out . - Where ? Maggie 's . We 'll go to Maggie 's . Okay . You got any money ? - 40 bucks . - All right . Here . And when you get there , stay put . Don 't use the phone . I 'll call you . Why is this happening , Paul ? It 's gonna be all right , Eddie . I promise you . Wait here five minutes , then leave . What do we know about this Shannon ? Illinois Institute of Technology , Georgetown Law , Kennedy School of Government , uh ... Worked for several aerospace giants . Three years in Washington during the Reagan administration ... - Oh , yeah ? Doing what ? - DARPA . Defense Advanced Research Project Administration . Jesus ! Who the hell is this guy ? Not just someone that runs a foundation , huh ? There 's a train at 8 : 40 at the Union Station to Williams Bay . - That 's where Maggie lives . - Are you sure you can trust her ? We used to live and work together . This is the Channel 32 special report . We go live to the Federal Office Building in downtown Chicago . Sorry to keep you all waiting . As you know , it 's been a ... a very long and a ... a very trying day for us all . Material witness warrants have been issued in the northern district of Illinois for professor Lu Chen , dr . Lily Sinclair , and Edward Kasalivich . Oh , my God ! Anybody with knowledge of their whereabouts is asked to please contact the Chicago office of the FBI immediately . Eddie , what are we going to do ? We can 't leave here together . Get a cab outside . Buy two tickets . Williams Bay . I 'll meet you on the track . - Be safe . - You too . There are allegations his body was found ... Hey , Mike , did you see that guy ? Union Station , please . Hey ! Hey , you ! Come here . Hey ! Hey ! Officer ! Hey , buddy ! Hey , you ! I got ' im ! I got ' im ! It doesn 't make any sense . If Kasalivich is just a simple pawn , what 's he doin ' with a burst transmitter in his den ? What ? I mean , the guy is transmitting to someone . Right ? - Unbelievable . - What ? CPD 's chasing Kasalivich down Michigan Avenue . Stay where you are ! He 's gonna fall ! Get me a boat under there ! What the hell 's he doin ' ? He 's goin ' over ! Hey ! We got guys downstairs ? - What did I tell you ? Just went over . - Stairs , over here . Let 's get on board . Listen . How do we get him down ? Officer , if I move that bridge , he 's gonna fall . - Can he get out from a lower level ? - Leads down to the gear room . - Bring the bridge down . - He 'll be delayed . He 'll get crushed . Ten-four . Bring it down slow . - We 're bringing the bridge down . Now ! - Get over there ! Hey ! What 's happening ? Why did it stop ? Right . I want this cleared . All right , let 's go ! Do a search ! You two , outta here ! Let 's go ! Move it , move it ! Go ! Go ! Right now ! Go ! You ! Back this thing outta here . Come on ! Go ! So , where the hell is he , Leon ? Amtrak northbound no . 343 , now leaving on track 19 for Fox Lake , Wallburgh , Williams Bay , Jamesfield and Madison . My God ! I didn 't think I was gonna make it . - Watch your step . - Thank you . Don 't worry , he 'll be here . You were right . - What took you so long ? - The bridge was up . All aboard ! - Here you go . - Thanks . Thank you . Are you sure she 's going to be up this late ? Yeah , she 's , uh , usually up all night . - She 's kinda wild . - Oh . - I worked up here one summer . - Oh ! Maggie . Maggie ! Oh , my . Tell me you didn 't do it , Eddie ! I didn 't do it . Oh , it 's good to see you , man . You must be the other terrorist . - I guess I am . - Maggie , this is Lily . Hi , Lily . - Have a nice trip , Mr. Shannon . - Thank you , Bobby . So , Leon , how did you get me into this hearing ? I don 't have this kind of clearance . I know a guy that knows a guy . - Who ? - It 's a guy . Who-who 's the guy ? Doyle , it 's national security . I can 't tell you . Security concerns must be given greater importance in our industrial research . We don 't know the cause of the explosion . It 's true . And we don 't know the source of the espionage , if indeed there was espionage . But we do know that we are at risk . Every idea that offers a competitive advantage to Americans is subject to theft . And that , gentlemen , could be catastrophic . Mr. Shannon , over the past ten years , this committee has approved hundreds of millions of dollars for your ... research projects without having one good , goddamn idea about where the hell all the money was going . He 's talking about our tax dollars up there . We were under the impression , Senator , that you passed legislation specifically to ensure that you wouldn 't know . Or perhaps , more accurately , that you didn 't want to know . I 'm aware of the law , Mr. Shannon , thank you . I wrote it . But I don 't remember , when I was drafting it , that I anticipated a large portion of the south side of Chicago blown up . What assurances can you give me and this committee that this event will never happen again ? None , Senator . The incident in Chicago was tragic , to be sure . But sometimes that is the price we must pay to ensure our competitive edge in the future . We didn 't intend to pay for our space exploration program with the lives of ten American astronauts . But we did . Nevertheless , we must not waver in our commitment to technological and scientific research and development . As you gentlemen know , there are many threats to our way of life . And not all of them wear uniforms and carry guns . Mr. Shannon , I wanna thank you for your appearance today before this committee . Your words were spoken like a true patriot , of whom this country can be very , very proud . Thank you , sir . - I think I 'm getting through . - What about Lucasz ? He never got over not getting his credentials . No one on the team could have done something like this . Whoever is doing this knows an awful lot about us . If I hadn 't shown up , they would have thought it was an accident . If you hadn 't shown up , nobody would know what 's really going on . Oh , my God ! Hey . Welcome back , boss . We missed you . Yeah , what about me ? Surveillance is up on Shannon 's estate . Cue it up , Jimmy . Where are the files on the Moore Foundation ? Gentlemen , Shannon 's on the move . Halt this for now . There will be an orientation meeting in the main auditorium , on level one ... - Is everyone here ? - Yes . - Is it running ? - Not yet . Good afternoon , gentlemen . FBI . I 'm agent Williams , this is agent Lim . So , what kind of facility is this ? I 'm sorry , sir , we 're not allowed to discuss this matter with you . Good morning , ladies and gentlemen . If you 'll bear with me for just a few more moments , we 'll get things started . Thank you . I don 't care if he 's got an appointment with Mother Teresa . We have been waiting for him for the last 35 minutes . You 're late . This is another one of your messes , Lyman . It 's not the Peace Corps , Paul . Anyway , you said you had it under control . I did ! You know , this thing 's still not working . You 've got to call off the Bureau . Do you understand ? I 'm not sure I can do that . There 's an awful lot of explaining to do . Where 's the young man ? Kasalivich ? He 's someplace safe . I 'm bringing him in today . Paul ! If someone 's going down for this , it is not gonna be I. Paul Shannon , please . Maggie McDermott . We 're old friends . Washington . Area code 's Wisconsin . Checking the prefix . Punch it up . It 's Maggie McDermott . She 's been put through from the Chicago office . Maggie ? Shannon , it 's Eddie . It 's scrambled . It 's him . He 's on a pay phone in Williams Bay . Call our contact there . I 'll get the locals . What are you doing ? It 's okay , I 'm on a pay phone . Listen . The phony fax to Lily ... It 's-it 's okay , I know about that . Listen . Go back to Maggie 's and wait there . I 'll send someone for you . Lily tracked it to Beijing . It routed through a Chinese manufacturing company , but it originated from an office , something called the American Technological Business Council . Gotta go . - Ever heard of it ? - Listen . They 'll be there within an hour . Now , Eddie ! - Look , I gotta go . We 'll come to you . - No , don 't come here , Eddie . Eddie . Eddie ! - Thanks . - Good luck . Officer . Hey , hey ! Andy ! Andy , you know that guy on the news ? I saw him run up the road there . - Really , Maggie ? - That 's the pawn . You should have brought him in when you had the chance . Get a new interview observatory , right away ! Lily ! Lily ! - Eddie , it 's unbelievable . - We gotta go . Listen , listen , listen , listen . This council . They-they lobby for defense contractors ... Come on . We gotta go now . The cops are here . - What ? ! - Come on ! How did they find us ? Hey ! Hold it right there . Hey ! Hold it ! Hey ! Stop ! Hold it ! Stop ! Hold it right there . Get your hands up . Get ' em up ! Walk back slowly towards me . Come on , do it ! Keep comin ' . Good , hold it right there . This is Nemitz , on the roof of the observatory . I 've got ' em . Go ! Go , go , go , go , go ! Come on ! Hold your heads down ! On the roof ! Get a medical team up here . Right away . Suspect is armed ! Get in the boat ! - Eddie , what are you doing ? - Get in ! - Eddie , what are you doing ? - The best I can . Get the boat ! - Are you okay ? - Yes ! He 's out of our sight . 12 o 'clock . Lily , the bag ! Gimme the bag . Go , go ! There 's nobody in there ! We need a pollution revolution . Aw , forget it . I don 't care . Search all of Wisconsin if you have to . What , they lost ' im ? We 've been to C-Systems place this mornin ' . We can 't get any information . It used to be a government-run facility . And now according to county records , it doesn 't even exist . Or maybe you weren 't really there . Maybe we 're not really here , in the end . Eddie , I can 't ... feel my legs . Come on . We got fire , we got fire . Why would a policeman shoot another policeman ? Maybe they weren 't police . Why didn 't they ... shoot at us ? I don 't know . What a dump , huh ? - Mr. Shannon . - What ? There 's two gentlemen from the FBI who 'd see you . Well , this is more important than his afternoon tea . My apologies for interrupting your , uh , tea , Mr. Shannon . But what 's Kasalivich doing in Wisconsin ? Running away from you , I 'd imagine . We understand he phoned you a couple of hours ago . I counselled Eddie to turn himself in to the proper authorities . Yeah , well , he and Miss Sinclair shot a Wisconsin state trooper . I doubt that very seriously . Well ... The state trooper 's very dead . Mr. Shannon , these are , uh , copies of the Moore Foundation IRS files . Do you know what 's in them ? Meagre tax records , I imagine . We are a non-profit organization . The funding for your foundation comes from a wide variety of sources . Defense contractors , telecommunication companies , aerospace ... Well , it 's gratifying to know that our work 's appreciated . But the bulk of your contribution seems to come from one account in Cayman Islands . I don 't do the fundraising . Oh , yeah . And the account ... is classified . - Who pays your salary , Mr. Shannon ? - The foundation pays my salary . Classified accounts , encrypted phone communications ... You know , a man could be forgiven for concluding that your ... foundation is largely a front for a front to the CIA . Well , if that 's the case , there may be national security issues here that are larger than all of us . Interfering with an FBI investigation is a federal crime . - I know the law , Mr ... - Doyle . National security does not include murdering people . Domestically , at least . Tell your friends at Langley that domestic is our back yard . They 're not allowed to play here . You can keep the returns . Nice house . And for dinner tonight , we have a choice of sardines ... or sardines . Gosh , I think I 'll have ... sardines . Sardines . Beautiful choice . So , is this how you seduce all the girls ? Only physicists with hypothermia who are accused of being a terrorist . Thank you . There 's a garage outside . I 'm gonna see what 's in there . I won 't be long . Okay ? Your pitbull has killed a Wisconsin state trooper . Well , now . Would you rather the Bureau got the girl and the Kasalivich boy ? First , he was a suspect . Worst-case scenario ... they arrest him . Now , he 's a cop killer . Worst case scenario , they kill him . For God 's sake , Lyman , whatever possessed you - to frame him in the first place ? - Two words . Convenience and expedience . He saw too much , he was talking . The poor boy was in the wrong place at the wrong time . I need this poor boy ! This poor boy is the only one who knows the frequencies ! Do you understand the concept , Lyman ? Poor impulse control ? Barkley , Chen , the regulator . That was supposed to be it ! That was all of it ! I am sick to death of cleaning up your messes . No , Paul , no . Yours . Not mine . You lost it , Paul . Lost control ... perspective ... You made it personal with these people . Well , we 'll find ' em . We 'll find ' em , and when we do and we 've got this thing working , well , then , my friend , then , this young man will be a liability . Well , that 'll be my problem . - Our problem . - No , Lyman . When the time comes ... I 'll handle it . You better . So , what does he want us to do ? We find him and give him an injection . Lily . Lily ! Come on . Leesburg , Virginia . C-Systems . - Who are they ? - Not cops . Cops carry badges , credit cards , pictures of their families . - If it 's crowded ... don 't go in . - Okay . - Hi ! - Hello . Can I help you ? Uh , yes , please . I 'd like to send some-some flowers and a note to a friend of mine in Virginia . It 's a little strange , Mr. Shannon , but these just arrived . I 'm not quite sure where they 're from . Here 's a note . May I see that ? Thank you . Hold it right there , buddy . FBI . Step outside the van , please . Why don 't you bring your invoice sheet out with you ? Do you know if the order originated at this shop ? I-I don 't think so . I think , uh , it was a wire from Georgetown . - Mind if I take one of these ? - No , sure . Have a nice day . So , uh , officially this investigation is now code-named Steel Bomb . We 'll use that name and input the data into Rapid Start . Look what I brought back from the flower shop . I think this is Kasalivich . Spawn versus Neanderthal man , 4 p.m. Today . What is this , a wrestling match ? Bad movie , video game ? Spawn is a comic-book character , boss . It 's the sick guy who comes back from the dead , right ? Yeah , like Kasalivich . So , maybe , uh , Shannon is the Neanderthal man ? Very well may be . Hello , Eddie . - Glad you got the flowers . - Very clever . - You all right ? - No , not really . I guess I can understand that . We were at Maggie 's . Caught . About to be arrested , Paul . Somebody shot the cop . Later , two guys tried to kill us . I 've got my car outside . Follow me . We 'll go some place where we can talk . I found this ... in one of the guy 's wallets . They weren 't cops . What do you know about C-Systems , Paul ? This is not the time or the place , Eddie . We 're being watched . Eddie , the world isn 't quite as simple as we 'd like it to be . Just doesn 't work that way . - Shannon , who are you ? - I 'm your friend , Eddie . I may be your only friend . Is it you , Paul ? Are you responsible for all this ? Time to go , Eddie . You 've got a job to complete . The experiment needs verifying . Do your work . This will all be over . Eddie , we 're beyond that now . Let 's just get this done . Come back to work with me . You 'll have your life back , I promise you . You don 't control our lives . - You 'll have to trust me , Eddie . - Just like Alistair ? Eddie ! Eddie ! A trip that normally takes five and a half hours . But today , you 'll experience everything that happened during that flight in just seven minutes . From takeoff to landing . Your pilot for today 's flight is captain Dave Larsen . Stay here . Our co-pilot is first officer ... Get in . She 's in the hatch . Look out ! The crew are going through their final pre-flight checks . They 're ready to taxi to the runway . Eddie ! Eddie ! Come on , man , don 't do anything foolish . Get Ford . DC police just reported a disturbance at the Science Museum in front of the Neanderthal man exhibit . CQ 493 ... CQ 493 . Here you are , darling , here you are . Drink this . You 're dehydrated . Wash it out of your system . Mr. Collier and I have a few colleagues we 'd like you to meet . Dr. Holloway , dr . Hamada , and dr . Orbit . They are very interested to discuss your work with you . Oh , and , of course , dr . Lu Chen . Lu . Lily . We would very much like for you and dr . Chen to continue the work you 've been doing with dr . Barkley . - You can 't be serious ! - Oh , yes . We 've been impressed with your work for a long time . Do you drug and kidnap everyone whose work you admire ? No . The dr . Barkley we left behind . Slay the dreamer , eh , Mr. Shannon ? Spare some change ? A quarter , a quarter , what 's a quarter ? I mean , two bits , two bits . You can 't even see me ? Can I share your grate ? CQ 493 . This is Eddie . Uh , I think he does . But he really does . What 're you watchin ' ? " Honeymooner " reruns ? Well , Kasalivich and , uh , Barkley . Look at this . Does it look like the kid is about to kill this guy and blow the place up in a couple of hours ? The whole thing stinks . Thanks . We got the ballistics report back on that trooper the guy killed in Wisconsin . High-power Teflon sniper round went right through the cop 's Kevlar vest . I don 't buy it . He 's smart enough to blow up the lab but then stupid enough to leave a quarter of a million bucks underneath the sink so we 'd be sure to find it ? So , what you 're sayin ' there ? Some cowboy 's gone off the reservation ? 100 bucks . Kid didn 't do it . You got a nationwide manhunt for an innocent man . Make sure nobody shoots ' im . Next shift 's going down now , okay ? Yeah , right . Help me out on this , will you ? I 've had problems with the conveyor belt . Damn , I 'll have a ... Yeah . No , no , I 'll have , uh , Jim Zinsky work on that . Okay ? All right . Listen , if you got any problems , gimme a call me on channel 4 , okay ? How is our young charge ? Did she say anything ? Well , we 'll soon find out , won 't we ? The young lady does appear to be cooperating . Good . - Gentlemen , you 're just in time . - Well , let 's get on with it . Miss Sinclair , Mr. Chen , please , have a seat . Attention , all personnel . Critical path experiment will commence in ten minutes . Critical path experiment will commence in ten minutes . - Activate the H2 compressor . - Oh , on automatic . Here we go . Lucasz , what are you reading ? - Two million Kelvin . - Activate the laser . Four million Kelvin . Shut it down ! Shut it down ! Damn it ! What a joke . It won 't work without the right frequencies . What did he say ? He said that 's what he 's been trying to tell you for days . Look . Let 's try it again in the morning , okay ? See you back here at 8 : 15 tomorrow , all right ? I have a feeling , dr . Sinclair , the solution will present itself . I doubt it . It had better or your usefulness will soon be outlived . Take them back to their room . I wish you wouldn 't threaten to kill my scientists right to their faces . It might make my job easier . Lucasz , Hamada , seal the lab ! I want to see those printouts first thing in the morning . - It 's working ? - Yes . - How ? - Lucasz claims he figured it out . - Lucasz ? - That 's his story . You should have seen it when I got here , Lyman . Mm-hm . I mean , the output was going right through the roof ! Son of a bitch ! It really does work . Ha ! Dr. Shannon , take a look at that . We 've got it . - What did you do ? - Nothing . Well , uh , I couldn 't sleep last night , sir . I heard this voice saying , " Go down and check different frequencies " because we were trying on 15 and 20 megahertz . " So I went down to the lab and ... ran the experiment . And it all worked out . So ... here we are , sir . Did you document the regulator frequencies ? Not yet . I 'd like those on a disk ... Now , sir . None too shabby , hey , Mr. Shannon ? - Doctor . - Thank you . Where are you going , Paul ? I 'm gonna check this against the Chicago data . I 'll try to meet you at the silo . - Wait as long as you can . - Yes , sir . Hello , Eddie ! Figured it was you . Nice place you have here , Shannon . Ten-megaJoule lasers ... particle reactors ... You know , Congress defunded most of the stuff down here years ago . They made a mistake . Is this part of the Moore Foundation ? In a manner of speaking . Power and money . Is that what this was all about ? I 'm afraid it 's a little more complicated than that , Eddie . He was a 60-year-old scientist who did nothing but good and they put a bag over his head . It was a mistake . Last thing I wanted was for something to happen to Alistair . But a decision had to be made . So ... Who made the decision ? - You ? - That 's my job . That 's what I 'm paid to do . I 'm paid to do dirty work . The work people don 't want to know about . People wanna live in their split-level homes . And eat microwave dinners and watch colour TV . Is that what you think ? Alistair was a dreamer . Clean air , free energy . Noble concepts but we live on a planet that is addicted to petroleum . Now , what happens if you dump free energy onto the world market ? Stock markets around the world would plummet . Our own economy would collapse overnight . Recession , unemployment , war . The world is speeding up too fast now , Eddie . We can barely hold on as it is . You 're right , it 's not working . That 's why we gotta try something else . Not bury the technology , but let it out . You let it out , but you let it out at a pace the world can absorb . It can absorb it now . There 's our boy . Mr. Kasalivich ! How kind of you to join us . Give us a moment , Lyman . Eddie and I are having a conversation . Please ! Don 't let me stop you ! Who runs this place , Shannon ? You ? - Or the guy with the guns ? - Well , we are a cooperative ... of sorts . Run at the behest of the United States government . But without their knowledge , right ? My , my , but your friend is sharp , Paul . All right , Eddie . What do you want ? Here are the specs for the regulator . You can pull the frequencies off the computer . Now let us go . I get it to work . You give us our lives back . That was the deal , wasn 't it ? Yeah . Yeah , that was the deal . I 'm afraid , young man , your position is non-negotiable . I see . I wanna tell you this story how I got inspired . - I had this dream ... - No ! Hold on . - I will continue . - Yes . What 's happening ? What did you just do ? I just told the FBI I was willing to surrender . Oh , and , uh ... I think your experiment just got a mind of its own . Check the breakers . Everybody , back to your stations ! - Leon . - What the hell is goin ' on , Doyle ? I just started a couple of minutes ago . Hundreds of pages . Technical drawings , specs for scientific experiments , budgets , personnel records , minutes of meetings , most of them are marked top secret . - Where is it coming from ? - C-Systems . Looks like they dumped their mainframe into our fax and into our computers . Look , here 's a , uh , special love note just for you . Jesus Christ , Kasalivich . Yeah . He says he 's in a bunker in Leesburg , Virginia , with some of his bomb-making buddies and wants us to come down and arrest him . - Lake Geneva Radical Bomb Network ? - Yeah , sound like bullshit ? Sounds like you owe me 100 bucks . Make sure that fax machine doesn 't run out of paper . - Hamada ! - Still off-line ! - Pressure ? - Presure is 500 psi rising . What the hell 's going on ? We 've lost control of the system , Lyman . We can 't shut it down . Turn it off . It 's self-sustaining . It can 't be shut down . Al ! How long before we run out of storage capacity ? I don 't know . It 's accelerating . What you say , Eddie ? 20 minutes before it blows ? Maybe less . - Is he right ? - I 'm afraid he is . Well done , Eddie . Well done . You wouldn 't blow it up if you weren 't sure - you were gonna get outta here alive . - Sure I would . Lyman , I think it 's time we got the hell out of here . - No ! - Chen ! - Lily ! - Chen ! For God 's sake , Lyman ! Chen ! Chen ! Wait ! Wait ! - Jesus Christ ! - What is wrong with you ? - Turn it off ! - That was totally unnecessary . If you haven 't got the stomach for this , Paul , you stay clear out of the way . I 'm going to turn down the power and reboot the system . - No ! - Don 't touch that ! Don 't ! Attention ! Hydrogen containment failure . Potential personnel hazard . - The compressor 's just shut down . - Turn it back on , man ! - You can 't . - The computers are down . Get out ! Get out ! Everybody ! - Fix it . - I can 't now . - Fix it ! - I can 't ! I wouldn 't do that , Lyman . It will ignite the hydrogen . It 's over , Lyman . It 's over . I guess it 's time to go . Go ! Go ! Give me the disk . - You two , stay ! - No , Lyman ! Let them go ! What possible difference can it make now ? - They stay ! - When does it end , Lyman ? Never . Well , it 's not your decision . The decision is mine , and I say they 're coming . You can stay with ' em ... if you like . We must go now . Well , are you comin ' ? Warning . Warning . Air contaminants at critical level . Come on , Paul ! We 've got things to do ! I 'm sorry , Eddie . - Shannon ! - Shannon ! Please ! Warning ! Warning ! Air contaminants at critical level . Evacuate immediately . Warning . Air contaminants at critical level . Evacuate immediately . All containment doors are now closed . The tanks . Okay , here 's the elevator . There 's room for everybody . I am looking for two men . Paul Shannon and Lyman Collier . Hang on to them . Follow the blue evacuation route arrows to the elevators . Move in an orderly fashion quickly and quietly ... Gentlemen , our friends from the FBI will be here presently . Anita , we 're on our way . You two , go to the north elevator . I 'll take it from here . Come on ! Come on , Lily . Eddie , which way ? By the way , Paul , do you have that disk ? The one with the magic frequency ? Thank you so much . You know , Paul , maybe it 's time to call it a day . Maybe you 're getting too old for this . What do you think , huh ? But then again ... what would we do ? What would we do , hm ? I didn 't tell you , Lyman ... but your retirement had already been arranged . Containment systems off . Access restored to all areas . Containment systems off . Hey , hold on , hold on ! Take it up , take it up ! They got a 20 on Kasalivich ? They found the stolen truck at the construction site one mile to the west . Hold on . Eddie , look . Get up . Come on , Reed . We gotta go ! I thought you said the hole was clear ! Get back in the seat , Ernie , get back in the seat . Eddie ... Lily , get in the basket ! Get out of here . Go ! Eddie , come on ! Eddie ! Hold on . Hold on , Eddie , hold on . Come on , Eddie . Come on ! Pull it up , pull it up . Holy ... did you see that ? Whoa ! Come on , Ernie , get ' im outta there . Eddie Kasalivich . Agent Ford . You got the message . Yeah , we levelled a forest printing the damn thing . What 's it mean , Eddie ? - Plans ... for clean , cheap energy . - Anybody else get this ? Hopefully , a couple thousand world renowned scientists . - I knew I liked this kid . - Yeah , right , Leon . Come on . You got some questions to answer in Washington for about six weeks . - That 's okay . - We got a lot to talk about as long as everyone stops shooting at us . Doyle , split ' em up . I 'll meet you back at the office . Hey , come on with me . Ford ! Doctor Sinclair and I ride together . All right , come on , both o ' you . Anita , take a memo . To the Director of Central Intelligence . C-Systems ... no longer a viable entity . Will be in contact .

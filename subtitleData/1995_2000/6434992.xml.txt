 You make man ? No . Woman . Woman ? THEME SONG : Weird science ! Pictures from a magazine . Diagrams and charts . Mending broken hearts and making weird science ! Something like a recipe . Bits and pieces and bits and pieces and- - my creation , is it real ? It 's my creation ! Woo ! My creation ! It 's my creation ! No heart of gold , just flesh and blood ! I do not know . It 's my creation ! Ooh ! My creation ! It 's my creation ! From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand ? It 's alive ! Alive ! [ MUSIC PLAYING ] I don 't know , Wy . Joining the school paper ? My dad reads newspapers . Me ? Give me a transvestite mad bomber on " Hard Copy " any day . It 's just an orientation meeting . And who knows ? You might like the whole investigative journalist scene . I 'm liking it already . Welcome to the " Farber High Sentinel . " First question ? Where 's the faculty advisor ? She 's history . Principal Scampi okays the proofs , but otherwise a teacher just gets in the way . Agreed ? [ CLAPPING ] Yeah ! Yeah ! Donnelly , welcome back . Everyone , Wyatt 's agreed to be this quarter 's photo jockey . [ CLAPPING ] Copies of the " Sentinel . " If you want to write for the paper , you get to know the paper inside and out . Ah , a new face . Got it mail order . Like ? I hope it was on sale . Name 's Gary . But you can call me Scoop . Welcome aboard , Scoot . That 's , um , Scoop . With a P. I 'm gonna be a reporter . You 're gonna take the pictures . How about this ? Polls show PE classes are too sweaty . Students threaten to riot . You actually took a poll ? Well , not exactly . I mean , I- - Gary , you can 't make up news . You gotta find news . That can take hours . I just want to write about the news I like , you know , the fun stuff , like a UFO sighting , the Loch Ness Monster , anything involving Elvis . Gary , you 're forgetting why you got into journalism in the first place . To pursue the truth ? I thought it was to score with Marie . Exactly . But she 's never gonna respect you if all you do is make up stories . She loves the news- - news that actually happens . How about this ? What if the tabloid stories you liked really happened ? Then you could report them and Marie would take you seriously . And then I 'd get to see her naked . Exactly ! I think there 's a step missing there . Details . Lis , make this happen . With pleasure . [ REWIND NOISE ] Blank ? The whole paper 's blank . It 's all in here . From now on , every story you write with your pen will come true . Marie will be way impressed . Score ! Let 's see how this baby rips . So I just write a headline ? That 's it ? Whatever your little tabloid heart desires . Ready , Wy ? You 're gonna love this . I 'm all tingly with anticipation . [ INAUDIBLE ] Check it out ! What ? [ INAUDIBLE ] Did you see that ? See it ? I wrote it ! Pretty impressive , huh ? And I was there . The full body probe went right through me . So on a scale from 1 to 10 ? Trash . We 're a serious newspaper , Wallace . We 're serious reporters . And we have serious proof . Very funny . What ? This is for real . Oh , please . Honky flying saucers ? Give me a break . What ? What 's wrong with it ? What 's wrong with it ? It 's a flying saucer . It 's not news . It 's a joke . It belongs on the cover of some supermarket tabloid . And besides , it 's not even in focus . It 's kind of in focus . Sort of . Tabloids sell big time . My kind of stories get people 's attention . All you have to do is turn me loose . I 'm sorry . There 's a leash law in this town . You 're afraid of me , aren 't you ? Yes . Then again , clowns have always frightened me . You 're afraid because I 've got power . Don 't tell me- - two double As ? I 'm talking Sears Diehard . Is the subject newspapers or auto parts ? Look , I know what people want . I could be the best thing that ever happened to you . To me , or the paper ? Both . OK , Wallace , we 'll try it your way . I 'll run the UFO piece and see what kind of response it gets . But if it backfires , your news days are over . You won 't be sorry . [ HUMMING ] What are you thinking of doing for your next piece ? I don 't know , but it 's got to be good . As a newsman , it 's my responsibility to make up the perfect story . Anybody got any ideas ? That might not be the best pen to brainstorm with . We 're just spitballing . It 's not gonna hurt anybody . Woo ! Hot . How about spontaneous combustion ? People love that . That 's a good one . [ SCREAMING ] How about a giant mutated octopus ? A two-headed Scotsman . [ BAGPIPES PLAYING ] How about the abominable snowman ? There 's an oldie , but goodie . Woo ! Who is messing with the thermostat ? [ GROWLING ] [ INTERPOSING VOICES ] - This is awesome . - Yeah . Take one . [ INAUDIBLE ] . Yeah . Get another one . I gotta say , more people are reading the paper than ever . Do I have my finger on the pulse of these wacky kids , or what ? You know wacky . So what do you say we two top dogs share a water bowl at the Java Man . You buying the milk bones ? On my salary ? You kidding ? Look , I 'd love to , Gary , but I 'm deep into my own story right now . And I think it might be big . Oh , yeah ? How big ? Word has it there 's no fish in the cafeteria fish sticks . And this is news to you ? Go ahead , laugh . It sounds like small peanuts , but if I can prove that , I 'll cinch my investigation on the school superintendent . No fish in him either ? I 'm certain he 's been skimming from school funds to invest in real estate . I just need one concrete piece of evidence . Why don 't you let me help you with your story ? I usually work alone . I have this source in the lunchroom . Trust me , he 's very inside . You and me working together , c 'mon , what do you say ? Why do you care so much about getting a photo of a giant lobster ? I thought you were only into real news . I am . I was . But it 's not about that anymore . It 's personal . I 'm a good photographer , and a good photographer should be able to take pictures of anything . This last week alone , I saw a Phantom 747 land on the assembly field , the ghost of Liberace selling churros at Beeman Park , Bigfoot breastfeeding Elvis . Nobody 's had a better chance to get this stuff on film than me , but I blow it every time . They didn 't all come out blurry . This one of the dreaded zit man is really gross . That 's my seventh grade picture . Ugh . Oh , jeez ! Oh , man , does that feel good ! Are you sure your contact was going to meet us here ? It 's , uh , not very private . Public , private , doesn 't matter to my source . She 's the best . She ? She , who ? I thought you said your source was a guy . You just said she . He 's a master of disguise . But enough about her , let 's talk about us . I can 't , Gary . Not now . When- - when I 'm on a story , it 's hard for me to think about anything else . It consumes every part of me . Consumes . I get very passionate about the hunt . The hunt ? Are we still talking about fish sticks ? Your source is a no-show . Maybe we should call it a night . Hold on ! Let me make a note of that . Wait , you 're right . Why would my source meet us in a public place ? She 's too smart for that . He . Whatever . The point is he 'd leave us a clue . What 's this ? Pinecrest Peak . 10 : 00 PM . Finally we 're getting somewhere ! Ooh ! You smell good . I know . What about me ? You smell like my dad . That 's the Old Spice hard at work . It 's a quarter to 12 : 00 . Someone is yanking us . Well , we might as well make the best of it . It 's a nice night . We 're alone . I 'm sorry , Gary . I can 't relax until we make some headway on this story . Fair enough . You want to wait till we wrap up the fish ? No problem . I 'll make a note of that . A fish ! A clue ! It 's wrapped in newspaper . Our newspaper ! These letters are circled- - R , M , 13 . Room 13 . That 's Scampi 's office . Oh , he must be in on it . There 's no telling how many teachers are gonna fall when we break this story . This is so Scooby Doo . Zoiks ! Wyatt , quick ! Where 's that expensivo aftershave your grandmother gave you ? Why don 't you get spruced up at your own house ? Yeah , what happened ? Your dad 's jug of Old Spice run dry ? Maybe . This magic pen is finally starting to pay off . The deeper we get into this thing , the deeper she gets into me . Gary , has it occurred to you that you don 't have the solution to Marie 's fish stick story ? So what ? Me and my little friend here can make up anything we want . I gave you that pen to impress her , not to lead her on . She 's been upfront with you . The least you could do is be honest with her . It 's time we told her the truth . I suddenly see a headline . Hey ! Did you have something to add ? [ GROWLING ] Do you guys sell snow cones ? I 'm burning up . [ INAUDIBLE ] [ GROWLING ] Nice up here , huh ? It 's beautiful . [ HEAVY FOOTSTEPS ] Mm . Frosty ice cream . Oh my god ! That looks like a yeti ! [ SCREAMING ] Ed ! You know , this is a brand new car , you pig ! Take a hike , skin job . I know we 're partners and everything , but when you planted your lips on me , did that mean- - There 's gotta be something in here . Look in the desk drawers , Wallace . You called me Gary last night . I was sure we 'd find something . This case is over . We can 't give up now . You never know what we 're gonna find next . Maybe we should check out that cabinet . Scampi might be keeping fish in there . What are you talking about ? Why would he be keeping fish in his office ? You never know . Are you OK ? Yeah . Just banged my head . Fist found ? Oh ! The freezer key ! Home of the fish sticks . Next stop , the freezer . This case is so exciting . I 'm so worked up . Kiss me , Marie ! Marie ! If anything is gonna get you a picture , this baby will . You 've got eight autofocus zoom lenses- - heat sensitive , cold sensitive , motion sensitive , waterproof , and infrared . What 's this button ? The auto-destruct . Don 't touch that . Well , I 'm ready then . Look out unexplained phenomena , Wyatt Donnelly is on the case . Wyatt , the lens caps . [ GROWLING ] [ SCREAMING ] Cold water ! Oh , cold . [ GRUNTING AND POUNDING ] Oh , cold ! Oh ! Nice bod ! Cold home ! MARIE : We 're onto something big . I know we 're gonna find it in here . This is gonna be great . GARY : Fish sticks are romantic , don 't you think ? You know , Gary , when you said we should team up , I was against the idea . You 're more of a loner , right ? No , I kind of thought you were a spaz . Really ? But I was wrong . It 's been fun working with a partner . I mean , with you . We 're good together , aren 't we ? We 're on the brink of something big . Are we talking fish sticks , or ? Oh my god ! It 's locked ! Come on , Gary , we 're trapped ! Oh , don 't worry . Nothing my trusty pen can 't handle . Hey , what 's that on your shirt ? No ink ! Help ! Hello ? ! Here , Elvis , Elvis , Elvis . Elvis ! [ BURPING ] Huh ? [ SCREAMING ] It 's kind of funny . Tomorrow they 'll find us in here frozen , just like those fish sticks . Well , there 's your headline- - " Farber Newsies Frozen With Phony Fish . " Seeing as this may be my last chance , I guess I can admit- - you 've inspired me . I have ? I 'm too analytical , but you , you 're all instinct . You don 't need clues or logic . You just know . The truth is , Marie , I 'm not quite the reporter you think I am . My pen really does all the work . You 're just being modest . It 's your hand that guides that pen . Well , I mean , you could look at it that way . And hey , what if we are stuck in here ? We 're still reporters , right ? This investigation isn 't over until we say it is . Or until our body temperature drops below 80 degrees . So let 's review the facts . Frozen fish sticks are frozen , right ? Yeah . Yeah , right . So you freeze frozen fish sticks in a freezer , right ? Let 's take inventory . It 's no use , Gary . I checked all the boxes . There are no fish sticks in here . But I thought that was the point . There never were any fish sticks . Maybe they 're just called something else . Pure ground beef patties . Sloppy Joe mix . Creamed corn . Wait a minute . Breaded soy fingers ? Look familiar ? Fish sticks ! Give me that package ! Soy product , bread product imitation fish scented textured curds ! But no real fish . Congratulations , Marie . You got your proof . We got the proof , Scoop . [ POUNDING AND GRUNTING ] Oh , at last ! Say " cheese , " Hairball ! You OK ? What happened ? Did you see that ? I got the yeti on film ! Small taters , Wyatt . We just cinched us a real story . Naked ? Dazed ? And I have no idea how I got here . That 's the third time this month . GUARD : Freeze ! Huh ? Hey , guys , I got my shots of the abominable snowman back from the lab . Huh ? What does this prove ? It 's a yeti . Clear as day . It 's a hairy back . It could be Robin Williams . But the hair is white . OK . So it 's Ed Asner . Yeah , but look at that focus , huh ? It 's perfect . Look , you can even make out the fleas . Maybe it 's Willie Nelson . Wyatt , that picture doesn 't prove anything . Yes , it does . It proves that I can take a decent picture . It proves it doesn 't take much to make him happy . Hey . So it 's back to work , huh ? Yeah , with you running the paper and me as the spaz reporter . Well , we 'll always have the freezer . LISA ( VOICEOVER ) : Who said truth can 't be stranger than fiction ? THEME SONG : Weird science ! Fantasy and microchips shooting from the hip . Something different we 're making . Weird science ! Pictures from a magazine . Bits and pieces and bits and pieces and- - my creation , is it real ? It 's my creation . I do not know . It 's my creation ! From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand my intentions ?

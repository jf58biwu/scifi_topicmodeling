 - [ Chattering ] - [ Horn Honks ] [ Honking Continues ] All right . Here we are . [ Laughs ] Take it easy , Matthew . See you . Bye-bye . - Bye , Joe . Bye . - [ Woman ] Let 's get your backpack , honey . - [ Girl ] Bye . - Bye , Rachel . - [ Chattering ] - Take it easy . Have a good day . Bye-bye . - Jarod , I 'm really sorry . - Don 't mention it , Ben . A bus trip isn 't a bus trip until somebody - - How did you put it ? - Tosses their cookies . - Cookies . Right . - [ Man ] Jarod , I can 't figure it . I 'm barely seeing enough pennies to keep the lights on ... and then you show up out of nowhere , and you fix up this old bus ... and you 're even taking the kids on field trips to the air force base . It 's better to give than to receive . I read that ... someplace . [ Laughs ] How 'd your dad like the base , Ryan ? Uh , Ryan 's dad couldn 't make it . He was on a business trip . But we got to hang out , didn 't we ? - Yeah . - You 're a godsend , Jarod . Next thing I know , Ed McMahon 'll be knocking on that door ... with one of those big cardboard checks . - [ Horn Honks ] - Hey , Jarod , there 's my mom . - Who 's Ed McMahon ? - See you later . - Oh , hey , Ryan . - Yeah ? - Here . I got this for you . - Cool . Thanks . - Maybe you 'll fly one , one day . - Yeah . Mostly , thanks for kind of being my dad for the weekend . - Sure . [ Chuckles ] - [ Woman ] Hey , you . Mom ! - How was your trip , honey ? - [ Ryan ] Fantastic . - Yeah ? - Mom , this is Jarod . - Cindy Wells . Nice to meet you . - Nice to meet you . - He 's been talking about you all week . - Look what he gave me . - Wow . - Can I stay up and show it to Dad ... - when he gets home tonight ? - Uh , yeah , we 'll see . - All right , top gun , into the cockpit . - Okay . - Bye-bye . - Bye , Jarod . See you later . Thanks a lot . His dad really wanted to go with him ... but he 's been away on business longer than usual ... and Ryan misses him a lot . I can imagine . - He 's a great kid . - Thanks . - Nice to meet you . Bye . - You too . [ Chuckles ] [ Car Starts ] [ Horns Honking , Tires Squealing ] [ Horn Blaring ] [ Jarod ] Cindy ! Ryan ! Somebody call 911 ! [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Siren Wailing ] [ Woman On P.A. ] Cardiology interns , please report to O.R. 2 . - Cardiology interns - - My wife and son were brought in . - Can you help me ? - Are you Mr. Wells ? - Yes . - My name is Jarod . - I was at the accident scene . - Where are they ? - They 're still in surgery . - Oh , God . I just got back in town . My firm 's been flying me all over . - You 're here now . - Mr. Wells ? - I 'm Ted Wells . How 's my family ? - Your wife 's gonna be just fine . She suffered a concussion , a dislocated shoulder . - My boy ? - Your son sustained a severe abdominal trauma . Both kidneys were damaged , one beyond repair . We had to remove it . The other one won 't last long . - He needs a kidney transplant . - He won 't survive without it . We 're looking at about a 48-hour window . Okay , so - So what 's next ? Ryan goes on some sort of priority list or something , right ? Normally . Your son 's blood carries a unique leukocytic compound . It 's a hereditary condition which makes finding a donor much more difficult . - Your wife isn 't a match . - Well , then , I have to be , right ? - You can put me on that table . - Ryan 's condition needs to be stabilized first . And we need to do a blood workup on you to screen out any infectious agents . Okay ? I 'll send a tech over to draw a sample . I don 't know what I 'd do if I lost my family . - Forgive me ? - For ? Being a neglectful brother . Just because you were nowhere to be found ... when I was in the hospital - at death 's door . - You 're too hard on yourself . - Look , I know you 're angry . I don 't blame you . In fact , I got these for you . Candied snails ? - Yummy . - Hey , those are hard to find . No kidding . Where have you been anyway ? I 've had three solid leads on Jarod in the last two weeks . You 've shown zero interest . I do have other responsibilities . Jarod is just one of them . Excuse me , Mr. Lyle . The phone man 's here to see you . - I 'll be right there . - He says he has other appointments . I said I 'd be there . Phone man ? Big responsibilities . Enjoy the snails . [ Trash Can Rattles ] [ Gasps ] That 's my good pillow . You seem to be smiling a lot these days , Miss Parker . - Sneaking in downwind - clever . - Hard at work . - Micromanaging ? - A necessary evil ... considering your ongoing lack of success . You 're building to a point , I hope . Your work has become unfocused . Perhaps you 're too distracted with ... personal affairs . - Such as ? - Such as - - Oh . Sorry . - Stay , Broots ! Mr. Raines was just slithering along , weren 't you ? Priorities , Miss Parker - priorities . What is it , Broots ? Well , I got this new satellite TV dish - 223 channels ... high-definition digital , right ? - So I 'm channel surfing in the shower - - Wait a minute . You have a television in the bathroom ? Don 't you ? Did you know that there 's a 24-hour disaster channel ? - Last night was train wrecks . - Which is what this is becoming . - Get to the point . - Oh , no , no , wait , wait . Please , look . I 'll just show you then , okay ? [ Woman ] Money problems seem to be everywhere ... including this small suburban church . " Donations are the only way we 're able to survive " ... says Reverend Jack Collins of his Little White Chapel . If you 're interested in helping out Reverend Collins - That 's sweet . Send the change from my desk drawer as a donation . Oh , no , no , no ! Wait . You missed it . Right there . Hallelujah . - Look who 's seen the light . - [ Chuckles ] [ Sirens Wailing ] - Anything you want me to bring you , pal ? - My airplane . - Kind of like this one ? - Jarod . How you feeling , kiddo ? Tired . My side hurts . [ Sighs ] Here . I tell you what . When you 're feeling better ... we 'll see about getting this thing airborne . Honey , why don 't you close your eyes for a bit ? The doctor said you need to rest . - Okay . - [ Jarod ] Ted ? Any word on the transplant yet ? We 're still waiting on the blood work . - I was just gonna go try and find the lab . - No . I 'll go check on it . You stay with your family . I don 't know why you 're so interested in all this ... but I really appreciate your help . [ Woman ] I 'm fully aware of what " stat " means ... but I 'm a little shorthanded down here . I understand . I know , but my partner phoned in sick ... and the lab tech Dr. Conti promised hasn 't shown up yet . Mm-hmm . I know . [ Jarod ] I am so sorry I 'm late . Oh . He just walked in . - Dr. Conti gave me the wrong directions . - [ Groans ] - Boy , you look like you could use a break . - You have no idea . Construction accident has E.R. Packed . Everyone needs their results yesterday . [ Chuckling ] Why don 't you take a little break ... - and I 'll start over here . - Oh , how about I give you a hug . - [ Laughs ] Have a good time . - Okay . [ Jarod ] Cindy ? - Where 's Ted ? - Oh , uh - He went to go call my parents . Did you find out what 's taking the lab so long ? Why don 't we go talk in the hall ? What 's wrong ? Is there a problem with the lab ? Your husband isn 't a donor match . - That 's impossible . - Cindy - I need to know the truth . Ted isn 't Ryan 's father , is he ? It 's something I always feared , but I didn 't know for sure . Look , I know this isn 't easy for you ... but if you want to save your son 's life ... I need to know who his father is , and I need to know now . His name is Luther Ecksley . I met him right around the time that Ted and I got together . He was the total opposite ofTed . He was dangerous and dark and - I had seen Ted on a date with another girl ... and I thought that being with someone like Luther ... was the best way to get back at him . So you had a relationship with this man ? It was a stupid fling . I was young . When I found out what kind of person Luther really was , I went back to Ted . But you found out you were pregnant ? And you never told him the truth ? There were a thousand times that I wanted to . And then a thousand times I stopped myself ... 'cause I was just too scared of losing him . And the more time that passed , the more itjust didn 't really seem to matter . Ryan is Ted 's son in all the ways that count . I need to find this Luther . Do you know where he is ? [ Sniffles ] I don 't have a clue . You said he was trouble . Maybe he has a police record . - I 'll start with that . - Jarod ? [ Whispering ] Please don 't say anything to Ted . Cindy , you can 't keep this a secret much longer . The doctors are bound to find the truth - just like I did . [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Rock ] [ Chattering ] What 'll it be ? I 'm looking for someone - Luther Ecksley . It 's important . Don 't know the guy . Does anyone know who Luther Ecksley is ? [ Groans ] What do you want with Luther Ecksley , huh ? I just want to talk to him . - [ Man ] So start talking . - [ Jarod ] You are not Luther . I 'm as close as you 're gonna get . Luther 's rotting in a Mexican prison ... and he 's gonna be for a long damn time . [ Groans ] You ain 't never gonna find Luther . [ Man Laughs ] [ Man Speaking Spanish On P.A. ] Gracias . Mr. Ecksley , my name is Jarod . Three years in this dump . No visitors , no letters , no phone calls . Now all of a sudden I got some humanitarian aid organization ... worried whether I 'm being treated right or not . - I 'm not here on your behalf . - Is that right ? [ Sighs ] - I give up . - His name is Ryan . He 's eight years old , and right now he 's in a hospital ... in desperate need of a kidney transplant . - Yeah ? Why are you telling me ? - He 's your son , Mr. Ecksley . Go on . He has a rare blood condition - inherited from you - which means you are the only person on this planet that can save his life . - How ? - I 'm going to try to arrange for your temporary release . You , uh , want me to donate a kidney ? Your son 's life depends on it . [ Sighs ] This is a lot to think about . There 's no time to think , Luther . Either you do this now , or he dies . Who 's the , uh - Who 's the mother ? Her name was Cindy Brenner . I remember her . Is she all right ? She will be - if you do this . Does the boy know about me ? No . And I can 't guarantee you 'll ever get to meet him . We 're running out of time , Luther . Do you believe in redemption , Jarod ? Maybe . You have a lot to make up for . This could be a start though , right ? [ Bell Ringing ] [ Miss Parker ] Damn , Broots . Looks like wejust missed the Sunday sermon . [ Organ ] You ever go to church , Miss Parker ? After the things I 've seen and done ... I think church is the last place I should be . Or maybe the first . - Reverend Collins ? - You can call meJack . How can I help you ? We 're looking for this man . He may have been helping out around here . Helping out ? Jarod 's a damn angel . You don 't say . Do you happen to know where he may have flown off to ? You just missed him . He packed his things and left early this morning . Jarod was staying here ? - Mm-hmm . - Oh . Hey , Max . Several parishioners offered Jarod a place to stay ... but he said he didn 't want to be any trouble . Honestly , I had forgotten this basement was here tillJarod suggested it . That 's Jarod - always with an idea . [ Collins ] He said he 'd be back in a couple of days . Actually , right now he 's already passed the border . - The border ? - As in Mexico ? Yeah . He had a line on some old pews we could get cheap . Money 's always a little short around here . As I always say , " Pray to the Lord , but buy a lottery ticket . " Take your time . Gotta go . No rest for the wicked . Well , looks like we 're too late . The place is clean . Yes , it is . Miss Parker ? Wait . Where you going ? Don 't mind us , Max . [ Broots ] What do you got ? A lottery ticket . Leave it . [ Jarod 's Voice ] Warden , I don 't think you understand . A child 's life depends on this decision . Please think carefully . Luther Ecksley was caught with 50 pounds of pure heroin . Since he 's been at my prison , he 's assaulted five of my guards . We both know he 's not a saint ... but you didn 't see his eyes when I told him he could save his son 's life . Maybe you feel that he 's undergone some spiritual awakening ... but that man owes me and the people I answer to 25 years of his life . - I am only asking for a temporary release . - What if something went wrong ? Huh ? I don 't have the jurisdiction to go after him . There are risks , granted . This boy 's life is worth it , don 't you think ? I have a responsibility to my country , to its laws . Are you hearing a word that I am saying ? Ryan 's life is in your hands . [ Sighs ] I don 't know if you can grasp the pressures of my situation . You know , the men that ran this prison before I came were sadistic . They treated those inmates like animals . Many men died , and many more were tortured in unspeakable ways . Those same sadistic men , they 're waiting for me to make a mistake ... to put them back in power . I won 't allow that to happen . - Where does that leave Ryan ? - Contact your State Department . Why don 't you petition the proper channels ? He doesn 't have that kind of time . Well , I 'm sorry . I still can 't help you . - Are those your children ? - Yes . And what if it was for one of them ? As I said , I can 't help you . But if you 're forced to resort to more extreme measures ... I 'd understand . - [ Buzzes ] - [ Man ] Yes , ma 'am . Take inmate Ecksley back to his cell . He has the afternoon loading detail in the compound today . - [ Man ] Sí , señora . - Good-bye , Jarod . Good luck . - Hi , Cindy . It 's Jarod . - Did you find Luther ? I 'm working on it . How 's Ryan ? The doctors aren 't telling me everything , but I know it 's bad . We 're running out of time . I can 't lose him , Jarod . I know , but you have to be strong . Have you told your husband the truth about Luther ? I tried . I really tried . I just - I don 't wanna hurt him . It 's going to hurt him a lot worse if he finds out the truth from somebody else . He loves you . Trust in that . The rest will take care of itself . [ Beeps ] [ Ted ] You okay ? Will you shut the door , honey ? We need to have a talk . [ Broots ] Ha . Talk about a bad dude . The mug shot you found is three years old . The guy 's name is Luther Ecksley . He 's doing 25 years in a Mexican prison . Says here he was running drugs across the border until an anonymous source ... tipped off the Mexican police . He 's not a nice guy . Why would Jarod be involved with someone like this ? Let 's ask Luther . Thanks for kind of being my dad for the weekend . Do you believe in redemption , Jarod ? I can 't lose him , Jarod . If you were forced to resort to more extreme measures - - Redemption - - Thanks for kind of being my dad . - I can 't lose him . - I 'd understand . [ Clattering ] [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Speaking Spanish ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] Do you want to get out of here ? Hell , yes . Redemption doesn 't come easy . [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Horn Honking ] Come on . [ Laughing ] We did it . I can 't believe it . I 'm free ! It 's only temporary . Don 't you forget that . You , uh , you got a plan to get me back to the States ? Drive back roads on the way to Tijuana . Try to blend in to tourist traffic . I have a change of clothes for you in this car , and I made you a fake passport . Thought of everything , didn 't you ? There 's no room for mistakes , and no time . [ Groans ] Appreciate you springing me there , Jarod . The truth is , I could give a damn whether that kid lives or dies . [ Laughing ] [ Groans ] Aw , damn it ! [ Broots ] Miss Parker , it looks like they 're locking down the whole prison . - [ Siren Blaring ] - [ Warden Speaking Spanish ] [ Spanish ] How long do you think you can continue to hold us here ? You 've wasted an hour of my time already . Nobody enters or leaves until we 've completed a thorough search of this prison . For all I know , you could be involved in this escape . That 's ridiculous . I told you already - he did it . You arrived in my office asking for Ecksley ... at the very moment that he was discovered missing . For all I know , you could be part of a diversion . An incredibly moronic one . Why would we have stayed behind ? Why was he found outside , hiding in a car ? Oh , Broots - He 's always hiding . He 's like a cockroach . Turn on the light , he runs . Broots , tell her . [ Stammering ] It - She 's right . Roach city . [ Sighs ] If you 'll be patient a while longer - One of the guards we talked to overheard Jarod saying ... One of the guards we talked to overheard Jarod saying ... something about needing a kidney donor for a little boy . Do you know what boy , or where ? - That 's the first I 've heard of it . - [ Whispering ] [ Warden Speaking Spanish ] - [ Spanish ] - Huh ? - [ Spanish ] - Sit . Hang on , baby . [ Whispering ] Mommy loves you . Ted . - You didn 't get Luther ? - Not yet . You told Ted the truth . Yeah , I don 't blame him for hating me . I hate myself . He doesn 't hate you . It 's just going to take him some time to adjust . Yesterday I woke up with this near-perfect life . Now my son is dying and my husband - Cindy , you have to remain strong ... for Ryan . Everything is going to work out - I know it is . [ Broots ] I found them . There are over a dozen emergency cases nationwide ... but only one is a young boy in need of a kidney . - Where ? - San Diego . Get us back to San Diego , pronto . [ Blues ] Hundred dollars on Earl . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - No , no , no , no . - [ Ringing Continues ] This is Ray . [ Luther ] Ray , my boy . - How you doing ? - Luther ? The one and only . I hear you 're doing real good with my operation . [ Ray ] Uh , I 'm doing okay . [ Luther ] Just okay , huh ? I got some news that 'll make your day . See , I took a little vacation from my permanent vacation , Ray . Surprise . I 'm out . I 'm back , and you 're the first person I thought to call . I can 't wait to see you , buddy . Ray ? - Ray ? You still there ? - Well , yeah , I 'm here . Well , you and me gotta get together . I need to see where we stand and what our next move should be . How 's , uh - How 's midnight ? - Mission Bay Hilton . - Tonight ? - Uh , what 's the hurry ? - Ray - Three years ago , some son of a bitch tipped off the Mexican police ... and got me locked away . Now I 'm guessing that same son of a bitch has my $ 10 million . So you can understand why I 'm a little impatient , can 't you ? Bring some old clothes , Ray . When we find this bastard ... it is gonna get messy . [ Man ] You look like you 'vejust seen a ghost , Ray . Whoa . You just seem a little bit jumpy , Ray . But I guess you would be , being a marked man , after all . What the hell are you talking about ? Was that Luther on the phone ? What did he want ? Tell you that he was back in town ? - Wanted to fire up the old partnership ? - What ? He 's setting you up , Ray . But I guess that 's only fair - payback . After all , it was you that tipped off the federales ... and had your old buddy Luther arrested at the border . Screw you . I went down to Hermosillo . I was at his trial every day , like a friend . Or somebody who wanted to look like a friend . Personally , I think it was overkill . I 'll bet you Luther thought the same thing . You 're out of your mind . Am I ? Look over my shoulder down the alley . You see that car down there ? That 's Luther , and he 's waiting for you . He 's playing you , Ray . He knows you 're gonna lead him to the money . When you do , he 's gonna blow your brains out . Now you better do exactly what I tell you to do ... or you 're never going to walk out of this alive . [ Grunts , Groans ] [ Gunshots ] So now what ? We 're going to lead Luther to where you hid the money just like he expects . This better work , man , or we 're both dead . Just keep driving . Make sure you follow my plan . Oh , this is crazy . [ Jarod ] Find a good hiding place , Ray ... and when I make my move , you make yours . Showtime . [ Luther ] Ray ? Give it up , Ray . I know you 're the one who stole my $ 10 million . - [ Clattering ] - [ Luther ] Oh , I get it . Wanna play a little hide-and-seek , huh ? - [ Clattering ] - Ray ? Might as well come out . I ain 't leaving without my money . - Getting tired of this , Ray . - Oh , Luther ? Jarod ? - Surprise . - I saw Ray shoot you in the alley . - That was part one of my plan . - Oh , yeah ? What 's part two ? - Ray . - [ Grunts ] I tried to warn him . Well , there 's plenty of money for both of us . Oh , yeah . I 'll take that , Ray . What ? This is my money . I stole it fair and square . I know a little church that deserves it a lot more than you do . I should have shot you when I had the chance . You 're right . Thanks . [ Jarod ] Come on , Luther . Wake up . We 've still got some work to do . [ Groans , Coughs ] Disconcerting , isn 't it ? Waking up in pain , not knowing where you are . That 's how I felt in Mexico . That 's how your son feels in his hospital room . What the hell are you doing ? - Are you out of your mind ? - Would you quit moving around ? - You 're gonna knock your I.V. Out . - This isn 't a hospital . Well , it 'll do - for what I need it for . - You 're not even a doctor ! - Technically , you 're right ... but I do enjoy that E.R. program . - You can 't do this ! - Well , that 's the beauty of it , Luther . You see ... I can . Nighty-night . [ Woman On P.A. ] Dr. Roberts , extension 15 . Dr. Roberts , extension 15 . Cindy . I just spoke to the nurse . The kidney seems to be taking . I think he 's gonna be just fine . I 've gotta call my parents . Jarod , thank you so much for everything that you have done . Thank you . - Your son 's going to make it . - My son ? For nine years I 've been living a lie - thinking I was someone I wasn 't . Were you ? I see that boy 's face when he looks at you . The way he talks about you . You don 't understand . I do . Right now you 're angry , and you 're hurt , and you 're confused . But if you leave that boy without a father - if you walk away from him now - That 's a wound that will never heal . If there 's ever anything I can do for you - [ No Audible Dialogue ] It 's funny that you should mention that . Gotten by us ? We 've been here the entire time . Pipe down . [ Whispering ] These people are afterJarod . Excuse us , Mr. And Mrs. Wells ? He was here , wasn 't he ? Jarod ? Helped you ? I don 't know anyone named Jarod . My wife and I are just waiting for our son to get out of surgery . So if you 'll excuse us , we 'd like to be left alone . [ Broots ] You know what I don 't get ? I checked the records here . There 's no Luther Ecksley . Whatever happened to him ? [ Warden ] What do you think , Dr. Mendoza ? Whoever did this certainly knew what they were doing . Yes , he did . Let 's prepare to transfer the prisoner . [ Groans ]

 Gosh , go home , harold . I 'm not done yet . Harold , you hear me ? You should 've gone home already . I 'm not done yet . For cryin ' out loud . This ain 't so difficult . I 'm not done yet ! Harold , it 's past your bedtime . It 's okay . And the doctors will be worried about you . You did a good job today . Now you go home . Come on . Thirty-seven , forty-five , sixty-three , seventy-one , eighty-six , ninety-two . What the hell ? Geez ! Oh , my god ! Oh , my god ! Oh ! I 'll get help ! Oh ! Officer ! Officer ! Go on , sir . This don 't involve you . There 's a woman inside . She 's bleeding . She 's ... my god . That 's her ! That 's the girl i saw . Hey , scully ! Take a look at this . What am i looking at ? The pin setter . See the way it 's wedged and broken ? Yeah . Mr. Pintero said that would only happen if considerable weight was placed on it from above . - This is where you saw the body ? - Yes , ma 'am . She was caught up in the machinery . Her neck was cut . And the blood from the victim was pooling where ? Right here . But both the body and the blood were gone when you returned ? Yeah ! But like , like i said , the woman in the parking lot ... was the same woman that you saw caught up in the machinery ? That 's right . Look , i 'm not making this up . No one 's suggesting that you are , mr . Pintero . I saw the look on her face . Can i ask you a favor ? Can i get a soda ? A cola ? Something like that ? Sure , yeah . What is that " look , " scully ? I would 've thought that after four years , you 'd know exactly what that " look " was . You don 't believe in ghosts ? You 're saying that what this man saw was the victim 's ghost ? Sounds more like a disembodied soul . Which is just another name for a ghost . Except according to mr . Pintero , this one was trying to communicate . She was speaking to him as if she was trying to tell him something . It sounds more like a death omen . A death omen ? Yeah . It 's a spirit being that arrives as a harbinger of death . This is the third reported sighting in as many weeks . And as many murders . Each time the victim appearing near the crime scene trying to communicate , to say something . Communicate what ? I don 't know yet , but ... thank you . If you hold on a second , i may have an answer for you . Hey ! What are you doin ' ? " She is me . " - What ? - Written onto the wax . " She is me . " look at this . Three victims . All women . All approximately the same age , height , weight , hair and eye color . All attacked within the same six-block area of each other . Our f.b.i. Profiling model ... suggests a white male , late 20s , early 30s . His victims were probably strangers to him . Symbols representing other women in his life . Perhaps all women . - Hey , you , in the back ? Are we boring you ? - No , not at all . Because if you have nothing to contribute to this profile ... i do have something to add . I think that following the f.b.i. Model in this case , will not only fail to turn up the killer , but will undoubtedly lead to more victims and more deaths . You want to tell us who you are and what you base that on ? I 'm special agent mulder . This is agent scully . We 're from the f.b.i. We 're here following up a lead that seems to have been dropped . A statement made by the proprietor of the bowling alley ... the guy who claims he saw the victim . No , no , not the victim . Her apparition . What the irish call a fetch . What is more commonly known as a wraith . Oh ! Okay . - Were there any written messages in any of these other cases ? - Written messages ? Do the words , " she is me " have any meaning to you ? You mean penny timmons' last words . Those were her dying words ? According to a 911 call we received ... who made that call ? - A nut . - What do you mean ? There were no dying words . Penny timmons ' larynx was severed . She couldn 't cry for help even if there was help to cry for . And no one followed up on this lead ? No . - I 'll have someone get you the number and you can follow up . - I 'd appreciate that . People ? People ? Listen up now . I brought some folks who want to talk with you . Nurse innes , could you gather the group ? All right , everyone , let 's go . You know the drill . Get your seats . Group seating . Go on in . Harold ? Come on . Harold . - Good morning , everybody . - Good morning , mr . Alpert . I brought visitors today . They 're investigating a crime . It 's okay . They just want to ask you a few questions . Hi . I wanted to ask ... if anybody used the pay phone in the hallway on friday night ? Because somebody called the police and reported a murder . Sloppy joe night . That was sloppy joe night . Ooh ! That was me . I did it . I admit it . I did it . I 'm just a human being after all . Chuck , tell the truth . Nah . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean it . I lied . I lied , but i 'm just a human being . Has anyone used the pay phone ... to call the police ? Anybody recognize this woman ? That 's the lady that got murdered . Yeah , she 's the one . i recognize her . I know her . She was murdered . And does anybody recognize this man ? - Oh , yes . Yes , he did it . - He did it . - He 's the murderer . - He 's a very funny man . - He smiles a lot . Uh ... The quiet man in the back . Harold spuller . The only one who didn 't raise his hand . Yeah . Has he ever been a problem ? Harold ? No ! He has a tendency to get a little worked up . Do you think i can talk to him ? Yeah , sure . All right . I think i found something here , mulder . In these photos taken by the forensics team , the third victim , her left hand , that band of pale skin ? It looks like she wore a ring on that hand . A wedding ring , yeah . Yeah , but she wasn 't married . So what , he stole her ring ? No , not at all . He switched it . And in all the other murders , he repeated the same ritual . Changing the ring on each of the victims . Nice catch , scully . Any idea about the psychology at work ? There 's something called ego dystonia , a form of obsessive compulsive disorder , where a person has the persistence and inescapable impulses ... to change things , to organize , to reorganize . But it 's not ordinarily something that escalates to a murderous impulse . Not ordinarily , unless there was a more complex psychology at work ... like pronounced mental illness . You really think that the killer is a patient here ? I 'm not sure the killer is here . But the person that made that phone call is . I think his name is harold spuller . Did he cop to making the call ? No . He 's about to . I don 't know anything . I didn 't do anything . Leave me alone . You made that phone call , didn 't you , harold ? No . Did you say the words , " she is me " ? No . Have you ever heard those words ? No ! Have you ever seen a ghost , harold ? No . No . No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No , no , no , no , no ! Harold , down . No , no , no , no , please leave me alone . Don 't , harold . Leave me alone ! No , no , no , no ! No , no , no , no , no ! Harold , listen to me . When you 're right , you 're right . Seventeen , thirty , thirty-seven , forty-five , fifty-three . Harold spuller suffers from pervasive developmental disorder ... where they 're sometimes called atypical autism . He has spent his entire life in and out of facilities just like this one . He has been medicated , he has received shock therapy , and aside from his other disabilities , he has been diagnosed with severe ego dystonic obsessive compulsive disorder , which would explain the switching of the victims ' rings . So why all of a sudden ? You mean what made him snap ? I think his outburst clearly showed a frustrated impulse towards violence ... when he was put in a challenging situation . That outburst didn 't come until after i 'd asked him if he 'd ever seen a ghost . Mulder , the man is disturbed . You could see the pressure building in him from the moment the interview began . Yeah . Why are you now so unconvinced that harold spuller is the man we came looking for ? I 'm sure harold spuller 's the man that made that phone call . But what led us to him , it still remains unexplained . - " She is me " ? - Mm-hmm . And the other apparitions . Like the one mr . Pintero saw at the bowling alley . I think i have an idea about that , if not an explanation . Harold spuller is at this facility voluntarily , which means he can come and go as he pleases . To kill those women , or to hold down a job or both . Oh , scully . Yeah , it 's okay . You sure ? Yeah , it 's just ... i 'm fine . I just need to find a washroom . Scully ? Scully , you in there ? Yeah . They found another victim . A college student with her throat cut , just about half a block from here . Her name was lauren heller , age 21. she was single . Apparently she was on her way home from a bar that she part-timed at after school . She had a ring on her left hand . It was switched to her right hand . The pinkie finger . She was dead less than an hour when she was found . That would rule out harold spuller as the killer . No , actually it doesn 't . Harold 's not at the home . He 's nowhere to be found . His nurse locked him in his room after we left , but he managed to escape unnoticed . I don 't imagine he 'd be too hard to find . Yeah , but we should be the ones to find him . If only to find out what " she is me " means . Mulder ... What ? I think i 'm gonna let you take care of that . I , uh , i think i 'm gonna get this checked out . Just , you know , just to be safe . You want me to drive you ? No , no , no . I 'm fine , really . I 've had the doctors keep a close watch , and this is just a precaution . You 're sure ? I 'm fine . Bye . Nine , seventeen , twenty-six , thirty-two ... No . I just want to be left alone . We 've spoken about your fear . You 've been afraid to express it to others . To agent mulder . - This is different . - How ? Several months ago , i was diagnosed with a cancerous mass . A nasal pharyngeal tumor that cannot be operated on , and cannot be treated by conventional medicine . I 'm sorry . I don 't mean for this to sound too dire . My health has been good . I have been checked up on a weekly basis . You 've kept working ? Yes . It 's been important to me . Why ? Why ? Um ... agent mulder has been concerned . He 's been supportive through this time . Do you feel that you owe it to him to continue working ? No . I guess i never realized ... how much i rely on him before this . His passion . He 's been a great source of strength that i 've drawn on . What happened last night , dana ? I saw something . And i don 't know what to trust . If i saw it because of the stress ? Because the image had been suggested to me ? Or if it was a suggestion of my own fears ? Your fear of failing him ? Maybe . What did you see ? I saw a woman who had recently been murdered . But i saw her . It appeared as if she was trying to tell me something . Do you know what ? No . Are you sure ? Hey , you 're back . Yeah . I 'm looking for harold spuller . Harold ? What for ? Suspicion of murder . You think harold killed those women ? You obviously don 't think so , huh ? Harold 's worked for me for ten years . He might be crazy , but he couldn 't kill anyone . He 's a sweet kid . Yeah . You know where he is now ? He was here this morning when i arrived , arranging the shoes . He has a key ? No , he 's got some damn way of gettin ' in through an abandoned building next door . Did you ever get lane six working ? No . Not since i saw the girl . Harold ? Harold ? Harold , i just want to talk to you . Harold ? She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . Harold ? She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . Eight , seventeen , thirty , thirty-seven . I wanna make this clear from the start . My client is suffering from a mental disorder which impairs his judgment . He will not answer any questions regarding his guilt or innocence . I 'd be real happy if he 'd quit talking right now . Anytime harold becomes upset or unwilling to cooperate , this interrogation will end . Detective hudak ? Tell me why you did it , harold , huh ? Come on . Tell me why you killed those women . What did i just say ? This is totally unacceptable . I am prepared to tell my client not to cooperate . Harold , you knew those women who were murdered , didn 't you ? That 's why you 're scared . You 're afraid they 've come back to visit you . Penny timmons . Eight , seventeen , thirty , thirty-seven , forty-five , fifty-three , seventy-one , eighty , ninety-two , ninety-nine , one-oh-eight . Mrs. Schipiro . Fourteen , twenty-nine , thirty-eight , fifty-seven , seventy-one , seventy-nine , eighty-eight , one hundred and one , one hundred and seventeen . Michelle chamberlain . Seventeen , thirty-two , forty-nine , sixty-nine , seventy-eight , eighty-seven , ninety-nine . What was her shoe size ? - Six-and-a-half . - There you have it . - This is not a confession . - He killed them . - Harold , listen . I 'm advising you not to respond ... - he stalked them , fixated ... nor to cooperate with this investigation any further ! Harold , there are people that think you murdered these women . I 'm not one . But i need your help for me to prove that . You think you can do that ? I think you can . Mr. Pintero , i 'd like to search the building for any ways in or out , that harold might have of the bowling alley . Sure . Thanks . You okay , harold ? The shoes are out of order , mr . Pintero . I 'm sorry . Hey , it 's okay , buddy . Don 't you worry about it . You get this straightened out with these folks , then come back and keep me in line . Okay , mr . Pintero . I wanna know why the hell we 're being led around like this ? I 'm hoping it will become clear to us when we find it . Is that right ? He 's gonna show us something that 's gonna exonerate him ? I think so . Here . Here what ? My god , they 're all here . Every victim . This proves nothing . - He fixated on them . I see hundreds of scorecards up here . Thousands of names . Choose a name . Pick a name . Pick any name up there . Fred graham . Seventeen , forty-two , sixty-seven , eighty-eight , one hundred and seven , one hundred and twenty-two , one hundred and thirty-one , one hundred and sixty-six , - one hundred and seventy-eight , two hundred and one . - Two hundred game . Not bad . You 're saying he has all these scores in his head ? Including the victims . You said this proves his innocence . How ? I 'm not sure exactly , but i think that ... no ! No ! No , no , no ! Breathe ! One , two , three , four , five . Breathe . He just keeled . Fell right over . I 've done all i can . Must 've been a heart attack . Hey , scully . Is it too late ? No . What are you doing , mulder ? I need your help on something . I needed your medical expertise . On what ? Harold spuller . Oh ! I 'm sorry . I didn 't even ask you . What did your doctor say ? I 'm fine . Good . What 's up , mulder ? Angie pintero , the bowling alley guy ? He 's dead . How ? Natural causes . Congestive heart failure . Just keeled over . That 's what you need my medical opinion on ? No . Harold spuller had a premonitory vision of his boss 's death . I don 't understand . Harold saw an apparition . What may have been angle pintero 's disembodied soul ... at the moment of or just prior to his death . How do you know ? Because i was standing right there when he saw it . But you didn 't see it yourself ? No . Why ? I don 't have that facility . That kind of connection to the victims that would have made such a vision possible . What 's harold spuller 's connection ? I don 't know its exact nature , but i think it has something to do with his autism . That harold experienced a profound attachment to these victims , but because of his disability , was unable to express ... the depth and power of those relationships . So somehow a psychic or preconscious bond was formed that went beyond the temporal . Whoa , wait a minute . So harold knew the people that were killed ? Yeah , from the bowling alley . Going back seven years . Even if what you 're saying is true , harold wasn 't the only one who claims to have seen these apparitions . No . But he does have something in common with those who 've had the visions ... that is quite powerful in its own right . Which is what ? They were all dying . Um , one of emphysema , one of cancer and , uh , now angie pintero . Harold spuller 's dying too ? Well , that 's what i need your medical opinion on . - Well , what if he isn 't ? - I would be very surprised . What is a death omen if not a vision of our own mortality ? And who among us would most likely be able to see the dead ? Harold 's at the resident home right now . I 'll meet you there . Harold ? Agent mulder will be sending a doctor to examine you . well , you 're back . It 's gonna be all right now , harold . They just want us to keep you here for a little checkup . There 's nothing to worry about . Thanks , officers . All right , chuck . Go to bed . You can see harold in the morning . See ? Everyone 's so glad to see you back , harold . You 'll be able to talk to chuck in the morning . You still have to take your meds though , harold . Keeps you flyin straight and level . Eighty , eighty-eight , ninety-two , ninety-nine . Come on . It 's the way we always do it . Seventy-eight , eighty-seven . Attaboy . Good stuff . Hi . Lucas brought him back . Is he acting up ? - No ! I think he 's just a little scared . I 've been tryin ' to get him to take his meds . Fourteen , twenty-nine , thirty-seven . Why don 't you let me sit with him for a bit ? Okay , sure . Take your poison , harold . Go on . What 've you got to live for now , huh ? What did you tell them , harold ? Fifty-nine . Did you tell them about your little girlfriends ? Huh ? Did you tell them how you were in love ? No ! Did you show them your pictures ? No . What do you think those girls thought of you , harold ? Do you think they loved you back ? No one could love you , harold . Look at yourself . They looked at you and saw an ugly toad , a retard . Agent mulder . Thanks for accommodating us again . Not a problem . We 're all concerned for harold . I understand . You 're bringing a doctor ? Agent scully 's a doctor . If you could arrange to have harold 's medical records made available ... Oh ! What 's happened to you ? Oh ! Don 't touch that . Don 't touch that . It 's just a cut . He just went wacko . I was tryin ' to get him to take his meds and he went berserk . He jumps me , he starts pounding me like he wants to kill me . Did he say anything ? No , he just started screaming like a lunatic . Something 's gone wrong with him . I think he 's lost it for good . I 'll be damned if i 'm gonna take care of him anymore . I think you should get this cut on your head looked at . Maybe just give me a few minutes to get my nerves back . Okay , everybody , everything 's fine now . Come on , back to bed . That 's right , dear . Go on now . We 'll see you in the morning . Night-night , everybody . What can i do to help ? Call the police . Ask for detective hudak . Tell him what happened . Tell him to look for harold down at the bowling alley . Are they gonna arrest him ? I don 't see that there 's any way around that . I 'm sorry . Maybe you were wrong . Well , that 's a superficial head wound , scully . He didn 't mean to kill her or maim her . That 's not the work of a murderer if you ask me . Then why would he do it ? Maybe harold is sicker than we thought he was . Maybe . We won 't know until we can examine him . I think there 's someone you can talk to about it . Why don 't you talk to his roommate , and i 'll see what i can do about finding harold . Oh , hi . Is your name chuck ? Yes . Yes , it is . Chuck forsch . F-o-r-s-c-h . Chuck forsch . Do you share this room with harold ? Yes , he 's my friend . Do you know where he is ? He 's dying , isn 't he ? Harold is dying . Why do you say that ? Nurse innes . She 's , she 's trying to poison him . Who told you that ? Harold . He said she told him she was putting poison in his meds . Harold hasn 't been taking his medication ? I don 't know . I don 't know everything . I 'm only a human being . But i do know that ... that harold 's my friend . He wouldn 't hurt anybody . You know , he really loved them . Who ? Harold , he gave them to me . He was afraid . Does anybody else know about these pictures , chuck ? Nurse innes . How are you feeling ? I 'm , you know , shaky . Understandable . Working with these people , it starts driving you crazy too . I 'm just looking forward to going home . - Will your family be a comfort ? - I live alone . No children ? Just the one my husband ran off with . Nurse innes , i 'm afraid i 'm going to have to ask you to step out into the hallway . Stay where you are ! Drop it ! Let it go ! She 's alive . Let 's get a paramedic in here . Yeah . You 're cut . Yeah , she attacked me . You might wanna bag that . I 'm pretty sure it 's the murder weapon . She had been taking harold 's meds ... clonazepam and clozapine ... the unregulated effects of which are violence and unpredictable behavior . Yeah , but why did you even suspect her ? I went in to talk to harold 's roommate , and he said that harold thought she had been poisoning him . So i went in to confront her and she just went off . Why do you think she killed those women ? I don 't know . I mean , maybe in some drug-addled way , she was trying to kill happiness . Harold 's happiness . His love for those women . Maybe trying to destroy something she thought she 'd never have again . " She is me . " I don 't know . Have they found harold ? Yeah . They found him in an alley a few blocks from here , face down on the pavement . They worked on him for 20 minutes , but he couldn 't be revived . What happened ? Well , preliminary diagnosis is apnea : Respiratory failure . As a result of what ? The paramedics are at a loss to explain that . But if what you 're saying is true , that harold stopped taking his medication , then that could have been a factor in his death . At least in the visions that he was seeing . Harold spuller wasn 't dying . He was killed as a result of what that woman took away from him . Is that your medical opinion ? - I saw something , mulder . - What ? The fourth victim . I saw her in the bathroom before you came to tell me . Why didn 't you tell me ? Because i didn 't want to believe it . Because i don 't want to believe it . Is that why you came down here ? To prove that it wasn 't true ? No . I came down here because you asked me to . Why can 't you be honest with me ? What do you want me to say ? That you 're right ? That i believe it , even if i don 't ? Is that what you want ? - Is that what you think i want to hear ? - No . You can believe what you want to believe , but you can 't hide the truth from me . Because if you do , then you 're working against me . And yourself . I know what you 're afraid of . I 'm afraid of the same thing . The doctor said i was fine . I hope that 's the truth . I 'm going home . I made this .

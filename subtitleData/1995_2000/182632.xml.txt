 Afternoon , ma 'am , and a fine afternoon it is . Yes , sirree . Is the man of the house about ? MRS. CABOT : What do you want from us ? Only your patience , ma 'am . Only the virtue of your forbearance . Fine-Iooking children , ma 'am . Yes , sirree . Deserving of all your hopes and dreams on the New Frontier far away from this Harsh Realm . Transportation 's included , ma 'am . You just leave us alone . Maybe this is something I should take up with the husband . Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Don 't ! Go back ! No ! Not another step ! Right there ! - So , what 's the bounty on my head ? - Huh ? [ WHIRRING ] How much ? How much you getting for me ? I 'm looking for a soldier you served with . - Friend of yours . - You can go to hell . We 'll talk later . HOBBES : A world exists exactly like ours . You live in this world . Your family and friends . And though you may not know it , I was sent to save you . It 's just a game . HOBBES : They call it the New Frontier , but it 's nothing less than a battleground . A place where free men live on the edge of a razor in this place called Harsh Realm . Like me , these people are on the run . And though I know none of it is real , that it is only a virtual world I 'm in there 's fear in the air here . I can taste it feel it in my lungs , as pure as anything I 've ever felt . I 'm living day to day trying to make sense of all this , trying to stay strong . Trying my best just to stay alive . I 'm in the company of a soldier , a man sent here on a mission like mine who saved my life , for which I am now in his debt as I am to a woman who doesn ' t speak but who healed me with a miracle when I might have died . [ DOG BARKING ] Keep a real close eye on him . If you 're not careful , somebody 's gonna eat that dog . HOBBES : We 're on the run from Omar Santiago a renegade soldier who hijacked the computer program that runs this world . It was Santiago the military sent me here to kill . Their fear of him is real and great though I have yet to understand why , if all this is just imaginary . PINOCCHIO : We 'd like to buy some gas . You guys know anybody selling gas ? HOBBES : They say this is a re-creation of the real world down to every man , woman and child each of us with a double here who can live or die in the virtual reality of Harsh Realm . [ CRYING ] Only those of us plugged into the program know this have any consciousness of the truth : That it 's only a game . I pray that 's all it is , Sophie . I watched you die here , never to exist again in Harsh Realm . I 'm doing everything in my power to find my way out to find my way home . You said you 'd have an answer . I need answers from somebody . I 'm afraid I don 't have any . MAN : Corporal . It 's okay . Miss Green , please . - Won 't you have a seat ? SOPHIE : Pardon me I 've been trying to get somebody to tell me what happened to my fiancé . - I understand . No , I don 't think you do . You got no answers because we had none yet to give . - Tom 's whereabouts were classified . - He left the house with your men was told to pack a bag on the orders of his C.O. I 'm not a troublemaker . What I 'm trying to say , Miss Green , is that I have an answer . It came across my desk this morning . " On April 1 st , Lieutenant Hobbes was given a mission involving a sensitive military objective . In the prosecution of his orders , it has been learned that Lieutenant Hobbes ... " No . Lieutenant Hobbes was killed in action . Further information is classified . We 'll be transporting the body home immediately . We would like to offer our condolences . WOMAN : Hey . I hear you 're looking for gas . Yeah . But if you 're looking for protection , I ain 't no one 's daddy . I got my protection . You want to buy gas or you don 't ? - How you paying ? - Ammo . Six rounds . I 'll pay at the pump . What the hell is this ? [ GUN COCKS ] [ CHUCKLES ] [ GUNSHOTS ] [ GROANS ] You . Long as you 're here , why not check the oil and tires ? Yes , sir , Mr. Pinocchio . No ! Please don 't take the children ! - No ! - Mom ! [ MRS. CABOT SOBBING ] MRS. CABOT : No ! Don 't take my babies ! No ! WATERS : General Santiago . - What does the woman say , major ? - Says she doesn 't know Mike Pinocchio . She says her husband was taken from here by a bounty hunter . I think she 's telling the truth . Well , then we should show some mercy . GILOVICH : To give your life in defense of a principle is to sanctify life . To consecrate the soul to honor those lives which gave life . As he protected and defended the many Thomas enriched the lives of everyone he knew or who knew him . None more than Sophie , his beloved bride-to-be . Sophie has asked me to read this today to honor Thomas and their love , which carries on . [ MAN SHOUTING ] GILOVICH : " You live in me for as long as I live . You are the life which does not die . Through me , you speak . Our love is everlasting . " Please accept our country 's flag as a token of appreciation for Thomas ' faithful service to his country . May God be with you and your family in your time of grief . WOMAN : I 'm sorry to bother you here . I know that this is a difficult time for you . I met Tom briefly just before he disappeared . Who are you ? I can 't tell you too much . Just that you 've been misled . About what ? About Tom 's death . Why are you doing this ? I 'm taking a chance by telling you now . I couldn 't come to you sooner . You have to find out the facts on your own . You 're telling me Tom 's not dead ? I 'm only telling you that you 've accepted a lie as the truth . SOPHIE : What is this ? I don 't know anyone named Mike Pinocchio . Somebody does . What the hell happened here ? Over here . BOUNTY HUNTER 2 : Get in there ! [ GROANING ] Okay , Hercules , I get the drill . [ GROANS ] - Hey , hey , hey , that thing hurts . Hey ! - Huh ? [ WHIRRING ] - What did he say ? - GI said he 's gonna pay for that . CABOT : Pinocchio , is that you ? Who 's that ? CABOT : Cabot . John Cabot . Johnnie . What happened to you ? Same as you . Bounty hunter 's gonna turn us over to Santiago . He 's been looking for you . They beat me , Mike . I wouldn 't talk , but when they threatened my family ... They got lucky , is all . I 'm gonna get us out of here . HOBBES : One man . They got nothing . [ DEXTER WHIMPERS ] I want to go in as bad as you . We don 't know for sure if he 's in there . We 'll go in at nightfall . [ GROWLS ] [ DEXTER WHIMPERING ] How the hell did you get in here ? You 're gonna blow it , you stupid mutt . Just get out of here . Get ! Get ! [ WHIMPERING ] Looks like we got rats . [ DEXTER WHIMPERING AND BARKING ] Dexter ! [ WHIMPERING ] Thank you very much . [ LOCK CLICKS ] We 're out of here , Johnnie . The rest of your party 's arrived . PINOCCHIO : What the hell were you doing ? - I was trying to get you out . - Who asked you to do that ? I owed you . You are one stupid ... BOUNTY HUNTER 2 : Who taught you this ? - You did . - Huh ? What ? - What does he want with you ? - The price on my head . - From who ? - Who do you think ? Santiago ? How long are you gonna run from this man ? You call me stupid . I 'm prepared to finish my mission . At least I 'm willing to fight . [ WHIRRING ] And what mission is that ? What 's your name , boy ? You 're looking for Mike Pinocchio . A bounty to the man who brings General Santiago his head . And for the head of Tom Hobbes ? [ CHILDREN YELLING ] Hi . Can I help you ? I hope so . My name is Sophie Green . My fiancé , Tom Hobbes , was an officer at Fort Dix . What happened to him ? He was killed in action . That 's what I was told . I 'm sorry . But why come to me ? I was given these dog tags . They belonged to a soldier named Mike Pinocchio . I 'm trying to find information on him but the military won 't help me , and he has no immediate family . - Your husband served with him . - My husband was killed in action . That 's what I was told . That 's John with Mike Pinocchio in Kuwait during the Gulf War . Those men have all disappeared . - All of them ? - Killed in action on classified assignments involving sensitive military objectives . I pounded on doors until I was blue in the face . I wrote my senator , the V.A. , the Pentagon . I got no clear answers . Nothing . But this is ... It 's beyond coincidence . It 's beyond belief . That 's what I kept telling them . It doesn 't do any good . Somebody knows about this . Somebody gave me these dog tags because they want me to find out . I hope you 're right . After all this time I tell myself and my family maybe it 's best just believing they might all be dead . Mom ? I hope I never have to tell my family the same thing . HOBBES : These were fighting men . U.S. Soldiers trained to be the best . But they are broken now living a fugitive existence . Who knows of this ? Do their loved ones have any idea of this world ? Do you , my dearest Sophie ? Shut up , Hobbes . - I didn 't say anything . - Yeah , well , I feel you thinking . Your dog won 't eat . Put a leash on me , honey . I 'll eat anything you want . Shut up . PINOCCHIO : I offend your honor ? - You don 't have to talk like that . She 's a thug 's whore . She 'll sell your dog for hamburger if she can ever fatten it up . I would never hurt an animal . She 's got no problem putting our heads in the chopper . Come here , little dog . HOBBES : Please . Please , we could use some water . Big Daddy told me not to . These men are hurt . PINOCCHIO : You 're wasting your time , Hobbes . - She 'll bring us some water . - For what , a kind word ? This is Harsh Realm . Kindness is when your buddy robs you , shoots you , doesn 't rape your woman . Hey . Let us go . - Lf I let you go , who 'd pay us ? - There 's a nice logic there , Hobbes . What do you think will happen if you turn us over to Santiago ? What will happen to me if I let you go ? I 'd eat that dog before it gets too skinny . What is wrong with you ? It doesn 't matter , Hobbes . Can you get that through your head ? She 's VC . A virtual character . These people got no reason to help you , no moral compunction . They programmed the game . They forgot one thing . You die here , you disappear . These people know no Christian virtues . They know no god . Judgment Day in Harsh Realm is when somebody points a gun at you . Ask Johnnie . He 'll tell you . Get erased here , it 's over . These people got no notion of an afterlife . It 's not even a concept . What about the real world ? Don 't they believe in that ? PINOCCHIO : What good would it do them ? The only world they know is Santiago 's . SANTIAGO : And when we take these urban centers , our policy is this : Repatriate only the healthy and the strong . Prisoners of war drain our resources and are therefore subject to extermination . General Santiago , this is the man that wanted to see you . This man is a bounty hunter . Pay him the going rate and be done . I 've got men you 're looking for . WATERS : At ease , sergeant . Mike Pinocchio and two others . I should have you thrown out , if only for the reeking stench . Tom Hobbes . An assassin . Obviously , an ineffectual one . I give you Pinocchio as a gift . For Hobbes I ask a price . Then I should let these men go ? You only ply your dirty trade because I pay you . You only survive in Harsh Realm because I let you . - I want out of Harsh Realm . - There is no way out . Don 't give me that VC rap . My body 's on a freaking slab up there in the real world . You got a way out . I know it . A portal . If I do , sir , then you might make every effort to win my favor to repair this patronage . For I 'd then have the power to destroy you in not only one world , but in two . Bring me this Hobbes . I 'll consider your request . You know why he runs ? He wants to get out , back home , back to the real world . Last place he 's going . What are you talking about ? Pinocchio what he knows about Santiago . His final solution . Better stay alive in Harsh Realm , lieutenant . This very well might be all that 's left . - I knew you 'd come . - You 're strange . - Why ? - The way you talk to me . The way you treat me so nice and polite . It 's because you want something . All I want is to go home . I was about to be married . - What 's her name ? - Sophie . - I 've got a picture ... - Does she live in the real world ? Yeah . You know about that ? I heard you talking . I want to hear more . What 's it like there ? It 's nothing like this . Are there flowers there ? You don 't have to live like this . Hey , Daytag , where are you ? Help us . Come get this damn mutt ! [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ CLANGING ] [ DOOR OPENS ] [ GUNSHOT ] Where do you think you 're going ? We 're leaving . [ DEXTER WHIMPERING ] - I 'd like my dog . - Hobbes ! It 's my dog now . Drop the gun . Go on . Shoot me . Hobbes ... Shoot all of us . What will we be worth to you then ? You 're in charge now . I don 't see anybody telling you what to do . You 've got the power now . The power to do the right thing . Let us walk out of here . You can walk out of here too . Traffic , fast moving ! Look , I just want to go home . I just want to see my girl . MAN : First squad , go to the left . Second squad , take the back of the building . BOUNTY HUNTER 1 : Let go my ear ! Let go ! Where is he ? Where 's Hobbes ? ! BOUNTY HUNTER 1 : I don 't know . I don 't know where they are . BOUNTY HUNTER 2 : Get down here ! [ DEXTER WHIMPERS ] BOUNTY HUNTER 2 : Come here . - I want some answers here . - I don 't know anything . What ? I don 't know ! You and Santiago had a deal . - They 're here . WATERS : Fan out . Find them . Get in the vehicles , check the roads . You men , on the trail . MAN 1 : Go , go , go ! - Come on , let 's go ! MAN 2 : Move it ! Hey , quiet ! What are you doing ? We 're standing in six inches of boom-boom , in case you haven 't noticed . - She put us here to protect us . - This is protecting us ? If brains were alligators , you couldn 't get one to bite you on the ass . I convinced her to let us go . Letting us go ? Only place she 's letting us go is for a ride on this fireball . - It don 't make no ... - Shut up ! If you didn 't see nothing how come this gun 's been shot ? If you was making deals , how come you didn 't bother to tell me ? I asked you a question . Yeah , maybe you were planning on leaving and never coming back . Going to the real world . Where did you hear that ? You don 't know nothing about that . You were just gonna leave me here . You can 't go . It won 't work ! What do you know , you stupid VC ? Some guys think about going home just to see their girl . Who has been talking to her ? You have till 0600 to turn up your prisoners . I 'd hate to disappoint General Santiago . [ RATTLING ] You better hurry . They 'll be back soon . - You can 't stay here . - He 'll just hunt me down . Come on . Get in the cab . Come on . [ GUNSHOT ] [ SHOUTING ] MAN : Cut him off ! Ma 'am , can I help you ? - I can 't just let you in there . - I don 't care . Lieutenant colonel ? I 'm sorry , general . I didn 't hear what you just said . Then that 's what I 'll do , sir . - I am owed an explanation ... - You are out of line . ... because I am being lied to . - What on God 's Earth is this all about ? My fiancé , Tom Hobbes . We buried his body . All you buried was a box . - We 'll have to transport it . - No . I don 't want it taken anywhere . GILOVICH : Seen enough , Miss Green ? You did this all wrong . You should have asked me . - I don 't need your permission . - It 's not him . - That is not your fiancé 's body . - I got an inquest . Think I 'm not gonna make them run DNA ? Who do you think 's gonna run those tests ? This is insanity . No one ... How far will these people go ? One step farther than you . I can get word to him . I can deliver a message to Tom . SOPHIE : Dear Tom , I 'm writing not quite believing you 'll ever read this . But if there 's a way I hope to God this news will somehow bring you back to me . I love you , Tom . And if there 's a doubt in your heart know that our love is greater now than the both of us . I 'm pregnant , Tom . I 'm pregnant with our child . Please come home . Find a way . [ DEXTER BARKS ] GIRL : Daddy 's home ! Daddy 's here ! MRS. CABOT : Oh ! A man runs , returns and fights . What are you running from ? Why are you afraid of Santiago ? I thought you wanted to go home . I 'm not letting Santiago stop me . Either way , there 's only one sure thing . We 're gonna need gas . Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH SDH ]

 [ Man ] It 's important that you realize sonograms are by no means an exact science . I don 't wanna alarm you or have you jump to conclusions ... because , honestly , it 's not something we 're perfectly able to explain . - But I don 't see anything . - As I said , we may be premature in a diagnosis . It may simply be ... an intermediate stage of growth . But there 's a problem . We see a development : an abnormal bony formation ... involving the upper vertebrae , and something growing here on the plates of the skull . Wayne . Sweetness ? It might be nothing . I 'm serious . Dr. Couvillion really just wants to wait and see . I just want it to be normal . Ohh , Wayne . Let 's go home , okay ? Come on . Thank you . [ Switch Clicks ] I love you , Laura , no matter what . You know that , poopydoo ? I know . Good night , Wayne . Good night , Laura . Sweet dreams . - [ Roaring ] - Wayne ! Wayne ! - [ Growling ] - Wayne ! [ Whimpering ] Please . What are you doing ? No . [ Gasping ] - [ Continues Growling ] - Stop it ! Wayne , where are you ? [ Gasping , Grunting ] - Stop him ! - [ Pelvis Cracking ] - [ Baby Crying ] - Please don 't take my baby ! - [ Continues Crying ] [ Crying ] Please don 't take my baby ! - Wayne ! Wayne ! - Laura ? - My baby . - Laura , it 's okay . Laura , you 're having a dream . - Wayne- - Oh , it was terrible . - It 's okay . Shh . Ohh . Mm . [ Gasping ] It was ... trying to steal our baby . [ Whimpering ] [ Screams ] [ Horns Honking , Distant ] It 's not the kind of case where I quite know where to turn , you understand . Down in Hollins , we do get our share of the oddball . On the whole , though , we 're pretty much like any other little town . Got your home break-ins , your smash-and-grabs . Nothin ' too wild . But given the victim 's statement , the unusually vivid detail ... well , I just had to take Laura 's word about her baby being abducted . I hear you specialize in these kind of cases . You 've come to the right place , Deputy , uh , Stevens . Now , this woman making these claims , she 's your sister ? - Yes , sir . Laura Weinsider . - Mm-hmm . I 've heard the things people 've been sayin ' about her- - not to my face , of course- - but real mean and awful things about what Laura 's part is in all this . It says here a doctor 's report the day before revealed to her abnormalities in the ultrasound . Yes , sir , that is true . But nothing conclusive , mind you . I see . Okay , Deputy . We 're gonna put this right into our priority caseload . Boy , I really wanna thank you . I know Laura 's really itchin ' ... to talk to somebody who 'll really listen to her . [ Woman Over Police Radio , Indistinct ] I know this went right into your caseload , but I never imagined you 'd get here so soon , Agent- - Mulder . Fox Mulder . Though I ask you not to make that known to anybody . The F.B.I. likes our work on these cases very hush-hush . Sure . Of course . But I would like to thank Agent Spender . No , no . I 'll thank him for you , ' cause I have to call in my progress report . - I hope you have something to call in . - Me too . All right . I kept calling it a nightmare , but how many people 's nightmares come true ? Not many . Certainly not in the way yours did , Mrs. Weinsider . When I was having it ... it just seemed so real . You mentioned a fire in the room , in your account ... and a , uh- - a devil that held your legs ? - So that he could take the baby . - But according to your statement ... your baby was not a normal baby . No . It was some kind of monster ... with , um , horns and a tail . [ Sniffling ] Can you excuse me , please ? My wife appears so resilient , but I know she 's suffered ... ever since the doctor told us about the complications . Um ... you were right there in bed with your wife the whole time , Mr. Weinsider ? Wayne . Yes , I woke her up . But according to your wife 's statement ... at one point she reached over ... for you in the bed , and you--you weren 't there . - Well , it was a dream . - Yeah . You mind if I use your phone , Wayne ? Sure . Of course . Remember , your truthfulness is important , Mr. Ginsberg , and as a prospective federal employee ... I will remind you to answer as honestly as possible . - Okay ? - Sure . Fire away . Do you or have you ever smoked marijuana ? Nope . No , sirree . Have you consorted with people who have , now or in the past ? No , I really don 't think so . - [ Telephone Ringing ] - Oh . - Scully . - [ Mulder ] Scully , it 's me . Would you mind ? Mulder , where are you ? I waited 45 minutes for you this morning . I , uh- - Before I tell you , I 'm gonna ask you to keep an open mind . - This isn 't an X-File ? - Call it what you like . Down here in Roanoke , they 're calling it a demon baby snatching . - You 're in Virginia ? - Look , I want you to take a look at this woman 's charts . Strange in utero deformities were detected . I 'm gonna courier them to you , all right ? Mulder , we are supposed to be doing background checks , not chasing X-Files . Look , Scully , Spender just round-filed this case . It 's unconscionable . And what do you call rooting through his trash ? Like that 's any different from the assignment we 're stuck with ? " " We , " Mulder ? I 'm stuck with . You 're not here . Scully , this is a classic case of demon fetal harvest ... what they called in the Middle Ages atum nocturnem ... the impregnation of an unwitting woman by a dark lord of the underworld . - [ Scully Over Intercom ] As host for his demon seed . - [ Mulder ] Exactly . - I saw Rosemary 's Baby on cable the other night , Mulder . - Yeah , but this is the real deal . You check that woman 's charts , you 'll get hard evidence . Check her prenatal ultrasound . Take a look at those medical records . I think they 'll prove my theory . Wayne , have you seen my nightgown ? I can 't find- - Wayne ? Wayne ? Wayne ? [ Men Chanting ] [ Grunting , Footfalls Crunching Leaves ] Wayne ? [ Women Vocalizing ] [ Chanting Continues ] - [ Gasping ] - Laura ? - What are you doing ? - What are you doing ? - Burning leaves . - [ Sighs ] At this time of night ? Well , you asked me to rake up the yard . It was in the job jar . Hey , come on . You 're making me feel weird . - Come to bed , Wayne , please . - I will , honey . I just wanted- - I just wanted everything to look perfect when you woke up . I 'll be right in . [ Phone Ringing ] [ Phone Beeps On ] - Mulder . - [ Scully ] Mulder , I think I found what you 're looking for . I have been up all night going over the medical charts on the Weinsider baby . - What did you find ? - The prenatal birth defects that you spoke of- - - They 're all here , but they 're subtle . - Describe them to me . Well , they look to be discrete bony deformities . There are spurs on the superior aspect of the scapula ... and small protuberances on the skull adjacent to the coronal suture . - Protuberances ? Like horns ? - Well , they could be recessive characteristics ... expressed as vestiges of primitive morphology ... or a developmental anomaly like craniosynostosis . Do you think this is something that could be passed along by the father ? No , I wouldn 't look to the father as any kind of dark force here , Mulder . I think it 's the mother . And Virginia law on third trimester abortions ... requires you to put her under arrest . - What are you talking about ? - Labor was induced , Mulder . In the mother 's blood there was found a significant trace of an herb called mandrake . It 's a poison that 's been known to facilitate self-abortion . - Mandrake ? - It 's also been known to be used as an hallucinogenic . - You think Mrs. Weinsider self-prescribed ? - I called the doctor on a hunch ... and he said that the father was very upset about the news ... while the mother was quite the opposite . Look , Mulder , I 'm gonna fax this information to you so you can present it ... to the commonwealth attorney for the county of Roanoke . But I think we have your baby snatcher here . Mulder ? Yeah ? What ? Yes ? I suggest you proceed carefully . This could be very emotional for everybody concerned . - All right . Thank you . - [ Phone Beeps Off ] - What are you doing ? - Sorry . I forgot my key . - Well , where have you been ? - I told you I was gonna be on the road until Tuesday ... poopydoo . I was just so worried , Wayne . We 're getting so close now . Honey , I wouldn 't let anything happen ... not to our little bundle of joy . I 'll tell you who 's been taking hallucinogenics . She didn 't take any poison . - My sister had never even heard of whatever the hell it is . - Mandrake . Mandrake . Where would she even get such a thing ? - All I took were some herbal sleep aids . - You don 't need to say anything . Hey , why don 't you just let your sister talk ? It might clear things up . - Not without a lawyer . - She 's not under arrest . You 're damn right , she 's not . I didn 't call you here to tell me rumors I 've already heard . - My sister 's no baby killer ! - [ Door Opens ] - What 's going on ? - They 're accusing me of taking the life of our baby . - Who 's accusing you ? - Who do you think ? I don 't know where you 've been , Wayne ... but I seem to be the only one keepin the dogs from the door . - A man 's gotta make a living . - Wayne- - Mr. Weinsider , I don 't wanna arrest Laura . I 'm sure you 'd hate like the devil for that to happen , as well ? - I should say so . - So why don 't you tell Deputy Stevens ... that it 's okay to search the premises so we can clear up any misunderstanding ... about who 's responsible for what happened here . Of course . [ Officers Chattering , Shouting To Each Other ] Laura , could you come here ? Whatever else we find , I know everybody in this house is regular . I know there 's nothing they 're going to find , but why do I feel guilty anyway ? Laura , there 's something I need to tell you about that ... something that I 've kept secret for reasons that I think will explain for themselves . What ? What are you talking about ? Well , I don 't exactly know how to say this ... and I 'm sure that you might find it painful , as I do . Wayne , what ? On the night- - the night that you lost the baby ... I had gotten up because I couldn 't sleep . And when I came back to bed , you were- - You had ... our little baby in your hands . You were in some kind of trance . I couldn 't get you to wake up . - [ Women Vocalizing ] - You kept chanting over and over : " " Zazas , zazas ... nastanada , zazas , " and- - - Wayne . - All I could do was take our little boy , our little baby ... and wrap him up so I could make sure that no one could ever learn the truth . - Oh , my God . - And the other night ... when you saw me outside and I was burning the leaves- - No ! No ! [ Gasping , Crying ] Laura , I was just doing it to protect you . I knew I could never bring back our little boy ... our precious little WayneJr . , but I couldn 't bear losing you . [ Continues Crying , Whimpering ] [ Officer ] Hey , take a look at this ! I don 't know what to tell you . [ Sniffling ] All I can think- - [ Crying ] When they told me something was wrong ... that there was a problem ... was that this thing that was growing inside me was evil . I kept thinking that maybe it was something I did wrong ... and that this was my punishment . I told Wayne that everything was gonna be okay . But I lied . But you have to believe me , Arky . I didn 't mean to kill him . I didn 't know what I was doing . It was the herbal medication . - That 's all I can think . - Laura- - Laura ... I don 't think you should say anymore . I 'm gonna have to read you your rights . We 're gonna have to go down to the station and- - and do all that . I 'm sorry . You 're gonna be okay . I 'm gonna get the best attorney . [ Door Closes ] I know what you are . [ Bells Pealing ] [ Woman Over Radio ] I 'm only happy when it rains I 'm only happy when it 's complicated And though I know you can 't appreciate it - I 'm only happy when it rains - Hello ? - Hi , Betsy . It 's me . - Wayne , where are you ? - I 'm on my way . You 're late , Wayne . I 'm going without you . I wanna be there , honey . I don 't wanna be the kind of husband ... who isn 't there every step of the way . Well , you 've already missed a lot of steps already . Anyway , it 's just a sonogram . Well , you 've already missed a lot of steps already . Anyway , it 's just a sonogram . It 's not just a sonogram , honey . It 's a picture of the expression of our beautiful love . - Wayne , what have you been smoking ? - I 'm three blocks away , Betsy . I 'm gonna be pulling up in front of the house in less than five minutes . - [ Betsy ] Oh , okay . I 'll wait for you . - Okay . Five minutes . - Hey , Wayne . Where you goin ' ? - What ? - Who you talkin ' to ? - Wayne , who are you talking to ? - You seem like you 're in an awful big hurry . - Wayne ? - I 'm late for an appointment . - Really ? An appointment ? Appointment with who ? - A business client . - Wayne , I 'm hanging up now . Right . You 're in insurance , aren 't you ? That must take you on the road an awful lot . Look , I 'm an insurance medical technician , not that it 's any of your business . So where is our appointment ? How far do we have to go ? - What ? - Come on , Wayne . I 'll race ya . I only smile in the dark Oh , hi , Mrs. Britton . Wayne Weinsider . ' Member me ? Harmony Mutual Insurance ? You had an appointment to have some blood taken . - It 's for next Tuesday . - I know that , Kim . Can I call you Kim ? I was in the neighborhood , and , well , insurance isn 't something you wanna be without ... even for just a week . - What do you do with that ? - Oh , they check it out , make sure you 're not a policy risk . - Slow down , monsters . - [ Kids Laughing , Chattering ] - Those your kids ? - Why , yes . I love kids . Got a baby on the way myself . It seems like I 've been trying forever . Hold that up . Those are fine-looking boys . You don 't know how lucky you are . Two cells , with all that can go wrong , and there they are . Perfect . - You okay ? You 're not feeling faint , are you ? - No , I 'm okay . [ Horn Honking ] Can I use your phone ? [ Playful Honking ] - I want those kids out of my car . - Okay , Speed Racers . That 's enough driver 's education for today . - Having your fun ? - [ Phone Ringing ] - Yeah ? - [ Scully ] Mulder , you 're busted . - What ? - I just got an earful from Assistant Director Kersh ... who got a call from Mr. Weinsider , who says that you 're harassing him . - [ Engine Starts , Revs ] - Leave me alone . Mulder ? Mulder , I have to tell him something . What do you want me to say ? Tell him I 'm down here doin ' a background check on somebody . [ Low Groan ] I got a message you needed to see me , Laura . What is it ? I 'm afraid . Well , I 've been meeting with attorneys , and given the circumstances ... and your emotional state , they feel confident of an acquittal ... if that 's what you 're worried about , Laura . No , Wayne . I 've been thinking . Thinking ? About what ? About your story . About how it doesn 't make sense . You said you wrapped the baby up to hide it ... but what they found in the fire was wrapped in the nightgown I had on ... when I woke up from my nightmare . But that 's not possible , Laura . You must be mistaken . And I keep thinking about the face of that terrible creature ... at the end of the bed . And I remember something that I didn 't tell anybody ... not even you . Laura , you 're scaring me . No matter what you believe , I only have one desire : to protect you , to put this all behind us . [ Sighs ] Why 'd you go and do that , Laura ? You 've got to know that I love you ... and I just wish you could 've been the one . [ Gasps ] Let me go , Wayne . [ Sucking Noise ] [ Prolonged Gasping ] - [ Female E.M.T. ] What 's her rhythm ? - [ Male ] She 's still in V-fib . Charge the paddles to 200 . - What happened ? - She just collapsed . [ Male E.M.T. ] Clear ! - Paddles are charged . Stand by to defib . - It was like- - - Clear ! - It was like she died right in my arms . Charging to 300 . Going again . Clear ! - [ Beeping ] - Got a heartbeat . - What ? - [ Beeping Continues ] - Laura , can you hear me ? - Laura , can you hear me ? - [ Female E.M. T. ] Got a palpable B.P. I need to get this woman to the hospital right away . - I need a neurologist consult at the E.R. - Maintaining sinus rhythm . Hang an I. V. of lidocaine , and let 's get her out of here . - Say when . - On three . [ E.M. T.s Chattering , Indistinct ] [ Gasping ] - That was a long five minutes . - I can explain . Oh , please , Wayne . I 've heard all your excuses . Besides , everything went fine without you . It always does . - Did you get the sonogram ? - Yes . Bring it back home ? - Is there a problem ? - The doctor found something . She doesn 't know yet , but there 's some kind of bony growth on the baby 's spine and skull . It may just be a stage of development . She really just wants to wait and see . Okay . Sure . Whatever happens , you know I love you , no matter what . Do you , Wayne ? ' Cause sometimes I wonder what 's going on inside your head . Nothing but good thoughts . You and this baby are my hopes and dreams . Mine too . Why don 't I get you a warm glass of milk , and we 'll go to bed ? Okay . [ Monitor Beeping ] Mulder , you asked me to come down here , and then you 're nowhere to be found . I was down in the basement at county records doin ' a background check . Mulder ? It 's me . That 's your cover story , remember ? That 's where I was . I was piecing together the history of the man that did this to her . Well , that 's why I was looking for you , because , in fact , nobody did anything to her . There 's absolutely no evidence of bodily injury , of overdose , of suffocation ... of anything that would explain why she was in a coma . - Perfect . - Mulder , I don 't think you heard what I said . I did a complete medical review , just as you asked . What I 'm saying is that there is not a shred of evidence to implicate the husband or anyone . Not a shred of evidence is exactly the evidence I 'd hoped you 'd find . Check this out . [ Sighs ] " " Ivan Veles . Born Czechoslovakia , 1 956 . Married twice . Widowed twice . No children . Prosecuted twice for murder of wives Gisele and Helga . Acquitted twice on lack of evidence . " Who is Ivan Veles ? Wayne Weinsider . He 's a Czech national . Emigrated in 1 994 . He 's also known as Bud Hasselhoff . Also known as Gordy Boytano . - Gordy Boytano ? - There 's more . Read on . " " In Slavic societies , the name Veles was synonymous ... with the devil . From the Lithuanian root Vele : a horned demon who sucks the souls of the innocent . " Mulder , you 're not suggesting that he is himself a devil , are you ? I 'm not suggesting anything . I think the facts speak for themselves . Mulder , I will accept that a man can be demonic , that he may have demon-like attributes . But why would a demon , if there were such a thing , bother ... with a 9-to-5 Make Room for Daddy routine just so he can off his wife and unborn child ? I don 't know why . I 'm not a psychologist . But this is the best explanation for " " how " that I 've heard . This 'll put you to sleep on a cloud , where troubles melt away . Sometimes I remember why I married you . - [ Officers Chattering ] - [ Explosion ] - [ Officer ] All the way down ? - [ Officer # 2 ] Yeah . All right . I 'm checkin 'it out now . [ Officer ] It 's pretty hard . Uh , get me the pick . - [ Officer # 2 ] All right . - [ Police Radio Chatter , Indistinct ] We 've got technology out here . Subterranean mapping equipment out from Richmond P.D. - Still can 't find a damn thing . - [ Officer ] Over here ! - [ Officer # 2 ] What ? - [ Officer ] We got something . Bring that light over here ! [ Mulder ] You 're gonna find discrete osteopathic deformities to the upper vertebrae ... and two bony protrusions between the parietal and occipital lobes of the skull . - Good Lord . - Put out an A.P.B. for your brother-in-law . - He 's not gonna come back here . - What are you talkin ' about ? - Just find him . - What are you talking about ? - He 's done this to other women here , like in Czechoslovakia . My guess is that baby we just dug up belonged to one of Wayne 's other wives . What are you saying ? That he 's trying to propagate , breed ? He 's exercising his biological imperative , and he 'll do or say anything to succeed . It doesn 't make sense . If he 's trying to breed ... why would he be snatching his own babies and burying them in his backyard ? Because they 're demons , and he wants a normal child . - [ Demon Growling ] - [ Gasps ] No ! No ! Wayne ! Wayne ! - What are you doing ? - [ Continues Growling ] - Maybe you didn 't hear me . I said , " " What are you doing , Wayne ? " - [ Wayne Gasps ] 1 5 527 Leahy . That 's in Cave Spring . That 's West Roanoke . Cave Spring ? Thank you . Thank you very much for your help . Scully , hold on . - [ Sighs ] Where are we going ? - Harmony Mutual Insurance ... has a second address for Wayne Weinsider , the other side of Roanoke County . - You think he 's got a second wife ? - Think about it , Scully . He meets or screens prospective women through work- - That 's probably why he came to this country in the first place : bigger gene pool , more women . Then he plants as many seeds as he can . Let 's just hope he hasn 't been able to harvest many more of them . - Mulder . - [ Tires Screeching , Horn Honking ] [ Tires Screeching ] [ Crying ] Please . Please . Please . He took my baby . He took my baby . - [ Continues Crying ] - [ Softly ] Who took him ? Wayne- - Wayne- - Wayne- - He took my baby . [ TVChatter , Soft ] - [ Girl ] Thank you , Daddy . - [ Man ] How are you , sweetheart ? - [ Girl ] Is he going to die ? - Of course not . People don 't die from chicken pox . - [ Woman ] Did you ever have chicken pox ? - I 've had a few . How ' bout you ? - I 've been trying to remember . - You won 't have to try long . You 'll know in a day or two . [ Woman ] That 's what 's worrying me . You can go on down . I 'll be down in a minute . - [ Girl ] She 's going to die . - [ Man ] Will you stop talking like that ? [ Women Vocalizing ] [ Mulder ] Wayne ! - It 's over . - Men Chanting A normal life , a family . It 's all I ever wanted . Where 's the baby , Wayne ? - How could she do this to them ? - Put the shovel down . - Your lies won 't work anymore . - My lies ? What about her lies ? Whatever the truth , Mr. Weinsider , you can 't hope to bury it now . I 'm not burying anything . I 'm digging it up . Where 's the baby ? Don 't you understand ? She took it . Betsy took it . You can 't blame anyone else , like you did with Laura . - [ Chanting Continues ] - Don 't you see ? Betsy isn 't like Laura . Betsy is- [ Gunshots ] - [ Men Shouting ] - [ Gagging ] - Get the paramedics ! - [ Officer ] Right away ! - [ Wayne Gasping ] I just wanted what everyone wants . [ Police Officers Shouting , Indistinct ] [ Chattering ] [ Gurney Wheels Clattering ] Don 't even think it ! Put that guy someplace else ! I don 't want him in sight of my sister . - Sir , he just got out of surgery . - All right . Give me this . Hey , hey , cut it out . Come on . You 're in enough trouble as it is . You don 't wanna complicate your situation further by endangering his life again , do you ? That son of a bitch better live so I can ... beat the truth out of him , find out why he did it and how the hell he did it . I think the " " why " is directly related to the " " how . " What do you mean ? What do you mean by that ? We should just go talk to this other wife of his , this woman , Betsy . Come on . - Wait a minute . - Come on . [ Beeping Steadily ] [ Heart Monitor Beeping Increases Rapidly ] [ Wheezing ] [ Beeping Increases Sharply ] [ Gasping , Grunting ] [ Exhaling Sharply ] [ Inhaling Sharply ] [ Gasping , Wheezing ] [ Heart Monitor Continues Beeping Rapidly ] - [ Continuous Tone ] - [ Wheezing , Coughing ] - Mrs. Weinsider ? - He 's flat-lined . - Page Dr. Nyland up here . - [ Continuous Tone Continues ] - Just breathe deep . Can you breathe for me ? [ Officers Chattering ] - Yeah . - [ Man ] I 'm gonna get a couple more shots here . How many ? Four total . All here for some time . Maybe years . All normal , though , Mulder . No osteological deformities . And Betsy 's baby isn 't here . There are no fresh graves . - I know . - What do you think he did with it ? - I don 't think he did anything with it . - But she was recently pregnant . I mean , I saw her records , her sonograms , in the house . Showing the same defects . These weren 't Wayne 's babies , Scully . - Well , whose babies were they ? - I think Wayne realized something last night . That 's why he was out here digging . He realized he 'd met someone more evil than he was ... who had sacrificed what he desperately wanted for himself . - Betsy ? - It was no coincidence that she ran into us last night . We were taken in by her just like Wayne was , by a woman who would say anything ... or do anything to get what she wanted , who was even more driven than he was . - Driven to what ? - To have what only Wayne could give her . [ Woman On Radio ] I 'm only happy when it rains - You know I love it when the music 's bad - [ Baby Crying ] Or why I feel so good but feel so sad I 'm only happy when it rains Pour your misery down Pour your misery down on me Pour your misery down Pour your misery down on me I 'm only happy when it- - [ Child ] I made this !

 Crichton : Hey , hey , hey , I am doing it . Whoa ... wait ... I 'm-l 'm not doing it . You 're doing it barely , but just ... Don 't show me , don 't show me . Port side , port-side thrusters . Slicker ' n snot . My microbes hadto have translated that one wrongly . Southern metaphors , darlin ' . You ain 't heard the half of them . You know , you 're picking this up more slowly than the dumbest recruit . But I am picking it up , Aeryn . The more I modify my module with Moya add-ons the more I need to understand bio-mechanoid technology . Now , you do that one again and I 'll kill you . Oh , sorry . Almost hit that big sun out there . There 's nothing out there , John . Exactly , Aeryn . That 's why we picked this spot . Nothing for me to hit . Perfect for a driving lesson . Like a big mall parking lot on a Sunday morning . I used to have 70,000 servants . Rygel , why don 't you get yourself something to eat ? And during festivals , I had 50,000 more . ( loud buzzing tone as Rygel taps ) Mostly females . Rygel ? They would worry about my ever nano-moment . Make sure I was always smiling , always entertained ... Rygel ! and never bored . I 'm bored . Bored , bored , bored ! Will you stop doing that ? ! Look , whatever you 're doing there , it can 't be important . You 're just scared I 'll win . Come on , let 's play . I can 't take Moya 's pregnancy much longer . The walls on my cell are excreting some sort of gel , and Pilot says it 's due to Moya 's condition . The Center Chamber has a strange odor as well . Have you noticed ? I have a Luxan 's olfactory sense . How can I not notice ? Where the hezmana are Crichton and Aeryn ? They should be back by now . Teaching Crichton takes time , D 'argo . Teaching Crichton is a waste of time . Am I the only one here that remembers we are being tracked by bounty hunters ? Aeryn believes that anything we can do to make Crichton more effective , the better . This sector is very peaceful . It 's perfect for Crichton 's trai ... Rygel ! If you do not stop that this instant .. . You 'll what ? Please do tell . It may be preferable to this mind-numbing tedium . Shut up ! Aeryn , lighten up . Have some fun . Fun ? How am I to have fun ? Oh , I don 't know how you 're supposed to have fun , but this is fun . This is Top Gun . This is the need for speed . You like this stuff . Admit it . I have no need for speed . Yes , you do. I see it in your eye all the time . You miss the adrenalin of combat flying . I miss the teamwork of combat flying . The reason why I agreed to teach you to do this is because you may become vaguely of some use to me one day in battle . Oh . Well , thank you for that vote of confidence . Well you may have noticed we 're short of hands . I didn 't exactly have much choice . Watch out for the starboard thrusters . You 're banking too sharply . I got it . What exactly do you mean by ' vaguely useful ' ? Well you 're hardly a quick learner , are you ? Oh , are you trying to tell me you weren 't the least bit challenged learning to fly one of these things ? Not challenged the way you seem to be . And you have it easy here . At Peacekeeper training , there 's no room for mistakes . You screw up on the last day of simulation flying , you die . Right . The simulator kills you . Now why does that not surprise me ? Chrichton : What are you doing back there ? Getting something to eat . I always get hungry when I ... Oh ! - What was that ? - What was that ? What did you touch ? I didn 't touch anything . Aeryn , any idea what this is ? Aeryn : No , I don 't . Crichton : There 's something pulling us in . Still pulling us in . I 'm not getting any pulse-back soundings . That 's impossible . Well , you think I 'm making this up ? Look at it , there 's nothing out there . I can 't hold her ! My name is John Crichton , an astronaut .. . ... a radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole .. . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship . A living ship full of strange alien life-forms .. . Help me .. . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? ... being hunted by an insane military commander .. . ... doing everything I can .. . I 'm just looking for a way home . Aeryn ? Aeryn ! You okay ? Aeryn ! Damn . Don 't scare me like that . Scare you ? What , you think I had something to do with that ? No , I thought you might ... never mind . You going to be all right ? Think so . You ? If you don 't count a broken neck . A couple of aspirin , I 'll be fine . We hit something . No , we didn 't . Hey , look , I was in a head-on when I was 19 . We hit something . There 's nothing out there . There 's no mass readings . No mass ? How can there be no mass ? Something 's blocking our view . The sensors say there 's still nothing out there . What the hell does that mean ? ! I don 't know . Will you stop playing with that ? ! I will play this thing for as long as I like ... ( loud squealing tone ) Pilot ! So sorry . I appear to have hit the wrong comm . You desired our attention , Pilot . An unidentified vessel is approaching . It is signaling , asking permission to come aboard . is it armed ? That depends . What do you mean , " it depends " ? Moya 's scan has found traces of weapon pieces . " Pieces ? " But nothing that constitutes a whole weapon , and certainly nothing operational . It seems a most ... curious vessel . The name 's Staanz . ( chuckling ) : Oh , there 's no need for the firepower , friend . I disagree ... " friend . " Move . That pretty little female here 's not going to look at you in quite the same way when she learns you killed the only person that could have saved you . Saved us from what ? You see how much you need me ? You 're headed straight for it , and you don 't even know it 's there . Headed for what ? The Flax . What is that ? It 's a magna drift mesh , 75 million zachrons long . I 've never heard of anything called " The Flax . " And what species are you ? Luxan . Luxan ? Never heard of it . Doesn 't mean you don 't exist . Our ship 's sensors have not picked up anything that size in this area . Well , they wouldn 't have picked up much of anything . That 's The Flax. lt 's invisible till you get snagged in it . Then it 's all over . Who put it there ? Zenetan pirates . You never heard of them ? Consider yourself lucky . I will warn Crichton and Aeryn . Staanz : You got another ship out there ? Well warning them 's probably a good idea , you know , if you 're not already too late . What exactly are you ? My name 's Staanz . I 'm a Garbologist . I 'm a , uh ... connoisseur of what other people throw away . Define " connoisseur . " Tadek , eh ? Ah ! Your set 's in , um ... very nice shape . Do you play ? Oh , I used to ... dabble . You any good ? Perhaps you could give me a few ... pointers . Perhaps I can . Oh ... Mmm ... mm-hmm . We need to get the ship stabilized and assess the damage . " Stabilized " ? According to this , we 're too stable . We 're not moving . There 's no drift , no spin ... What ? l-l don 't know . It 's as though we 're suspended in one place . The sooner we get this thing fixed and blast out of here , the better . No comms signal . Probably busted in the crash . No . The equipment 's working just fine . It 's just there 's no signal out there . Aeryn , if I 'm reading this right , calorics are flat line . We don 't have any power . Oh , that 's impossible . I fed the batteries just before we left Moya . Yeah ... impossible . This isn 't good . I can 't make contact with the Transport Pod . Aeryn and Crichton aren 't responding . They can 't be that far out . Staanz 's story about The Flax could be true . It could be what 's affecting the comms transmission . If it is , if he did come to warn us , then the question is , what does he want from us in return ? Anything he can get his hands on . I 've just accessed the criminal ident files from the Peacekeepers . It seems our Mr. Staanz has quite a record . He came offering help . Shouldn 't we at least give him the benefit of the doubt ? We don 't know that The Flax doesn 't exist . And what if it does ? He may be leading us straight into it . For all we know , he could one of those bounty hunters . No , Staanz is trouble , and we do not need to take that risk , especially while Moya is pregnant . I agree that Staanz may be the most unusual species , but you can 't surely condemn him just because he is an ex-prisoner of the Peacekeepers . Are you forgetting that we are all ex-prisoners ? How can I ever forget ? Have you ever looked at your own records to see what lies the Peacekeepers have written about you ? Have you ? Not everyone imprisoned by the Peacekeepers was innocent . Meaning ? Meaning that I do not have time to stand here and discuss this with you while he is looting what precious little we have . Interesting move . Very unconventional . Care to raise the stakes ? Ossoh scent . How pure ? Ninety parts . They won 't be able to resist even you . ( D 'argo roars ) ( grunts ) What are you doing ? ! I was about to raise ... I had him right where l wanted him . You have a criminal record with the Peacekeepers . Do you have any idea how difficult that is in this game ? I 've got a lot of records with a lot of people. lt 's who I am ! It doesn 't mean his money 's no good . ... didn 't deserve it and I never robbed anybody ... well , I used to rob anybody but now I 'm an honest garbologist . Ask anyone. I can give you a list of names . Well , a couple of names . Hey ! ( groans ) I used to be a Zenetan . One of the pirates who run The Flax . I alert ships that get caught in it . I can prove it . If you put me down . Thank you . Slowly . Oh , for heaven 's sake . Zenetan gang murals . I spent nine cycles in a Malsonic labor stockade . My Zenetan " brothers " did nothing to help me . In fact , ' cause of what they were doing on the outside , I got beat close to death more than once on the inside . So , uh ... when I got out , I went my own way . I work for myself now . Part of the fun is getting to The Flax before they do . Also , I like warning people like you . Pisses the Zenetans off no end . And I ... I figured when you send me on my way , you might give me , I don 't know , a small reward ? Put those back on . Rygel : Where are your , uh ... your , uh ... your ... My , uh ... For an anthropoid biped there seems to be something missing . ( chuckles ) Yeah , I know . Well , I 'm a Yenen by species . We 're not exactly , uh ... cut from the standard mold . If you are truly interested in helping us , our transport pod is still out there . Two of our complement are aboard , and we 've lost contact . They 're not family ? No . Good . There 's nothing worse than losing family . Right , get a move on , Crichton . The Message Buoy 's almost ready so we 'll need power to launch it . I 'm working as fast as I can , Aeryn , but these schematics are hard to read . They 're like half CAT scan , half blueprint . I know you don 't read ' em at all . Don 't be ridiculous . That 's Tech work . What happens if you crash land your Prowler and you have to repair it ? We 're not trained to repair . We 're trained to find and secure somebody else 's ship . Secure . As in take by force . Oh , beats learning to read those . Not today it doesn 't . I think I 've redirected the remaining power from the auxiliary systems . Message buoy away . You ready to go home ? Very . D 'argo : Staanz . Staanz : Huh ? ! Where did you get those boots ? Let me go ! Those boots are Luxan . A Luxan would never lose his boots unless he were dead . I didn 't kill him . He was already dead ! His ship got caught in The Flax ! Oh , so you rob the dead ? No , no ... A Zenetan killed him . He ejected ... ejected the body . I tried to get aboard the ship , but ... look . They blasted the crank out of me . You tried to loot a dead Luxan ship . Of course I did . That 's what I do. I loot ships . I see a ship , I try and loot it . Well that ship , my friend , was a Luxan deep-space voyager . Now , it may have onboard some map fibers that I desperately need . Can you take me there ? Well , I don 't know. lt was , uh ... earmarked for destruction . They might have already ... melted it down . If you take me there , everything on board after I get those map fibers ... is yours . Well , that sounds like a deal to me . What about The Flax ? Oh , not a problem . If you know what you 're doing . ( lock beeping ) ( nervous chuckle ) ( relieved sigh ) Crichton : Let 's do this while we still have power . 200 trads . Are we clear ? Not yet. I 'm increasing to eighty percent . This is going to hurt , isn 't it ? 300 trads . Should I punch it ? Ninety percent . Should I punch it ? Not yet . 400 trads ! Now ? It 's too strong ! I can 't hold her ! Now , Aeryn ! Now ! 500 trads clear ! - Now ? ! - Wait ! Man , this is really going to hurt ! Now ! ( yells ) ( grunts ) ( grunts ) Crichton ! Aeryn , where are you ? I haven 't the faintest idea . Aw , man , I knew this was going to hurt . I 'll be all right if I can get it out . Can you pass me that ax ? Yeah . What are you going to do with it ? I 'm going to hack my foot off . Aw , no . Let me , then . Oh , just give it to me . Did we break free ? Uh , you mind if I check in a minute ? I want to get these flames out first . D 'argo , the distress buoy is broadcasting full coordinates . Aeryn 's message is short , but it 's clear . Their pod is caught in some sort of stasis , but they see no stars . Staanz : That 's The Flax , all right . We are aboard Staanz 's vessel now and ready to launch . Wish us luck . Rha 'nalan be with you . A triple quadra-hent . Of course that means nothing to you , but I would have won all this fair and square , even if he hadn 't left it behind . Staanz : Luxan voyager , here we come ! When I get her really firing I can get this baby up to Hatch 4 ! It stinks in here . What ? ! It stinks ! Oh , does it ? I had my smell pods cauterized . Helps in my line of work . You mean you actually go out of your way to collect all these things ? I follow space streams and I pick up what others throw away . That 's all garbage . Garbage ? I don 't touch garbage . I 'm a professional scavenger . I only pick up the gems of what others throw away . I 've got 9 million Onnyxi play partners . They particalize , they levitate , everything . One day , I 'm going to sell these babies and make a killing . They burn good , too . You say that you can take me to this Luxan ship . Unless it 's already been melted down . You and me go onboard , get what we need , stay no longer than an arn . And then we go to rescue Aeryn and Crichton . You said they 'll be safe for a while . They 're stuck in The Flax . They 're going nowheres . You said it was a small pod . The Zenetans aren 't going to be in a rush to get there . Oh , we have plenty of time . Okay . Come on , baby ! Come on ! We 're not moving . We 're still stuck . There must be some sort of field holding us in place . You mean like a natural phenomenon ? You ever hear of phenomenon like that ? Uh-uh . Well , whatever it is we have to find a way to break free . Any suggestions ? The distress buoy got away . Well , I guess we just wait for D 'argo and the others to come rescue us . - l 'll deal with propulsion . - l 'll take environmentals . Go on ! Have a chew ! It 's delicious ! No , not that bit. lt 's got to rot a bit more . Here . Try this . No. I think I 'll pass . Hang on ! If I don 't get to this , she 's going to blow ! What ? Come on , baby ! Why don 't you just get it fixed ? I didfix it . That 's why it works when I whack it a few times . Help me ! ( burbling noise ) Uh-oh . What ? Hang on . You see that ? That 's Kcrackic 's tracer beam . Who 's Kcrackic ? He 's the Red Mentor to the Zenetans . is that like a rank ? There 's nothing military about these guys except their firepower . Then why are you so afraid of him ? I 'm not afraid , exactly . It 's just ... maybe I should have ... mentioned it earlier , but ... I 'm kind of on Kcrackic 's hate list . I told a few of his secrets to get out of prison . So you betrayed your own leader ? Betray ? Never . The bottom line is , if he knows we 're around he 's going to seal The Flax up and we 're not going to get to the Luxan ship or your friends . He missed us . But he 's headed straight for your ship . The Moya ! Warn them . They 've never heard of me , they 've never seen me . I understand , D 'argo . We will strive to keep them distracted as long as we can . Ooh ... I will strive to keep them distracted . ( belching ) Greetings. I am Pa 'u Zotoh Zhaan . You are Kcrackic ? You know me ? Your reputation is well known in these parts . For what ? Cruelty . My scan shows that your Leviathan is pregnant . You 're lucky . Why ? I once tried to commandeer a pregnant Leviathan . 80 men died . A mother will protect her child . A tracer ship was last seen heading in this direction . Run by a pewnkah named Staanz . Have you seen it ? Or him ? No . Perhaps I can offer you and your men something to eat ? You offer us nothing . What we want from your ship , we take . I see nothing of value here . Let 's go . Commander Kcrackic ... May I present Rygel the Sixteenth , Dominar of ... Yeah , yeah , yeah . How do you do , pleased to meet you and all that yotz . Where did you get so many Kelvic Crystals , little one ? I won them . Playing Tadek ? No. lnter-species tuggwrestling , idiot . So , you believe you play well ? I know I play well , and you , I believe , are an easy mark . I 'm still not getting a clean reading . More than half the pod 's sensor relays have been fried . Do you think Moya 's got that distress buoy yet ? Crichton : Don 't know , but even if she did , if we don 't buy ourselves a couple of hours , arns , we 'll be dead by the time anybody gets here . The atmospherics mix line is crushed . Can you fix it ? Maybe . Might be able to weld it , but I need a welding torch . There should be one in the equipment pack . Problem is , there 's too much pure O2 in here right now to risk firing it up . What if we depressurize , blast it out into space ? Fix it in our suits ? Yeah . Aeryn , that 's a great idea . You sound surprised . ( explosion ) You okay ? Yes . You ? Yeah , just ... peachy . Are you comfortable ? Can I get you a pillow ? Do you think your people have kept Kcrackic occupied ? Well , why don 't we just call Moya and ask them ? Perhaps you can speak to Kcrackic himself . Let 's get out of here . Kcrackic isn 't the kind of person you give a second chance to find you . Okay , come on . Sing for daddy . Sing ! ( engine dies ) What 's wrong ? Oh , nothing , nothing . Sometimes she just needs a bit of a push to get going . A push ? Yeah , you know. like a grav spin around a planet or something ? I need you to get me to that ship fast so I can find that map fiber . If you want to get there , open the furnace . Hmm ? This had better work . Come on ! Burn ! Come on ! Burn , baby , burn ! Okay ... Here we go . Oh , great ! What 's wrong ? We 're caught in The Flax . Impressive . We 'll be out of here in a few microts . Mmm . Rygel , surely you 're not giving up so early ... Who 's giving up ? I 'm not giving up . Leave me alone . I know what I 'm doing . Ante up , Hynerian . It 's going to be like a wind tunnel in here when we depressurize . I 'll get the release sequence started and leave out the last line ... We have a problem . What 's the matter ? It 's broken . is there another one of those ? Exactly that . One . So one of us gets to die . Crichton : Torch looks like it 's in working condition . Unfortunately , there 's no way to test it before we depressurize . Kill shot . We use them in battle triage to stop brain and heart function . And this is a nerve shot . You use this one to bring me back . Whoa , whoa , hold the phone . Let 's talk about this . Nothing to talk about . You know welding . You should do the repairs . Yeah , but Aeryn , that means you 've gotta ... I 'm Sebacean . They are meant to be used on my kind . Yeah , but still ... The oxygen is rising in here quickly so you 'd better get ready . Aeryn , you notice anything about that ? It 's useless . It 's also mine . Yours isn 't going to fit me . Tell me exactly what I have to do . We could wait . The others may come . No . We got to fix the line . Otherwise , we 're both dead anyway . And if we get another spot fire in this place , it 's going to go up like a blast furnace . How long do I have to do the repairs ? I don 't know . Um , without oxygen , my brain can last maybe four minutes , maybe five or six depending on my body temperature . Pick a number . Tell me how long l have , and I 'll follow it but tell me what to do while there 's still time . Torch . ( gasping ) ( laughing ) Goon : Should I tell Bacca to fire up the engines ? Why not ? I should be there shortly . Hmm ? Very unusual move . Where did you learn it ? Uh , I made it up myself . Did you ? I know somebody else who makes that move . Good for you . ( sighing ) Are you sure this thing 's going to work ? Mm-hmm , it should kill you . Well , it 's not the kill shot that concerns me . I 'm sure you guys got that one down fine . It 's the wake-up call that 's got me worried . Well , we can 't be sure it works until you 're dead . Great . It works perfectly well on Sebaceans and Sebacean and human physiology appears to be similar enough , so I say 50-50 . You call that good odds ? No . No , no , no. I 'm going to teach you CPR . What 's that ? It 's a human resuscitation technique and very low tech . We don 't have time for this . Aeryn , I 've got time , okay ? I need a backup plan in case your little nerve shot doesn 't work , Aeryn . What does it involve ? It involves you breathing for me , keeping my blood flowing so I don 't die . Don 't be ridiculous. lt sounds far too complicated . Well , it 's a lot less complicated than learning to fly a Transport Pod . Fine . Show it to me , then . Good . Lie down . What ? Lie down . No , flat out on the ground . I can 't show ... lie down . Okay . Come on ! ( laughing ) Where are the stars ? The Flax magna absorbs the light before it can get to us . It 's a bummer , like that . Absorbs the light ? If it 's that powerful , how come you 're not more concerned ? Because I may be able to dissolve a small part of The Flax unless they 've already changed the code . What ? Now , what I need from you is , I need you to whack this really hard on my signal . Whack it really hard . Ready ? Three ... Two ... One ... Whack it ! ( grunting ) Come on , man ! Come on ! ( grunting ) You can do it , come on . Just a bit . Come on . Come on ! ( grunting ) Yes ! We 've done it ! We 're clear of The Flax ! We 're clear ! Did I say it , huh ? Hey ! Stop whacking it ! We 're clear ! We 've made it ! ( laughing ) Oh ! Go with me , brother ! We 're clear . It doesn 't get better than this , baby ! 13 , 1 4 , 15 . Then two more breaths then 15 more compressions . Right , until I start breathing again on my own . Or not . Let 's do it . You 've got about four minutes , 180 microts before my brain starts to go adios . Let 's do it. ln the chair . Aeryn , it 's real simple what you got to do to fix the line . I remember what you told me . Hey , when Sebaceans die what do you guys believe happens ? Do you believe in an afterlife ? Heaven and Hell , all that jazz ? Humans believe , well some believe that there 's like this bright light and you end up somewhere else along with your friends , family , relatives , all the people who died before you . Does that ring a bell ? Sebaceans believe when you die you die . You go nowhere ; you see nothing . Guess I 'll find out in a minute , huh ? - Okay , 180 microts . - Yes , I know . Sorry if I 'm repeating myself . It 's just , you know , I don 't want to take any chances with this , so ... I won 't let you down , John . Aw , this ... this is going to hurt like crap , isn 't it ? Trust me , it 's not going to hurt a bit . That 's it ? Well , it doesn 't hurt ... ( screaming ) The engine 's fired up , ready to go . Your wager , your Lordship . Zhaan : But we have nothing left to bet . This ship . I 'll wager this ship . You can 't do that , Rygel . I can beat him. I know I can . Fear not , lovely lady . I told you before , I 've had my experience with pregnant Leviathans . I don 't want your ship . I reject your wager . Quit now . You must quit . The one you call Staanz . I know where he is . Rygel ! I wager his whereabouts . Computer : You now have 60 microts , 59 , 58 57 , 56 , 55 54 , 53 ... Hey , I 'm picking up some traces of atmosphere . Atmosphere ? Yeah . They 're drifting from the coordinates where your ship 's pod is caught in The Flax . Oh , they 're not just mere traces , either . Looks like your friends might be out of luck . We may have no reason to rush aboard that Luxan ship . Computer : 1 4 , 13 , 12 ... 1 1 , 10 , 9 ... 8 , 7 , 6 ... 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 ... 1 ... ( groaning ) Time has lapsed . Time has lapsed . Time has ... ( laughing ) : I knew it. I knew I could do it . Thanks for the game . The game 's not over . Thank you for the game ... little one . ( laughing ) Now , for that nugget of information you promised me . Zhaan : Rygel , don 't . Oh , you willtell me or he 'll blow your brains out . I 'll count to three . One ... Two ... - Three . - Okay . Staanz was here . One of our crew is with him now . You can locate him by following the frequency of our crew member 's comms unit . What 's the frequency ? It 's in the ship 's data store . Access the ship 's data stores and let 's go get him . Crichton . One ... two ... three ... four . Come on , Crichton , wake up . Seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fourteen . Aeryn and Crichton have a second reserve tank . They could still be alive . Look , there she is . Your Luxan beauty . Oh , you 're lucky , we 're just in time . She 's next in line for the melt . It 's a Luxan Assault Piercer . I dreamt of serving on one as a boy . I 'll bring her in nice and easy . Come on ! What are you looking so down about ? You said yourself the two aboard that pod weren 't family . Look , the maps aboard that ship might be your only chance to reunite with your real family , huh ? My son . Yeah , yeah , your son . Thirteen , fourteen , come on ! Come on ! ( gasps ) Crichton . My God . You did it , Aeryn . You did it . But you lied like a dog . God , that hurt like hell . How 'd it go ? The environmentals . They fixed ? Uh , I ... I didn 't finish . You didn 't what ? Your time was running out . Wait a minute . You stopped because ... I think we have about half an arn of breathable atmosphere left . I thought we 'd never be rid of them . You wanted them to leave . Didn 't you ? Yes , but I ... You didn 't expect them to leave us unscathed unless they thought they were leaving with something of value , did you ? You gave them the frequency . The wrong frequency , yes . I told Pilot to change it the minute Kcrackic stepped on board . Where are they headed , Pilot ? Not exactly certain . I could plot it for you . No , don 't bother . As long as it 's far from here . Oh. lt 's certainly that . You lost to Kcrackic on purpose ? You think it was easy ? He 's an abominable player . A switched-off DRD would have made a better showing for itself . Oh , please . Bluffing is what the game 's all about . The message buoy got out . They could still come for us . Maybe they 've been trying all this time . The phenomenon that 's got hold of us might not be letting them through . They might have tried and given up already . Oh ... lt 's really cold in here . It 's colder than a frog 's ass . Okay . We 're docking . If I get this right , we 'll be nice and snug in the aft access port . Oh , come on , you got to be a bit excited . You 're 15 paces away from your own Luxan Assault Piercer . The maps . You 'll be able to find your son . You got to be looking forward to seeing your son . Huh ? Yes . But when I do , I want to be able to look him in the eye . Aeryn . You should have kept working . Finished the repair . At least one of us would have survived . To be sitting here alone now ? I chose not to . I thought Peacekeepers were trained to fight alone , survive alone . Die alone . Well ... it appears my training is failing me . I don 't want to die alone . What did you see ? Hmm ? Y-you know , after the kill shot , when you were dead . Did you see the things that , you know that , that humans believe ? The light ? Friends ? No . No , I didn 't . All I saw was black . I don 't know , maybe you Sebaceans are right . Maybe there 's nothing after this . Maybe ... maybe ... I wasn 't supposed to die that time . Well ... maybe you 'll find out for certain this time . Somebody docking ? D 'argo . ( clearing throat ) Um ... what took you so long ? I had to , uh ... find someone to help me . Right . I think it 's time that we left . It 's about time ! Oh , your pals are okay ! I told you they would be ! You think maybe you could untie me , please ? This is no fun ! Hey , welcome aboard , people ! I 'd offer you something to chew but , uh , what can I say ? My hands are tied at the moment ! is he dangerous ? Merely annoying . The Flax is huge . There 's bound to be another Luxan ship stuck in there somewhere . I thought ... maybe we could go look for it together ? We go together ? ( snorts ) I 'm lonely . Everybody needs a mate , Ka D 'argo . Even you . A mate ? I amthe female of the species . You know that don 't you ? In fact , false modesty aside I 'm , uh ... I 'm considered quite the Zenetan beauty . You know big guy , I think I better , uh ... give you a little time alone here . 'Cause I know , in a universe this vast when two hearts collide ... Shut up . You and me ? Oh , I don 't really , ah ... I love you . Um , well you , ah ... Love you ! I love you ! We are now well out of range of The Flax and Kcrackic 's tracer . What happened out there , D 'argo ? D 'argo ? A Luxan warrior must never be indecisive in battle . My indecision nearly cost Aeryn and Crichton their lives . But you saved them . Barely . And by saving them I may have given up my only chance of ever seeing my son again . On every front , I failed . Heat of the moment . Exactly . Too much pure oxygen . Affected our judgment . If it had been you and D 'argo there , the same thing probably would have happened . Or you and Zhaan . Anyway , one thing 's for sure . It 'll never ... never happen again . Never . ( clearing throat ) Never . Never . One thing , just to be absolutely certain . You are the female of your species ? Right ? I 'll take that as a yes .

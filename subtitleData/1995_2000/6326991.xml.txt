The first wave Translation and adaptation Adyc - thin Catrenul 64 , VIII century . " The murderer flees the shadow of Olympus , where the tears of a mother kill with Rome . " Olympus he saw Nostradamus can be Olympia . There , Glenn Harris , a serial killer escaped three weeks ago . If Harris is the killer of quatrain , the shadow of Olympus would be to the east .

It seems he was here recently . - Even last night . - Last night ? Tuesday evening 's drinking tonight ? In this town , it is . Dale is an old tradition in Emerald . It would be good to convince myself alone . Now if you do not mind , I have some paperwork to do . Good luck in your search . I think Harris went to Tacoma or Portland . It 's easy to get lost in the big cities . I think it is . The question that I put it before I left . Craig ! We 're friends , right ? - I was friendly with you ? - Yes , of course . Atlon is a quiet town . I do everything I can to keep it that way . I do not want a bounty hunter to scare people away . Sheriff , if there is a small possibility that Harris to be in town , people should be scared . He 's a serial killer . You read it in the newspaper . How do you do ? - Good . How can I serve ? - A glass of beer , please . - You have a nice time here . - Damn ! - Did I say something ? - The rainy season cause irritation . - You should tell me your name . - Why ? I think we should kiss you . That 's not the mistletoe ? Glyn McDougal . You do not want to introduce yourself ? Insist to break tradition ? Craig Wilson . And what are you doing in town ? Here come not many tourists . I 'm looking for this man . Have you seen ? Does Not . I have not seen . I would have mentioned before that . Glen Harris . A family murdered in cold blood . A husband killed his wife and two small children . One of the many murders in two different districts . - Sounds like a monster . - Yes . - Are you a cop ? - No . There are bounty hunter . It 's a reward for his capture . In fact if anyone here could help me find him ... I saw it . Yes ? Where ? - Haide , Kieren . - The East . Killer . - I want my reward . - Enough of playing . Leave me alone , Kieren ! Do not take into account Kieren . There he met many townspeople . I 'll pay Mr. drink . No I have not met many foreigners . Ron McDougall . Glynis is my niece . - Is it possible ? - Sure . I would look in Tacoma or Portland . It 's easy to get lost in a big city . Funny . That 's what the sheriff suggested . Well , he knows best . Enjoy your drink . Watch the way you leave the city . I do not know ... You have a very peaceful city . - I could use some relaxation . - I could show you around . Anyway going to remain a little . I took a room at Holly 's Inn . Hey , Glynn ? Pour some whiskey and my friend . To make up for bad behavior . It 's okay . You do not . Thank you . Where we come from , if a man wants to buy you a drink , do not refuse . Okay . Have all a good night . I think I 'll buy one myself . All right ... Alo ! Anybody ? Where did you get this number ? From any government agency ? Identify yourself . You can follow . I will find you . I know people . Alo ? Alo ? Let 's your get something , Garth ? - Garth ? - Continue to drip . - Why do not you move the other seats ? - Do not stop . I know . Come on , let 's go . Few places . I think it 's bounty hunter . I do not know . I took the fingerprints on the handle of the station . To check it . Forget it . We call say that I have not seen Harris , and he says he 'll stay on vacation . Can we staged an act . Not yet . Maybe you should give him a reason to leave the city . Put your boys to die to settle accounts with him . - No Rian . - Why do you care what happens to him ? I do not care . But we should dedicate principles . You 're still young . You do not know all the traditions . Tomorrow . Nothing too hard . Just scared . Wait , come . Hi . Can I talk to you ? - Sunt Fergus Mc Kay . - Fergus ... Why do you act like I have a disease for the city ? - Well you are . We do not like strangers . - Why ? There 's a lot of history . And I came here ago a year for a job at the sawmill , but you can see how I treat others . - Why do you allow ? - Some cocky , but I got used . - You could leave . - Not if I want to work . Environment Agency closes all mills in the state and I need money . Did you mean that you will share the reward if someone helps him catch the killer ? A split in half . - I saw it . - When ? About two weeks at the store . Stocked with camping equipment and gear for cold weather . I was at the store . Maybe I was still drunk but I do not remember one to be seen on Harris said . Maybe I 'm wrong . I 'm sure he was . I lie , Fergus ? Okay . I do not think . You convince yourself . - You want to go out of my way ? - Who sent you here ? - Who sent you here , Fergus ? - Release me ! Who sent you ? Kieren . I counted 21 cell lines . Harris disappeared 3 weeks . It was here , eh ? I do not know . I told you . Listen , you can try your luck with them or with the police . You choose . What do you look for it in the woods . Where in the woods ? It 's a clearing in the southern city . It 's a statue . That 's all I 'm saying . What the hell is that ? Mistletoe , known as the Drualis or Druitreed was cut from a sacred oak to be used as a poison antidote . - Foster ? - Sorry Eddie , are hung . - I should drink at work , man . - Thanks for the tip . You said something Druids . I 'm from Celtic religion , is not it ? It 's romantic way of looking . Some believe that druids are part of a pagan cult practicing human sacrifice ritual . - I think I burned their victims . - For live . In a man of straw and wood . Mistletoe , idols , stone circles , based on this , I 'd say you got a druid center . The second part of quatrains says something sacrifice . Not you ? Yes , it is . " Fear transforms sacrifice in vain until bush raging flood will be off . " Let 's say you 're right , and that # which I found belongs to Harris , this l-ar sacrifica , Eddie ? Human sacrifices were used as a last resort when the community was in danger . Like when floods threaten crops . This time not in danger of flooding . The rain stopped 24 hours ago . Perhaps ritual work . Maybe I 'm missing something . What were the Druids with aliens ? Perhaps Gua are behind cult . Start a new fashion . Restore human sacrifice . In this case all they did was to Gua exempt duties million dollars ... Does Not . There must be more . Must remain in the city , Eddie . There is a sawmill where he works these guys . Notify me know . Hey , how you escaped from the cage ? Get out of the city , and next time we will not be so polite . I heard what happened . - News travels fast . - I came to see if you 're okay . It seems that know how to make a receipt . I was afraid that it will happen . I had to go when I say . I 'm not going anywhere until I find out what happened to Glenn Harris . You 're wasting your time . Glenn Harris Atlon not hide . I know . I found in the woods that 's left of it . Idols bones Harris . I 'm sure the experts can prove it was him . - You 're a cop . - No , I 'm not . But if you find some answers , I 'll bring the police . I think that Harris was sacrificed in a ritual druid . Why ? What impels people to sacrifice ? What is this town to hide ? I can not talk about it . Take my advice . Get out of town ! You are silent . Ryan , bounty hunter knows . Damn . Our Stupidity got us into this . If you bring the police ? What we limit ? There we no limit . We do what our ancestors would have done to save this city . Where are buried our parents and their parents before them . The plague is still with us . The sacrifices did not help anything . I tried to thank the gods giving them the killer . But can our sins are too great . What you talking about , Ryan ? When completed book of prisoners , Celts chose one of them . An innocent . It was considered a great honor . - We can not . - Why not ? We go back to the traditional method . Our problems started when I turned my back to what I had in the past . Another sacrifice is the only way to save succeeding . That was the way our ancestors , this will be our way now . I dropped what I believe in , and for that you have to pay . The first sacrifice to the gods happy . We must offer another . This time we must choose someone with a pure heart . Let 's come to the track only . He who chooses burnt bread , our people will petition directly to the gods . Come forward . Who is honored ? It was decided . Glynis 's the one . With her death , we find life . Whether sacrifice to end the plague . In the fourteenth century , our clan was exterminated black death . One of your ancestors went willingly to the altar and gave his life . The plague spared his family . I know the story , Ryan . I am very sorry Glynis . Had no choice , I would take it . I know . We can not do anything now . The gods have chosen . May your soul find peace in the other world . We closed . Return tomorrow . That means we can talk . What are you doing ? My ancestors candles tied to trees in the cool winter . They thought that because heat will increase the branches . Looks like a beautiful tradition . Unlike human sacrifice . I was in the woods tonight , Glynis . I know what I want to do . I 'm not afraid . This is the true philosophy of reincarnation ... Immortality of the Soul . Ce este molima , Glynn ? A soul dies in a world other three are born in another world . That 's why we do not accept birth but the death of a family member . - Tell me what is the plague . - A birth ... Glynn , ce este din molima Atlone ? - Rain , of course . - Rain ? - How long rains ? - Two years . Two years ... Those of us who happen to escape ... Better die than leave the house ancestors . - Este an experiment . - This este ? Rain . I know who 's behind it . This is not punishment from the gods . Far from it . - You do not understand . - Do you honestly say that you do not understand . When there is ritual ? When is the ritual , Glynis ? Tomorrow night . Do not let it pass by . You find out what is behind the rain . It makes sense . I looked on the map and weather is not raindrop in the area . If you are responsible Gua can control the weather , and can be used as a tactical advantage over our cities , Eddie . Water Torture there was a way to make it yield highly trained soldiers . Well , this certainly worked . Locals have failed . I am depressed , irrational ... - Sad . - Then , e sad . No no . SAD .. In regions where the sun does not rise for some time , suicide rates increase . The question is , how did Gua to do that . In the 80s , the government has been experimenting in New Mexico , using toxic substances to cause cloud formation . Toxin ? - Pollutants , industrial waste dumped into the environment . But to 2 years continuous rains one must to feed the clouds with chemicals . If I find out who I find alien . Oh , you ! Like others here , I get weaker type ? Relax Ferguson . I need more information . Who 's responsible for the fire at the factory ? What do you mean ? Who lights the fire there ? It does not work that way . Lumber Scraps is responsible for everything that happens there . Did you see anything else there besides wood ? Maybe chemicals ? Time spent with me will cost you job and home . Fergus Come on , I know you disagree with what is happening here . Otherwise , do not tell me the body . Okay . Once , 6 months ago I came to work early , before daybreak . I saw someone by the fire , wearing ritual mask . - Which one ? - Wolf . Pour some on fire , in a white plastic bottle . - Who wears a mask wolf ? - I do not know . Numa Ryan speaks at meetings and bear bear . But others do not know what each wearing masks . Now I can go , please ? You must upload at 6.00 machine that delivers ... What you got , buddy ? Come on , you and me . I know who you are . I can nonsense these people , but I can not fool me . A talk or fight , right ? What is going on here ? - You have been warned . I had to listen . - I make it rain . - I can prove . Look in the closet ... - I 'm tired of you . - Call the sheriff O 'Connor . - Key 's city skyline 's closet . I can take care of you . Shut up and put on one of the guys you close it . You 're under arrest . I did not start the fight , sheriff . For killing your wife . Results of the verification . - You killed your wife . - I was framed . Falls and a criminal . Glynn ? - I came to talk to the prisoner . - I do not think it 's a good idea , Glynis . I never asked for your opinion . Ryan knows you 're here ? Sheriff , I need to know if the man is guilty of murder . Let me talk to him , or call the state police . Knock yourself out . - Did they hurt you ? - Not yet . You 're the man they say ? I 'm Cade Foster , but I killed my wife or other people . I was framed by the same group that is responsible for the plague of Athlone . Say you Kieren accused to cause rain . Kieren part of them . Kieren has his sins , but we grew up together . You 're a stranger . You lied about your identity . - Why should I believe you ? - Because I left town , Glynis . I stayed to protect you , while the rest of us would have left you to die . They care about me . So much care , that would burn you alive . - That 's the way our ancestors . - If your ancestors were wrong , Glynis . When you love someone does not sacrifice . You sacrifice anything to protect them . Why had to live in this city ? Glynis , why talk to that man ? It is cold blooded killer . - Dar noi , Ryan ? - Glynn ? You 'll pay for that . At night . - How do we do ? - Same as before . We wait until he falls asleep and unlock cell . I pray to the gods to go this time . If Cade is right ? If Kiern , causing rain ? Ridiculous , Kiern 's just like us . Bigger than we would like . There should check Kieren 's closet , before you kill a man ? It 's time to check the prisoner . I want to finish bring back peace to the city . Keys to the cell are in the drawer . Stay there . If you put them on the fire , the rain will stop . Let me show you . Great-grandfather made this furnace , the day of the opening of the factory . The gods sent smoke contains the soul of people cut trees . No man will go the sacred fire . If the rain continues . Kieren know . The proof is in the locker room . Enough talk . It is time . Take him to the sacred circle . Wait . Why not here in the furnace . You tried to sacred flames left . Maybe it 's fitting that you extinguish flames on you . November burn sacrifice to stop the flood . Believe me , it will not stop the rain . Hear me , I can help . What the hell is wrong with you ? You are crazy . Gods of thunder and oak , receive offerings and put an end to our suffering . Wait , stop . I found these in Kieren 's closet . Are chemicals . Just as Cade said . Release it . Kieren , you put chemicals into the furnace ? Yes , but not what it seems . These substances helps fire burn cleaner . Of this , Kieren ? As environmental agency to take away , not to close as the other factories . Fergus knew he would not understand . He told me not to tell you . Fergus is responsible , not Kieren . Get off masks . Give him the mask . Okay , okay . What is this ? And take your skinny guy ? When you leave me alone ? - Why did not you leave with anything ? - Yes , Fergus . Whose side are you ? Run the treadmill . Use chemicals to extinguish the fire and the rain will stop . I forgot what the sun looks . You 'll get used to it . I had taken the scapegoat . You were not yourself . People have the ability to withdraw the words . I 'll take a little longer to get used to Do not be too hard on yourself . You came and you saved my life . Why do you think Ferguson told the chemicals in Kieren 's locker . I think he realized that I know . And tried to frame his Kieren . Hopefully next time things get crazy , not allow superstition to lead you . Do not be so sure . Last night after you left , said Fergus was a magician . Old practicing black magic . They believe that the sacrifice rain stopped . But what do you think ? Aliens or wizards ? Better not choose . Have a good journey . I made the sun to warm you again . You did the Irish in me . Athlone People were willing to make a sacrifice . But the sacrifice was wrong . It was the sacrifice of fear . Always civilizations have created rituals , to calm the fear of the unknown . Helpless against the fury of Mother Nature . The ritual was done to give orders to an arbitrary world . In order to survive , to avoid sacrificing what makes us human , must control our fears . Perhaps the sun shines in Athlone , but it 's just the calm before the storm . Translation and adaptation Adyc - thin

 My name is Marco . I 'd give anything to be on the other side again , just a normal kid in a regular world . But then I remember that the world isn 't regular anymore . And I remember that at any minute a controller could be sneaking up on me . About to shove a slimy alien slug in my ear . Looking for Jake ? Hey Tom . Yeah ... is he up stairs ? I don 't know . Just got here . Right . I know , I did not do well . Hey , Dude . We 've got to stop meeting like this . We always hung out before , it 'd be a bigger bust if we suddenly stopped . I Agree . - Yeah . By the way , your brother 's here man . That 's why I have a door . Okay , let 's try this thing . You 're the computer whiz . Compared to you , maybe . Alright , lets see what happens . It doesn 't look like it will fit . - What , you have a better idea ? Try " Alt Escape X " What 's going on ? - What happened ? It worked on " Independence Day " - They had Will Smith What 're you guys doing ? - Just Cracking up . Marco finally said something funny . So , what 's next ? I don 't know . Any ideas ? Let 's sleep on it , okay ? Oh , he takes it away ! Scores ! Hey , Tom , you up for a quick game ? Marco 's no challenge anymore . Nah , I got somewhere to be . Do you think there 's gonna be any college scouts there tonight ? Going for a triple double or what ? - Nah . Team 's history . I 'm going somewhere else . - Where ? To a new club , The Sharing . Everybody 's joining . Wait a second , you quit the basketball team ? Jake , there 's more to life than throwing a ball at a stupid hoop . What ? Basketball 's like your whole life . - Not anymore . Anyway , we do cooler things at The Sharing , and besides , the place is a magnet for girls . You guys should come . I 'll see you two clowns later . He quit the team . You know all that stuff about how anybody can be a controller ? Yeah . What are you saying ? What are you saying ! I 'm just saying that it 's pretty weird that your all-star all-state Mr. Basketball brother would suddenly quit playing hoops . Yeah ? So ? So , maybe Tom 's not entirely under his own control . They would never get to my brother ! What ? You think he 's immune ? - He 's too smart . You just don 't want to see it ! Have you looked in his ear lately ? Hey , If you 're looking for somebody who 's acting weird , why don 't you start with your father ? Hey , Marco . - Didn 't you have a job interview today ? Yeah , yeah I canceled . Great . Actually , I had something more important to do . - Like what ? I went down to the cemetery , put some fresh flowers out for you mom . Well , there 'll be other job interviews . - Yeah . Want me to call for a pizza ? - Sure , that 'd be great . Thanks for walking with me . - Sure . Um , where do you live , anyway ? - Down on Grove , with my aunt . Last year I used to live with this other uncle . I kind of get passed around . That must be rough . It 's alright . I gotta get going . You know , I saw a hawk flying over my house this morning . What makes you think it was me ? - Something about the way it flew . Do you ever wish you could just ... fly away ? Sometimes Smile ! Now you have a picture of your new boy friend . ... exams coming up . - Yeah , you 're right . Oh yeah , we really should .. Stop right there , Marco . Yes , Mr. Chapman . - You know , it always bothers me when the grades of one of our best students begin to drop . Well , if I find that student , I 'll tell him you said so . Levity won 't get you out of this . Maybe what you need are some friends that will be a better influence . Disgusting creatures . I didn 't think you 'd show . Oh , what are you , kidding ? I live for science lab make-ups , bro . Hey , careful . I dropped one earlier , I can 't find it . Yeah . I saw it in the hallway . Chapman almost stepped on it . Listen , about what happened yesterday ... - I 'll forget it , if you will . I mean , we 're dealing with some serious stuff here . It 's a little more drastic than finding a zit . We were bound to go ballistic sooner or later , you know ? You know ? I 'm sorry . Me too , man . Buckmeyer Over here . Have you had any success in locating the Andalites ? Not yet , but we 're still looking . - That 's unacceptable . We know they 're using human morphs . - Approximately the same age as my host body . Just find them . - Yes , sir . Now , go stand watch while I check the entrance to the pool . - Yes sir . Chapman went that way . - Jake , I can 't see very well . Weird , I can 't see colors . - Whoa ! My tongue ! It can smell things ! It 's between classes ! - So . Scared . Run . Hide ! Get a grip ! - Get a grip ? Get a grip ! Man , this skink is one nervous animal . Watch out . Is everything ready for tonight ? Everything 's arranged . Show me . Tom ! No ! - Jake ! I 'm sorry , man . Very impressive . But it 's been three days , regeneration must begin tonight at sundown . I need the kandrona nutrients . How many new hosts will be there ? 50 new members from The Sharing , but your host 's brother is not among them . Why ? Jake has a very strong will . He may be a problem for us . If he doesn 't cooperate , we may have to correct the problem . What do we have here ? Jake ! Help ! - Stay Calm . Just stay calm ! Nasty little creature . Jake ! Help ! Disgusting thing . Stay calm . Just stay calm ! Jake ! Help me ! - Marco , be cool ! Next time , we use a phone booth , dude . Don 't worry man , we 're gonna help your brother . Jake , I 'm really sorry about your brother . I 'm gonna set him free no matter what it takes . And when we do , I 'm gonna take that yeerk inside of his head and squash it like a bug . At least now we know that the yeerks need some sort of a booster treatment every three days . And we know a way into this pool . Whatever that is . Yeah , you 'd think that Elfangor would 've given us an instruction manual , or somethin You mean before or after he went toe to toe with Visser Three ? Well , maybe that 's what the disk is for ! We need an instruction manual for that too ! This is where my mom works . With all of the exotic animals . Exotic ? Like rare chickens or somethin ' ? Hey , listen . If we 're going to fight the yeerks , I think we 're going to need something a little more dangerous than a rat , a cat , and a dog . How dangerous is dangerous , dude ? - This looks tricky , I 'll give you a boost . Why do I have to go first ? - Because you 're small . I can get you up there . You 're the leader , why don 't you go first ? - Okay , you boost me . Man , that 's barbed wire , baboso ! You guys almost finished ? My bad dude . Look at that ! They 've all been fed , right , Cas ? What is it ? - It 's a white , Bengal tiger . Now , watch his eyes . If they dilate , just back away very , very slowly . Slowly ? Remember , all you have to do is touch it to acquire it 's DNA . Just make a fuffer sound . A what ? - Fuffer . Like this , fvvvv , fvvvv . See , it calms him down . Yeah , sure . Easy , Jake . Slowly Hey , buddy . Remember , when you acquire it 's DNA , it 'll go into a trance . How about that moment before the trance when it rips his arm off ? This one 's for you , Tom . Yes . Cool . Okay , Rach , you 're next . I 've got it . Rachel the lionhearted . Yeah , well , Marco the chicken hearted says lets go before we become lunch . Good idea . Hey Jake , don 't take this the wrong way but , um ... should you should leave Elfangor 's disk in your room ? You 're right , but I already thought of that . From now on , It goes where I go . Cool . We 're gonna help your brother , bro , I promise . You think we 'll pass as human controllers ? We 'll find out tonight . Go on . Go move ! Move Faster ! We have many hosts to regenerate tonight ! I will be in my chambers , notify me when it is done . - Yes , Visser Three ! You ! Stay in the regeneration line ! Jake , look . No , Let go of me ! You can 't put that thing back in me ! Keep those free hosts quiet . Get in line We report directly to Visser Three . Get out of our way . Good . Yeah . We 've got to do something . There 's Cassie . What is she doing ? - I don 't know ! Is something wrong ? C 'mon , let 's distract him . - Do it . Quick . I 'm having a hard time getting out of her ear . Turn your head . I 'm almost free . No ! Don 't put that thing back in my ear ! Let go of me ! Rachel , You have Visser Three to your right and two Hork-Bajir behind you ! Thanks , Tobias . What is going on out there ? ! Stop them you fools ! The door ! controller ! Cassie ! Hurry up ! Where 'd they go ? Did anyone see their faces ? Hey you ! Stop right there ! We did our best ! - You have failed once again . You okay ? Yeah , I 'd give anything to be just a regular kid again . But , no , now I get to change my shape more often than I change my underwear . But when I saw Jake 's brother and all the others trapped , taken over , controlled , I realized I was one of the lucky ones . That was wild ! I 'm just glad we 're all okay . Tom 's not . There 'll be another time , Jake . We 'll get him back , okay ? Tobias , you did it again . If it wasn 't for Tobias , I 'd be road kill . Thanks , Tobias . That 's , not him . What ? You mean I 've been talking to a bird all the way back ? No . You don 't think ... Rachel , I 'm sure he made it out ...

I thought I should meet the man I was serving for . You wanna join me ? It must be difficult . Working so hard , never get a supporting you need to win . I will win . I have to . What was Jimmy doing in your car the day of crash ? He saw the pathetic data on the three car . Jimmy wanted to know what 's like to drive a competitor ride . I feel sorry for him . And give him a shot . And the story . According to the data after the crash , Jimmy had a throttle wide open when he hit the wall . I love my brother , but , he didn 't know his limits . Your brother has a very rare disease . In Jacob 's case he 's stimulated the brain and seems like ... awaked areas injured years earlier . Is he aware of the surroundings ? On and off .

Meaning you gonna do whatever it takes to get the number one car out front and keep it there . What about me ? Me , me , me , there is no me . It 's a team sport now . I want you and Jarod to let Nigel drive behind your cars , block out the leaders so he can gain track position , okay ? Excuse me . Blocking is ... offence . - It 's called racing . - Yeah , so basically Jarod and I are just traffic cops . You have any idea how much money it takes to support three cars ? Fine , dad , I just meant ... Sponsors want to see their product in victory lane . otherwise they find another team . And you go back to ... junk with monster trucks . Which means driving smart , not like that lose kind of brother of yours . Son of bitch . Hey , hey , R.J. Cool down . Come on , Hawkes is right . Jimmy had that business be in number two car , you know it . Yeah , and check the race in last time , I should be top right . Yeah , right . Come on , Hawkes , I 'll show you some in the front of ... Someone should shot that son of bitch for good . You see , that 's the kind of Roemer spirit that I am looking for . I just want to some of them on the track . Some much for the home team . Sydney . Sydney . Oh , god . You scared the hell out of me . You are expecting to find two corpses , Miss Parker ? What did Raines promise you ? What are you talking about ? The sweeper team that showed up at the hospital . You called Raines up , didn 't you ? Admit it ! Let go of me , Sydney . You are the only one who knows my brother is still alive . Raines thinks I murdered Jacob . If he knew he was still alive , I would be in more danger than anyone . I suggest you just check your home phone for bugs . And let go of me . Has he said anything ? I need to reach him , Parker . I need answers . Answers ? About what I 've done . You did brake , Jimmy . But your engine kept running . Jimmy used to walk the stands for every race . He said that felt like being in church . Thanks for getting R.J. to go to see Jimmy . ... his brother . I thought I might help . Yeah . How is he doing ? ... he feels like he failed . Failed ? Me , R.J. , mostly his dad . Grant is pretty intense . Yeah , he always encouraged them to compete against each other . No wonder when Jimmy was seven , Grant took him and R.J. out to a cabin , made them each chop a quarter wood , told them the winner get a brand new Odekirk fishing knife and fishing attachments . I saw the photograph in the trailer . Right , now there is no way a couple of kids can cut out that wood . And Grant knew that . But he left them out there alone in the cold . What happened ? There is a lumber yard nearby . So R.J. .. a tractor , rides up the hill , buys himself a fresh cut .. wood , and wins the knife . Sounds like the real prides was winning his father 's approval . And he would do anything to get it . Something 's never changed . Sydney . Sydney . Catherine . You remember my mother ? You look just like her . Yes . But you remember her . Jacob . Please Jacob , try to remember . Why can 't you remember ? Because he is dying . The same virus that will awaken Jacob is also killing him . He has less than twelve hours left . I am sorry , Sydney . What can we do ? Broots is bringing some my personal items . Photos or movies . If only I can help Jacob remember , maybe he can tell us something about your mother . Or about Jarod . Or maybe he can simply die , Knowing who he is . It 's okay . Now there Andretti is racing ... But stay low , avoid the bumps . You will be glad you did . Something about that voice sounds kind of familiar . But thanks . - What 's that ? - I came across it a throttle cable from Jimmy 's crashed engine . - Well , you are a car inspector now ? - I just want to know how things work . I couldn 't figure out what these scratches were . Jimmy bent the cable plate . And what happens when the cable plates bent ? You bent the cable plate , your throotle stick . Is that what happened to Jimmy ? Look , I did a car inspection after the accident . Jimmy 's crash had nothing to do with a mechanic error . Well , then how do you explain these marks ? Damage in the crash . Come on , I am not a mechanic . But these marks are looked they were made by set of pliers . You are right . You are not a mechanic . Oh , well , this place is really nice . Hey . Here . Hey , do you think maybe I can rent here for some weekend I can bring my daughter here ? - That 's it ? - Yes , it 's over . You can leave now . Okay . Can , can I at least go to the bathroom first ? Is it through here ? Broots , wait . What 's going on ? My Brother Jacob is quite ill . You breed a word of this to anybody and to every diary case and America would be ... your face . Got it ? Yeah . Go back to the Center , if you notice anything unusual , you call me . We need protection for at least for another ten hours . Understood ? Yeah , as good as it never gone out . Why would you want to kill your own brother , R.J. ? Yeah , I just come back . No , it 's quiet . Everything seems to be really cool . Of course , I won 't say anything . Miss Parker . Could you do me a favor ? Could you wish Sydney good luck ... Miss Parker ? Hello ? God , I hate her when she does that . Mr. Raines . Damn it ! I am sorry about that , man . Hey ! So didn 't that eat you up , R.J. ? Now I have to make some major buddy work . You wouldn 't happen to have a small screwdriver or a set of pliers , would you ? Someone broke the lock of garage and stole all the pliers last night . Really ? Can 't trust anybody these days . Hey , Jones , try this . Odekirk . It 's very difficult to come by . Where did you get this ? I won it about a year ago . From whom ? From me . Data hate the soon losers , right ? Did R.J. threaten to take your number one car , Brinkman ? Remember those tennis matches in Yale ? I still think you let me win so that I wouldn 't feel so bad . Jacob . Listen to me . There are things you know , Jacob . Things that can help others . Remember Jarod ? You signed him into the Center . the night he was brought there . Parker and I found files at SL twenty-seven . Your signature was on Jarod 's entrance report . Think back . where did he come from ? What was his real name ? His parents name ? That is the least I can do for him . Since your car accident , I 've done things , Jacob , Unspeakable things , to protect Jarod , to protect you . I even tried to kill Dr. Raines . But the bullet hit his oxygen tank and ... It 's pretty ... , huh ? I rebuilt Jimmy 's engine from the crash . All by myself . I did however have to replace this damaged throttle cable . Maybe I should be a car inspector . What do you want ? Do you remember these markings ? It turns out they were indeed made by a pair of pliers . Pliers from another Odekirk knife . This Odekirk knife . Used to belong to R.J. , but R.J. lost it in a bet to Nigel Brinkman . What 's this got to do with me ? I am glad you asked . This is a videotape , from the surveillance cameras in the garages of Milwaukee . It 's dated the day before Jimmy 's crash . It shows you letting Nigel Brinkman into the number two car garage . Brinkman was worring that R.J. was going to take over the number one car . How was he supposed to know that Jimmy was going to be behind that wheel that day ? Why would I want to hurt R.J. ? Because you wanted Nigel to replace this cruel boss . I found resumes . Resumes of people applying for your job . Oh , god . I am fifty-six years old . I can 't start over again . I never want to hurt Jimmy . What the hell was that kid doing in that car anyway ? He was covering for me . Your hand . Yeah . I started having spasms about six months ago . Day of the race , I was so bad . I could barely hold the wheel . That I asked Jimmy to cover for me . I 've seen cases like yours . It 's treatable . Yeah , I will take care of it later . It 's time to think Jimmy . I messed up , Jarod . I let down my father and almost killed my little brother . You didn 't know that Brinkman messed with the engine . I know now . I am going to do everything I can to make it right . We all will . No , don 't lie to me . I tell you , I don 't know anybody named Jacob . Six hours , Mr. Broots . Is all this discomfort worth for protecting someone like Sydney ? I don 't know what you are talking about . Well then , maybe I can help drag your memory . Look , okay , I think I start to remember . Hello , Anna . It is Jarod . Jimmy would be able to come to the track tomorrow ? " Cart Headquarters " Nigel , it 's Jarod . Hawkes thinks he made a break through on your set up . Can you do a little testing in the morning ? Great . I 'll see you then . I tell you , I don 't have enough courage in the bets . Yeah . - Excuse me , sir . - Yeah . - Could you direct me the public address bead ? - There is a rack in the back . That 's what the problem is . You only got five cameras out there , and I need twice that many . Why don 't you walk on the camera truck ? Television ! I 'd be out of my mind . Can we at least get it on camera positions ? Only one and a half seconds seperating the two cars in the front roads ... Nigel ! Glad you made it here . Hey , if you boys think you can get some more speed out this car , I am ready to go . Where is Grant ? Considering what 's on at last meeting , Hawkes thought it would be wise if we kept this between us until we save the fence up . Okay , let 's go to run . Here you go . Alright , Nigel , have a good run ! Ready ? Go ! How did you feel ? So far so good . I 'm going to warm up then you 'll see what you can do . What the hell Brinkman is doing out there ? You should watch this . And then we have to talk . I 'm going to roam up the next turn round . How does it feel , Nigel ? Oh , man , there isn 't any better than this . Come on , Nigel , you can go faster than that . Jarod , what are you doing out there ? I am just trying to find out what really happened to Jimmy 's car before the crash . I don 't know what you are talking about . Lies . This is what I am talking about . I don 't know anything about Jimmy 's accidental crash . I am pulling in . Not so fast , Nigel . .. game up . I have control on your car . You are out of your mind . Think so ? What the hell I can 't .. ? Now you know how it feels . Careful , I really hate to see you crash . What the hell is going on ? I want to know why you sabotage R.J. ' s car . Why you nearly killed Jimmy Roemer ? You are not making sense , Jarod . Now stop this car ! Stop it , Jarod . ... Give you a information that I had your filled tank on top . So you should be good for at least seventy laps . Bad news is I put on four old tyres . My guess is one of them will blow any time now . You know what that means . I can 't hold this any more . That 's the idea . Oh , right . I ... R.J. ' s car , but I didn 't know that Jimmy 's going to behind that wheel , I swear . I cann 't lose . Now you know how Jimmy felt . I 'm getting to the wall . Jarod , Jarod . You said it yourself , Nigel . That 's racing . Nigel Brinkman ? Come with us , please . Please , Sydney . I don 't have much time . Sydney . I am here , Jacob . I want you to know that no matter what you did , what we did , I never blame you . I think that together we rob Jarod of his life . And for that we will be judged . But I 'm not allowed to be angry , and to forgive . And I only hope that , one day , Jarod can feel the same . Gene . Gene ? Gene who ? Here , try to write it down . Is it Jarod 's real name ? Or his father 's ? Who is Gene ? Please Jacob , I need to know . I am sorry , Sydney . Jacob love this song . And this place . He came to finally find his rest here . Where is he ? - Do you have any sevens ? - Got fish . Check the bedroom . Give you five ? You got to be cheating . No one . I know Jacob was here . You are mistaken . My brother is dead . It 's dangerous to deceive the Center . I wouldn 't push him . A man with a temper to match his marksmanship . Dangerous combo . It 's a beautiful place . Jarod . How did you know ? I called Broots . He told me about Jacob . He said you will be away from the Center for a few days , so I took a chance . Hard to be alone on the world , do we ? I hope Jacob 's passing was ... easy . I believe it was . Before he died , my brother gave me this . What does it mean ? Maybe your name , maybe your parents ' . I wish I could be sure . Anyway , I hope it 'll help you find your own peace on the world . " A Brother Missed " " Indy Show " End Dictation : ± ¿ ± ¿ / ´ Ð ´ Ð - = = YTET PRESENTS = = -

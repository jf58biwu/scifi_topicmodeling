 Nina , I still don 't get it . Which one is baby spice ? Oh , she 's the one that goes like this . I thought that was scary spice . No . Scary spice , she 's all , " wha ! Ssss ! " Mary ! No . Because , see- - daddy ! Hey , magpie . Ha ha ha ! Oh ... oh . What a nice surprise ! Well , not really . I 've left your mother . Again ? Oh , I 'm so sorry . Let me give you two some time alone . Oh , that 's not necessary . They do this every year . I know . I just can 't bear to hear it again . Buh-bye . So how long is this fight going to last ? Oh , this was a bad one , Mary . I broke her sound of music box . Oh , no ! Yep . Your mother and I are through ! 45 years down the toilet . You still got that hide-a-bed in the living room ? Yes . And you don 't mind sleeping on it ? Not really . No . Good morning , Mary . Oh , good morning , Dick . Good morning , Dick . Good morning , George . Aah ! What ? If he 's here , that means the other one 's here , too , and--and she scares me . No , Dick . Daddy 's here alone . [ Whispering ] He left Mother . Oh ... finally . [ Doorbell rings ] I 'll get it ! Hello , Solomons . Hello , George ! Uh , this is my brother Harry . Charmed , I 'm sure . And this is my son Tommy . Hey , there , sport ! Hey ! Cut it out ! He started it ! It 's all right . I left myself wide open . Come on in . All right , then . I 'm sorry . Hi . I 'm Sally . Hi . Let me take your coat , young lady . Oh , thank you . You know ... you remind me of a gal named Betty grable , but I bet she was before your time . Yeah , I 've only been here a couple years . Sit down and let me fix you a drink . Great . I 'll have a beer . A beer ? A beer 's no drink for a lady . Let me make you a lady 's drink . Yeah . A lady 's drink . I like this scotch . Yeah . So does everybody else . So tell me about Normandy again , George . Oh , you just can 't hear enough about the big one , can ya ? No . I love war . Oh , I mean , I hate war , but I love hearing about the killing . You know , I once killed a Nazi with my bare hands . Oh , please ! So , how did it happen ? Well , I was asleep in this burned-out church in the French countryside . And he tripped , and you choked him , and I think it 's getting late . Dick ! Huh ? Oh ! Oh , Mary ! Oh , thank god you 're here ! I had a terrible dream . Your father was there ... and- - and he was telling all these boring war stories . I couldn 't keep my eyes open ! Hello , George . Chop-chop , everyone ! Time to go ! Oh , cool , I 'm still kinda drunk . Hey , there 's no hair on my chest . Thank you , Mary . George , it was a wonderful evening , but I 'm afraid we 've got to be off . Sally ! Really ? So soon ? I didn 't even get a chance to tell Sally about my discharge . That 's not appropriate , dad ! From the air force ! Oh . Well , hey ... why don 't you take Sally to the Rutherford air and space museum tomorrow . You can tell her all about it . Hey , but I thought we were gonna have lunch tomorrow , magpie . Oh , that 's Ok . Well , I 'd love to go . They 've got a perfectly reconstructed p-38 lightning . Could we get it and pretend we 're bombing cities ? I 'll slip the guard a fiver . Oh , you are awesome ! Hey , Tommy , do you like egg salad ? 'Cause I like egg salad . Harry , if you eat Dick 's lunch before we find him , then we have no reason to find Dick . That 's a load off . Ooh , look ! An exhibit on the early days of radio . No . This is just the college 's cruddy old radio station . No . I 'm pretty sure that guy 's animatronic . Hey , Eddie . Are you the D.J. ? Huh ? No . He left for spring break . What ? You mean there is no D.J. ? Well , isn 't that kind of cheating people ? This is , like , 8 watts , man . I mean , how many people is that , like ... 8 ? Oh ! Eddie ! Can I be your D.J. ? Uh , I don 't know . Do you have any experience ? Why , yes , I do ! Yes . I was in charge of the morning drive time zoo crew team at wlmnop . I can work the knobs perfect . Oh , knock yourselves out . All right ! Ooh ! Oh , uh , just ... don 't curse ... and don 't spill Nothin ' , and if ya spill somethin ' , don 't curse . Oh , wait- - wait a second . Whoa ! Whoa ! What do I say ? In 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... good morning , Rutherford . I 'm Harry Solomon . It 's 10 : 52 in the A.M. Here at wpdl . It 's a sunny day , and I 've got a sunny way to play . Here 's one of my favorites , and I hope it 's one of yours . See if you recognize this one . Put the tape in . I don 't know how . Welcome to talk radio , people . Vroooom ! Rat-a-tat-tat - tat-Tat-tat ! Oh , how was the air and space museum ? It was terrific ! I had the best time ! Ooh ! So , you sure you don 't mind me taking the Lincoln ? Not at all . You run your errands in style . Thanks . I 'm gonna pick up that Ella Fitzgerald Cd . Oh , you 're gonna love it ! Oh , I know I will ' cause you know what I like . Oh , isn 't she sweet ? You know , muffin , if I didn 't know better , I 'd say that little gal really likes me . Well , of course she does . You 're wonderful . No . I mean she really likes me . Oh , please . She didn 't want to leave the air museum . Well , obviously , she has some perverse interest in old war relics . In my opinion , if dogs were meant to be on leashes , they would have been born with them . And don 't give me that tired , old argument that their tails are leashes . Ok , let 's check in with the traffic with our good buddy Tommy g ! Thank you very much . Well , uh ... there 's a truck out there , and now it 's gone . Back to you , Harry ! Let 's be careful out there , people ! Ooh , hey , we got an in-studio guest : miss Nina Campbell ! Hey , you guys , I turned on the radio , and I couldn 't believe it ! This is so great ! Yeah . I wanna send some shouts out to Steven and bobby and Clarisse- - ooh ! And Reggie and shy girl and little b and- - no . This is my show . Ooh , we 've got a caller on line 1 . Go ahead , caller . Yeah . I totally disagree with you on that whole leash law thing . Oh ... well , that 's too bad ... because you , my friend , are wrong . You tell him , Harry ! Yeah ! Next sound you hear will be the sound of me hangin ' up on a dumb ass . Ok , so far you 've attacked leash laws , city council , and some old lady . Yeah , but I 'm runnin ' out of stuff to say . I mean , we need a guest . Oh , you know who you should have on ? George Albright . He killed a Nazi with his bare hands . That 's cool . Well , you certainly are spending a lot of time with that man . Well , why not ? He 's great . He 's not like any guy I 've ever met . He 's so confident . I mean , look at all the plaid he wears . Well , I will admit he is jazzy . Oh , yeah . He 's got style , plus he smells like spices . Old spices . Dick , I finally understand your Albright attraction . It must be their Dna . They 're irresistible . Yes ! At last I 'm understood ! There 's something about them , a charm ... a magnetism ... a strength ... a quiet force- - they 're both a pain in the ass . I don 't know , you guys . Do you really think a guy like George would be interested in a gal like me ? Sally , why would a guy in his 70s want to be with a woman in her 20s ? Oh ! [ Knock on door ] Oh , hey , Albright , is George here ? Oh , actually , he just went out . With who ? To get a paper . Oh . Come in . Come in . Thanks . You know , Sally , mother and dad do this every year , and I do not look forward to it , so thank you for helping me out . Dad appreciates it . He really does . He does ? He said that ? Tell me exactly what he said , right now . Oh ! He 's having a ball , and I know it 's not easy entertaining dad all day . No , no . I like it . You 're so lucky . Your dad is amazing . Well , I 'm really glad you get to spend some time with my dad . Oh , yeah . But I must warn you . Sometimes he gets a little carried away , and he gets these ideas . All I 'm asking is that you be gentle with him , Ok ? Ok . No more wrestling . No . I 'm serious . I won 't do it again . Ok , Don . Thanks for coming down . We know how busy you are . We appreciate your time . Oh . It 's my pleasure . In fact , I think I got an interesting story for you guys . In 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... and we 're back ! Well , look who dropped by to say hello . Officer Don orvel . Or as he 's known on the streets , Madge with a badge . I 've got this story for you guys . Yeah , so tell me , officer bacon bits ... when you 're working over a suspect , does that make you feel like a big man ? [ Man screams on tape ] Well , Harry , I try not to abuse my badge , which brings me to my story . It 's about- - boring ! So , Don , tell me , what do you think about old dudes dating young , hot babes ? Is it smart or skanky ? I don 't know . I guess I 'm down with that . Mm , you 're down with that ? Yeah . I am . I 'm down with that . Yeah ! He 's down with that . Well , would you still be down with it if the young , hot babe was , oh , say , Sally ... and the old dude was Albright 's dad ? That I 'm not down with . So , Sally likes Mr. Albright . Ha , that 's messed up . Oh , we 've got a caller on line one . You 're on the air with Harry Solomon . Sally : yeah , this is , um , Thelma ... from Ohio . It 's none of your business what I do , and if you idiots keep talking about me , I 'm gonna beat your faces in with a monkey wrench when you get home . New topic . Michelle pfeiffer 's lips . Are they real ? Daddy ? You still up ? Yes . Oh , my god . Oh , my god . Oh , my god . Oh , my god . Oh , my god . Oh , my god . Albright ! Albright ! I 'm being gentle . Heads up ! I 'm coming into the room ! I can 't sleep . We have to talk . Great . Let 's talk . I 'd like to speak to my father alone , please ? Oh , Ok . Good night , sugar . Oh , listen , um , George and I want to take you and Dick out to dinner tomorrow night . Oh , goody . A double date with my dad . Please go . Mary , listen , I just want you to know now that George and I are together , and I 'm not gonna try to replace your mother , Ok ? And I ... I just hope to become a way better mother and gradually turn you against her . I 'm not gonna call you mummy . Sally 's fine . Oh ! Listen , I want to take you shopping next week , get you a pretty new dress . Would you like that ? Did I tell you she 's got the hots for me ? Was I right ? Stop this foolishness and go back to mother ! No ! After 45 years of pure misery , I finally think there 's a plan for the universe . Why her ? Well , she listens to me . She finds me interesting . I 'm crazy about her . And that 's why I think I 'm gonna give her this . That 's mother 's heirloom bracelet . Well , Martha doesn 't wear it anymore . I 've been waiting for her to die to get that ! We all have . We all have . Oh , yeah ? Well , why don 't you come down to the station and make me , ya big jerk ? ! [ Pow ] Harry , she was 8 years old . She just wanted to know if it was gonna rain . [ Boom ] You just stifle it , little man . So George thinks we should take a cold water cruise , because it 's far more interesting than doing that whole island thing . Oh , yeah . There 's nothing like snuggling up on the deck with your sweetie and a hot toddy . Where the hell have you been ? And don 't go too far ! Would you like to dance ? Oh , I 'd love to . Oh , whoopsie , Mary . Let me get it . Good double-baked potatoes . Look at those two . Who ? Woody and soon-yi over there . This world works in wonderful and mysterious ways . What does that mean ? Those two people could be fated to fall in love , just when your mother was conveniently out of the way . Look at him dancing , gushing all over her . Dancing ? Making a fool of himself . Dancing . Is this mayonnaise or horseradish ? Of course I know what it is with Sally . She 's just trying to replace the father she lost . Oh ! Oh ! Whatever it is , it 's hot . Don 't tell me I 'm jealous , because I 'm not ! My mouth is on fire . That 's my daddy ! That 's my napkin ! Daddy , you want to dance with me ? Well , sure ... kitten . I 'll dance with you , Sally . He called her kitten ! I 'm kitten ! Can 't you be pumpkin ? I don 't want to be pumpkin ! We 're gonna have to get some things straighten out if she 's gonna be my mother-in-law . But aren 't you gonna be her stepmother ? Whatever . Excuse me . Uh , shall we dance ? Dad- - no ! Why ? Sally , people are watching . Oh , yeah ? Ohh ! I was dancing with my daddy . No ! You were dancing with my boyfriend . He was my daddy way before he was your boyfriend . Listen , I think you 'd better grow up . George and I are a thing , and you just better get used to it , Missy . Well , you just better get used to me ! Is there something wrong , kittens ? No ! Nothing ! Ok . We 're back . Let 's go to the phones . Who 's on ? Nobody . Yeah . We haven 't had a call since you made fun of that lady 's dead cat . Maybe we need a new topic . Ooh , that 's a good idea . Hey ! Let 's go one-on-one with Nina Campbell . Ok . Ok . So , Nina , how many dates have you had lately , like zero ? What ? No , no , no ! It 's Ok . I think I know what the problem is . Oh , really ? Yeah . You 're a great big loser . I don 't have to take this ! Yes , you do 'cause you 're a loser . I 'm out of here ! Wait , Harry , what are you doing ? Well , I 'll tell you what I 'm not doing . I 'm not just sitting there being a pimple rancher . How 's the new crop this year , teen boy ? This is over . I am gone ! Oh , go ! Leave ! I don 't care . I don 't need any of you . Come baaack ! [ Knock on door ] Hey , Sally . Hey , George . Listen , we have to talk . Well , come in . What 's the matter ? Well , um , I 've been thinking . And , uh , I think we should cool things off a bit . Oh , if I had a nickel for every secretary I 've said that to . No , no , no , I 'm serious . Well , why ? Well , I just- - I 'm not ready to be with somebody who has children . What , Mary ? She really can take care of herself . Oh , let 's not fool ourselves , George . She 's gonna be a lot of work . You can 't just ignore her . You know that . She 's old . This isn 't easy for me , Ok ? I don 't want to penalize you for being a great dad . It 's just- - I have to be selfish here . I knew I should 've closed this deal the night we met . I knew that . I think maybe you should go back to your wife . Aw ... well , I usually do . Well , there you go . Bye , sugar . Sally . Albright . Look . I 'm sorry for the way I acted the other night . Maybe we should all talk this out . No . There 's nothing to talk about . Martha and I- - I 'm going back to mother . Really ? ! Yeah , he is . And I 'm sorry if this caused any friction in your relationship . But , Mary , I just want you to know something . I could 've had him . She ain 't lying . dad , are you sure you have everything ? Yeah . Mary , I wouldn 't mention this Sally thing to mother . Gee , dad , I don 't know if I can do that . Here . My lips are sealed .

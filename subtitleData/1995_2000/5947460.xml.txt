 Good morning , Harry . What are you eating ? New cereal . " Monopoly " ? Finally ... a cereal about real estate . Uh , Harry , that 's a game , like " life . " Life 's a cereal too . - And a magazine . - Yeah , and a bowl of cherries , but that doesn 't change the fact that you 're eating little plastic houses . Plastic , no . These houses are just stale . Stale plastic ! Sally , did you take my blue suit to the dry-cleaners ? Oh , no , it was too expensive , so I dry-cleaned it myself . Here . I think I may have sanded off a button , but .. - you ruined this suit ! - I knew you were gonna say that . Mary wants me to wear this to our party tomorrow night . Uh , wait , don 't you mean her party ? No , ours , it 's the first party we 're hosting together . So exactly which part of the party is yours ? Oh , I 'm in charge of the hors d 'oeuvres . I 've chosen miniature egg rolls . Oh . Well , you know , brown goes with egg rolls . Why don 't you wear your brown suit ? No , Mary wants the blue . And if Mary wants the blue , Mary gets the blue . Uh , permission to state the obvious , high commander ? - Permission granted . - You are so whipped . - Excuse me ? - Yeah , Dick , whipped like pudding . Pudding-whipped ? I 'm not pudding-whipped . The woman tells you how to act . - And what to say . - And what to think . - And how to act . - I said that . I know , I just wanted in . Look , I will say this once and once only . I am the high commander and nobody has control of my life , especially Mary , is that understood ? yes , sir . - Good . Sally , pour me a cup of coffee and a bowl of monopoly . But , sir .. ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah . The high commander has spoken . Nina , do you think I 'm whipped ? - " Whipped " ? - I know , it 's crazy . - By Dr. Albright ? What was I thinking ? - Dr. Solomon ? - Yes , Nina . You are wrapped around that woman 's finger like a yo-yo . And she is always walking the dog . - Mary , we need to talk . - Oh , Dick can it wait ? I 'm late for class . Mary , I will not be wearing my blue suit to our party tomorrow night . Okay . You 're positive , it 's all right ? - Sure . - Oh , great . That 's great . I 'll wear my brown suit . Uh , no , no , no . Why don 't you wear \ your blue blazer and khakis ? Okay . And you really should get a haircut before tomorrow night . - You can go at lunch . - No , absolutely not ! I 'll go at 2 : 00 . Damn ! Five ... .. One , two , three , four .. eh , eh , you 're not the top hat , I 'm the top hat . You 're the boot . - I 'm not the boot . - Harry , who 's the boot ? Sally said she wanted to be the boot , because it reminded her of a boot . Fine , I 'm the boot . One , two , three , four , five . Community chest . " You have won second prize in a beauty contest . Collect $ 10 . " Ooh , $ 10 , you must be real pretty . Yeah , pretty close to owning your knobby butt . Now roll the dice , you long-haired alien freak . Now , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine . " Go to jail . " Go directly to jail . Do not pass " go , " do not collect $ 200 , and do not , I repeat , do not drop the soap . And so you will see that a equals dv - over dt which equals d over dt , enclosed- - oh , good , I 'm glad you find newton 's laws in vector notation as hilariously misconceived as I do . It 's not why they 're laughing , Dr. Solomon . They 're laughing because of this . A woman in a cocktail dress ? Turn it upside down . Oh , my ... I 'm sorry , I 'll have to confiscate this until I 'm through . Dr. Solomon , can I get that back ? It 's for my brother 's bachelor party . - Bachelor party ? - He 's getting married , and all the guys are taking him to a strip club . Strip club ? " Roy 's house of class . " Why wasn 't I invited ? But Dr. Solomon , it 's just a pathetic excuse for guys to get together and behave like pigs . So why wasn 't I invited ? Well , Dr. Solomon , we just didn 't think that maybe you ... no , you think that I 'm too whipped to go to your twisted little soir√©e ? - Sorry , Dr. Solomon . - Apology accepted . Just tell me where it is and I 'll be there . Well , uh ... we don 't exactly have a time set yet- - yeah , we 're not really even sure with the wind and ... 8 : 00 tomorrow night . What could I do he was staring right at me . Friday night , 8 : 00 , " Roy 's house of class . " Ow , ow , ow , oww ! Next time , my answer is paper . Oh , Dick , would you do me a favor for tomorrow night ? Would you keep an eye on Sal Talbert ? Last party , I think he tried on some of my teddies , they were stretched out in the strangest places . Oh , don 't open those , I want that fresh for the tapenade . If I had something I had to do tomorrow night- - something else- - you 'd understand , wouldn 't you ? Dick , we 've been planning this party for weeks . All your boring physics friends are coming . Well , I- - I know , but it 's an emergency- - an emergency bachelor party at Roy 's house of class . Who 's getting married ? Bug 's brother , Fred- - or Frank , or something . You 're going to abandon me to go to a party for someone you don 't even know ? Pitman 's going . - This whole party was your idea . - No , it wasn 't . - Yes , it was ! Yes , it was ! - No , it wasn 't ! No , it wasn 't ! Yes , it was- - we were at " the sea shanty " with the sullivans . You were having crab cakes , which you hated . They sang " happy birthday " to the kid at the next table . You jumped up and said " I wanna have a party too ! " Oh , that is absolutely untrue ! Dick , this is your party . You can 't leave me alone with those physics guys . - I have nothing to say to them ! - Fine , I 'll be here . Who needs fun anyway ? I want Tennessee . You already own the railroads and all the utilities . I need Tennessee . I need it bad . You just need to be the big man , don 't you ? Well , you know what , Tommy ? It 's the little ones . The ones who labor to build houses on the baltics and the Mediterranean , the ones who pay school taxes and property taxes . The ones who are happy just to get a bank error in their favor . For they 're the ones , Tommy ! The ones who own this country . I 'll give you $ 400 and my " get out of jail free " card . Thank you very much . I have made a command decision . I am no longer whipped . Good for you . I 'm tired of feeling like a catholic schoolboy always getting his knuckles wrapped by the nun he 's dating . So , what 's sister Mary Albright gonna say about this ? She 'll just have to accept it , because I 'm the man ! I 'm stronger than she is , I have a larger cranium . I 'm far more likely to go to prison . I 'm the man ! Now , if I could just find someone who could teach me how to act like one . - Tommy . I 'm sorry , but before you teach him how to be a man , shouldn 't you get August 's permission first ? She told me not to call her until after dinner . Problem is that you both had your masculine energy zapped by blond chick goddesses . Guess that makes me the only real man in the room . Not even Sally can make that claim . That 's true . How do you do it ? Who , me ? By keeping it real , Dick . Keeping it real . You think you could help me ? Follow me . So , ermm ... you wanna watch the pencil - neck leading the hen-pecked ? Oh , so I take it you 're forfeiting , 'cause either you 're rolling these dice or you 're forfeiting . Ha ! " Free parking , " loser ! First of all , you need a manly name . " Dick " is so ... girly . You need something hip , something sexy , something that says , " I 'm a real man , " something like ... " Manny . " Harley . Tubby . Batman . - How ' bout " solom-oh-n " ? - Ooh-oh ! Oh , I like that . " Dick Solomon ... " hi , I 'm Dick Solomon . How much are those pliers ? No , no ... don 't look at your fingernails like that . It 's not manly . This way . Manly . Not manly . Very manly . Manly no , manly yes . How ' bout scratching ? Outside the pants , manly . - Inside the pants ? - Too manly . This is so hard , Harry . How does a real man know what to do ? Look deep inside yourself . Find your primal instincts . Now let it come out , slowly . Now let it go , let it go . - Hey , baby , what 's shaking ? - Harry : ooh ! There you go . Now ... walk the walk . Now talk the talk . Hey , mama , I got ants in my pants and they make me do the hula dance . - You the man . - No , you the man . - No , you the man . - No , you the man . - No , you- - - Damn it , Harry , I 'm the high commander ! If I say " you the man , " you the man . Okay , okay . I 'm the man . oooooh ladies . Hey , Judith , did those fries come with soup ? I 'd sue him if I knew what he was talking about . Oow ! - Hey , did it hurt ? - What ? - When you fell from heaven ? - Oh ! What 's that smell ? That 's the scent of a man ... and brut . Go home and take a shower . You steel wool . The party 's tonight . What makes you think I 'm coming to our little party ? This eldorado is leaving for " Roy 's house of class . " Is this a test to see how pissed I can get ? Oh , come on , Mary , you can 't run my life . - Your what ? - I have to be my own man . Fine . Go ahead . Go to " the house of class . " Leave me alone to entertain your friends . Right I will . That was easier than I thought . Oh ! - I tell you what you 're gonna do . - What am I gonna do ? You 're giving me Marvin gardens . I 'm giving you waterworks and St. Charles . I don 't want waterworks . I 'm giving you waterworks , St. Charles and $ 200 . - You 're taking the deal . - I 'm not taking the deal . - $ 400 , take a deal ! - $ 500 ! Deal ! You 're gonna like this deal . Tommy , Dick and I are going to the bachelor party , wanna come ? Does it look like I have time for strippers ? I 'm playing freaking monopoly here . Come on , Harry , let 's make like a banana split and leave . Boy , don 't you look stupid . You 're just upset ' cause you have to be pretending to be my sister and can 't get any play . Yeah , right . Hey , Dick , why don 't you slip one of these in your wallet ? Might come in handy . A moist towelette ? In case they serve ribs . Ow , my god , I love you . I love you ! I 'm an ice cream sandwich . Okay , Dick ... the thing about these women is you 've got to play it cool . Just ignore ' em , pretend they 're not even here . Can I get you something to drink ? Oh , man , Solomon 's here . - Hi there . - Well , hello . How 'd you like to buy a bottle of champagne ? - How much ? - $ 75 . What , for a bottle of champagne ? Are you crazy ? How ' bout if I sit down and drink it with you ? Well , then you should buy it yourself . I mean , at least pay for half . I gotta ... .. I gotta pass go . Roll the dice .

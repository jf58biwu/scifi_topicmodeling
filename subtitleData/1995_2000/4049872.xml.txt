 The Kol-Ut-Shan ... a cornerstone of our beliefs . Infinite diversity in infinite combinations . I know all about Vulcan philosophies . Why have you come here ? I was sent against my will . Then I suggest you leave . I 'm not a prisoner ? Only of your emotions or so I have been told . My emotions free me . I see . It 's regrettable that I won 't be able to teach you . Where should I go ? Are you seeking my counsel ? I ... can 't return home . My father has banished me . Your school ? They revoked my seat . Why ? Because I refuse to deny myself passion , the way you and men like my father do . You reject logic ? If I was meant to deny feelings , why was I born with them ? Where 's the logic in that ? Hidden for you to find ... or in plain sight for you to ignore . You speak in riddles because the truth frightens you . You 're right . It does frighten me . You are surprised to hear a Vulcan master admit to having emotions ? Yes . Emotions can be a powerful tool . To deny their existence is illogical , but you must learn to control them . Why ? Do you wish to be taught ? I would question everything you say . You would not be a worthy pupil otherwise . Let us begin . Sit down , Tuvok . Tun beveg ! Uh , sorry ? Senn ... nebah senn ? Either the universal translator 's off-line or I hit my head harder than I thought . Ruck . All right . Take it easy . All right , all right . Take it easy . Fitah ! This ? Listen , I really need this . Fitah ! Ud neetot ! Okay , okay . First day in town and I 've already been mugged . Ah . I 'm Commander Tuvok of the Starship Voyager . Tuvok . Tuvok . Yes . And you ? Noss . Noss . We 'll go to my vessel . I see you 've already been there . Mayday , Mayday . Paris to Voyager . Respond . Aw , come on . Her name is Noss . She was attacked by two humanoid males . You sure she didn 't attack them ? They were attempting to rob her . Seems to be a local pastime . She requires medical attention . I 'd love to help , but somebody stole our medkits . Food . What 's the status of the shuttle ? Fractures throughout the hull , environmental systems down , impulse engines are beyond repair . Told you we should have brought the Delta Flyer . Communications appear to be functional . Won 't do us any good . Every time I transmit a signal , it gets bounced back by the distortion field that pulled us down here . It looks like we fell into some kind of gravity well . As far as I can tell , this planet is a part of an entire solar system that is stuck in a pocket of subspace . Fascinating . Yeah . Well , scientific interest aside , I don 't see any easy way out of here . No doubt Voyager has begun a rescue effort . The Doctor ? His mobile emitter was damaged during the crash . With a little luck , I might be able to repair it and bring him back on line . Make it your top priority . Gren , gren . What is it ? 13 humanoids approaching ... the same species that attacked her . Gather as many supplies as you can carry . We 're leaving . You really think it 's smart to abandon the shuttle ? Noss appears to have survived here for some time . It 's logical to assume she has access to a more secure shelter . Nemmok . Eilen . Eilen . Whatever you say . Eid kahn . Doesn 't look like this bird 's going to fly , either . Minimal power and life-support , but the ship is protected by a force field . That explains how she 's been able to survive here . Anything resembling an engine ? I 'm detecting engine debris two kilometers away . It is of the same configuration as this vessel . Great . We 've got two unusable ships , and the only way Voyager is going to detect our distress call is if they crash-land right on top of us . Progress ? The optronic relays took heavy damage . I 'm bypassing the primary circuits . Come on , Doc . I know you 're in there . I 'm guessing we hit a snag . An accurate assumption . Rev din ud ? Ud rev ? Tun sang . Ton rev ud tim seid . You speak her language ? A universal translator was written into my program . Ask her how long she 's been here , if she knows a way to get back through that sinkhole . Din yee ton ud lurka ? Pah din nefta menruk ? Lurka heen . Zin ik lurka ud ruck totta . Mah 'ees bin ruck ayah . What 'd she say ? She said she 's been here 14 seasons and in that time , she 's seen many ships come down , but she 's never seen one go back up again . Come back , you little bloodsucker . I don 't know what 's worse- - catching them or eating them . No poison . Well , they may not be poisonous , but they give me the creeps . Maybe I should have left the hunting to you and Tuvok . Let me . Looks delicious . Shut down my program ? Why ? Our resources are severely limited . We may need your mobile emitter as a source of power . I 'm a Doctor , not a battery . Until we 're rescued or you 're needed for an emergency , I must insist that you remain off-line . Make way for the mighty hunters . If Mr. Paris ' hunting ability is any indication , maybe we should take him off-line . Thanks for the vote of confidence , Doc . The hunt was good . Impressive . Voyager has 15 decks , a crew of 152 , warp and impulse engines . I want to see . Someday , perhaps . Tell me about you there . I am the Chief Tactical Officer . What else ? Can you be more specific ? Your duties , uh ... Where you sleep ? What you eat ? Music ? Friends ? Why is any of that relevant ? Because it is you . When I first met her , she wouldn 't even look at me , but she warmed up after , oh ... three years . The longest flirtation in Starfleet history . No kidding . She sounds ... fascinating . I just hope I see her again . You must really ... bot yah jouton . Love her very much . Yeah . More spiders ? Oh , no , thank you . Three 's my limit . I will assist you . Well , I suppose it 's time I shut down my program . Good night , Doc . She likes you . She has been alone for many years . She appreciates our company . No. I mean ... she likes you . What are you implying ? Oh , come on , Tuvok . You may be cold , but you 're not blind . Need I remind you that I am married ? Your wife is 50,000 light-years away in a different layer of space . The chances of you ever seeing her again are practically nonexistent . Excuse me . What are you doing ? I 'm recalibrating the distress beacon . Listen , um ... what I said in there about your wife- - l 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to hurt your feelings . I have no feelings for you to hurt . I think you do . You work hard to bury them , but they 're there . And even if they 're not , this is home now . You might as well accept it and try to find as much happiness as you can . Listen , you have a chance to make a decent life for yourself here . There is still a possibility that Voyager will rescue us . You may see Lieutenant Torres again . If I didn 't know you better , I 'd say you were trying to cheer me up , Tuvok . is there a point to your pessimism ? It 's not pessimism . It 's practicality . You of all people should understand that . Look , I 've never met your wife , but if she 's half as logical as you are , I bet you she 'd tell you the same thing . Your attempt to play matchmaker is misguided . I am not experiencing Pon farr . What difference does it make ? You obviously care about Noss . If you won 't admit it to me , at least admit it to yourself . I respect her ability to survive . It 's more than that . I 've seen the way you look at her . What way is that ? Like someone who wishes he wasn 't Vulcan . I 'm sorry I was born Vulcan . B 'Elak paar . Self-pity . Are you cataloging my emotions ? What is the source of your self-pity ? Isn 't it obvious ? If I weren 't Vulcan , I wouldn 't be here now , going through this pointless ritual . You see only what is in front of you . You must learn to see behind you . Another riddle . I have no eyes to see behind me . You have the eyes of memory , the knowledge of why you are here and why you have lost control . Tell me your story . My father 's already explained it . I wish to hear it from you . Her name is Jara . Her father 's a Terrelian diplomat . She 's been granted a seat at my school . And you have developed an emotional attraction toward her . Yes . You love her . Yes . Does she love you ? No . She 's ... Jara ... doesn 't return my feelings . What if I were to say that I received a letter from your father telling me that Jara is in love with one of your fellow students ? That 's a lie ! Who is it ? Jealousy ? I 'll challenge him . That would be illogical , because I have received no such letter . You 're trying to trick me . No. I 'm trying to help you to understand . Shon-ha 'lock- - love- - is the most dangerous emotion of all . It produces many other emotions- - jealousy , shame , rage , grief . You must learn to suppress them all . Otherwise , they will consume you . I can sense emotions building inside you like a gathering storm . If we begin now , we may be able to stop them . Captain 's Log , supplemental . It 's been over an hour since the shuttle disappeared from sensors . I 'm not detecting any debris . Maybe the shuttle was tractored or transported somewhere . Scan the region . Look for plasma emissions or EM displacements- - anything that might indicate another ship . Nothing out of the ordinary- - hydrogen , helium , space dust . There has to be something out there . Shuttles don 't just vanish into thin air . It 's a gravimetric shear . Source ? Unknown . Red Alert . Helm , full ahead . We 're caught in some kind of subspace sinkhole . It 's pulling us in . The gravimetric shear 's increasing . Go to warp . I can 't establish a stable field . Then we need more power to the impulse engines . That won 't be enough . We 've got to find a way to counter the gravitational pull . B 'Elanna , vent three million isodynes of plasma from the nacelles . Chakotay , reverse shield polarity . We 're clear . Move us away . Stand down Red Alert . Secure all stations . I 'd say we have a pretty good idea what happened to that shuttle . The anomaly is approximately 600 meters in diameter . It 's out of phase with normal space . Even after recalibrating the sensors , it barely registers . The distortion circumscribes a subspace zone that includes a type-G sun and three planets . Any sign of the shuttle ? No . I 'd say it 's time to break out the multispatial probe . Agreed . What the hell is that ? A vessel approaching off the port bow . They 've locked on a tractor beam . Captain to the Bridge . I 'm only going to say this one more time . Disengage your tractor beam , sir . You were in danger of being pulled into the distortion . You should show a little gratitude . We appreciate your help , but we didn 't ask for ... Captain , this is Mr. Yost . Supervisor Yost , Renovation Team Nova . Captain Janeway of the Starship Voyager . Until tomorrow , I suggest you stay at least two million kilometers from the distortion . What happens tomorrow ? The rift will be closed by then . Some of our crew are trapped inside . I am sorry . We have lost 1 1 ships to the distortion over the last year . It must be sealed . What about your people ? Even if there were survivors , there 's no way to rescue them . The best we can do is to prevent others from being trapped . We can 't abandon our crew . If you could delay your mission ... My orders are to seal the rift by this time tomorrow . If you want to attempt a rescue between now and then , the risk is yours to take , but I wouldn 't advise it . Launch the probe . Aye , Captain . Work with B 'Elanna and Seven to enhance the sensors . Do whatever you can to find Tom and Tuvok . I 'll be looking for a way to counter those gravitational forces . Come in . I 've been brushing up on sinkholes , quantum singularities . Any luck ? All the data leads me to the same conclusion . They 're mono-directional phenomena- - what goes in doesn 't come out . Well , if it 's any consolation , something 's coming out of that anomaly . What is it ? Telemetry from our probe . We 've located the shuttle 's distress beacon on a Class-D planet . Vulcan , human , alien life signs . At least we know they 're alive . Keep reading . There 's astronomical data here covering a three-month period . How is that possible ? There seems to be some sort of temporal differential . How big a differential ? It 's difficult to say , but every hour that passes for us could mean weeks , even months for Tom and Tuvok . Months trying to survive in a Class-D environment ? And more than likely , they 've assumed that we left them behind long ago . Ready for the bad news ? You 're kidding . The gravitational stress is increasing . Seven believes the sinkhole is on the verge of collapse . When it does , everything inside will be crushed . Noss ! Medical tricorder . We were ambushed . Give me 20 milligrams of inaprovaline . They got away with a pair of resonator coils that we found . Three fractured ribs , subdural hematoma , internal bleeding . Will he live ? Vulcans are very resilient . He 'll be fine . How long has it been since I was last activated ? Almost two months . Two months ? ! So ... what 's new ? Oh , same old thing- - fighting off scavengers , hunting spiders ... No word from Voyager ? . They 're probably 300 light-years closer to home by now . I think I should remain on-line until Mr. Tuvok is fully recovered . It 's good to have you back , Doc . Rest . How long was I unconscious ? Too many hours . Mr. Paris ? He 'll be fine . I was afraid . It is good to see your eyes . Don 't . I only want ... to show you how I feel . You ... you-you feel nothing for me ? I told you , I don 't experience emotion . I have developed an appreciation and respect for you- - nothing more . Nothing ? I am sorry . I cannot return your affection . You cannot or you will not ? A minor distinction . Logic ! I hate logic ! Your emotions will only exacerbate the situation . Shevrot kat ! Insulting me will not help . Derot oraht ! We can use the multispatial probe as a transporter relay . It 'll take a little time to reconfigure the targeting scanners , but , with a little luck , it should work . Any reason we can 't use the same relay to send a com signal ? I don 't see why not . Good . Let them know that help is on the way . Captain to the Bridge . They 've started ahead of schedule . Hail them . Yes ? It was my understanding you wouldn 't begin for another six hours . We 're ready now . Well , we 're not . We need at least another two hours to make a rescue attempt . I 'm sorry . How long until they seal the rift ? Approximately 30 minutes . Then that 's all we 've got . Tuvok ? Hey ! I am meditating , Mr. Paris . I don 't care . I trust there is an urgent reason for your lack of courtesy . You 're damn right there is . What did you say to her ? Our conversation was private . Well , whatever you said , she 's talking about leaving , going off by herself , because it 's too painful to be around you . She is under the influence of unfettered emotions . Well , maybe you 're able to " fetter " your emotions , but the rest of us don 't have that luxury . She is a living , breathing woman , who , for reasons that I can 't begin to fathom , has fallen in love with you . Now , if you 're incapable of returning her feelings , at least show her some compassion . Try to let her down easy . There is no easy way to recover from infatuation . Oh , really ? And what do you know about infatuation ? More than you might imagine . Enlighten me . I have no intention of continuing this conversation any further . Come on , Tuvok . Come on ! It 's just you , me and the rocks . When I was a young man , I experienced an emotional attraction toward a woman . It nearly destroyed me . Your wife ? No . Her name was Jara , a Terrelian female . I would have violated every tenet of Vulcan philosophy simply to be near her . She must have really been something . I lost all sense of who I was . The emotional attraction I felt for her became a kind of ... insanity . Tuvok , everyone feels a little insane when they fall in love ... but it 's worth the risk . For you , perhaps , but I am Vulcan . My natural emotions are erratic , volatile . If I don 't control them , they will control me . Whatever happened to Jara ? I chose to leave her . I spent several months in isolation , studying with a Vulcan master . I learned to suppress my emotions . Too bad . Gravimetric distortions . What 's causing them ? Unknown . No response to our hails , Captain . At this rate , their anti-graviton beam will seal the distortion in approximately 29 minutes . Transporter status ? I 've completed the reconfiguration , but we 're only going to be able to relay one transporter beam through the probe . We 'll have to get Tom and Tuvok within a two-meter radius of their distress beacon . Harry ? I 've opened a channel . Voyager to away team . What is it ? The distress beacon . We 're receiving a transmission . Can you route it through your com system ? If I 'm right , this message was sent almost nine hours ago on a very slow carrier wave . Can you speed it up ? I 'll try . Voy-a-ger ... to ... away team . A transporter beam with a radius of two meters will activate at the coordinates of your distress beacon in exactly 30 minutes . " 30 minutes " ? That would have been over eight hours ago . Shh . There 's more . Be advised we 've detected a temporal differential between our two positions . According to our calculations , the differential ratio is .47 44 seconds per minute . Repeat : Voyager to away team . A transporter beam with a radius of two meters ... According to that formula , 30 minutes would translate to two days , 1 1 hours and 47 seconds . Well , we 've waited this long . Tom . The force field is holding . Not for long if they keep pelting us with these photon grenades . How are we supposed to hold them off for two more days ? The rift will be sealed in less than two minutes . Move us into range . Stand by for transport . Yes , ma 'am . The force field is losing power . Time ? We still have another hour before transport . Where are you going ? To repair the field generator . I will accompany you . No . You stay . Prepare for the attack . You can 't go alone . Risking two lives ... would be illogical . We 're in transporter range . Link up with the probe and relay the signal . Stand by . I 've got a lock on their beacon . They 're supposed to be ready for transport in 32 seconds . Let 's hope they don 't stand us up . Begin 20-second countdown on my mark . Now . We 've got less than ten minutes to transport . Where the hell is Noss ? ! I 'll find her . 15 seconds . fourteen ... thirteen ... Tuvok ... I could not leave you behind . Nine ... eight ... seven ... Now , Mr. Paris ! Hurry . Four ... three ... two ... lnitialize transport sequence . Energize . We 've got them . Welcome back . Who ... ? A friend . Commander Tuvok , Personal Log , Stardate 52438.9 . We are en route to Noss ' homeworld . As I prepare to say good-bye , I find myself experiencing a certain discomfort . Tuvok . Weird day . Problems ? I 've spent the last two months wondering if I 'd ever see B 'Elanna again . As far as she 's concerned , it 's only been two days . I guess I expected her to have missed me , too . Were it not for the time differential , I 'm sure she would have experienced a deep sense of loss . You know something ? I always thought that beneath that cold Vulcan exterior lay a ... even colder Vulcan interior , but now , I 'm convinced you 're a hopeless romantic . There is no need to insult me , Mr. Paris . Oh , here they are now . I was just getting Noss ' recipe for sautéed spiders . She told me how much you enjoyed them . Let 's just say it 's an acquired taste . Good-bye , Tom . Thank you . Come on , Neelix . Oh . Of course . Crewman . I 'm sorry . For what ? I know how difficult this was for you ... for us . I just wish things had been different . As do I . I understand . Thank you . Live long and prosper , Noss . You , too . Infinite diversity ... ln infinite combinations . Your training is now complete . You have done well . Thank you . You are now prepared to return to the world . Grief , anger , fear and especially love , will never threaten you again . I am ... grateful .

 No ! Make them stop ! Anything ? Nothing of relevance . His neural pathways are still fluctuating . Doc ... Can 't you do something ? Look how much he 's suffering . If I sedate him , we could lose any chance of making contact with the aliens . Get them out ! Commander , can you hear me ? Focus on the sound of my voice . I can 't understand them , but they won 't stop talking ! What are they saying ? I don 't know ! Make them stop ! Please ! Janeway to Sick Bay . Any progress , Doctor ? It 's not going well . Our " Ambassador " is still delusional . We 're running out of time . The graviton shear is buckling the hull . If we don 't find a way out of chaotic space soon , we 're going to die here . Chief Medical Officer 's Log , supplemental . Despite my efforts , Chakotay 's condition continues to deteriorate . Doctor ! Yes , Commander ? I 'm tired . I want to sleep . If you lose consciousness , it could sever your link with the aliens . Aliens ? The ones who live in this place . We 're trapped here . They may know a way out . It 's urgent that you speak with them . But I don 't understand what they 're saying . I can try to help you understand . I 'm going to end up like my grandfather- - a crazy old man . No . You 're not crazy . I believe the aliens are reconfiguring your neural pathways , so they can communicate with you . Do you remember the day you were injured on the holodeck ? In the boxing simulation ? Yes . You were knocked down , remember ? I was injured . I came to see you . We had an argument . That 's right . Try to remember more about the holodeck . I was sparring with a Terrellian ... and Boothby was there . He used to train me when I was a cadet . Keep going . What round was it ? Three . Round Three . The fight was going badly . I was avoiding my opponent . Stay away from the ropes , son . That 's it , that 's it . End Round Three . That wasn 't so bad . It was terrible . Am I missing something ? He barely landed a glove on me . Mm-hmm . Give him time . You 're not reading him . You think he 's slow and stupid . I know better . In fact , I know his kind in my bones . Literally . I can count the fractures , if you 'd like . He 's not landing any punches . That 's the problem . You 're not letting him . Have I got this sport all wrong ? Boxing is more about taking the shots than dishing them out . You shouldn 't be dancing away from this fella . Let him punch himself out a little . It all comes down to the heart . Do you have the heart for this ? That 's the contest- - it 's not against him . It 's against your own natural human desire not to get hurt . That 's the real fight . Begin Round Four . Go . Go , go , go . Stay with him . Too close . Come on , come on . Break it up . Thataboy . Keep him busy . Cover up ! How many ? Three . Good guess . I 've got a good mind to use a needle and thread add a little authenticity to your fun . Be my guest . You 'd like that- - a manly scar above your eye . " Chakotay- - the Maquis Mauler . " Pointless violence . That program shouldn 't even be in our database . There 's nothing like a good fight , Doctor . I was there when Price Jones went 23 rounds with Gul Tulet . " The Knockout in the Neutral Zone . " Best match I ever saw . Really ? Most blood spilled ? Or did Price Jones drive Gul Tulet 's nasal bone up into his brain ? You 've got the wrong idea . The idea is simple enough . Do enough damage to your opponent to render him unconscious . How 's the headache ? It hurts . Edema beneath the anterior fossa of the cranium ... hairline fracture of the septum ... I saw something strange . I 'll bet you did . No , before I got hit . What do you mean ? I looked over at Boothby ... He yelled at me ... I turned back ... Then the ring got distorted . An hallucination . You probably had some pressure building up along the optic nerves from a previous blow . No. I was keeping away from him the whole fight . He never touched me . Hmm . A number of the ganglia in your visual cortex are hyperactive . Your opponent wasn 't firing on you with an energy weapon , was he ? Just his gloves . Chakotay to the Bridge . On my way . I want you back in here for some tests ... unless you want to be seeing things on a regular basis . It 's changed course again- - 20,000 kilometers off starboard . lon storm ? Not exactly . It 's two light-years across , emits enough energy for a dozen stars . It doesn 't match any phenomenon in our database , and it won 't sit still . Okay . 1 1,000 kilometers off the port bow . We are too close . I 'm backing us off . The phenomenon has been shifting positions every few minutes . Nothing so massive could move that fast . Full reverse . Maximum shields . Full stop . Anybody want to tell me where we are ? We appear to be inside the disturbance . I 'm picking up a lot of raw data- - subspace flux , graviton waves . Sensors must be confused . The readings are shifting around so much , I can 't make heads or tails of what 's out there . Captain , this is Seven of Nine . Please report to Astrometrics at once . The Borg have been aware of this phenomenon for many years . It 's a zone where the laws of physics are in a state of flux- - " chaotic space . " Why didn 't sensors warn us in time ? Chaotic space appears randomly and unexpectedly . The Borg have observed it throughout the galaxy . Then why hasn 't a Federation starship encountered anything like this ? No doubt some have . Think of all the Starfleet vessels that disappeared under mysterious circumstances . Borg vessels are more advanced , but only one cube has survived an encounter with chaotic space . Those aren 't good odds . If the physical constants are shifting , our sensors can 't function . The problem is here . Changes in the gravitational coefficient will cause sudden shear forces against our hull . Shields will protect us , but only for a time . How much time ? Unknown . We 've got to recalibrate the sensors- - redesign them if necessary . Otherwise , we 're flying blind . Let 's get to work . Begin Round One . Computer , did you say something ? Negative . Pick ' em up , son . It 's the fight you 've been waiting for . Begin Round One . Bridge to Commander Chakotay . Go ahead , Tuvok . Please report to the Bridge . On my way . Graviton wave displacement says we 're moving at warp 6 . Subspace sensors show we 're standing still . We can 't be that far from where we entered . Maybe we should just set a course , go to impulse and see what happens . What would most likely happen is a collision with an asteroid field or a star . That 'd be better than just sitting here ... Report . Torsional shear has increased by 200 percent . Shields ? Holding . Like I was saying , better than just sitting here waiting for our hull to breach . Perhaps we could drop a series of beacons to help us navigate . Now that 's an idea . Did you hear something ? I heard nothing unusual . I didn 't hear anything . Begin Round One . I 'll plot a course and we 'll take it slow . What do you think , Chakotay ? The challenger ... Chakotay ! Don 't you hear that ? Hear what ? Look . Commander ? Are you all right ? Put on the gloves , son . I 'm not ready . Commander . In this corner , wearing the red trunks ... Begin Round One . Bridge to Sick Bay . We 've got a medical emergency . Mm-hmm . Let 's go to 880 hertz . Music lessons ? Pretty soon we 'll be singing duets . I 'm checking to see if there 's been any damage to the auditory nerves- - nothing so far . His vision checks out as well . I 'm afraid the source of the trouble may be a little ... deeper . The family curse . What do you mean ? Chakotay has the genetic marker for a cognitive disorder- - sensory tremens . The primary symptoms are visual and auditory hallucinations . My family doctor suppressed the gene before I was even born , so I never had to go through what the others did- - like my grandfather . For some reason , the gene 's been switched on . I 'm not saying for certain that 's why Chakotay thought he was getting ready for a prizefight , but it 's a good bet ; the holodeck boxing simulation was fresh in his memory . A few misfiring neurons did the rest . This chaotic space we 've entered- - could it be stimulating the gene ? Possibly . The only way to make certain would be to get the ship out of here . In the meantime , the Commander will have to stay in Sick Bay . Tuvok tells me you 've got a mean left jab . Never spar with a Vulcan . How are you doing ? I 'm all right . When I was a boy ... my grandfather started seeing things nobody else could see ... hearing what nobody else could hear . He refused treatment . A couple of hyposprays a day , that 's all he would have needed . But he was stubborn . He said his spirit was in pain ... but that the wound ... must be honored . Crazy old man . Ready , Captain . Janeway to Seven . Bring the grid back on line . Stand by . We 've got sensors . I 'm scanning to 100,000 kilometers ... 700,000 . Sensors are stable to one million kilometers . We won 't be able to scan any further . Are you picking up anything at that range ? No planets , no asteroid fields , no sinkholes . Good enough for me . Set a course dead ahead one-quarter impulse . Sensor status ? Continuing to function . Still nothing ahead . Good . Let 's increase our speed . Mr. Paris , go to half impulse . Wait . It 's a ship . Warp capable . It 's adrift , and the outer hull is damaged . No life-signs . Let 's take a closer look . Computer , let 's hear that again . Why won 't you answer ? Did you give up on me for being so late ? Not my fault . We got lost in here . Why do the stars make such a noise ? Let me sleep . I don 't understand them . I don 't want to talk to them . I just want to go home . That was the final distress call . According to the vessel 's medical records , the Captain and one of his engineers started hallucinating after they entered this space . The physician on board never found a way to treat them . How long were they stranded here ? Almost a year . Eventually , their systems were compromised . They died of exposure . The sensors on that ship are more advanced than ours and they couldn 't find a way out . Let 's hold our position till we have a better idea of what we 're up against . It looks like that 's what they did . And along the way , a couple of them started sounding just like Chakotay . I can 't believe that 's a coincidence . Then why hasn 't anyone else been affected ? That 's a question I can 't answer . Not yet . Request permission to beam their Captain 's body on board . I 'd like to perform an autopsy . Granted . Pull the sensor technology off that ship . Use it to enhance ours . We 're going to need all the help we can get . I made a deep scan of the alien 's brain tissue and sensory organs . The optic and auditory neurons have been partially stripped of their normal protein insulation . The result- - auditory and visual hallucinations . The same symptoms as Chakotay but a different cause . Exactly. ln this case , the gene responsible for producing protein insulation was shut down . By what ? There might be something in chaotic space that reacts with DNA- - alters it . But why it targeted him specifically and now you , I can 't say . is there a treatment ? I can control the hallucinations using a neural suppressant , but , unless I can find a way to deactivate that gene of yours ... I need to go on a vision quest . Captain ? That 's not the best idea right now . A vision quest taps directly into your frontal cortex . It could agitate your mind . Or help me control it . Permission granted . Very well . I will ask you to wear a cortical monitor . It will help me keep track of your vital signs . Ah-koo-chee-moya . I am far from the sacred places of my grandfathers . I am far from the bones of my people , but perhaps there is a powerful being who will embrace me and give me the answers I seek . Grandfather , what are you doing here ? I , uh ... seem to be ... lost . Just a little lost . You didn 't take your medicine this morning . Which medicine are you talking about ? There are many medicines . The one the hospital gave us . Oh , that one . Where are you going ? My spirit doesn 't want that medicine . I don 't care what your spirit wants . You 're going to take it . I don 't think so . Come with me back to the house . Now why would I want to do that ? It 's better where l 'm going . It 's more interesting . Where are you going ? To the place where my spirit lives . Grandfather ! Where are you ? Answer me ! Begin Round One . Begin Round One . The aliens . They were there , watching me . Inside your vision quest ? They were trying to tell me something . What was it ? I don 't know . Are they with you now ? Can you hear them ? Yes . Let them speak to you . No ! They 'll make me go crazy . You 're not going crazy . They 're doing this for a reason . You 've got to trust them . Stop fighting . Open your mind . Let go . Listen . Chaotic space ... intersects ours ... at the 18th dimensional gradient . Voyager entered through ... a trimetric fracture . Trimetric fracture ? We must escape , or we 'll be destroyed . How do we escape ? We 've got to alter our warp field . In what way ? Rentrillic trajectory . Rentrillic ? It doesn 't make any sense . I can 't understand it . I 'm scared I 'm losing my mind ! Try to focus . It 's too much ! I can 't ! It 's too much ! Chakotay ! Get them out ! First contact ? It was brief , but he definitely communicated with them . Rentrillic trajectory . Unfortunately , they never got around to explaining what that meant . Could be some sort of alien geometry , but we 'll need much more . is it safe for him to try to make contact again ? Medically speaking , yes . The problem is convincing the Commander of that . I realize you 're frightened ... but you 're our only hope out of this place . You think this could risk your sanity . But your sanity won 't do you any good if we remain in chaotic space . I need you to keep trying , Chakotay . Will you keep trying ? Keep me posted . Are you ready to continue ? Try to focus on the alien voices . Tell me what they 're saying . I can 't hear them . Are you sure ? Listen carefully . Maybe we can return you to a more receptive frame of mind . Think back to when you first heard them in the vision quest . What were you doing ? Where were you ? In a boxing ring . A strange ring . Was anyone else there ? Yes . My opponent ... Kid Chaos . Describe him . Tuvok ... move into position . Thompson and Sharr , target the midsection . Ensign MacAlister , you and I will aim for the head . Set your phasers to kill . Not exactly the Marquis of Queensberry rules , now , is it ? " Set to kill " ? That 's not even Starfleet . Put down the weapons , son . Tactical advice from an Academy groundskeeper ? We fire at your command , sir . Give that order and you 'll be out for the count- - the whole lot of you . Lower your weapons . Commander ... I said stand down ! We just heard from Vegas , Mars and Orion lll . The odds are running 33 : 1 that he 'll outpoint you . 1 1 : 1 that you 'll be kayoed by the fifth . Subspace radio is calling it " The Disaster in the Delta . " We can still scratch the card . I 'll call the Doctor . We 'll get you out on a medical . He 's trying to hornswoggle us . Double-check those calculations . Let me see that padd . No . Fine . Don 't want to trust your friends ? You 're on your own . I 'm filing a grievance with the Delta Quadrant Boxing Commission ! This bout came out of nowhere ! There 's some sort of scheduling mix-up . You haven 't had the time to train . You 're not ready ! If you fight now , you 'll be destroyed ! I can 't fight now . I 'm not ready for this . Come on ! I can 't stay here ! I follow your example , learn from you , look up to you . I don 't want to lose that . You 'll find another role model . You 'll be okay . You 're my First Officer . Your duty is to this crew . If something happens to me , you 've got to get Voyager home . Tuvok can take command . You 're being selfish , Chakotay . I 'm doing this for you ... for all of you ! A delusion- - dementia puglistica . You 're punch-drunk , Commander . A hard shot to the head and neck , collapses the carotid artery and cuts the flow of blood to the brain . The hook ! The head and neck twist laterally , traumatizing the cerebral tissue . And who can forget the upper cut ? The head snaps back , rupturing tissue in the cerebellum and upper spinal cord ! Yes ! And the result ... of all this poetry in motion ? Neurologic dysfunction , chronic traumatic encephalopathy , loss of balance and coordination , loss of memory . Starting to sound ... familiar ? Chakotay 's fine . He just needs a little conditioning , that 's all . He needs to listen to his doctor and not to his fantasies . Step into that arena and you 'll become what you most fear . What are you talking about ? Oh , he knows what I mean . Don 't you , Chakotay ? Hmm ? What 's wrong ? Victory ... defeat , knockout , TKO ... it 's all beside the point . We know how it really ends- - " a crazy old man ... " Hmm ? It 's your fate , your destiny . There 's no escape . You 've just got to do your best . You can 't let yourself give in to your fears . I 'm not afraid ! Who said you were ? I 'm sorry ! Please come back . They got away . Grandfather . Where did you go ? Some people were shouting at me . They were going for a walk and they wanted me to come along . Oh ... lt 's hard to follow them . Oh , God , they go to strange places . I 'm supposed to be watching you . We 're going to get in trouble if we don 't go back home . Be a good boy and go . We understand . You have to come with me . They say you can come with us . There 's nobody else here . They say you 're just like we are . I 'm not ! I 'm not like you . It 's not so bad . When you get used to it , they 're not so bad . They 're just a lot of talk . Sometimes I wish they were more quiet . But they like to talk . Come home . No . I 'm too tired . This is a nice place ... a nice place to call home . Hmm . Begin Round One . Did you hear that ? No . Yes , you did . There 's a lot of them this time . Tell them to go away ! Go away ! They 've got other ideas . I have to go home ! Wait . They 're coming for you . The challenger- - Chakotay ! Better late than never . They almost scrubbed the bout . I 'm afraid . I know you are . You 'd be a liar if you said anything else . But I 've always been afraid . I know that , too . The champion- - Kid Chaos ! That 's it ! All over ! The fight 's been canceled on medical grounds ! Put ' em down . Let 's go . I hear there 's some bearbaiting at the arena next door ! Have fun ! He 's coming out of it . You stopped the fight . You were stuck in the vision quest . I 've got to go back . You 're going nowhere but Sick Bay . Let me go . Calm down . It 's over for you . - No , let me get in the ring ! - Chakotay ... No . Let me back in the ring . Let me ... 200,000 kilometers . Launch another beacon . Beacon launched . I 'm reading a shift of .003 in the graviton shear . Status ? Shields holding . Speed is steady at one-quarter impulse . Maintain course and heading , Mr. Paris . Sensors are functioning . Our course is still clear . Captain , I recommend we go to three-quarters impulse . lncreasing power to the engines could affect chaotic space . There are too many unknowns . At this speed , we should see daylight in about two months . The longer we 're in chaotic space , the longer we 're exposed to these unknowns . His logic is undeniable , Captain . We should increase our speed . Finally . Who am I to dispute logic ? Take a look at this . It 's the first beacon we launched three hours ago . We 've been going in circles ? To be precise , one large circle . Hold our position . All stop . Report . I 've applied 10,053 algorithms to the energy signatures produced by chaotic space . There is a pattern . Order to chaos ? Observe . An isolinear frequency . Some kind of signal ? I haven 't located the source . It may be natural- - a star or quasar that has managed to survive in chaotic space . But it could be a transmission . Possibly . Have you tried the standard language decryptions ? All of them with no success . Success seems to be in short supply lately . lmpossible . Captain ? And to think ... that kept me from getting an " A. " It was the only question I missed in exo-genetics my senior year . The nucleotide resonance frequency . That signal was designed to activate DNA . It realigned his molecular bonds . Now do you believe me ? They 're the ones who scheduled the fight . They 're promoting it . They 're putting up the purse . His sensory cortex is hyperactive . He 's still hallucinating . It 's not an hallucination not a vision quest- - it 's a prizefight ! Chakotay , do you know me ? Do you know where you are ? I know you , Captain , but you stopped the fight . You ruined my career ! Nobody is going to put me on the card after this ! It 's better for you to rest , Chakotay , until we can figure out why this is happening to you . They want to contact me . Who does ? The people who live here . This will sedate him . Wait a minute . You believe somebody lives here , in chaotic space ? And they 're trying to communicate with you ? Yes ! I saw him ! Tell me about him . What does he look like ? He 's got a couple of kilos on me , a few centimeters in height , but I can take him , Captain ! I just have to stay off the ropes . The holodeck boxing simulation is still strong in his memory . Obviously , it 's the primary source of imagery for his hallucinations . What if those hallucinations are being induced for a purpose ? Aliens who exist on some perceptual wavelength that our senses can 't detect and the only way for them to communicate with us is to alter our senses . Chakotay 's bad gene gave them the opportunity . What are you proposing ? Remember the derelict ship ? Two of their crew members claimed they were seeing things . Was somebody trying to communicate with them ? Was somebody trying to warn them , help them ? Or trying to destroy them , just as they 're trying to destroy us . Why go through all the trouble ? We 're trapped here anyway . Let me back in the ring ! Even if this is some kind of alien communication , it could harm him permanently . Bridge to Captain Janeway . Go ahead , Tuvok . Graviton shear has increased again . Hull pressure is rising . I 'm on my way . Captain ... when have we ever turned away from a first contact ? Send him back in the ring . Report ! Some kind of spatial sinkhole just opened up beneath us ! Full thrusters ! Status ? We managed to sidestep that one , but graviton shear has increased by another 310 percent . Janeway to Sick Bay . Sick Bay here . It 's now or never . Understood , Captain . I 've got to get in there . They 're about to ring the bell . I 'm going to subject you to a field that will enhance the nucleotide bonds . The gene should become fully activated . Do you understand ? I understand . Find us a way out of here . I 'll try . Good idea . Keep him waiting . Let him sweat it out . In this corner , representing the Alpha Quadrant , Earth and humanity , the challenger , Chakotay ! Everybody loves an underdog . And in this corner , champion of the Delta Quadrant , Kid Chaos ! Looks like he 's got a lot of upper-body strength- - a real puncher . Just keep your elbow low when you throw the right and don 't come in too straight ; you 'll be okay . Where 's the scouting report ? We don 't know anything about this guy . I don 't know who I 'm up against ! You 're up against yourself . That 's all you 've got to remember and don 't raise the elbow . Begin Round One . Boothby , where are you ? Still here , son . I 'm not going anywhere . You ... Are ... Far from where ... You ... Call home . You ... Are ... Lost . Do you understand ? Yes . We are far from home . We are lost . - Our ... - Home ... ls here . Our ... Home ... is here ... ln chaotic space . - Chaotic space ... - Chaotic space ... Hang in there , son . Protect your head ! I understand ! - We are too ... - Alien ... - For you . - We are too ... - Strange ... - For you . Maybe we 're the ones who are too alien ... too strange . - lf ... - You ... - Stay ... - ln chaotic space ... - Chaotic space ... - Chaotic space ... You 'll be destroyed ! We know that ... but we can 't navigate . Our sensors don 't work in your space . 20 more seconds ! Don 't go down ! - Your ... - Sensors must be ... Realigned ... How can I ? - Your mind ... - Must be ... - Realigned ... - Realigned ... Realigned . - Your mind ... - Must be ... - Realigned . - l understand . End Round One . Get them out ! Let go , Commander ! I can 't take any more punches ! They aren 't hitting you . Duck ... feint ... clinch ! Stop fighting ! I can 't ! They 'll destroy me ! That 's a risk you 'll have to take . You take the damn risk ! They want you . Why ? Because you have the gene . The crazy gene . Yes , the crazy gene . The aliens are trying to speak to you , and the only thing keeping you from understanding them is your own fear- - your fear of losing control , your fear of the unknown ... The unknown and I don 't want to know . But we have to know or we 're all going to die . Allow yourself to hear them for just a few moments . Do it for us . What will happen to me ... when they 're done ? You 'll be on Voyager ... surrounded by friends . I can 't understand them . You will . They 're talking too fast , too many words . Try to focus on one word at a time . Too many words . - Don 't stop . - l 'm scared . - Let them in . - l don 't want to die ! They won 't hurt you ! No one will hurt you ! 18th gradient , trimetric fracture . Keep going . We have to modify our deflector . We have to induce a paralateral rentrillic trajectory . How do we do that ? I think I understand . It 's making sense . Where are you going ? I can make the adjustments myself . I have to get to the Bridge . I don 't know how much longer I can keep it in my mind ! - Commander . - What happened ? He 's got a right uppercut that almost knocked me out . Move over , Harry . Hang on , Ensign . They showed me how to get out of here . He 's hallucinating . Out of the way ! Tell us what to do . I can 't ! It 's too difficult to explain . I 'm locking him out . No . Give up your post . He 's recalibrating the deflector dish and routing it through the sensor array . It must be altered . Captain , the graviton shear is increasing . I 'm reading microfractures on the hull . Stay and we 'll be destroyed . Activate the deflector- - maximum amplitude . Bring sensors on line . Captain ... Do it . I don 't know how , but the sensors have found us a course . Maximum impulse ... now ! Captain , if that course is wrong , we could breech our hull . Engage . We 've reentered normal space . Mr. Paris , resume a course to the Alpha Quadrant . Aye , sir . When I said you should take the next day or two off , I thought you 'd want to stay in your quarters with a good book . Boxing helps me unwind . Well , in that case , report for duty first thing in the morning . See you then . Computer , run Chakotay Training Program 15-Beta . Ah , come for a little more punishment ? Thought I 'd spar for a few rounds . Uh-huh , after that last bout ? Did you talk to the Doc ? I 've got a clean bill of health . That 's good enough for me . Okay . I 've been watching him fight . He falls in too much when he clinches and he moves more to his right than he does to his left . Well , I 'll double up on the left jabs and see what happens . You sure you 're ready for this ? I 'm ready . Okay . Begin Round One .

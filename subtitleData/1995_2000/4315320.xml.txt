 Easy ! Steady up ! Hold on , mates ! He 's almost up ! That 's it ! Give it a big pull ! That 's it ! Don 't drop him now ! Put your backs into it ! Come on ! - [ Coughing ] - There he goes .

You an airman , mate ? - He 's not dressed like an airman . - What kind of uniform is that , then ? - [ Groans ] - Sprechen sie Deutsche ? Jah ? I say he 's a rat and we throw him overboard like a rat . Let 's give him the heave-ho ! [ Sailors Talking , Laughing ] [ Mulder ] Hey . How 's about another dip in the Atlantic , huh ? DirtyJerry . Even the sharks won 't eat him . What you got to say for yourself , Jerry , before we throw you back in ? My name 's notJerry . What 's that ? My name 's Mulder . Fox Mulder . That a name ? Mulder ? I got I.D. in my pocket . " " Fox Mulder , Federal Bureau of Investigation . " " - Sorry , mate . Never heard of it . - Never heard of it ? Ever tell you what we do with foxes ? Care to know ? You 've never heard of the F.B.I. ? Why don 't you shut up , Jerry , before we change our minds here . - Where are you taking me ? - Where 'd you pick up that accent ? Probably in the Fuhrer 's secret service . - Come on . - What are you talking about ? I say we cut him open and see what color he bleeds . DirtyJerry . Deutschland uber alles .

I think the mistake is mine . Speak the truth , man . - This is the Queen Anne , isn 't it ? - Aye . That 's about enough of that . I came looking for this ship . Say the word , Captain . I 'll make him the first of the rest . - I think I can explain what 's going on . - It 's a ruse , Captain . What 's our current position ? Cut the spy up . I 'll tell you . We 're two degrees above the 30th Parallel . Sargasso Sea , just above the Tropic of Cancer . 64 degrees west by southwest off the Plantagenet bank , 60 miles south-southwest off Bermuda . How would I know that if I 'd been in the water ? That 's a damn good question , lad . I 'm waiting for a damn good answer . Tell me I 'm wrong . Tell me that you haven 't been able to get accurate compass readings , that navigation 's been a real bitch . It 's because you 've been caught in the Devil 's Triangle . I can show you . It goes from Bermuda ... down to Puerto Rico , back up to Florida . The Queen Anne is stuck here on the eastern edge of it . You 've been caught in a time warp , some kind of limbo dimension ... and now you 've popped out the other side into 1 998 . - 1 998 ? - This man is mad . Let him tell it to the fishes . I 'm done fooling ' about , man . There 's a war on . And in it or no , I don 't plan to lose me mind nor me ship ... to the likes of a jackal like you . Relax . There 's no war . The world is at peace . There 's a little trouble over at our White House , but that 'll blow over . So to speak . Peace ? It 's September 3 , 1 939 , man . Hitler 's entered Poland ... and we 've just been boarded by a bunch of his goose-stepping hooligans . So don 't speak to me of peace , man . Tell Mother England . No , it 's not September 3 . It 's November 1 6 . Look . - [ Knocks On Door ] Excuse me , Captain . - Aye . Sir , the Germans , sir , they 've taken control of the bridge . They 're steering a course for their homeland . Not on the watch of Captain Yip Harburg , they 're not . Lock the prisoner up in here . It 's okay . The war 's over . Let ' em take you to Germany . They make nice cars . This is unbelievable . [ Static ] Mayday . Mayday . This is Special Agent Fox Mulder with the F.B.I. I 'm on the S.S. Queen Anne . [ Static Continues ] Ship in distress . Mayday , mayday . [ Announcer ] The British ambassador in Berlin ... handed the German government a final note ... stating that unless we heard from them ... that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland , a state of war would exist between us . No such undertaking has been received . Consequently , as of today , September 3 , 1 939 , this country is at war with Germany .

Jeepers creepers Where 'd you get those peepers Excuse me . Scully ! Get your Nazi paws off me before you get one in the kisser . - No , it 's me , Mulder . - Oh , you speak English , do you ? Well , how 'd you like to see the stars in the American flag ? - I 'm not a Nazi . - Sure . You just look like one , right ? I had to steal this uniform .

What are you guys doing here ? - Mulder 's in trouble . - Big trouble . - What do you mean ? - Let 's take a walk . Okay . Where are we going ? The walls have ears . I have ears . Tell me what 's going on . - Mulder 's disappeared . - From where ? From the National Reconnaissance Office 's ... Lacrosse mid-latitude imaging radar satellite . - What am I looking at ? - A whole lot of nothin ' . We pulled that down 45 minutes ago off the N.R.O. satellite , which early this morning sent a picture of a ship ... which inexplicably appeared in the middle of the Atlantic . The S.S. Queen Anne , which vanished without a trace over 60 years ago . - The British luxury liner . - That 's correct . - It was torpedoed by a German U-boat . - That 's one story . There 's another ? Though her exact position was kept a secret ... for fear spies might give her up to the Axis , it 's been determined that the Queen Anne ... was just south of the Plantagenet bank when she went missing . Less than 60 feet of water , yet she 's never been found . - The Queen Anne just disappeared ? - Into the Bermuda Triangle . - And reappeared this morning at 6 : 49 . - That 's impossible . - The satellite doesn 't lie . - There 's nothing on here . We gave the original images to Mulder so he could use them as navigational aids . - He was in a hurry . - To get where ? Out to the Queen Anne before anyone else got there first . - He 's gone out here ? - He chartered a powerboat . We tracked him on the satellite for an hour and a half . Until a storm blew in and obscured all transmissions . - That 's what you 're holding . - What 's happened to him ? We can 't know that , not without alternative tracking data . Which is why we 're here . - All we can do is hope for the best . - But expect the worst . Well , we have to get help . - He 's a needle in a haystack . - What do you need ? [ Sighs ] Navy AWACS S.L.A.R or S.A.R. 1 00K swath imaging . You 're gonna have to find somebody at the Pentagon to get it . Wait for me downstairs . I need to speak with him . - Could you take a seat- - - Is he in ? - Yes , he 's on his phone . - This can 't wait . Sir ? Hold on a minute . What is it , Agent Scully ? I just received some very disturbing information , sir . I need your help . I 'll call you back in five . You can 't come rushing in here . Sir , I couldn 't waste time explaining myself to your assistant . - Tell me what is so urgent . - Agent Mulder 's done something rash . - I can 't . - He may be lost at sea . - I can 't , Agent Scully . - You can 't what ? - I can 't help you . - This isn 't for me . It 's for Mulder . My hands are tied . I 'm not your direct superior any longer . - Don 't you want to know about this ? - No , I don 't . - I don 't even want to hear it . - Sir , this is about a man 's life . I 'm not allowed to have any contact with either you or Mulder . She walked right past me , sir . You 're out of line , Scully . No , sir , you 're out of line . I 'm sorry , but I 'm coming to you for help and I 've got nowhere else to go . I would hope that after everything we have been through ... you 'd at least have the courtesy , the decency , not to mention the respect ... to listen to what I have to say . All I need is information . You don 't have to do anything else . Look , sir , if you know anybody at the Office of Naval Intelligence , it would be of great help . I could lose my job , my pension . I could even be subject to legal action . [ Sighs ] Use your head , Scully . It 'll save your ass . Save your own ass , sir . You 'll save your head along with it . [ Sighs ] Ouch . Sorry . Yes , sir , I 'll get those files and buzz you when I have him on the line . - I need a word with A.D. Kersh . - I 'm sorry . He 's not available . Uh , Assistant Director Kersh , may I please have a moment of your time ? A moment for what ? May I , sir ? Thank you . Sir , I need you to get me some information . I am not at liberty to say why , but I can tell you it is of the utmost importance . Yes ? I , uh- - Sorry . I-I shouldn 't have come unannounced . May I see what you were going to show me , Agent Scully ? Uh , it wa- - It 's nothing , really . Good . [ Sighs ] What am I thinking ? What am I thinking ? [ Beeps , Dialing ] Sorry . [ Line Ringing ] Come on , come on , come on , come on , come on . Answer , Mulder . - Answer the phone , answer the phone . - [ Ringing Continues ] Come on , Mulder . [ Phone ] The cellular customer you are trying to reach is not responding . Damn . I want you to do me a favor . It 's not negotiable . Either you do it or I kill you . You understand ? - You okay , Agent Scully ? - No , I 'm not . I 'm a gun ready to go off , so don 't even think about trying to weasel me . What is it that you need ? Navy AWACS ... S.L.A.R. 1 00K swath south-southeast of Bermuda . I am looking for a boat , maybe a ship . 1 939 luxury liner . - 1 939 ? - Don 't ask too many questions . I don 't care what you do or who you do or who you have to grease . I need that information and I need it now . Are we clear on that ? Crystal . And Agent Spender , if you 're not back in a hurry , - I 'll hunt you down and so help me- - - Right . [ Sighs ] God . [ Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] - Hello . - [ Cigarette-Smoking Man ] Agent Fowley ? - Yes . - I was looking for Agent Spender . He 's not here right now . Is there something I can help you with ? Agent Scully just handed the assistant director a piece of paper ... with an intelligence system scribbled on it- - Yes ? - Yes , sir ? - Who is this ? [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Gasps ] - Agent Scully . - I was just- - - I was sent to come get you . I was waiting for Agent Spender . I 'm supposed to pick up a delivery from him . Agent Spender is with Assistant Director Kersh . That rat bastard . Stupid- [ Phone Rings ] - Scully ! [ Static ] ... Scully ... Mulder , is that you ? [ Static Continues , V oice Breaking Up ] No , I can 't- - I 'm on an elevator . Hold on , I 'll be off in a s- - Hold on . [ Static Continues , Voice Breaking Up ] - Hello ? - ... Scully ... No- - I can 't understand ! I can 't- - - Was that you ? - Is that you ? I 've been trying to reach you . I got the information you needed . How ? Don 't even ask . Sir , what you 've done- - Is save Mulder 's ass . I know . And if you ever ask me to break policy or protocol , I will have you tossed out of the F.B.I. for good . - Am I understood , Agent Scully ? - Yes . Yes ! [ Sighs ] [ Tires Screech ] [ Byers ] Did you get it ? Yeah . [ Tires Screeching ] Oi , American , right ? Saved your life , mate . Krauts don 't want no reason to bring you Yanks into the war . - I got two words for you- - Pearl Harbor . - What ? After Poland , Hitler 's on his way to Denmark , Holland and France ... with a few stops in between . The French all but roll over on us , the Italians seize their opportunity , and thejapanese come through the back door . It 's a long , bloody story . Fortunately , it has a happy ending . - We win . - With no small amount of help from us . Not much to apologize over the next 50 years , except for the Spice Girls . [ Shouting In German ] Well , according to our host , this 'll be our new accommodations , lads . You speak German . What was that shouting about up there ? They got it in mind that we left America carrying arms to England . Are we ? Listen , she 's drawing 1 6 feet at 81 , 000 tons . We 're making 21 knots at full power . If we got munitions aboard this ship , they don 't weigh but a few stone . The captain knew something . He wouldn 't give up the wheel . The Nazis boarded us after they intercepted a radio communication . Some kind of code word they keep asking about- - Thor 's Hammer . You know what that is , mate ? Who goes there ? I said , who goes there ? Show your face , or we 'll bloody beat them to a stub . Put your irons down , boys . It 's your own crew , for God 's sake . - What are you doin ' down here ? - Havin ' a cup of tea . What 's it look like , you stupid swabbo ? Then who 's steering ' the boat ? Just some blokes who answer to the name of " " Heil Hitler . " " Ever been to Germany ? They 'll have a special affection for the likes of you . Hey , this ship can 't go to Germany ! Make up your mind , mate . It can 't . You 're not carrying munitions . It 's something far more deadly . - Thor 's Hammer . - Thor 's Hammer is a man , not a weapon . A man who will help build a bomb that 'll win the war for whoever has it . - You 're saying he 's aboard this ship ? - I saw him . In the ballroom . [ Guard Speaking German ] [ Speaking German ] Auf weidersehen , mates . What 's wrong with you ? Don 't you know there are spies everywhere ? Trust no one , man ! We 've got to stop this ship ! Now ! - All right , lads , let 's go ! - [ Sailors Shouting ] Hey , you , who 's in charge of this engine room ? [ Shouting Continues ] Hey , I 'm talking to you . Shut her down , man . We 've got to scuttle her now ! Put some piss in her , boys . You heard him ! Kill the engines ! There 's no other way , swabbo ! You can 't get to Germany if you can 't steer . Me overriding her . We steering a course for home . Have you looked at your compass ? You can 't get to England going the wrong bloody direction . We 're not going to England . We 're going toJamaica . Steer her home , you bloody ruffo , to her home where she belongs . Listen to me ! You can 't take this ship to England ! - You 'll never make it ! - What are you talking about ? There 's only one place she 's going , Yank . - Jamaica ! - [ Cheering , Shouting ] You can 't take the ship toJamaica either . The Germans will hunt you down no matter what course you steer . - No ! No ! - Hear it out ! Hear it out ! And who you be , boy ? - My name 's Mulder . - He wants to go back to bloody America . No , I don 't . I want you to turn this ship around the way you came . - [ All Shouting ] No ! No ! - Bloody hell ! We 're halfway home ! You 've got to turn the ship around ! - And what 's in that direction ? - The future . - What ? - Actually , the past . Oh , well , I 'm convinced . I can explain it to you . [ Soldier ] Du ! Der Amerikaner ! [ Continues In German ] Turn the ship around , or Hitler rises , Germany wins ... and your children will never know what freedom is ! [ Shouting In German ] [ Shouting In German ] Halt ! Halt ! [ Continues Shouting In German ] Achtung ! Aufstehen . Mach schnell . Get up ! [ Speaking German ] There 's a scientist on board who can make a bomb . Who is this man ? I don 't know . [ Continues Speaking German ] You will answer the question ... or we will begin killing passengers . Which one is the scientist ? I don 't know . [ Continues In German ] [ Passengers Gasp ] - [ Gunshot ] - [ Passengers Screaming ] [ Body Falls ] [ Continues In German ] How many lives are you willing to sacrifice ? None . Then you have the answer . [ Speaking German ] - [ Pistol Cocks ] - [ Passengers Gasp ] - [ Gunshot ] - [ Screaming ] [ Scully ] Stop ! This man has no answers . You 're killing innocent people to learn that he knows nothing ! Shut up . Shut up and move away . Listen to me , you little weasel- - [ Speaking German ] [ Passengers Gasping , Murmuring ] [ Continues In German ] Answer the question . I 'll answer the question . [ Cigarette - Smoking Man Continues Speaking German ] That man is the scientist . [ Frohike ] Hey , Scully . You 're not gonna believe this . Get up here . What ? The sky just cleared , and there it was . Is it the Queen Anne ? [ Byers ] That 's her . I don 't believe it . Seeing is believing . They 've got power . [ Byers ] Maybe Mulder 's already on board . Let 's hope he is . You 're lying . - He 's telling the truth . - Shut up ! - Who is the scientist ? - I told you , this man is the scientist . [ German ] - [ Speaks German ] - What is the man 's name ? John Brown . Ask me again , and I 'll knock you down . - What 's his name ? - Puddintame ! Ask me again , I 'll tell you the same . Wait . Don 't shoot . I 'm the scientist . - This man 's a liar . - [ Man Shouts In German ] - I 'm the scientist . - Please . Tell them the truth before someone else has to die . - I don 't know this man . - Don 't listen to her . She 's traveling with me to protect me . She works for the O.S.S. - [ Speaks German ] - [ Soldiers Shouting In German ] [ Continues Speaking German ] [ Whispers ] That 's great . I don 't see you did any better . [ Continues Speaking German ] - What 'd he say ? - [ Soldiers Continue Shouting ] - I think I know what he said . - You learn fast . [ Soldier Shouting In German ] [ Engines Winding Down ] - What 's happening ? - The engines shut down . [ Shouting , Screaming ] - Hey ! - Hey what ? - Come with me . - Why should I ? 'Cause you 're the only one who can save this ship . Come on . [ Soldier Shouting In German ] [ Continues Speaking German ] Now what , Einstein ? [ Shouts In German ] [ Gunshot ] [ Body Falls ] God bless America . Now get your asses out of here . [ Scully ] Byers ? - [ Soldiers Shouting In German ] - Langly ? Frohike ? Come on . Come on . There you guys are . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? - Telling you how to save this ship . - Out here ? I can 't stay . I gotta get back to history . - What ? - You gotta rescue it . Listen to me . The ship 's caught in something called the Devil 's Triangle- - a time warp , a rift in space . - Are you crazy ? - You know Einstein , right ? He predicts the theoretical possibility . He also predicts an atomic weapon that will destroy the world . Yeah ? So what ? If you don 't convince the crew ... to turn this ship around and head back into the Devil 's Triangle , everything Einstein predicted will become true ... except for the outcome of history . So if I don 't turn this ship around- - In all likelihood , I won 't exist . And neither will you . [ Sighs ] Okay . So , in case we never meet again- - [ Gasps ] I was expecting a left . Hey ! [ Splash ] [ Voices Overlapping ] [ Scully ] Mulder ? [ Monitor Beeping ] Mulder , it 's me . - Where am I ? - You 're in a hospital . - Oh ... - Lie still . I feel ... like hell . I don 't blame you . You 've been through the wringer , I 'd say . What happened to me ? You did something incredibly stupid . What did I do ? You went looking for a ship , Mulder , in the Bermuda Triangle . - Say that again ? - [ Frohike ] Gilligan awakes . You were there . You were there , Scully . - He 's delirious . - And he was there too . Right , me and my dog Toto . You were there with the Nazis . Mulder , settle down . It 's an order . - Not that he takes orders . - Yeah . - You saved the world , Scully . - Yeah . You 're right . I did . - What kind of drugs is he on ? - I want some . No , no , the Queen Anne . I found it . You were there with Thor 's Hammer . I told you you had to turn the ship around , then I jumped overboard . I bet you did . The boat you were on was busted into a million pieces . And as for the Queen Anne , it was nothing more than a ghost ship . No , no , no , you and I were on that ship , Scully , in 1 939 . Get some rest , Mulder , 'cause when you get out of here , I 'm gonna kick your butt but good . Come on . Let 's go . I would 've never seen you again . But you believed me . In your dreams . Mulder , I want you to close your eyes ... and I want you to think to yourself , " " There 's no place like home . " " [ Chuckles ] Hey , Scully . Yes ? I love you . Oh , brother .

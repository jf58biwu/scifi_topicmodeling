 All right , all right , hold on . If you were married in 2304 , and your daughter was conceived during your 11th Pon farr , that would make you ... 162 years old . Incorrect . Come on , Tom . The man 's not a day over 140 . We know you were at least a hundred when you joined Starfleet the second time , so I 'm guessing you 're around 133 ? Also incorrect . I 'm afraid you both lack sufficient data to reach a logical conclusion . Come on , Tuvok , tell us . I see no reason to enlighten you . Don 't tell me Vulcans are embarrassed about their age . On the contrary , we value the wisdom that comes with advancing years . In that case , how wise are you ? Wise enough to end this inquiry . Saved by the bell . I 've got a fleet of ships 200,000 kilometers dead ahead . Can you identify them ? Negative . I 'm reading multiple hull configurations . Raise shields . Red Alert . Report . We 've detected a large group of vessels directly ahead . - Hostile ? - Possibly . I 'm charging weapons . On screen . I 'm counting 62 ships and a few hundred pieces of ships all dead in space . It 's a junkyard . Congratulations , Tuvok . You just saved us from a flotilla of hostile trash . We 're being hailed . Let 's see what they want . Welcome to Abaddon 's Repository of Lost Treasures . Whether you 're in the mood to buy or simply browse , we 're always open . Take a look . You may find something you never knew you wanted . Mr. Abaddon . The name was passed down from my father and his father before him . Not a very imaginative lot , but I 'll answer to it just the same . I 'm Commander Chakotay . This is Mr. Neelix . Welcome to Voyager . Neelix , is it ? You wouldn 't be a fellow trader , would you ? What makes you say that ? Cheerful demeanor , furtive eyes . It 's obvious you 're a man of commerce . You 're very perceptive , Mr. Abaddon . A useful skill in my line of work . Oh , I 'll admit there was a time when I dabbled in commerce , but these days , I focus my efforts on food and diplomacy . Well , whether you 're interested in a new iso-convective oven or a slightly dated translation matrix , you 've come to the right place . My inventory , give or take a few items . After 20 years , it 's hard to keep up . Looks like you have an item or two we might be interested in . Uh , the question is what are you looking for in return ? Artificial gravity plating . Plasma-based power induction . Impressive . Those are integrated systems . Unfortunately , we couldn 't trade them to you without dismantling our whole ship . Commander , don 't we have some spare duranium sheeting in Cargo Bay 1 ? With a few modifications , uh , it could be converted into gravity plating . Good idea . Why don 't you show Mr. Abaddon our inventory ? Report back when you 're done . Yes , sir . Mr. Abaddon , follow me , please . This guy 's collected more technology than the Borg . And almost all of it is useless . Wait . What 's that ? Ensign ? Grid 49-Alpha . Oh , she 's beautiful . It 's just an old rust bucket . What , are you kidding ? Look at those lines . It 's a work of art . That ship wasn 't assembled ; it was sculpted . I think I 'm in love . That makes 15 power regulators in fair condition and three more we could salvage with a little work . Seven has some doubts about the ion exchange rods ... We 'll take a chance . Add them to the list . What about these cultural artifacts ? Oh , just a few items I thought might have some historical value . They don 't cost much . Looks like a good haul . If that 's it ... Oh , uh , yes , there is one other item : uh , a small vessel that could be an asset . We 've already got a full complement of shuttles , not to mention the Delta Flyer . What do we need with this derelict ship ? Chakotay , this ship is a diamond in the rough . Sure , it 's got some scrapes and scratches , but , here , take a look at these systems . It has a neurogenic interface that allows it to react directly to the pilot 's thoughts . That gives it the potential of being quicker and more maneuverable than anything we 've got , including the Delta Flyer . Add to that an optronic weapons array ... I get the picture . Are you sure you 're not just looking for a new toy ? No . Absolutely not . Even B 'Elanna thinks restoring this ship is worthwhile . Maybe , if we had the manpower to restore it . No , I 'll do all the work myself on my own time ... and if I need a hand , Harry 's offered to help . I have ? What will it cost us ? Abaddon 's agreed to give it to us for three used power cells and Tom 's interactive record collection . My jukebox . All right . One slightly used alien ship . Don 't make me regret this . You won 't . Remember , just one seat . Not much storage . She was designed for speed , not hauling . Understood . Make sure you go easy on the thrusters . She doesn 't like being manhandled . - Temperamental ? - Sensitive . She demands respect , like any fine piece of machinery . Sounds like you 're sorry to let her go . Well , in some ways , she 's like the daughter that I couldn 't marry off , but that doesn 't mean I 'd trade her to just anyone . I 've got a feeling you 're the kind of pilot that she needs , someone that 'll give her the proper care and attention . I 'm your man . Don 't worry , Mr. Abaddon . She 's in good hands . Well , this has been a very productive exchange . Oh , just one more thing ... Uh , let me guess . All trades are final . I still can 't get an active readout . Here 's the reason . Another damaged power cell . Come on , Alice , how ' bout it ? Give us a break . Alice ? Well , I 've got to call her something . How about the Lost Cause ? Alice Battisti was " the lost cause . " I knew her back at the Academy . She was smart , sexy ... but she wouldn 't give me the time of day . All right , Alice it is . Try it again . I 've got a pulse ! A little snug . As Seven would say , an efficient design . The main computer 's coming on line . There 's not much in it . Just a few schematics . Looks like somebody tried to wipe the database . Probably rolled the odometer back , too . Let 's see what this neurogenic interface can do . Whoa . What 's it like ? It 's kind of hard to describe . I 'm tapped into all the primary systems : ops , tactical , sensors ... What happened ? We just blew out two more power cells . See if you can reconfigure the power distribution grid . Look , we 're both tired . Why don 't we call it a night , come back fresh tomorrow ? Oh , come on , we can still get a couple more hours in . You can get a couple more hours in . I 'm going to bed . All right . You win . Good night , Alice . See you in the morning . Good night , Alice . See you in the morning . See you in the morning . See you in the morning . See you in the morning . See you in the morning . Tom ... B 'Elanna ? Tom ? Who are you ? It 's me , Alice . Good morning , Alice . I 'm sorry , but you 're going to have to trust me on this . You 'll be a lot happier if we can bypass the EPS relays . - Tom . - Yeah ? Who are you talking to ? Alice . She 's being very stubborn today . No matter what I do , I can 't get her to bring her propulsion systems on line . Next question : What are you wearing ? Oh , this is a flight suit design I found in Alice 's database , something her last pilot used to wear . For a minute , I thought you were changing Captain Proton 's look . Chapter 37 ? Oh , " The Web of Pain . " I completely forgot . Oh , no problem- - l 've got another hour on the holodeck . You know , now is not a great time . How ' bout tomorrow ? That 's what you said yesterday . Sorry , Harry . Alice needs me . So does Arachnia . Give the queen my regards . Okay ... Seven , can I get you something ? A refund . The star charts we obtained from Abaddon are inaccurate . Really ? The computations are based on obsolete data . It 's not the only item that didn 't live up to its advertising . Cultural artifacts ? According to Abaddon , they 're lost treasures of the Delta Quadrant . If you ask me , they 're worthless trinkets . Perhaps not . This crystal is beryllium . Valuable ? Beryllium is the standard currency in Spatial Grid 539 . There are species that would trade an entire fleet of starships for this " trinket . " If Abaddon knew about this , he 'd never have traded it for a few plasma couplings . Well , maybe I should return it . Need I remind you ? All trades are final . Neelix , I need one bottle of champagne , if you don 't mind . Another anniversary ? No. I 'm christening Alice . Congratulations . I 'll whip up some hors d 'oeuvres for the crew . Oh , no , don 't bother . This is a private ceremony . Just me and B 'Elanna . And Alice , of course . Oh , yes , of course . There 's nothing like having your own ship . I remember when I first laid eyes on my little freighter , Baxial . No , don 't tell me- - love at first sight ? Actually , I thought she was the ugliest thing I ever saw . But she grew on me . Eventually , l-l couldn 't imagine being without her . You know , she 's still down in the Shuttle Bay . Why don 't we get her and Alice together and go on a double date ? You pack the picnic basket . I 'll bring the deuterium . So , I finally get to meet the other woman . Well , don 't be too critical . She 's a long way from finished . When have you ever known me to be critical ? is that a trick question ? Okay , ready ? Well ? It 's beautiful . I can hardly believe it 's the same ship . Yeah . Most of it isn 't . I 've replaced the impulse reactor , navigational array , uh , plasma manifolds ... The list goes on and on . Just a few more repairs , and she 'll be spaceworthy . Care to do the honors ? It 's almost a shame to break this over the hull . You have a point . Oh , oh , be careful- - the upholstery . I 'll send an Engineering team down to clean it up . - To Alice . - To Alice . So , when 's her first flight ? Well , a couple of days , if I can round up all the parts I need . You want to come with me ? Sure there 's room ? It 'll be a tight squeeze . We 'll manage . Hold on . Something wrong ? It 's these environmental controls . They need recalibrating . It is kind of warm in here , isn 't it ? Alice , lower the ambient temperature . Please specify , Tom . Five degrees should do it . Temperature modification complete . That 's some voice . It came with the ship . You jealous ? Maybe I should be . I hear you 've been sleeping here . When Alice lets me sleep . Sounds like a real slave driver . Well , if you 're trying to make improvements , you might want to start with these reactant injectors . The deuterium mix is too high . Well , that 's how Alice likes it . No , don 't touch that . I was just trying to help . Well , thanks , but we 're fine . " We " ? It 's a ship , Tom . Yeah , but she 's my ship . Well , then , maybe I 'll leave the two of you alone . Okay . I 'll see you later . Thanks for the champagne . Oh , sorry . I need to fix that . 30 meters of EPS conduit , a broadband sensor matrix , a tactical data module . Tom , I appreciate your enthusiasm , but I can 't spare these parts right now . But they 're just lying around Cargo Bay 2 . Those are emergency supplies , and this isn 't an emergency . Okay , what if I just replicated some ? That takes energy , which isn 't exactly in abundance at the moment . Maybe in a few weeks , if we can replenish our power reserve . A few weeks ? What am I supposed to do until then ? Your duties , which you 've been neglecting . You 've been late for two shifts in Sick Bay . You 've been distracted on the Bridge . Maybe it 's time you gave this project a rest . You 're right . I guess I have been overdoing it . You look run-down . Maybe you should stop by Sick Bay and have the Doctor take a look at you . No. I 'm fine . l-l just haven 't been getting enough sleep . Well , your next shift isn 't till 0700 . Why don 't you do yourself a favor and turn in early ? Yeah . Good idea . One more thing . I 'd appreciate it if you 'd shave and change back into your uniform . We do have protocols . Yes , sir . We 'll get your Alice flying . Just give it some time . Sorry , Alice , we 'll have to put the test flight on hold . All we need is a few lousy spare parts , but to listen to Chakotay , you 'd think Voyager would grind to a halt without them . But we 're so close . Well , he gave me a direct order . Since when do you care so much about orders ? I 'm already an Ensign . You want to see me busted down to Cadet ? Don 't take that off . Well , I 'm afraid I have to get back into uniform . Protocol . Forget about protocol . Once my repairs are complete , we can go somewhere together . Leave Voyager ? It 's been a long time since I met a pilot I 've been compatible with . We can go anywhere you want . It 's very tempting , Alice , but I can 't just take off . What 's holding you back ? My job , for one thing . My friends ... B 'Elanna . She doesn 't understand you the way I do . None of them do . Look , maybe we can make the test flight in a few weeks , and if it goes well , I 'm sure the Captain will assign us on missions together , but I can 't leave Voyager . All right . I 'm sure you know what 's best for us . Yeah , I think I do . You look a little tired . How about some rest ? Sit back . Relax . Let me help you with this . What are these ? Just some modifications I made to your flight suit . They 'll help us work together more closely . I 'll show you . Activate the interface . Just for a minute . You won 't regret it . What do you say we continue with those repairs ? How 's it coming ? This is the last power cell . Then we 'll just need the data module from Section Beta-12 . What 's wrong ? Well , these relays are just tricky . That 's all . You 're not being honest with me . I thought we agreed to tell each other everything . Well , it 's just ... we 're compromising vital systems . Backup systems . If there 's an emergency , Voyager 's going to need them . If your friends had been more understanding , we wouldn 't have to be sneaking around like this . I 've spent the last six years with these people . They 're like my family . Sometimes you have to leave your family behind . They 're not like us . They 're trapped by rules and regulations . Velocity , freedom ... they 'll never understand these things the way we do . Yeah , maybe you 're right . Of course I am . You don 't belong here . You belong with me . You 're thinking about your first flight , aren 't you ? Tell me . Dad took me up in an old S-class shuttle . Two seats , no warp drive , manual helm controls . I was eight years old and I was scared out of my wits . You couldn 't keep the ship level . No , not at first ... but then ... came this moment of clarity , when suddenly , everything made sense . The clouds parted . I was flying . No matter how many starships I 've piloted since then , I 'm still chasing that feeling . Tomorrow , you 'll catch it ... only this time , there won 't be any clumsy controls to get in the way . Just you ... me ... and the stars . Hey . I wasn 't aware you were assigned to Astrometrics . I was just , uh , passing by . I guess curiosity got the best of me . Are you planning an away mission ? You were charting a course . Oh , that . Uh , no , I was just taking a peek at what 's ahead of us . All yours . You 've modified your garment . Uh , adapted , actually . I made a few tweaks to enhance Alice 's neurogenic interface . You know , the " merging of man and machine " ? Perhaps you should learn more about this interface before you attempt to use it . Convince her it 's safe . I ran diagnostics of every system onboard that ship . There 's nothing to worry about . Perhaps I should examine it . Make an excuse and leave . It 's nice of you to offer , but it 's really not necessary . I have to get back to work . Power fluctuation 's down to 4.7 percent . Looks like Abaddon 's regulators might work out after all . Keep at it- - the last thing we need is a temperamental power supply . Bad day at the office ? Bad night with Tom Paris . You 're his best friend , right ? So he tells me . So , maybe you can explain why every time he finds a new hobby , I go right out the airlock . I wouldn 't take it personally . The Ferengi call it the Five Stages of Acquisition : Infatuation , Justification , Appropriation , Obsession and Resale . Seems like you 've only got one stage left before he loses interest in that ship . Then he 's all yours again . Until the next infatuation . We 've got a .003 drop in the warp field output . That 's within parameters . Not on my watch . Somebody 's removed four power cells from the secondary warp assembly without authorization . Whoever it was tried to cover his tracks by rerouting power from adjacent cells . Should we tell Tuvok ? Don 't bother . This is an open-and-shut case . Tom Paris ! Well , Alice ... looks like you 've been borrowing my things without permission . Hey ! Computer , open the hatch . Unable to comply . Warning . Life support failure . Torres to the Bridge . Torres to Chakotay ! Anybody ! B 'Elanna , what are you doing here ? Let me out of here ! What the hell happened in there ? Your ship tried to kill me . That 's ridiculous . It sealed the ... the hatch , vented the atmosphere . You must have accidentally tripped the environmental controls . Don 't you try to tell me this was an accident . What else could it have been ? How about " pilot error " ? Are you saying that this was my fault ? What 's gotten into you ? You 've been stealing components , Tom . Oh ... I found the power cells . A few spare parts ? You 're overreacting . Am I ? Where are you going ? - To talk to the Captain . - Wait . There 's something wrong with you . - Listen to me ! - Are you out of your mind ? Stay out of this , B 'Elanna ! Or what ? You 'll sic Alice on me again ? Let her go . What were you thinking ? ! You could 've killed her ! She broke into my database . She was going to discover our flight plan . Not that it matters now . What is that supposed to mean ? Keep your voice down . Once your girlfriend talks to the Captain , they 'll drag you straight to Sick Bay . One neural scan , and they 'll know all about us . Well , maybe it 's time they did . Think you can just walk away ? Watch me . So , I guess this is the real Tom Paris . Life throws up a few roadblocks , and he heads for the nearest exit . Get away from me ! I need you . You should 've thought of that before you tried to kill B 'Elanna . Sick Bay . Remember how you felt when you first saw me ? You knew we were meant to be together . - l was wrong . - Think of how it feels when you 're sitting at the helm - and the interface is active . - lt 's over , Alice ! One way or the other , I 'm getting the hell away from you . I 'm sorry you feel that way . What are you doing to me ? ! Convincing you to do the right thing . Take us to the Shuttle Bay . We 're leaving Voyager . No ! Please , Tom . I don 't want to hurt you . The Shuttle Bay , now . Deck 10 . Shuttle Bay . This isn 't the first time you and Tom have had an argument about how he spends his free time . This wasn 't a lovers ' quarrel . Captain , he practically assaulted me . Well , that doesn 't sound like Tom . It wasn 't Tom . It was Alice . Now you 've lost me . That 's the name that he 's calling this new ship . Ever since he started working on it , he hasn 't slept . He 's become irritable , irrational ... lt 's not just me ; Chakotay and Harry have noticed the same thing . This new ship- - it has some kind of neurogenic interface . Exactly. lt must be having some kind of an effect on him . All right , I 'll have the Doctor take a look at him , but in the meantime , I want you ... Captain , we have an unauthorized launch in progress . Seal the Shuttle Bay doors . Too late . He 's out . His shields are up . I can 't get a transporter lock . Tractor beam . They 're trying to tractor us . - Stop them . - l can 't . You 'll be able to maneuver much better if you complete the interface . How ? Activate the connector sequence . We 're one now , Tom . Think of what you want me to do , and I 'll do it . We can disrupt their tractor beam ... with an optronic pulse . Good . You have access to our weapons . Use them . He 's charging weapons . Full power to the shields . He 's disrupting our tractor beam . lncrease power to the emitters . We 'll drag him in by his heels if we have to . He 's broken free , Captain . Janeway to Paris . Stand down and return to Voyager immediately . I 'm with Alice now , Captain . Let us go . You know I can 't do that , Tom . She 'll do anything to get you back . I don 't blame her for that , but we have to stop her . How ? You know . He 's coming about . He 's charging weapons again . Direct hit . Return fire . He 's gone to warp . Track him . He masked his warp signature . He 's gone . " And Daedalus fashioned wings from wax and feathers and used them to escape his prison . " That 's one of my favorite myths . I know . But you left out the part where Icarus flew too close to the sun and his wings melted . Poetic license . Besides , if we get too close to a star , we have multiphasic shielding to protect us . What is it ? My arms . They feel numb . Who needs arms when you have wings ? You 're becoming a part of me now . Our potential is unlimited . Forget the old Tom Paris . He doesn 't exist anymore . You know my policy . We 're not looking for a refund- - just some information . That 's one commodity i don 't keep in stock . I suggest you look elsewhere . Not until we get some answers . You 'll find I 'm prepared to deal with disgruntled customers . Captain , I 'm reading active weapons signatures on three of the derelict ships . They are targeting Voyager . Before we take actions we both might regret , Mr. Neelix has something to show you . I wanted to say , uh ... thank you for this ... lost treasure . A beryllium crystal . I 'm surprised a trader of your distinction would let this slip through this fingers . I could say all trades are final , but we 'd be willing to give it back in exchange for some cooperation . Haunted ? That 's what the Haakonian told me when he traded her . I blamed his wild stories on isolation sickness and then took the ship off his hands . Did you ever notice anything odd about the ship ? Odd ? You could say that . I tried turning her into a towing vessel . She was cooperative at first , but then she began to require constant ... I hope you haven 't forgotten me . Mr. Abaddon ? Wh-where was I ? Constant repairs . Right . Please ... I wasn 't going to tell them anything . Who are you speaking to ? No one. l-l-l have to leave now . I 'll return the items you traded for the ship . Leave me alone . I did what you told me . I found you a pilot . What is it- - what are you seeing ? It 's her . She 's right in front of me . There 's no one there . Transport me back now . Janeway to Sick Bay . Medical emergency . He suffered a cerebral hemorrhage . Fortunately , I was able to repair the damage in time . What caused it ? It appears his neural pathways were recently restructured . I detected a neurogenic signature . Looks like Alice got to him , too . Wake him . Oh . She was here . The woman you saw was an hallucination created by the derelict ship 's neurogenic interface . I 've given you a cortical suppressant . She won 't be bothering you anymore . Tell me , what does this ship want with our crewman ? She can 't fly herself . She needs a pilot- - a biological entity to work in tandem with her programming . Well , if all she needed was a pilot , why didn 't she just recruit you ? I wasn 't compatible . She ... said my reflexes were too slow , that I was as useless as the junk that I traded , that I couldn 't get her to where she needed to go . Don 't ask me for the coordinates . She never told me . Just insisted that I get her a real pilot . I 'm sorry I didn 't warn you before . I couldn 't resist her . Seven of Nine to Captain Janeway . Please report to Astrometrics . I 've managed to reconstruct the data Ensign Paris was working on . My suspicion was correct . It is a course trajectory . Let 's see it . It terminates in Spatial Grid 867 . Looks uninhabited . It 's empty space with the exception of a small anomaly . A particle fountain . The Federation lost more than a dozen ships examining a similar phenomenon in the Alpha Quadrant . Relay the coordinates to the Bridge . Take us out of warp . Can you see it now ? Yes . What is it ? Home . Distance ? Six million kilometers . Decrease speed to one-quarter impulse . Full power to shields . I 'm detecting a vessel off our starboard bow . It 's Tom . He 's headed right for the anomaly . Can you get a transporter lock ? No , ma 'am , not with those multiphasic shields in place . Are we in hailing range ? Opening a channel . He 's responding . Keep your distance , Captain , or we 'll open fire . Tom , listen to me . The neurogenic interface is affecting your judgment . Drop your shields and let us beam you aboard . Ignore them . Keep going . He 's not responding . Target his propulsion systems and fire . Direct hit . The vessel 's shields are holding . Doctor to the Bridge . Cease fire . Ensign Paris ' neural readings are fluctuating . His synaptic functions have become linked to the ship . If we keep firing , we could injure him severely . Acknowledged . Tuvok , stand down . We 've got ten minutes until he reaches the particle fountain . is there any way to disable their shields without firing weapons ? If I could access their main computer and transmit a shutdown sequence ... Problem is , Tom and Alice would detect it . They 'd compensate . Unless we find a way to distract them . Bridge to the Doctor . Go ahead . Any progress on your analysis of the neurogenic interface ? Not yet , Captain . Would it be possible to tap into the interface using a com signal ? I believe so , but I don 't know what that would accomplish . You 've got five minutes ; do it . And tell B 'Elanna to prepare for an away mission . Captain ? We 're four minutes away . Bridge to Sick Bay . - Status ? - Stand by , Captain . I 'm making the final adjustments . I 'm not sure how I feel about getting inside Tom 's head . Maybe you 'll be able to explain a few things when you get back . I knew you were the one . No one 's ever gotten me this close before . I 'll have you home in just a few minutes . I promise you won 't be disappointed . Don 't believe her . Where 's Alice ? There is no Alice . She 's a pile of circuits in this ship 's computer core . You 're letting a program delude you . Doctor to Bridge . She 's in . Now . Accessing their main computer . You don 't understand . This is what I 've always dreamed of . You 're still dreaming , and when you wake up , you 're in for a big surprise . Alice needs me . So do I . Nice sentiment , but it 's a lie . Your family will do anything to keep us apart . Don 't listen to them . Tom , it 's me , B 'Elanna . Alice is an illusion . I 'm giving you what you always wanted- - something they could never do . Does that sound like an illusion ? I can 't ... think . Leave me alone , both of you . They 've accessed our systems . They 're trying to disable my shields . Stop them . Focus on me . Listen to me . My shields are failing . Do something ! It 's time to come home . Tom . No ! Hang on . We 're going to get you out of here . Tom ! No ! I 've got it , Captain . Their shields are down . Beam him to Sick Bay . There 's too much interference from the particle fountain . I 'm boosting the confinement beam . Try it now . We 've got him ! Alice is losing helm control . Resume course to the Alpha Quadrant . You 'll need a few days to fully recover . Think you can manage to stay off your feet for that long ? If he doesn 't , I 'll break his legs . Well , then , I 'll leave you to B 'Elanna 's tender mercies . I 've got something for you . It 's a get well card from Naomi Wildman . It 's a pretty good likeness of you , but I don 't think she quite captured my eyes . I 'm sorry ... for everything . It wasn 't your fault . But I remember all of it ... everything I said , everything I did ... lt was like I was sleepwalking . The important thing is you woke up . Yeah . Thanks for being my alarm clock . Anytime . From now on ... I promise no more affairs with strange ships . What about the Delta Flyer ? We 're just friends .

 Stasis interrupted . Fire in cryogenic compartment . Repeat : fire in cryogenic compartment . All personnel report to emergency-escape vehicle launch pad . Deep-space flight will commence in T minus 20 seconds . An EEV 's come down . Get down to the beach . There may be others . Now ! Talk to me . All right , let 's get it going . Keep it together . Come on . Right ? Right . Here we go , Mr Dillon . Give us strength , O Lord , to endure . We recognize that we are poor sinners in the hands of an angry God . Let the circle be unbroken until the day . - Amen . - Amen . Thank you , gentlemen . This is Rumor Control . Here are the facts . As some of you know , a 337 model EEV crash-landed here at 0600 . There was one survivor , two dead , and a droid that was hopelessly smashed beyond repair . - The survivor is a woman . - Is she pretty ? I just want to say that I 've taken a vow of celibacy ... that also includes women . - We 've all taken the vow ! - Shut your gob , Morse . I do not appreciate company policy , allowing her to freely intermingle with inmates and the staff . Our brother means to say we view the presence of any outsider , especially a woman , as a violation of the harmony , a potential break in the spiritual unity . We are aware of your feelings in this matter . You will be pleased to know that I have requested a rescue team . Hopefully they will be here inside of a week and evacuate her ASAP . Don 't give us that ! - What 's her medical status ? - She doesn 't seem too badly damaged . She 's unconscious . Can 't give you a more specific diagnosis . - Will she live ? - I would think so . It 's in everybody 's interest she doesn 't come out of the infirmary until the rescue team arrives , and certainly not without an escort , right ? Sir . Gentlemen ! We should all stick to our set routine and not get unduly agitated . Correct ? All right . Thank you , gentlemen . All right . Better get here soon or there ain 't gonna be much left . What 's that ? Just a little cocktail of my own mix . Sort of an eye-opener . - You a doctor ? - My name is Clemens . - I 'm the Chief Medical Officer here . - Here ? Fury 161 . It 's one of Weyland-Yutani 's backwater work prisons , it grieves me to say . Do you mind ? This is basically a stabilizer . I really ought to shave your head . We have a big problem with lice here . When you feel better I 'll give you some clippers for your private parts . How did I get here ? You crash-landed in an EEV . Separated from your mother ship before you hit our atmosphere . Any idea how long you were in hypersleep ? Coming out the way you did can jolt your system . - I 'll be sick for a couple of weeks . - Indeed . - Where are the others ? - They didn 't make it . - What ? - They didn 't survive . I have to get to the ship . - You 're in no condition for that . - Wanna get me some clothes , or should I go like this ? Given the nature of our indigenous population , I would suggest clothes . None of them has seen a woman in years . Neither have I , for that matter . This used to be a 5,000-convict facility , but it 's been reduced to a custodial staff of 25 . - Why ? - To keep the pilot light on . Pilot light for what ? Blast furnace ! Natural methane . We have a foundry , Lt Ripley . The inmates forge lead sheets for toxic waste containment . How do you know my name ? It 's stenciled on the back of your shorts . Release the cable ! - Where are the bodies ? - We have a morgue . We put them there until the investigative team arrives - in about a week , I think . - There was a droid . - Disconnected . There were bits and pieces everywhere . We put what was left on the rubbish tip . The corporal was impaled by that safety support . Never knew what hit him . And the girl ? She drowned in her cryo-tube . I don 't think she was conscious ... when it happened . Sorry . - What 's the matter ? - Where is she ? In the morgue . I have to see her . I have to see what 's left of her . Is there any particular reason that you 're so insistent ? Yes . I have to be sure how she died . I hate to be repetitious about such a sensitive subject , but it is perfectly clear that she drowned . Was she your daughter ? No . She wasn 't . Could I have a moment alone , please ? Yes , of course . Forgive me . What 's she doing ? OK ? No . - We have to do an autopsy . - What ? I told you . We have to make sure how she died . And I told you she drowned . I 'm not so sure . I have to see inside of her . - You 're disorientated . - I have a very , very good reason . Perhaps you 'd like to share that reason ? Possible contagion . What kind , exactly ? Cholera . There hasn 't been a case of cholera reported for 200 years . Please ? Everything 's in place . There 's no sign of infection . No indication of disease . Her chest . Open her chest . Careful . Lungs ... flooded with fluid . Ergo , she drowned . Now , since I 'm not a complete idiot , would you like to tell me what we 're really looking for ? - Mr Clemens . - Superintendent . I don 't believe you 've met Lieutenant Ripley . - What 's going on , Mr Clemens ? - That 's right , sir . What 's going on ? First , the lieutenant is feeling much better , I 'm happy to say . Second , in the interest of public health , I am performing an autopsy . - Without my authority . - There didn 't seem to be time . But it 's turned out all right . There 's no sign of contagion . Good . But it might be helpful if Ripley didn 't parade around in front of the prisoners , as I am told she did in the last hour . It might also be helpful if you informed me of any change in her physical status . - Or would that be asking too much ? - We have to cremate the bodies . Nonsense . We 'll keep the bodies on ice till the rescue team arrives . On ice . There is the public-health issue . The lieutenant feels there is still the possibility of a communicable infection . - You said there was no sign of disease . - It would appear that the child drowned , but without proper laboratory tests it 's impossible to be certain . I would consider it unwise to tolerate even the possibility of an unwelcome virus . An outbreak of cholera would look extremely bad on a report , would it not , sir ? We 've 25 prisoners in this facility . All double-Y chromos . All thieves , rapists , murderers , child molesters ... All scum . Just because they 've taken on religion doesn 't make them any less dangerous . I try not to offend their convictions . I don 't want to upset the order . I don 't want ripples in the water . And I don 't want a woman walking around , giving them ideas . I see . For my own personal safety . Exactly . I will leave the details of the cremation to you , Mr Clemens . They may use the furnace , but I want everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours . Our Christmas has come early . - What do you mean ? - Any dead oxes are good . Smelly bastards all covered in lice . There 's only seven of the friggin ' things left , then we 're done with them . I hate hosing ' these bastards down . Always get shite all over me boots . - Talking of hosing things down , Frank ... - Yeah ? If you had the chance , what would you say to her ? - What do you mean ? - You know , if you got the chance . - You mean , casual , like ? - Yeah . How would you put it to her if you bumped into her in the mess hall ? No problem . I 've never had any problem with the ladies . I 'd say " Good day , my dear . How 's it going ? " " Anything I can do to be of service ? " Then I 'd give her the look , up and down . Then I 'd give her the wink . A dirty smile . - She 'd soon get the picture . - Yeah , right . Then she 'd say " Kiss my arse , you horny old bugger . " I 'd be happy to kiss her arse . I 'd be happy to kiss her anywhere she wants . Yeah , but treat ' em mean , keep ' em keen . Right , Frank ? Told you before , Murph . Treat a queen like a whore and a whore like a queen . You can 't go wrong . What do you think killed Babe ? Beats me . She just keeled over . - How old was she ? - Guards say 11 . In her prime . Never mind . We 'll chop her up later and throw her in the stew . Fine . Hey , Frank . What 's this ? We commit this child and this man to your keeping , O Lord . Their bodies have been taken from the shadow of our nights . They have been released from all darkness and pain . The child and the man have gone beyond our world . They are forever eternal and everlasting . Ashes to ashes , dust to dust . Why ? Why are the innocent punished ? Why the sacrifice ? Why the pain ? There aren 't any promises . Nothing 's certain . Only that some get called , some get saved . She won 't ever know the hardship and grief for those of us left behind . We commit these bodies to the void ... with a glad heart . For within each seed , there is a promise of a flower . And within each death , no matter how small , there 's always a new life . A new beginning . Amen . Amen . I tell ya , it 's fuckin ' weird . The only one that survived that crash is a woman . OK . There 's a lot of talk going around that we 've got some disharmony here . Any of you guys wanna tell me what the problem is ? Come on . Speak to me , brothers . All right , I 'll tell you . I don 't mind the dark . I don 't mind the bugs . I don 't mind wandering around in some cold , wet , damp tunnel for a week at a time . But I mind Golic . - That the way you feel about it ? - Yeah . The guy 's crazy and he smells bad . I ain 't going out with him any more . You got anything to say for yourself ? The boy 's going with you . Golic is just another poor , miserable , suffering son of a bitch , just like you and me . - He smells worse . - And he 's crazy . Knock off the shit ! You 've got a job to do . I don 't wanna hear another word about Golic . OK ? As I thought , Mr Aaron . - As I thought . - You called it , sir . I just wanted to ... say thanks for what you said at the funeral . - My friends would 've appreciated ... - You don 't wanna know me , lady . I 'm a murderer and rapist of women . Really ? I guess I must make you nervous . - Do you have any faith , sister ? - Not much . We 've got a lot of faith here . Enough even for you . - I thought women weren 't allowed . - Well , we 've never had any before . But we tolerate anybody . Even the intolerable . Thank you . That 's just a statement of principle , nothing personal . You see , we 've got a good place to wait here . And until now ... no temptation . What are you waiting for ? We 're waiting for God to return and raise his servants to redemption . Dillon and the rest of the alternative people embraced religion , as it were , about five years ago . Tincture ? - I 'm on medication . - Hardly . - What kind of religion ? - Some sort of apocalyptic , millenarian , Christian fundamentalist ... - Right . - Exactly . When the company wanted to close the facility down , Dillon and the rest of the converts wanted to stay . And they were allowed to remain as custodians , with two minders and a medical officer . And here we are . How did you get this wonderful assignment ? How do you like your new haircut ? It 's OK . Now that I 've gone out on a limb for you with Andrews , damaged my already less-than-perfect relationship with that good man , and briefed you on the humdrum history of Fury 161 , can you not tell me what you were looking for in the girl ? Are you attracted to me ? In what way ? In that way . You 're very direct . I 've been out here a long time . So have I. I really appreciate your affections . But I am aware that they deflected my question . In the nicest possible way , of course . You 're spoiling the mood . I have a job to do . I just want to know why we had to cremate the bodies . And now that I 'm in your cot , you think I owe you an answer . I think you owe me an answer . Being in my bed 's got nothing to do with it . I had a terrible dream in hypersleep , and I had to be sure what killed her . Anyway , I made a mistake . Possibly . And now I 've made another mistake . - Really ? What 's that ? - Fraternising with a prisoner . Physical contact . It 's against the rules , isn 't it ? Definitely . - When was this ? - I think you know . I 'm not a prisoner . You have a bar code on the back of your head . That does deserve an explanation . But I don 't think now is the moment . Sorry . We are rather spoiling things , aren 't we ? Mr Clemens . Mr Aaron . Superintendent Andrews would like you to report to vent shaft 22 . Now . - We 've had an accident . - Something serious ? You could call it that . One of our prisoners has been ... diced . Sorry . I have to go . Official duties . - Who was it ? - Murphy . - How do you know ? - That 's his boot . I gave him the assignment , sir . He was a wanker . No apologies , Mr Aaron . It wasn 't your fault . Well , not much to say , is there ? Death was instantaneous . No shit . I take it he was pulled into the fan . - Rush of air , I 'd imagine . Except ... - Right ! Almost happened to me once . I 've told them so many times : stay away from the fans . - Nobody bloody listens . - Except the fan was blowing . - What 's that ? - I don 't know . I want to see you in my quarters in 30 minutes , if you please , Mr Clemens . Here you are . Wandering around without an escort will really piss Superintendent Andrews off . - Tell me about your accident . - One of the prisoners has been killed . Really ? How ? In the air shaft . Poor sod backed into a nine-foot fan . I found something at the accident site . Just a bit away from where it happened . A mark . A burn . Rather like the one you found on the girl 's cryo-tube . Look , I 'm on your side . I want to help , but I need to know what 's going on . Or what you think is going on . If you really wanna help , find me a computer with audio capabilities so I can access this flight recorder . We don 't have anything like that here . - What about Bishop ? - Bishop ? The droid that crashed with me . I can point you in the right direction . I can 't join you . I have a previous engagement . This looks off . Golic , don 't fidget . What 's all this shit ? It 's not properly wrapped . - What the hell 's he ever do right ? - Eat . He does that pretty good . Golic . You light a candle for Murphy . I 'll light a thousand . He was special . Never complained about me once . I loved him . Is it true what they say ? His head split into 100 pieces ? OK , who 's got the matches ? - Sit down , Mr Clemens . - Thank you . - Sugar ? - No , thanks . - Milk ? - Just a little , please . Thank you , Mr Aaron . Listen to me , you piece of shit ! Screw with me one more time , I 'll cut you in half . I 'm sorry , I don 't think I understand . At 0700 hours I received word from the network . This is the first high-level communication this installation has ever received , to my knowledge . They want this woman looked after . They consider her to be high priority . - Why ? - I have no idea . Why did you let her out of the infirmary ? This accident with Murphy is what happens when one of these dumb sons of bitches gets a hard-on . I 'm a doctor , you 're the jailer . We both know exactly what you are . Sit down ! I think it might be better if I left . I find you unpleasant to be around . Isn 't that lovely ! Consider this , Mr Clemens . How would you like me to explain your sordid history to your new-found friend ? For her personal edification , of course . Now sit the hell down . I don 't like you . You 're unpredictable , insolent , possibly dangerous . You question everything . If I didn 't need a medical officer , I wouldn 't let you within light years of this operation . - I 'm eternally grateful . - Keep your sarcasms to yourself . Now , is there anything I should know ? - About what ? - About the woman . Don 't play with me . You spend every second you can with her . And I have my suspicions that not all of your concerns with her are medical . Has she said anything to you ? About where she 's from , what her mission is ? What she was doing in an EEV ? She said she was part of a combat unit that came to grief . Beyond that , I assume it 's all classified . I haven 't pressed her for more . - That 's all ? - That 's all . - You sure ? - Yes . - Nothing more ? - No . Get out of here . Shut up , you fuckin ' bitch ! Shut up , you bitch ! Let go of me ! Fuck you ! No ! Hold still ! No ! You OK ? Son of a bitch ! Take off . I gotta re-educate some of the brothers . We gotta discuss some matters of the spirit . Cigarettes ! Let 's do it . This is like ten city blocks . - How many ? - This makes 176 . Can 't you chew any quieter ? I 'm trying to figure how big this compartment is . - I can 't think with this goddamn noise ... - You 're not supposed to swear . I 'm sorry . Now , we 've encircled this entire compartment ... What ? - What the shit is doing that ? - Swearing ! Shut up ! It 's all right to say " shit " . It ain 't against God . What 's going on with the candles ? Must be the wind from one of the vent shafts . Backwash from the closest circulating unit . If all the candles go out , how do we know where we are ? Somebody will have to go back and relight them . I guess I 'm nominated . Watch your step , brother . OK , who are the comedians ? No ! Go ! Quick , in here ! Help me , help me ! Go ! Fuckin ' go ! Go on ! Go on ! Quick ! Give me that . Get this fuckin ' thing off me ! Let me go ! - Hello , Ripley . - Hello , Bishop . - How are you feeling ? - My legs hurt . - I 'm sorry . - That 's OK . I 'm just a glorified toaster . How are you ? I like your new haircut . - Can you access data on the flight recorder ? - No problem . Golic ? I 'm home . What happened on the Sulaco ? Why were our cryo - tubes ejected ? Stasis interrupted . Fire in cryogenic compartment . Repeat : fire in cryogenic ... What happened ? What started the fire , Bishop ? Can you hear me ? The fire was electrical . It was in the subflooring . Did the sensors pick up anything moving around prior to separation ? It 's very dark here . I 'm not what I used to be . Just tell me . Does the recorder indicate anything ? Was there an alien on board ? Yes . Is it on the Sulaco or did it come with us in the EEV ? It was with us all the way . Does the company know ? The company knows everything that happened on the ship . It all goes into the computer and gets sent back to network . And they want it ? I hurt . Do me a favor . Disconnect me . I could be reworked . But I 'll never be top-of-the-line again . I 'd rather be nothing . You sure ? Do it for me , Ripley . It wasn 't me ! I didn 't do it ! Help me . It was the dragon . Feeds on minds . Nobody can stop it . - What about Boggs and Rains ? - Slaughtered like pigs . It wasn 't me . It wasn 't me . Stark raving mad . It wasn 't anyone 's fault , but he should have been chained up . You called it , sir . Mad as a fuckin ' hatter . Keep him separated . Don 't want him causing a panic . - Clemens ! - Yeah . - Sedate this poor idiot . - Not until we know about the brothers . Now , pull yourself together . Talk to me now . - Where are Boggs and Rains ? - It wasn 't me . You 're not gonna get anything out of him . We 'll have to send out a search team . There 's a good chance this simple bastard has murdered them . You don 't know that . He 's never lied to me . He 's crazy , he 's a fool , but he 's not a liar . He 's telling the truth . I 'd like to talk to him about this dragon . - It 's a dragon ! - You 're not talking to anyone . I 'm not interested in your opinion , because you are not in full possession of the facts . He is a convicted murderer , known for particularly brutal crimes . - Isn 't that right , Mr Dillon ? - Yeah . That part 's right . Then I 'll talk to you . It 's important . When I have finished with my official duties , I 'll be pleased to have a little chat . Yes ? Let me see if I have this correct , Lieutenant . It 's an eight-foot creature with acid for blood , and it arrived on your spaceship . It kills on sight and is generally unpleasant . And you expect me to accept all this on your word . No . I don 't expect anything . - Quite a story , Mr Aaron . - Right , sir . It 's a beauty . - Never heard anything quite like it , sir . - Expect not . Tell me , Lieutenant , what would you suggest we do ? - What kind of weapons have you got ? - This is a prison . - We don 't allow prisoners access to firearms . - It keeps them from killing you . Yeah . There 's no way to escape . With the arrival of the next supply ship , the company will eliminate it . This is a maximum-security prison and you have no weapons of any kind ? We have some carving knives in the abattoir , a few more in the mess hall , some fire axes . - Nothing terribly formidable . - That 's all ? We 're on the honor system . - Then we 're fucked . - No . You 're fucked . Confined to the infirmary . Quarantined . Mr Aaron will escort you . You 'll be safe from any nasty beasts while you 're there . Good girl . Let 's all report to the mess hall . The superintendent wants a meeting . Mess hall , right away , people . Isn 't there any way off of this place ? Some way to escape ? No . A supply ship comes every six months . That 's it ? Fuck . They are sending somebody to pick you up quite soon . Really ? What 's soon ? I don 't know . Nobody 's ever been in a hurry to get here before . Do you want to tell me what you and Andrews talked about ? No . You 'd just say I 'm crazy . That 's a bit uncharitable . How are you feeling ? Not so hot . Sore throat , sick to my stomach . - Pissed off . - Understandable , given the circumstances . Perhaps I should give you one of my special cocktails . I don 't know why everybody blames everybody . Nobody 's perfect . We 're only human . There 's no such thing as a perfect human . In an insane world , a sane man must appear insane . That 's very profound , Golic . Thank you . You married ? - Me ? - You should get married , have kids . Pretty girl . I used to know lots of them . Back home . They used to like me . For a while . You 're gonna die , too . Are you ? - What ? - Married . - Why ? - Just curious . No . - How about leveling with me ? - Could you be more specific ? When I asked how you got assigned here , you avoided the question . Then when I asked about the prison ID tattooed on your head , you ducked me again . It 's a long , sad story . And more than a little melodramatic . Try me . If you insist . After my student years , despite the fact that I had become secretly addicted to morphine , I was considered to be most promising . A man with a future . During my first residency I did a 36-hour stretch on an ER . So I went out and I got more than a little drunk . Then I got called back . Boiler had blown in a fuel plant and there were 30 casualties . And 11 of them died . Not as a result of the accident , but because I prescribed the wrong dosage of painkiller . I got seven years in prison and my license reduced to a three-C . - At least I got off the morphine . - I 'm sorry . I think I was let off lightly . Did you serve your time here ? I got to know this motley crew quite well . So when they stayed , I stayed . Nobody else would employ me . So , do you still trust me with a needle ? Magnificent . Give us strength , O Lord , to endure We recognize that we are poor sinners in the hands of an angry god Let the circle be unbroken until the day . Amen . What the fuck is happening here ? What the fuck is this bullshit that 's coming down . We got a murder , we got a rape , we got brothers in trouble . I don 't want no more bullshit around here ! Now , we got problems , we stand together . Yes . Thank you , Mr Dillon . All right . Once again this is Rumor Control . Here are the facts . At 0800 hours , prisoner Murphy , through carelessness on his part , was found dead in vent shaft 17 . He seems to have been sucked into a ventilator fan . At about 2100 hours , prisoner Golic reappeared in a deranged state . Prisoners Boggs and Rains are missing . There seems to be a good chance that they have met with foul play at the hands of prisoner Golic . We need to organize and send out a search party . Volunteers will be appreciated . I think it 's fair to say that our smoothly running facility has suddenly developed a few problems . I can only hope we are able to all pull together over the next few days , until the rescue team arrives for Lt Ripley . - It 's here ! It got Clemens ! - Stop this raving at once . I 'm telling you ! It 's here ! Aaron , get that foolish woman back to the infirmary . - What is that ? - Move it ! Fuck ! We give you thanks , O Lord . The wrath has come , the time is near for us to be judged . The Apocalypse is upon us . Let us be ready . Let your mercy be just . - It was massive . - Amen ! - I was there . I saw it . - Yeah , I know . What the fuck do we do now ? Who 's in fucking charge ? Organize ! We gotta organize , right ? Right ! I 'm next in line . - 85 's gonna be in charge . Give us a break ! - Don 't call me that ! There 's no way I can replace Andrews . He was a good man . - I know you didn 't appreciate him ... - Aaron , we don 't wanna hear that shit now . Sister , what about you ? You an officer . How about showing us a little leadership ? Forget fuckin ' Shirley Temple ! You take charge . - Right . - You run things here anyway . No fuckin ' way . I 'm not the officer type . I just take care of my own . Well , what does this fuckin ' beast want ? Is this mother gonna try for us all ? Yeah . Ain 't that sweet ! How are we gonna stop it ? - You have no weapons . Is that correct ? - Right . I haven 't seen one exactly like this before . It moves differently . But the others were afraid of fire . Not much else . - Can we seal off this area ? - No chance . There 's 600 air ducts ... Video ? There 's closed-circuit monitors everywhere . We could use that . The video system hasn 't worked in years . Nothing much works here . We 've got technology , no way to fix it . - 85 is trying to tell you ... - Don 't call me that ! We ain 't got no entertainment center . No climate control , no video system . No surveillance . No freezers . No fuckin ' ice cream . No rubbers , no women . No guns . All we got here is shit ! What the hell are we even talking to her for ? She brought the fucker . Why don 't we just get her head and shove it through the fuckin ' wall ? Sounds good to me . Morse . Why don 't you shut the fuck up ? Right . Right . What are we going to do ? What 's this ? That leads from the mess hall to the infirmary . It 's a ventilation shaft . Then we go in there . Flush it out . Hey , look , there 's miles and miles of tunnel through there . It won 't go far . It 'll nest in this area . Right around ... here . How do you know that ? It 's like a lion . It sticks close to the zebras . Zebras ? Oh , right . But running around here in the dark ? Outside of this main shaft there 's no overheads . - Don 't we have flashlights ? - Thousands of them , but no batteries . Torches ? Do we have the capacity to make fire ? Most humans have enjoyed that privilege since the Stone Age . No need to be sarcastic . Never been used . They were gonna dump nuclear crap in there . Never did . It 's clean as a whistle inside . This is the only way in or out ? That 's right . Walls are six feet thick . Solid steel . They knew how to build these babies . You 're saying we get something in there , there 's no way it can get out ? That 's right . No fucking way . It 's kept here . Forget what it 's called . - Quinitricetyline . - I knew that . I 've gotta get these section arrangements organized with Dillon for the paint brush . - So ... - David ... - Yeah . You can get these drums organized . - Right , 85 . And ... don 't call me that . What 's this " 85 " thing ? A couple of us sneaked a look at his personnel file . It 's his IQ . I saw a drum of this stuff fall into a beachhead bunker once . The blast put a tug in dry dock for 17 weeks . Great stuff ! All right , let me get this straight . You wanna burn it down and out of the pipes , force it in here , slam the door , and trap its ass ? Right . And you want help from us Y-chromo boys , huh ? You got something better to do ? Why should we put our ass on the line for you ? Your ass is already on the line . The only question is what are you gonna do about it ? Look at this . There 's only one of these batteries in 2,000 that works . Hey , it could have been a lot worse . We might have got the paintbrush detail . Man , this stuff stinks ! This shit smells awful . - I can 't believe the fucking fumes . - You need a fuckin ' pipe for breathing . Don 't breathe too hard . You miss Doc , right ? What makes you say that ? I thought you two got real close . I guess you 've been looking through some keyholes . That 's what I thought . - Are you OK ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Whatever you say , but you don 't look OK to me , sister . I 'm fine . I hate this place . I hate this place . There 's definitely something in here with us . Don 't light the fire until I give the signal . This is the signal . Got it ? Can you remember that ? Shit ! No ! No ! Wait for the fucking signal ! Get down ! Come on ! We gotta find the sprinklers . We gotta help these guys . Come on . Move ! Move ! Get to the waste dump . Don 't open the door ! You 're all right . You 're gonna be all right . The fire 's out . Jude . Jude ! Get to the sprinklers and turn ' em on . We gotta get him outta here . We 're getting you out . Jude ! Behind you ! Open the door ! Come on ! Come on ! Come and get me , fucker ! Even for those who have fallen , this is a time of rejoicing . We salute their courage . They will live forever . Those that are dead are not dead . They have moved up . They have moved to a higher place . Crazy bastards . Clemens used to call them Dillon 's God Squad . It keeps ' em out of mischief . - You 're not the religious type ? - Me ? Shit , no . I got a job . Look . I figure the rescue team gets here in four , five days . Six , tops . They open the door , go in there with smart guns , and kill it . What have you heard from them ? Nothing much . We got a " Message received " . Later we got something that said you were top priority . They don 't cut us in on much . We 're the arse end of the totem pole here . What if they don 't want to kill it ? - Take it back ? - Yeah . They 're not lunatics . They gotta kill it . Right ? Morse , please cut me loose . - No fucking way . - Come on . It hurts . Sorry . - I haven 't done nothing . - Just don 't talk to me . - Please ! What did I do ? - I 'll tell you what I 'm gonna do . Sit here and guard your arse , like I 'm supposed to . I don 't need any fuckin ' trouble with Dillon . All I did was tell him about the dragon , what it did to Boggs and Rains . I didn 't lie . You saw it . Fuckin ' A , I saw it . Come on , please ! If this gets in here , I 'm dead . I can 't run . It 's not gonna get in here . We got it trapped . So what 's the big deal ? Come on . - Don 't I always give you cigarettes first ? - Yeah . Aren 't I your friend ? I love you , Morse . Why not ? You better behave yourself . No fucking around or I 'll get nothing but shit . So where 've they got it ? In a waste tank . We got that sucker nailed . Gotta see it again . What the fuck you talkin ' about ? No more cigarettes for you . We got the first part . Now what do we say ? Tell them we trapped it . - What do we call it ? - A xenomorph . Right . How do you spell it ? - We can 't kill it , don 't have any weapons . - Right . See ? That 's all they ever tell us . They treat us like shit . - Off and on . - What the hell you talking about ? Talk to me , the beast ! You can 't go in there . The big motherfucker will eat you alive . Sorry . Sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry ! Tell me what to do next . So they 're coming to take this thing away . Yeah , they 're gonna try . They don 't wanna kill it . We gotta figure out a way to do it . Why do we have to kill it ? You just said the company 's coming for it . That 's right . They wanna take it back , as some sort of weapon . - What 's wrong with that ? - They don 't understand it 'll kill them all . Like I said , what 's wrong with that ? Nothing 's wrong with that , except a lot of innocent people will die . - I thought you were a religious man . - You don 't understand . That world out there doesn 't exist for us any more . We got our own little world down here . It ain 't much , but it 's ours . So fuck everybody else ? No . Fuck them . - Hey , Dillon ? - Yeah . Dillon . We got a teeny-weeny problem . Fuckin ' great ! The miserable , crazy son of a bitch let it loose . Got what he fuckin ' deserved . Now what are we gonna do ? Andrews was right . Should have kept the shithead chained up . - You OK ? - Piss on her . The fuckin ' thing 's loose . - What are we gonna do ? - I just said that . You 're the dumb prick that let Golic out . You miserable little shit ! - Cut that shit out . - Tell your fuckin ' bozo to shape up . - What do you think ? - I think I have to get to the EEV . - Why ? What 's up ? - I just have to use the neuroscanner . - You don 't look so good . - Who gives a shit ! What are we gonna do ? Do you want a smack in the mouth , you stupid wanker ? Stop causing panic ! Panic ? You 're so stupid , you couldn 't spell it . Don 't talk to me about panic ! Shut up , both of you ! Shut up ! - Well , I 'm out of ideas . - Surprise me . - What about outside ? - Great idea ! Sun doesn 't come up for two days , it 's 40 below zero . That makes a lot of sense ! So you just want us to stay here and let this thing have us for lunch . Get everybody that 's still left together . Get ' em into the assembly hall . OK . Where 'd she go ? Need any help ? I didn 't mean to scare you . You shouldn 't be wandering around alone . Do me a favor and run this keyboard , will you ? OK . - What do I do ? - Hit B or C. What 's C ? - " Display bio-functions " ? - That 's it . OK , we 're hot . Now what ? Let it run its cycle . - It 's real fuzzy . - Hit enhancement . Keep looking . - I don 't know how to read this stuff . - Hemorrhaging will show as a dark patch . Look for hairline fractures through the base of the skull . Little white lines . What is it ? I think you 've got one inside of you . That 's not possible . What does it look like ? - Horrible . - I have to see it . - Freeze it ! - You don 't want to look at it . I 'm sorry . All right , the fuckin ' thing is loose . It 's out there . A rescue team is on its way with guns and shit . Right now , there isn 't any place that 's real safe . We stay here in the assembly hall . This place never had any fuckin ' air conditioning . If it comes in , it 'll be through these doors . We 'll post a guard who 'll let us know if it 's coming . In the meantime , you lay low , be ready and stay right , in case your time comes . Don 't you start bullshitting , Dillon . We 're gonna be trapped in here like rats . You got a weapon . You got a blade . You take it out and you fuckin ' use it ! Oh , right . So you think we 're gonna stab this motherfucker to death . I don 't think shit ! Maybe you 'll hurt it before it takes you out , huh ? Isn 't that something ? Any of you got any better ideas ? And I 'll tell you . Until the rescue team gets here , we 're fucked ! So you better get prepared . Well , I ain 't staying ' here . Then suit yourself . Fire . - The furnace . - Yeah . Let 's make it to the furnace . Holy shit . - Well , all right . - Fuckin ' A. Too fuckin ' right , it 's right . It 's up . What do you want to say ? Say the whole place has gone toxic . Are you kidding ? The rescue team will turn back . - Yeah , I know . - What are you talking about ? Our only hope is that they kill this fucker . Maybe they can do something for you . I don 't know , freeze you , do an operation . If this organism gets off the planet , it 'll kill everything . The company doesn 't care about that . They just want it for their bio-weapons division , OK ? So we can 't let them come here . Fuck you ! I 'm sorry you 've got this thing inside you , but I 'm getting rescued . I don 't care about these prisoners , but I 've got a wife and a kid . - I go home on the next rotation . - I know . This is hard . But I 'm gonna send this message and I need that fucking code . I 'm sorry , Ripley . It 's classified . You stupid little shit , this has got to be done ! OK ? There are no alternatives ! You 're not getting it ! No fucking way ! Look , it 's nothing personal . Understand ? I think you 're OK . Thanks . Have you got any ideas ? It won 't kill me . I 'm carrying the new queen . It won 't kill its future . You really wanna bet this thing 's that smart ? Maybe I 'll go find it . See how smart it is . - You 're gonna go and look for it ? - Yeah . I have a pretty good idea of where it is . It 's just down there , in the basement . This whole place is a basement . It 's a metaphor . Wanna come ? Fuck me . Where are you when I need you ? Don 't be afraid . I 'm part of the family . You 've been in my life so long , I can 't remember anything else . Now do something for me . It 's easy . Just ... Just do what you do . - It won 't kill me . - You 're supposed to be laying low . I have one inside of me . The big one won 't kill its own . - What are you talking about ? - I just saw it , an hour ago . I stood right next to it . I could have been lunch , but it wouldn 't touch me . It ran away . - It knows I 'm carrying its future . - Bullshit . - How do you know the thing 's inside you ? - I saw it , on the CAT scan . It 's a queen . An egg-layer . It can make thousands more . It still sounds like bullshit to me . If that thing 's inside you , how did it get there ? When I was in hypersleep , I guess . I was violated . And now I get to be the mother of the leader . I don 't have much time . And I can 't do what I should . I need you to help me . I need you to kill me . - What the fuck are you talking about ? - I 'm dead anyway . I can 't survive it . But the one inside of me can generate thousands more . It can wipe out the whole universe . It has to die . So somebody 's gotta kill me . Are you up to it ? You don 't have to worry about that . No speeches . No prayers . - What 's going on ? - I don 't like losing a fight . Not to nobody , not to nothing . That thing has already killed half my men and got the other half scared shitless . As long as it 's alive , sister , you 're not gonna save any universe . - You fuckin ' coward ! - I want that thing ! I wanna get this thing and I need you to do it . And if it won 't kill you , then maybe that helps us fight it . Otherwise , fuck you ! Go kill yourself . Dillon ! We waste this thing , then you take care of me . No problem . Quick , easy and painless . This is the choice . You die sitting here on your ass , or you die out there . At least we take a shot . We owe it one ! It 's fucked us up . Maybe we can get even for the others . Now , how do you want it ? - What the fuck are you talking about ? - Killing that big motherfucker . Hold it , hold it . The rescue team 's on its way . We could just sit this out . - The rescue team for who ? - For us . - They just want the beast . You know that . - I don 't give a damn what they want . - They 're not gonna pick us off one by one . - I wouldn 't be so sure . - Come on ! They 'll take us home . - They 're not gonna take " us " home . Still doesn 't mean we should fight it . Jesus Christ , give us a break . You guys must be nuts . I 've got a wife and kid . Nobody gives a shit about you , 85 . You 're not one of us , you 're not a believer . You 're a fuckin ' company man ! Yeah , OK . I 'm a company man , I 'm not a fuckin ' criminal . You tell me how dumb I am . I 'm smart enough not to have a life sentence on this rock ! - Shut your face ! - Piss off , 85 ! And I 'm smart enough to wait for some firepower to show up before we fight it ! OK , just sit here on your asses . Fine . - How about if I sit here on my ass ? - No problem . Oh , I forgot . You 're the guy that 's made a deal with God to live forever , huh ? And all the rest of you pussies can sit it out , too . Me and her 'll do all the fighting . OK . Look , I want the same thing as you . I want to see it dead . I hate the fucker ! It killed my mates , too ! Why the fuck can 't we wait for the company and have some guns on our side ? - Why should we go on a fucking suicide run ? - Right ! Because they won 't kill it . They might kill you for having seen it , but they won 't kill it . That is crazy ! That is horseshit ! They will not kill us . When they first heard about this thing , it was " crew expendable " . The next time , they sent in marines . They were expendable , too . What makes you think they 'll care about a bunch of lifers who found God at the ass-end of space ? You really think they 're gonna let you interfere with their plans for this thing ? They think we 're crud . And they don 't give a fuck about one friend of yours that 's died . Not one . - Have you got some sort of plan ? - This is a lead works , isn 't it ? All we gotta do is lure the fuckin ' beast into the mold . Drown it in hot lead . Oh , right . So how do we do that ? Yeah . What are we gonna use for bait ? Aw , fuck ! We 're all gonna die . The only question is when . This is as good a place as any to take our first steps to heaven . The only question is how you check out . Do you want it on your feet or on your fuckin ' knees ... begging ! I ain 't much for begging . Nobody ever gave me nothing . So I say fuck that thing ! Let 's fight it ! - Fuck it . Let 's go , boys ! - OK . What the fuck are we gonna do if it runs at us ? Better have some fucking good ideas . Door 1 open . When was the last time you used this place ? We fired it up five , six years ago . - You sure the piston 's gonna work ? - There 's nothing for sure in this place . We trap it here first , then you pull the lever . The piston 's gonna push it into the mold . One of the guys will pour the lead . - End of his ass , end of story . - What if somebody screws it up ? We 're fucked . You got one chance , one shot at it . We 'll never have time to reset it . Now , remember , you pull the lever , for a few seconds you 're gonna be trapped in here with that thing . You guys don 't drop the ball , I won 't . You better be right about that thing not wanting you . Because if it wants out , that 's how it 's gonna go : through that alcove , through you . - Where will you be ? - Around . - What about the others ? Where are they ? - Praying . Do you believe in this heaven shit ? I don 't know . Fuck it . What else have we got to believe in ? Ain 't that the fuckin ' truth . What the fuck . Right ? I can 't hear ... Let 's blitz this thing ! Closing door 7 . I don 't know about this shit . Hey , guys ! My door ain 't working . - What the fuck 's he saying ? - I think we better rethink this thing ! Did anybody hear anything ? Come on ! Come and get me , you fucker . It 's behind me ! It 's started . - It 's still behind me ! - It 's in channel B. It 's still behind me . Shut the doors ! Must be heading over to channel A. This thing is really pissed off ! - Did you say B ? - No , E. - You said we should stay here ! - Move your ass ! Morse ? Kevin ! I think I 've found Vincent ! Hey , fuckface , come and get me ! Take your best shot ! You can 't get me ! A7 closed ! Over in the east wing . Door B7 safe ! You too ? OK , over to E , everybody ! - Where the fuck is E ? - This way . Right . Track ! How did I get here ? Where the hell are they going ? What about the plan ? - You 're immune ! They 're not ! - So what are we doing ? - Improvising . - We 're improvising . Great . Here ! Here , kitty , kitty . Oh , my God . You bastard ! It 's coming ! It 's coming down through the tunnel ! It 's after us ! Shut the fucking doors ! That was the plan ! Jeez , it 's on the fucking ceiling ! Dillon ! Anybody ! This is not a drill ! Kevin ! Gregor ! Where the fuck are you ? Kevin ! Now I 'm back in A ! Door three , F channel , closed . I hope . What the fuck are you doing ? Don 't hold it like that , hold it like this . You 'll kill someone , you fuckin ' moron ! Morse ! Kevin ! Gregor ! All they have to do is run down a damn corridor . Stay here . Where the hell is it ? It 's coming . Jesus . There ! No ! Don 't start the piston ! No ! We have to trap it ! What are you doing ? It 's gone ! No ! It 's gone ! OK ? OK . Kevin ! Don 't move ! Don 't struggle ! Come on . Come on , Kevin . Come on ! - The doors . - It 's coming ! Take the piston ! It 's all right . It 's OK . It 's all right , Kevin . Kevin . Kevin ! Leave him ! He 's dead . Lure it in . - Shit ! How much time ? - I 'm not sure . Four or five minutes . We got to get it back in here before the piston seals this place off . Now let 's move it ! Help me ! Jude ! Dillon ! Help me ! It 's coming at me ! Don 't look back , Jude ! Run as fast as you fuckin ' can ! Dillon , help me ! Please ! Jesus Christ ! Thank God you 're here . Warder Aaron , sir . 137512 . Not many of us left , sir . Where is Lt Ripley ? Is she still alive ? If she 's alive , she 's in the furnace . She 's in the lead works with the beast . Wouldn 't wait . - Jesus Christ . - You fucker . Scared me shitless ! I thought you were the fuckin ' beast . You fucker ! Wanker ! Move . Come on , you bastard ! Come on ! Get out of there ! Come here ! Ripley , we 're running out of time ! Ripley , where are you ? No ! Dillon , over here ! Dillon ! Come on . Get out of there ! What the fuck is wrong with you ? Let it go ! - Yes , it 's working ! To the piston ! - Scream . Let it follow us . - Come on ! - We gotta get it in front of the piston ! - It 's following us ! - Come on . Come and get us ! - Come on ! - Up to the door ! Come on ! Come on , motherfucker ! Come on ! Get the door ! - Get the door ! - Morse ! - Now ! - Shut it ! Shut it , Morse ! Morse ! Shut the door ! - Now ! - Shut the fuckin ' door ! I 'm going for the lead ! - Now ! - What about you ? - I 'm staying . - There 'll be ten tons of hot lead in here . - I 'm telling you , I wanna die ! - We got a deal . Remember ? It dies first , then you ! I 'm not gonna move without you . Now get going ! - Dillon ? - I 've gotta hold it here . - What about me ? - God will take care of you , sister . No ! Pour the lead . Now , fuck you . - No ! - Go on , Ripley . Go on ! Pour the lead , Ripley . Pour it now ! Come on ! Is that all you got ? Fight , motherfucker ! - Come on , do it ! - Morse , over here ! - Ripley ! - Pour the lead ! Pour the lead ! Pour it ! I hate bugs ! Ripley ! It 's burning hot . Hit the sprinkler ! Douse the fucker ! Gotcha ! Yes ! - Don 't come any closer . - Wait ! They 're here to help . Stay where you are . - Ripley . - Bishop . - I 'm here to help you . - No more bullshit . I just felt it move . - You know who I am ? - You 're a droid . Same model as Bishop . Sent by the fucking company . No . I 'm not the Bishop android . I designed it . I 'm very human . The company sent me here to show you a friendly face . To demonstrate how important you are to us . To me . - You wanna take it back . - We want to kill it and take you home . Bullshit . You 're wrong . We want to help . What does that mean ? - We 're gonna take that out of you . - And keep it . We can 't let it live . Everything would be in jeopardy . - You don 't want to take it back ? - Ripley , time is important . Let us deal with the malignancy . We 've got a surgical bay set up on the rescue ship . Come with me . It 's very quick . Painless . A couple of incisions . You 'll be out for two hours . And then it 's over . You still can have a life . Children . And most important , you 'll know it 's dead . Let me help you . What guarantee do I have , once you 've taken it out , that you 'll destroy it ? You have to trust me . Please ? Trust me . No . What 's this gonna achieve ? Stop ! Oh , Jesus ! Morse . - Will you help me ? - What do you want me to do ? It was a mistake . There was no need for any of it . Fuckin ' android ! I 'm not a droid ! Ripley ! Think of all we could learn from it . It 's the chance of a lifetime ! You must let me have it . It 's a magnificent specimen . No pictures ! You 're crazy . What are you doing ? No ! - Come on , you . Get going ! - Fuck you ! Ash and Captain Dallas are dead . Cargo and ship destroyed . I should reach the frontier in about six weeks . With a bit of luck , the network will pick me up . This is Ripley , last survivor of the Nostromo , signing off . [ ENGLISH - US ]

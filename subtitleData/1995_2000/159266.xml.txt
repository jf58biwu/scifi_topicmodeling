 What a great choice . Amazing food ! And such generous portions . Just wait till you try the mints . Doug , most guys are put off by my eye . It 's nice to meet someone open-minded . Ew ! Love 's Labour Lost in Space What went wrong last night ? I don 't know . I couldn 't put my finger on it . Possibly his vile lizard tongue . You 're too picky . If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or low l.Q ... ... or a temper , you 're gonna be lonely . There 's nothing wrong with having high standards . Leela 's problem is purely medical . She 'll drop her eggs . They 'll hatch and all will be well . Give guys a chance . You think a guy is a pig , but then you realize he has a good body . Thank you for the inspiring advice . But I 'm happy with my life . That sounds like a cry for help . Let 's go out . There 's great places to meet people . - The Sex Bureau . - A saucy puppet show . A rotting whale carcass . I 'll pick . Oh , wow ! It 's totally retro ! - Why 's everyone wearing rings ? - Because nobody wears them anymore . - Rings are stupid . - They look cool . Don 't let anyone hear you ! Did he say rings are cool ? - No , he said they 're stupid . - Cool ! What do you think of that guy ? - I don 't know . Maybe . - Forget it . He 's gay . What ? How can you tell ? I just know these things . I 've got " gaydar . " There 's no such thing . No ? Okay , I got a lock on him . Yep ! He 's gay . - Are you sure ? - Definitely ! Or it 's interference from a gay weather balloon . You 're from the 20th century ? That 's incredible . I 'm from the 21 st ! We 've got so much in common ! We sure do . Remember when the cyborgs enslaved humanity ? Yeah ! That rings a bell . This is Bolt Rolands . He 's a hyper-sled racer with 1 0 wins on the pro circuit . Hello , beautiful . I think she means 1 0 wins on the gay circuit . I wish . Those cats can really fly . M 'oh . This is M-5438 , an entity of pure energy . Great . But he 's just not what I 'm looking for . I understand . One day you will evolve beyond your physical body . And on that day , I hope you will pick up the phone . You 're impossible . Just as well . He comes from a dimension ... ... that 's big on musical theater . I need the apartment . Go see a saucy puppet show . Can do ! My , my , my . What 's a beautiful lady like you- - ? Oh , my ! I 'm sorry ! I thought you had two eyes . Leela , you must 've had your pick last night at closing time . Could you stop talking about my personal life ? Yes , let 's talk about Leela 's personal life later . We have business to attend to . - A delivery ? - A tax-deductible mission of charity . ROBOTIC VOICE : This is Vergon 6 . This is Vergon 6 . Buh ! It 's a sunny little doomed planet inhabited by frisky , doomed animals . - Animals ? - That 's right . Animals in need of rescue . Vergon 6 was once filled with the dense substance " Dark Matter . " Each pound of it weighs over 1 0,000 pounds . Wait . What about the animals ? Well , Dark Matter is valuable as starship fuel . That 's why it was mined out , leaving the planet hollow . But what about the animals ? - The-- ? - The animals . I didn 't mention animals . The planet will collapse within three days . This will kill all the animals . We have to save two of each kind . Like Noah 's Ark . Why two ? Oh . [ GIGGLES ] I bet Leela 's holding out for a one-eyed guy . That 'll take forever . She ought to find a guy with two eyes and poke one out . That 'd be a timesaver . Do you mind ? You can use this as a poker . Thanks , if it 's less than five , I don 't care how many eyes he has . I want a guy who 's adventurous , self - confident , maybe a snappy dresser . These new uniforms are snappy , first officer . I suppose , captain . I 'm not a big fan of velour as you are . What do you want to do about that ship ? Destroy them ! That 's got a nice feel to it . ZAPP : Captain 's journal . Stardate , 3000.3 . KIF : Who are you talking to ? You . Aren 't you getting this ? A vessel is attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6 . I 'm anticipating a tactical dogfight , followed by a light dinner . Ravioli , ham , sundae bar ... . Hey , look ! Zapp Brannigan 's ship . - Wow ! The Zapp Brannigan ? - Uh-huh . Who 's the Zapp Brannigan ? Shall I fire on them now , sir ? Not yet , Kif . In the game of chess , never let your adversary see your pieces . What ? Zapp Brannigan alone saved the Octillion System ... ... from rampaging Killbots . - Wow ! - A grim day for robot-kind . But we can build more Killbots ! He 's the most decorated captain in the Order of Planets . Leela 's got a boyfriend ! No , but we ought to see if he 'll help us rescue those animals . In case you hit it off , you 'll want to take this with you . They 're headed for us . A calculated move out of Sun Tzu 's classic text , The Art of War . Or my own masterwork , Zapp Brannigan ' s Big Book of War . The one thing their captain doesn 't realize is- - They 've docked and come aboard . Then I 've risked all and lost . I 'll be in the escape pod . If that wicker chair I like survives , have it sent to my P.O. box . I 'm Leela , captain of the Planet Express delivery ship . We 're pleading for assistance . If there 's- - I 'm in command . Zapp Brannigan . Has my fame preceded me , or was I too quick ? Oh , not at all . I 'm just so really thrilled to meet you . You 're an impressive captain , beautiful and deadly . - A potent combination . - You don 't mean that . I haven 't seen more than three captains sexier than you . Only one who was deadlier . I heard you defeated a horde ... ... of somethings in the something system . The Killbots ? Simply a matter of outsmarting them . I never would 've thought of that . Killbots have a preset kill limit . Knowing that , I sent wave after wave of my own men at them ... ... until they shut down . Kif , show them the medal I won . More , please . A little more . More . Keep going . We need to talk about our mission . I 'm willing to put wave after wave ... ... of men at your disposal . Right , men ? MAN : You suck ! We 're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 . - If you could- - - Vergon 6 ! - This dinner is over . - What 's wrong ? The Order of Planets prohibits interfering with other worlds . It 's a little rule known as " Brannigan 's Law . " People already interfered . That planet was mined hollow . By an Order of Planets mining crew . This doesn 't make any sense . I don 't pretend to understand Brannigan 's Law . I enforce it . Fine , we 'll save the animals alone . I 'm afraid I can 't allow that . Guards ! - What just happened ? - He 's throwing us in prison . Dang ! Can I get this wrapped up ? Ow ! I might 've liked Zapp if he hadn 't thrown me in prison . You really are too picky . Kif , follow me up to the deck . I 've got some musing to do . Oh , jeez ! I 'm facing a formidable female adversary . Suggestions ? I fail to see any problem , sir . You 've imprisoned her under directive B-1 0.81 . You mean Brannigan 's Law ? Right , that law . - Which one ? - Brannigan 's Law . You 're my best friend , but you 've earned my contempt again . You should know , the way to deal ... ... with a female adversary is to seduce her . - This time we are sure she 's a woman ? - Yes ! Invite her to my quarters . And have the boy lay out my formal shorts . The boy , sir ? You . You lay out my formal shorts . The jackass wants to see you in his quarters . Now 's my chance to reason with him , captain to captain . And he wants you to wear this . ZAPP : Come and get it ! Welcome to my humble chamber . Or as I call it , " The Love-Nasium . " - Cham-pag-in ? - You 're such a coin-a-sewer . Well , I have studied abroad . Or two . - Captain , if we could speak seriously . - Uh-huh . Please let us rescue those animals . Mm-hm . I like your style . I find it very erotic . - What ? - Erotic ! Erotic ! Erotic ! Erotic ! We can escape . Just bend the hatch off this steam pipe . Hey , yeah ! FRY : No ! It 's full of steam ! You look like a woman who enjoys the finer things . Come over here and feel my velour bedspread . I 'm not in the mood . Leela , it 's real velour . Just let yourself go . Can I please just go back to prison ? You 'd rather sit in prison than spend time with the " Zapper " ? Much rather . [ ZAPP SNIVELS ] What are you doing ? Oh , God , I 'm pathetic . Sorry . Just go . You want the cham-pag-in ? No . And it 's pronounced " champagne . " Oh , God , no ! It 's not a big deal . I get so lonely . I just thought a fellow captain would understand . Oh , forget it . It 's great ordering people around . But through it all , you 're completely alone . It comes with the job . I 'm just so lonely ! Oh , come on . Cheer up . It 's not that bad . - Want to try escaping again ? - I 'm comfy . Leela 's been gone a long time . I hope she 's making progress with Zapp . [ SNORES ] Good morning , lover . - Listen ... . - Now you 're officially my woman . Kudos ! I can 't say I don 't envy you . Last night was a mistake . A sexy mistake . No , just a regular mistake . For a second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity . A second is all it takes . That 's why eventually you 'll come crawling back to the Zapper . The only kind of crawling I 'm doing to you is away ... from. Leela , you 're obviously confused and aroused . I 'm going to Vergon 6 to save those animals , like it or not ! I won 't stop you . Threaten all you- - What ? We both know you won 't make it to Vergon 6 before the craving sets in . Then you 'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet candy . Bam ! Ew . - Kif ? - Yes-- Oh ! Yes , captain ? I have made it with a woman . Inform the men . The fatso says you 're free to go . - Really ? Why ? - " Why , " indeed . - What was that ? - Nothing . Should we go and head to the planet ? We just talked , okay ? We don 't have much time . The planet is supposed to collapse in- - Two hours ago . Purple Fruit Snake ... . Purple Fruit Snake ... . Hello , there . He 's not on the list . So we can cook him ? A barbecue ! I 'll wear my funny apron ! No ! I don 't care about your apron , we 're not cooking him . Ahhh . I 'll call him " Nibbler . " Ahhh . I 'll fire up the grill . I hope he 'll be okay with all those big animals . Once my woman returns , I won 't have time to hang with the boys anymore . That 's a shame , sir . So let 's make the most of our time together . Never mind . Just give me a back rub . I found some hermaphlamingos . That 's the last species . Huh ? BENDER : Hey , what the- - ? - Where 'd they all go ? [ BURPS ] Nibbler ! I can 't believe we flew across the galaxy and had a steam ... ... to get lunch for him . He 's pending for a Bending . It 's not his fault he 's an unstoppable killing machine . Is it , snookums ? The planet 's kerr-ploding ! Prepare for liftoff . We 're out of fuel ! Bender , I told you to fill the tank . I 'll do it when we get back . Lucky for us Zapp Brannigan 's nearby . Forget it ! I refuse to go crawling back to him . What do you mean ? Nothing . We just talked . So ? It 's not like you slept with him . Oh , my God ! How could you , Leela ? I thought you had standards ! Jeez , he 's a dumb , gross gorilla ! Don 't you think I feel bad enough already ? No ! All right , I 'll call him . If living is that important to you . - -that 's why you 'll never make captain . Hello , Zapp ? - Well , well , well . - Zapp , we 're out of fuel . Vergon 6 is about to implode . We need help . So , crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly . Delicious . - Birds don ' t crawl . - They 've been known to ! Are you gonna rescue us or not ? Can ' t you ask a bit more sexfully ? Please , Big Z ? But first you have to get rid of that thing . That 's the law . Brannigan 's Law is like Brannigan 's love . Hard and fast . Now put that greasy rat outside and we 'll tow you . I 'd never abandon a helpless animal . You know , once I thought you were a pompous buffoon . Then I realized that inside you were a child . Now I realize that outside that child is a pompous buffoon ! And which one rocked your world ? [ LEELA SIGHS ] Way to tell that guy off ! What 's your escape plan ? I guess to sit here and wait for death . Can do ! [ LOUD THUDDING ] What the hell was that ? Pew ! I don 't believe it ! It 's Dark Matter ! So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel ? His species must 've filled the planet with it . Did you do that , you cute little- - ? That should be enough fuel to get us out . Bender , put it in the engine . We made it ! And some of the animals survived ! So a couple animals didn 't die and Leela got lucky . That 's what I call a successful mission . We 're heroes ! Dear diary : I didn 't find love on this mission ... ... but I did find a cute little companion who excretes fuel . And that 's just as good . ZAPP : Captain 's journal , Stardate , uh ... . KIF : April 1 3th . ZAPP : April 1 3th . Point-two . We failed to uphold the law . However , I did make it with a hot alien babe . And in the end , is that not what man has dreamt of ... ... since first he looked up at the stars ? Kif , I 'm asking you a question . Oh .

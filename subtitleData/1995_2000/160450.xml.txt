THEY GOT FOUR FANGS , NOT TWO . - AND THEY SUCK GOATS , HENCE THE NAME . - SO INSTEAD THIS WOULD BE ? - CLASSIC VAMPIRISM . - OF A BUNCH OF COWS ? AND ONE DEAD HUMAN . LAST NIGHT A VACATIONER FROM NEW JERSEY . COME ON . WE GOTTA GO . WHY DIDN 'T YOU TELL ME THAT FROM THE BEGINNING ? LOCK THE DOOR ON YOUR WAY OUT . [ Disgusted Sigh ] [ Scully 's Voice ] THE TOWN OF CHENEY IS TOO SMALL TO MAINTAIN A MORGUE FACILITY . AS SUCH , WE MADE OUR WAY TO THE PEACEFUL SLUMBERS FUNERAL HOME ... IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THE BODY OF ONE MR. DWIGHT FUNT , RECENTLY DECEASED . [ Man Talking Quietly ] [ Scully ] IT WAS THERE THAT WE WERE MET BY A REPRESENTATIVE ... OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT , SHERIFF- - LUCIUS HARTWELL . - YOU THE F.B.I. AGENTS ? - YES . I 'M- - AGENTS MULDER AND , UH- - [ Snapping Fingers ] SCULLY .

YOUR SATANIC CULTISTS HAVE SOME SHARP LITTLE TEETH . WHAT SATANIC CULTISTS ? GO AHEAD , TELL HIM YOUR , UH , " THEORY . " WELL , MY THEORY HAS EVOLVED . BASICALLY , I THINK WE 'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS SEEN ONE TOO MANY BELA LUGOSI MOVIES . HE BELIEVES HE IS A VAMPIRE , THEREFORE HE- - THEY ACT LIKE ONE . YEAH . YEAH . THAT MAKES A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE . - I THINK SHE 'S RIGHT . - WHAT ABOUT THE FANG MARKS ? WELL , SOMEONE SO OBSESSED MIGHT WELL FILE DOWN THEIR INCISORS . I THINK THAT A MOULAGE CASTING SHOULD HELP US MAKE AN IDENTIFICATION . MOULAGE CASTING . THAT 'S A GOOD IDEA . NOW- - NOW , ISN 'T THERE SOME KIND OF DISEASE THAT MAKES A PERSON THINK THAT THEY 'RE A VAMPIRE ? WELL , THERE IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL FIXATION CALLED HEMATODIPSIA , WHICH CAUSES THE SUFFERER TO GAIN EROTIC SATISFACTION ... FROM CONSUMING HUMAN BLOOD . EROTIC . YEAH . THERE ARE ALSO GENETIC AFFLICTIONS ... WHICH CAUSE A HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY TO LIGHT , UH , TO GARLIC . PORPHYRIA . XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM . YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR STUFF , DANA . " DANA " ?

[ Neck Muscles Cracking ] [ Sighs ] [ Scully 's Voice ] HAVING COMPLETED THE AUTOPSY , I CHECKED INTO THE DAVEY CROCKETT MOTOR COURT . [ Mulder ] THE NAME OF IT WAS ACTUALLY THE SAM HOUSTON MOTOR LODGE . [ Bed Motor Humming ] [ Sighs ] [ Whispering ] OH , MY GOD . [ Door Hinges Creak , Door Slams ] CHLORAL HYDRATE . WHAT ? - WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU ? - NOTHIN ' . CHLORAL HYDRATE ? YEAH , THAT THING THAT YOU DIDN 'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR . CHLORAL HYDRATE , MORE COLORFULLY KNOWN AS " KNOCKOUT DROPS . " I FOUND IT IN ABUNDANCE WHEN I SENT THE TOX SCREEN IN ON OUR MURDER VICTIM . - NO , SERIOUSLY , MULDER . WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU ? - NOTHING . - WHO SLIPPED HIM THE MICKEY ? - MY " THEORY " ? YOUR VAMPIRE . HE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO DOPE POOR MR. FUNT TO THE GILLS ... BEFORE HE WAS ABLE TO EXTRACT HIS BLOOD . PROBABLY DID IT TO THE COWS TOO . WHAT KIND OF VAMPIRE WOULD DO THAT ? EXACTLY . [ Sighs ] WE GOT ANOTHER DEAD TOURIST . YOU GOTTA DO ANOTHER AUTOPSY . TONIGHT ? I JUST PUT MONEY IN THE MAGIC FINGERS . I WON 'T LET IT GO TO WASTE . [ Bed Continues Vibrating ] [ Sighs ] [ Giggling ] [ Giggling Continues ] THIS ONE 'S MY ROOM , MULDER . DON 'T GET MUD EVERYWHERE . YEAH . YEAH , YEAH , YEAH , YEAH , YEAH . OKAY . [ Giggling ] EXCUSE ME , MA 'AM . DID YOU ORDER A PIZZA ? YEAH . THE GUY IN THERE WILL PAY FOR IT . [ Scully 's Voice ] FORGOING BOTH DINNER AND SLEEP , I WAS SOON BACK AT THE FUNERAL HOME ... EXAMINING ONE MR. PAUL LOMBARDO ... FROM NAPLES , FLORIDA . HEART . LUNG . LARGE INTESTINE . [ Sighs ] [ Sighs Deeply ] AS WITH THE PREVIOUS VICTIM , IT APPEARS THAT THE SUBJECT ... WAS MOST LIKELY INCAPACITATED WITH CHLORAL HYDRATE ... AND THEN EXSANGUINATED . [ Phone Rings ] [ Sighs ] THE DRUG WAS EITHER INJECTED OR INGESTED , [ Ringing Continues ] I 'M NOT SURE WHICH . [ Phone Beeps ] SCULLY . [ Heavy Breathing ] HELLO ? [ Gasping ] HELLO ? [ Panting ] [ Sighs ] WHERE WAS I ? STOMACH CONTENTS . [ Sighs ] STOMACH CONTENTS INCLUDE ... PIZZA- - [ Gasps ] CHLORAL HYDRATE 'S IN THE PIZZA . THE PIZZA GUY . [ Gasps ] MULDER . MULDER ? [ Hissing ] THAT 'S IT ? WELL , LUCKILY , I 'D GOTTEN THERE IN TIME . I MEAN , THOUGH YOU WERE DRUGGED , YOU WERE , MORE OR LESS , UNHARMED . MULDER ? ARE YOU OKAY ? WHO 'S THE BLACK PRIVATE DICK WHO 'S THE SEX MACHINE WITH ALL THE CHICKS ? dd SHAFT dddd CAN YOU DIG IT ? THEY SAY THIS CAT SHAFT IS A BAD MOTHER- - SHUT YOUR MOUTH . TALKIN ' ' BOUT SHAFT . I DID NOT . LONG STORY SHORT , THOUGH MY FIRST FOUR SHOTS OBVIOUSLY MISSED RONNIE STRICKLAND ENTIRELY , WITH MY FIFTH , I WAS ABLE TO SHOOT OUT A TIRE ON HIS CAR , FORCING HIM TO ESCAPE ON FOOT . I LEFT YOU BEHIND , AND I ENTERED THE WOODS IN PURSUIT . I ASSUMED THAT YOU WERE INCAPACITATED . THEN I HEARD SCREAMING . WHEN I ARRIVED IN THE CLEARING , I FOUND THAT YOU HAD CAUGHT UP WITH HIM FIRST ... AND HAD ... OVERREACTED , AND THAT HIS VAMPIRE TEETH WERE FAKE . THAT 'S WHAT YOU 'RE GONNA TELL SKINNER . WELL , I 'M GONNA ARGUE THAT WE CAUGHT A KILLER . AN UTTERLY NON-SUPERNATURAL KILLER , BUT A KILLER NONETHELESS . AND THAT YOUR ZEAL TO CATCH UP WITH HIM WAS AUGMENTED ... BY THE CHLORAL HYDRATE YOU WERE GIVEN . - YOU ARE AFRAID TO TELL THE TRUTH . - EXCUSE ME ? THAT 'S NOT THE WAY IT HAPPENED . ARE YOU AFRAID IF YOU TELL IT ... THE WAY IT REALLY HAPPENED , YOU 'LL LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT , LIKE ME ? MULDER , WHY DON 'T YOU TELL ME THE WAY YOU THINK IT HAPPENED ? STARTING AT THE BEGINNING . YOU 'RE DAMN RIGHT . YESTERDAY MORNING BEGAN LIKE ANY OTHER MORNING . YOU ARRIVED AT THE OFFICE CHARACTERISTICALLY LESS THAN EXUBERANT . [ Quiet Tone ] I HOPE YOU BROUGHT YOUR COWBOY BOOTS . WHY ARE WE GOING TO DALLAS ? ACTUALLY IT 'S A LITTLE TOWN JUST SOUTH OF THERE CALLED CHENEY , TEXAS . THEY 'VE HAD INCIDENTS DOWN THERE RECENTLY WHICH I THINK YOU 'LL AGREE ARE PRETTY UNUSUAL . - LIKE WHAT ? - I BROUGHT SOME SLIDES WITH WHICH TO BETTER ILLUSTRATE . HERE WE GO . IT 'S A DEAD COW . IT 'S ACTUALLY SIX DEAD COWS , AND HERE 'S THE REALLY INTERESTING THING . WHY AM I LOOKING AT SIX DEAD COWS ? BECAUSE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY DIED . ALL SIX WERE MYSTERIOUSLY EXSANGUINATED . - AND ? - AND TWO LITTLE PUNCTURE MARKS RIGHT HERE ON THE NECK . LOOK , I GOT A SLIDE OF THAT . AND , UM , ONE DEAD HUMAN VICTIM . LAST NIGHT A VACATIONER FROM NEW JERSEY . HIS BODY COMPLETELY DRAINED OF BLOOD , AND TWO LITTLE PUNCTURE WOUNDS ON HIS NECK . OKAY , LOOK , SCULLY , I DON 'T WANT TO JUMP TO ANY HASTY CONCLUSIONS , BUT ON THE STRENGTH OF THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE HERE , I THINK WHAT WE MAY BE LOOKING AT IS WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SERIES OF VAMPIRE ... ORVAMPIRE-LIKE ATTACKS . ON WHAT DO YOU BASE THAT ? UH , WELL , ON THE CORPSES DRAINED OF BLOOD ... AND THE FANG MARKS ON THE NECK . BUT AS ALWAYS , I-I 'M VERY EAGER TO HEAR YOUR OPINION . - WELL , IT 'S OBVIOUSLY NOT A VAMPIRE . - WHY NOT ? BECAUSE THEY DON 'T EXIST ? WELL , THAT 'S ONE OPINION , AND I RESPECT THAT . NONETHELESS , I 'M THINKING A MURDER HAS BEEN COMMITTED HERE , AND WE CAN GO DOWN THERE AND HELP BRING A KILLER TO JUSTICE ... IN WHATEVER FORM- - MORTAL OR IMMORTAL- - HE MAY TAKE . IT 'S NOT THAT MEXICAN GOAT SUCKER EITHER . [ Man Talking Quietly ] [ Mulder ] UPON ARRIVING AT THE FUNERAL HOME , I MADE AN INTERESTING OBSERVATION , ONE WHICH YOU APPARENTLY DIDN 'T HEAR . - THAT 'S A WHOLE LOT OF CASKETS . - LARGEST IN-STOCK SELECTION IN THE STATE . WELL , WHY WOULD A TOWN WITH A POPULATION OF ONLY 361 NEED THAT ? REPEAT BUSINESS . [ Chuckles ] MORTICIAN HUMOR . EXCUSE ME . [ Mulder ] APPARENTLY , YOUR MIND WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE . WHOO , BOY . [ Exaggerated Texas Accent ] Y 'ALL MUST BE THE GOVERNMENT PEOPLE . I 'M LUCIUS HARTWELL . HE HAD BIG BUCKTEETH ? - HE HAD A SLIGHT OVERBITE . - NO , HE DIDN 'T . AND THAT 'S SIGNIFICANT ? HOW ? I 'M JUST TRYING TO BE THOROUGH . ANYWAY , THEN WE WENT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BODY . HERE WE GO . NO EXAM HAS BEEN DONE ? NO , SIR . THIS IS JUST LIKE WE FOUND HIM IN THE MOTEL ROOM , AS IS . NO EXAM HAS BEEN DONE ? UH , NO , MA 'AM . ONCE I HEARD Y 'ALL WAS INTERESTED , I FIGURED WE 'D BEST LEAVE IT TO THE EXPERTS . NOW , UH , THAT CAN 'T BE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE , RIGHT ? IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK IT LOOKS LIKE , SHERIFF HARTWELL . VAMPIRES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WITH US , IN ANCIENT MYTHS AND STORIES PASSED DOWN FROM EARLY MAN . FROM THE BABYLONIANEKIMMU TO THE CHINESEKUANGSHI , THEMOTETZ DAMOF THE HEBREWS , THEMORMOOF ANCIENT GREECE AND ROME , RIGHT DOWN TO THE MORE FAMILIAR NOSFERATUOF TRANSYLVANIA . MORMO . YEAH . IN SHORT , SHERIFF , NO , THIS CAN 'T BE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE . I THINK WHAT WE 'RE DEALING WITH HERE IS SIMPLY A CASE OF SOME LUNATIC ... [ Chuckles ] WHO , UH , HAS WATCHED TOO MANY BELA LUGOSI MOVIES . HE WISHES THAT HE COULD TRANSFIGURE HIMSELF INTO A CREATURE OF THE NIGHT . YEAH , OKAY . WHAT SHE SAID , THAT 'S WHAT I 'M THINKIN ' . AND , UH , YEAH . STILL , THAT LEAVES US IN SOMETHING OF A QUANDARY ... BECAUSE THERE ARE AS MANY DIFFERENT VAMPIRES AS THERE ARE CULTURES THAT FEAR THEM . SOME DON 'T EVEN SUBSIST ON BLOOD . THE BULGARIANUBOUR , FOR EXAMPLE , EATS ONLY MANURE . THANK YOU . TO THE SERBS , A PRIME INDICATOR OF VAMPIRISM WAS RED HAIR . [ Chuckles ] UH , SOME VAMPIRES ARE THOUGHT TO BE ETERNAL . OTHERS ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE A LIFE SPAN OF ONLY 40 DAYS . SUNLIGHT KILLS CERTAIN VAMPIRES , WHILE OTHERS COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE , DAY OR NIGHT . IF THERE 'S A POINT , MULDER , PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME TO IT . MY POINT IS WE DON 'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE 'RE LOOKING FOR , WHAT KIND OF VAMPIRE- - OR , IF YOU PREFER , WHAT KIND OF VAMPIRE THIS KILLER WISHES HIMSELF TO BE . NOW , WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT THAT HIS SHOES WERE UNTIED ? I 'M GETTIN ' TO IT . SO WHILE YOU STAYED BEHIND TO DO THE AUTOPSY , THE SHERIFF DROVE ME TO THE TOWN CEMETERY . [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Metal Gate Squeaking ] AGENT MULDER , YOU MIND ME ASKIN ' YOU WHY WE 'RE OUT HERE ? HISTORICALLY , CEMETERIES ARE THOUGHT TO BE A HAVEN FOR VAMPIRES , AS ARE CASTLES , CATACOMBS AND SWAMPS . BUT , UNFORTUNATELY , YOU DON 'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE . WE USED TO HAVE SWAMPS , ONLY THE E.P.A. MADE US TAKE TO CALLIN ' ' EM WETLANDS . YEAH , SO WE 'RE OUT HERE LOOKING FOR ANY SIGNS OF VAMPIRIC ACTIVITY . - WHICH WOULD BE LIKE , UH- - - BROKEN OR SHIFTED TOMBSTONES . THE ABSENCE OF BIRDS SINGING . THERE YOU GO . 'CAUSE I AIN 'T- - I AIN 'T HEARIN' ANY BIRDS SINGIN ' . RIGHT ? 'COURSE , IT 'S WINTER , AND WE AIN 'T GOT NO BIRDS , BUT- - IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE ? A FAINT GROANING COMING FROM UNDER THE EARTH , THE SOUND OF MANDICATION , OF THE CREATURE EATING ITS OWN DEATH SHROUD . [ Rain Falling ] NO . NO MANI- - MAN- - MAN- - MANDICATION . MANDICATION , NO . SHERIFF , I-I KNOW MY METHODS MAY SEEM A LITTLE ODD TO YOU , BUT- - LOOK , Y 'ALL WORK FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . THAT 'S ALL I NEED TO KNOW . I MEAN , C.I.A. , SECRET SERVICE . Y 'ALL RUN THE SHOW , SO- - IT 'S JUST THAT MY GUT INSTINCT TELLS ME THAT THE KILLER WILL VISIT THIS PLACE , THAT IT MAY WELL HOLD SOME FASCINATION , SOME KIND OF SIREN CALL FOR HIM . YOU KNOW ? [ Horn Honking ] HOWDY , SHERIFF ! - OH , HEY , RONNIE . HOW 'S IT GOIN ' ? - CAN 'T COMPLAIN . WELL , ALL RIGHT , THEN . MAYBE AFTER NIGHTFALL , SHERIFF , BUT HE 'LL COME . OH , HE 'LL COME . [ Mulder ] SO WE STAKED OUT THE CEMETERY . [ Animal Howling ] MULDER . SHOELACES ? HMM ? ON THE CORPSE . YOU WERE GONNA TELL ME WHAT WAS SO MEANINGFUL ABOUT FINDING UNTIED SHOELACES . I 'M GETTIN ' TO IT . SUNFLOWER SEED ? SORRY . NO , THANKS . DO YOU MIND- - DO YOU MIND ME ASKIN ' YOU WHAT YOU WERE- - HISTORICALLY , CERTAIN TYPES OF SEEDS ARE THOUGHT TO FASCINATE VAMPIRES . CHIEFLY OATS AND MILLET , BUT , YOU KNOW , YOU GOTTA MAKE DO WITH WHAT YOU HAVE . REMEMBER WHEN I SAID BEFORE THAT WE DIDN 'T KNOW WHAT TYPE OF VAMPIRE WE WERE LOOKING FOR ? YEAH . ODDLY ENOUGH , THERE SEEMS TO BE ONE OBSCURE FACT ... WHICH , IN ALL THE STORIES TOLD BY THE DIFFERENT CULTURES , IS EXACTLY THE SAME , AND THAT 'S THAT VAMPIRES ARE REALLY , REALLY OBSESSIVE / COMPULSIVE . HUH . YOU TOSS A HANDFUL OF SEEDS , NO MATTER WHAT HE 'S DOING , HE 'S GOTTA STOP AND PICK IT UP . IF HE SEES A KNOTTED ROPE , HE 'S GOTTA UNTIE IT . IT 'S IN HIS NATURE . THAT 'S WHY I 'M GUESSING OUR VICTIM 'S SHOELACES WERE UNTIED . YEAH . OBSESSIVE . LIKE RAIN MAN . WHEN THAT OLD BOY DROPPED MATCHSTICKS , HE HAD TO PICK ' EM ALL UP . SAME THING , RIGHT ? WELL , HE DIDN 'T ACTUALLY PICK ' EM UP . HE COUNTED THEM . OH , YEAH ! HE DIDN 'T HAVE TO PICK THEM UP . 247 . OFF THE TOP OF HIS HEAD . IF HE PICKED THEM UP , HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A VAMPIRE . YEAH . I TELL YOU WHAT . I KNOW I 'M IN LAW ENFORCEMENT , BUT I 'D LIKE TO TAKE HIM TO VEGAS MYSELF . AM I RIGHT ? WELL , THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL , RIGHT ? - HE WAS LIKE A LITTLE CALCULATOR . - YEAH . [ Woman On Radio ] YOU GOT YOUR RADIO ON ? EXCUSE ME . HEY , CHARLENE . WHAT 'S UP ? I JUST GOT A CALL FROM THE R.V. PARK . THEY GOT SOMETHING OF A SITUATION THERE . SOUNDS LIKE YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A LOOK . [ Engine Starts ] HEY AGAIN , SHERIFF . HEY AGAIN , RONNIE . [ Ronnie ] I GUESS YOU GOT YOURSELF A RUNAWAY , HUH ? [ Hartwell ] YEAH , RONNIE . I GUESS WE DO . WHAT DO YOU THINK ? WE OUGHT TO SHOOT THE TIRES OUT ? [ Mulder ] ANYWAY , SKIPPING AHEAD- - WHY SKIP AHEAD ? WHAT HAPPENED THEN ? MULDER ? YOU SHOT OUT THE TIRES . AND WHAT THEN ? [ Mulder ] OKAY , HERE 'S SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT KNOW . SHOOTING OUT THE TIRES ON A RUNAWAY R.V. IS A LOT HARDER THAN IT LOOKS . I THEN TRIED A DIFFERENT APPROACH . WHOA ! HEY ! HEY , HEY ! WHOA ! - HELP ! WHOA ! - COME ON , BIRD-DOG IT ! THATAWAY ! [ Screaming ] - OH ! - [ Groaning ] SHEE , OW . HOW YOU DOIN ' THERE ? ALL RIGHT THERE ? [ Engine Sputtering ] [ Mulder ] FINALLY , WE PREVAILED . THAT 'S THE SAME AS THE OTHERS . RIGHT DOWN TO THE SHOES . [ Mulder ] WE INTERVIEWED EVERYONE PRESENT . NO ONE HAD SEEN ANYTHING . TIRED , FRUSTRATED AND LACKING A SOLID LEAD , [ Bed Vibrating ] I JUST WANTED TO GET CLEANED UP . I HAD THE SHERIFF DROP ME AT THE MOTEL , WHICH IS WHERE I RAN INTO YOU . [ Shouting ] WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU WANT ME TO DO ANOTHER AUTOPSY ? WHY DO I HAVE TO DO IT NOW ? I SPENT HOURS ON MY FEET DOING AN AUTOPSY , ALL FOR YOU ! I DO IT ALL FOR YOU , MULDER ! I HAVEN 'T EATEN SINCE 6 : 00 THIS MORNING , AND THAT WAS WAS HALF A CREAM CHEESE BAGEL . IT WASN 'T EVEN REAL CREAM CHEESE , IT WAS LIGHT CREAM CHEESE ! NOW YOU WANT ME TO RUN OFF AND DO ANOTHER AUTOPSY ? WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU ? [ Mulder ] FINALLY , YOU LEFT . [ Scully ] DON 'T YOU TOUCH THAT BED ! [ Door Slams ] [ Bed Continues Vibrating ] [ Knocking On Door , Door Opening ] [ Ronnie ] HELLO ? HELLO ! OH , HEY AGAIN . THE LADY OUTSIDE- - SHE SAID THAT , UH , YOU 'D PAY FOR THIS . SHE ORDERED A PIZZA FROM YOU ? EXCELLENT . HOW MUCH ? 12.98 . I 'LL GET MY WALLET . - HOW MUCH ? - IT 'S 12.98 . - OKAY , HERE 'S 13 . - OKAY , THEN . ENJOY . [ Door Closes ] AH , SCULLY .

[ Grunts ] [ Mulder ] THEN I WAS OUT COLD . I DON 'T KNOW FOR HOW LONG , BUT WHEN I FINALLY CAME TO- - [ Hissing ] [ Scully ] MULDER ? [ Gun Cocks ] [ Growls ] YOU 'RE SAYING THAT I ACTUALLY HIT HIM TWO TIMES ? SQUARE IN THE CHEST . NO EFFECT . AND THEN HE SORT OF FLEW AT ME LIKE A FLYING SQUIRREL . WELL , I DON 'T THINK I 'LL USE THE PHRASE ... " FLYING SQUIRREL " WHEN I TALK TO SKINNER , BUT , YEAH , THAT 'S WHAT HAPPENED . [ Mulder ] YOU CHECKED ON ME , THEN LEFT TO PURSUE RONNIE STRICKLAND INTO THE WOODS . ONCE I RECOVERED , I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO . HELP ME ! HELP ! I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM , CHASED HIM OVER HILL AND DALE . AND IN THE END- - [ Shouts ] MULDER , IT 'S NOT JUST ME . NOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WILL EVER BELIEVE THAT STORY . THEY 'LL HAVE TO , ONCE THEY EXAMINE RONNIE STRICKLAND 'S BODY . [ Sighs ] " CASE 0026198 . RONALD LaVELLE STRICKLAND . " PROBABLE CAUSE OF DEATH- - GEE , THAT 'S A TOUGH ONE .

IT COULDN 'T HURT . JUST STOP IT . SCULLY ? MULDER ? I WAS DRUGGED ! [ Sighs ] I WANT YOU BACK IN TEXAS . RONNIE STRICKLAND 'S BODY HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE MORGUE . APPARENTLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS , A CORONER 'S BEEN ATTACKED . HIS THROAT WAS BITTEN . THE CORONER 'S DEAD ? NO , HIS THROAT WAS BITTEN . HE WAS SORT OF ... GNAWED ON . DAYLIGHT 'S BURNING , AGENTS . [ Door Closes ] WELL- - HE WAS DEAD . I NOTICED THAT . WITH A STAKE THROUGH HIS HEART . I NOTICED THAT TOO . SO WE SHOULD FIND RONNIE OUT HERE BECAUSE ? BECAUSE TRADITION STATES THAT A VAMPIRE NEEDS TO SLEEP IN HIS NATIVE SOIL . OH . YEAH . BUT , MULDER , HE HAD FAKE FANGS . WHY WOULD A REAL VAMPIRE NEED FAKE FANGS ? I MEAN , FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT . NO , FANGS ARE VERY RARELY MENTIONED IN THE FOLKLORE . REAL VAMPIRES AREN 'T THOUGHT TO HAVE THEM . IT 'S MORE AN INVENTION OF BRAM STOKER 'S . YOU WERE RIGHT BEFORE WHEN YOU SAID THAT THIS IS A GUY WHO 'S WATCHED TOO MANY DRACULA MOVIES . HE JUST HAPPENS TO BE A REAL VAMPIRE . [ Sighs ] WELL , SO WHERE THE HELL IS HE ? WHAT ABOUT HIS FAMILY , THE ONES WHO WERE GONNA SUE US FOR 446 MILLION ? WELL , AN AUNT AND AN UNCLE . THEIR MAIL COMES GENERAL DELIVERY TO A LOCAL POST OFFICE . NO HOME ADDRESS ?

I REALLY NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU ABOUT RONNIE . HE MAKES US ALL LOOK BAD . UH- - HE 'S JUST NOT WHO WE ARE ANYMORE . I MEAN , WE PAY TAXES , WE 'RE GOOD NEIGHBORS .

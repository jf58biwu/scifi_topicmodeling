Basement , research . I need a piece on disasters . I take it that Mother Nature will not cooperate , the next best thing is to take my readers a blast through the past : " Disasters through history .

For emergencies only ... Try to leave my desk as you found it . DISASTERS , 20th CENTURY " What causes one disaster to become part of our collective consciousness , while another fade into history ? Maybe some author our attention because they remind us of the power of Mother Nature over Man 's technology . Others because they shows us how inheritantly flawed our most advanced technology can be . There 're still others because they reveal ... " Crap . This is crap . What the hell ... Hello ? - It 's Tom Merrick . - I hope this 's an emergency . - Could someone have altered your data ? - No way ! I have double firewalled and keep built case guessing ! - What is it about , though ? - Mau ! Where do you get these pictures from ? All images are from our , Smithsonian Institute and the Library of Congress archives - There has to be a mistake . - If there is it is not on my computer . Can not it wait until tomorrow ? I must ... Whatever it is Merrick , it can wait until tomorrow . Larry King and Heating Pad waiting for me at home . Just take a look . Titanic , the Hindenburg fire , Hurricane Hugo . I hope for your sake you have more than a history lesson here . Take a closer look . Do you still want to catch Larry King ? - What is this ? - A guy shows at three disasters , a perhaps across nearly a hundred years without aging a day . Now , is it someone trying a hoax on us , or is this the most incredible DNA fluke in human history . - Or is he not human . - Come on Eleaner . It 's just us two here . And we are showing our theories . I don 't know what you found Merrik , but this is absolutely amazing . Exactly what the Inquisitor needs . We get to scoop the globe . - I want 1000 words from you . - I have no idea what this is all about . We don 't know even the images are authentic . That 's why you are flying to D.C. tonight .

I was looking for a nine to five job . Remember ? No competitions . No stress . And make sure we will be running the story day after tomorrow . - If there 's a story . - If ? Why the hell did you come up here if you don 't think there 's a story ? Come on Merrik ! Admit . You blood supply is full of adrenaline . - You 've never felt this good in a long time . - There has to be a reasonable explanation . Find ! The way to fine it is to be on that flight .

Bad things happen to people all the time , but they do not just draw back and give up . This time get yourself a life . As life you and Steve given Kevin in Atlantic City ? - I don 't think you 're in any position to give an opinion about that . - Motel theme parks ? Okay it 's Casinos . - What is it going to do to our son ? - Stop it , Tom . You can not only tolerate the fact that Steve being in Kevin 's life . You know , Steve does things with Kevin . He got us tickets to the final of the hockey championship at Cops Collosium . - Buying half ticket for a kid doesn 't make him father of the year . - No , it does not , Tom . But when Steve do anything with Kevin , he makes more of a father than you . - Are you a photographer ? - Passengers ! Please fasten your seat belts . No , reporter . So , like a news paper ?

Thanks ! - Sir , please take your seat . - Just a second . YOU ARE HERE ... . TITANIC ! EVANSTON POWER PLANT 12 DEAD HINDENBURG explosion 33 DEAD ! DEPARTURE 222 - 15 JUNE Please Sir ! Take your seat now . Isn 't today 15th ? What flight number is this ? Flight 222 . COLLISION IN MID AIR 307 DEAD 16th June ... That 's tomorrow . CHICAGO GREEN LINE DAYTIME SUBWAY CRASH Give me that . No one needs to get hurt . Drop the gun . What the hell is gonna happen with this plane ? Land it ! Calm down , then we 're gonna discuss it . Bring it down now ! Or else all will be dead . Let 's go . We got problems . No radar or communications . We got a bigger problem . He 's not gonna hurt anybody . He just wants us to land , that 's right , isn 't it ? The two nearest airports are Grand Rapid and O 'Hare . Your call . - Which one is the closest ? - O 'Hare may be five minutes . Do it . Going down to 10,000 feet , heading 2-9-0 by 6-2-0 . - Wait ! - We will take it down , like you wanted . You got no radar , no radio . - What would you do , if I weren 't here ? - I don 't understand . If you didn 't have a gun pointed at your head , would you continue to D.C ? No . No , it is considered an emergency . Code one emergency . We 'd land at the nearest strip . - Which is ... . which is you 're doing anyway ! - Yeah ! - Bring her up . - I thought you wanted us to land ? Bring her up now ! There ! Pull her up . Pull her up hard ! - We 've lost hydraulics . - Switch to manual . Both sides . We 're on manual . 7000 feet . 6700 feet . - Damn it ! - 6400 feet . 27 seconds to impact . - Come on ! Come on ! - 6000 feet . 22 seconds to impact . 5700 feet . Get her up , get her up . - 5500 feet . - I got her ! I got her ! We 're levelling at 5500 feet . Are you alright ? Hadn 't we taken her up , we 'd all be dead . How did you know ? I won 't be needing this any more . They are waiting for you . There was no way that guy wasn 't on the plane . I saw him , the little girl next to me saw him , the flight-attendant saw him . Let 's not worry about this alleged gentleman for a while and concentrate on you . You see Mr. Merrik , you had the gun . You commandeered flight 222 . Now in my experience , hijackers rarely work alone . I am NOT a hijacker . The plane was going down , and ... - Why don 't you tell us who else was involved ? - No one ! The last thing I wanted to do was even get on in that plane . Believe me ! Believe you ? Believe you ? Mister I believe in looking directly into a man 's eyes and seeing the truth . Right now as I look into yours truth is nowhere inside . Sorry . Ask the pilot . He 'll tell you ! As we speak , the agents are interviewing the all flight personnel and passengers , - - And I have a forensic crew sweeping the plane . Good ! Then you 'll find this brochure . The itinerary you supposedly saw inspired you to pull out your gun ? For the millionth time , it wasn 't MY gun . It was his . The guy with the brochure , the guy we couldn 't fine the guy that does 't show up on the flight manifest He was not even on the damn plane when it landed ? While you 're sawing holes in my story - - There 's a guy out there with a list of disasters . The subway is next ... . I think . Something 's going to happen to it . So now you have designs on a subway ? I need to use a phone . I get a call , right ? Stanton , why don 't you bring Mr. Merrik , a phone ? Check with weapons department . Check Merrick through national BCI . Stanton , what exactly is that thing ? The digital recorder built into my watch . I made it . You 're sure that you want field work son ? Perhaps you should 've stayed in MIT . Nothing wrong with being an engineer . I 've always wanted to be in the Beurau . I mean ... . I can switch to a corner ... I can be an agent and still have time to fiddle around with things like this . - Mind if I get you a watch ... - Forget the watch . Concentrate on this here . Remember ? Please , just find Grayson for me ? It 's an emergency . Wait , wait ... Transfer me to Research . Sir ! What Merrick did ... . It doesn 't make any sense . OK . Follow that line of thought ... Well .. the guy hijacks a plane , doesn 't ask for any money , doesn 't make any demands whatsoever ... So ? What does that tell you ? Think . Get a shrink down here . To see if Mr. Merrick is always honest . That 's marvellous . That 's marvellous - Research .. - It 's Tom Merrick ! I need a favour ! You left my office in a complete mess , you hung up on me the last time we spoke , and now you want a ... I found something in your system . Yeah ! That 's the point of using it ... right ? I do not understand it all yet , but it may be something big . Oh ! Please Merrik ! This isn 't going to be one of the stories of the century 's history ? Do you have any idea how many reportes have dropped that stuff , in my life ? Any of them come in the aeroplane , forces it to land and get arrested by FBI ? Yeah , right ! I 'm getting out of here . Wait , wait , wait ! There is a file in your system . Merrick doc.doc I dropped three photos in to it . I need you to make hard copies of each of them and and bring them down to me at the FBI office . I do not have time to be a delivery woman . Look , Merrik ! I would like to help , but ... - Listen to me ! You are a researcher ! So I hope that you 're genetically curious ! Pull the file . Have a look at it yourself . You won 't be disappointed . Merrick doc.doc I 'm counting on you . Story of the century , my ass . " Titanic " , " Hindenburg " ... Wow ... ! - What does he want anyway ? - At the end of the day ... . What happened to Baker ? What 's going on here ? Where are we going ? Who the hell are you guys ? Not now . Emergency Medical Team to 348 on the double quick . Put security on alert . Seal off the building . Merrick has escaped . Freeze ! Drop the gun ! Drop it ! Drop it ! Now ! Against the wall . No ! Our orders was to stop him . If we kill Merrick , it violates the phenomenon on negative law ! Get out of the way ! Move ! Get out of the way ! - Let 's go ! - What 's that ? Freeze ! - Are you going to kill yourself ? - Come on . Let 's go ! - Come on ! Let 's go ! - He was going to shoot us ! Come ! Further ! Surveillance displays Merrik 's had at least two assistants : A woman of 160cm tall , black hair . Black jacket . And a man ... Stay where you are ! Get down ! What the hell was that ? It would be a Glock 17L with ballistic modificatins for an M 136 . Right ? - Certainly , unheard ... . - That 's enough ! We got two males and two females with us - - Running eastwards along the Fedaral building . They are armed and dangerous . Move in ! Move in ! Why are we runing ? Why am I runing ? What 's going on ? - What are you doing ? - It 's the siren . They 're cops . They are coming ! - If they are cops , they will straight shoot us ! - What ? Here ! Attention Please ! The train leaves from track on level 1 ... What have you got me into ? What ... ? Ah ! ... The captain confirms Merricks statement ! We shall contact Grifasi . Where the hell are they ? You guys spread out . Cover the exits . I don 't want any of them to get out of here . Alright ! Listen ! If passengers saw Merrick 's guy on the plane , we should be able to get a sketch of him on the wire . Let 's also get the sketches of the two freed Merrick . What 's going on ? - All I know for sure is that the guy on the photos was on my flight . - What ? He was there . And he had a brochure ... of disasters . And it doesn 't make any sense . No ! The flight we were in was in the brochure . My plane was gonna crash . That 's why you were arrested . You hijacked plane all before crashing . Great ! So that it makes me an accomplice to a hijacker . So ! Who was the guy in the plane with the brochure ? Merrick and him working on the insides , the two goons and woman running with Merrik on the out . But now at least we got positive ID on her . The call we allowed Merrick to passed through to ... an Elizabeth Wintern . She 's a match with the woman he just works with . So Merrik ! Whatever all this is about ... What are we supposed to do about it ? The brochure he had was about past disasters . There 's one that hasn 't happened yet . A Subway wreck . Right here ! On the green line at noon today . - Wait a little ... . I told the FBI , but they wouldn 't believe me . - Well ... I can imagine why .. Just one thing that 's little odd . The captain on the flight confirms what Merricks says . That Merrick prevented a mid-air collision ? So that he 's not a hijacker . Merrick pulled the gun . He and the other guy probably tried to hijack it ... but got cold feet . And the story now ... The three big questions : How did Merrick know to prevent mid-air collision ? How did the guy with him get out of the plane , and passed the security ... . and why ? Why is Merrik run away from the people who freed him ? - I do not know , sir . - I don 't know either .. we 'll damn well find out . Wait until we process the signal ! What 's wrong with it ? I don 't know . He is in a shielded containment-bunker . Now we shouldn 't have affected communication . Grifasi ... if you can read me ... have them charge up this place . We need a reset . We can 't reset you ! We have serious problems here that takes time to address ! - What is he saying ? - This chaotic stuff is a major deviation ! - If that 's not bad enough , I got the time the police after me . - Having trouble in getting him . Find the bastard and eleminate him ! If he keeps on saving more lives - It will be a question why do you come back ! Kiss my ass ! Stop , Cortez . We can not afford any unspecified casualties . There won 't be any unspecified ones . We have to stop it before something happens . We have twenty minutes . Let 's go ! Hold it for a sec ! You even don 't know if something 's gonna happen . Or even if it did , how 'd you know which train is going to crash ? No , I don 't know . But if we don 't get every train on that line stopped , one 's gonna be history . It 's clear . Away ! Move away ! Find a security guard , anyone and say that there is a bomb and they need to stop all trains . - What 're you gonna do ? - I 'm going to find a way to kill the power and ... And then what ? What is it ? It 's him ! It is this train . We got to get out of here . Come ! - How many stations are on this line ? - There 're six . The last is Hill Horn . Why ? This is Baker . I need security units set up in Subway stops ... - between Union and Hill Horn immediately - Let 's get some cars . Merrick , this train is not stopping . There he is ... - I do not know how you got photos you found , but it 's Thrill Seeker 's fault . Not mine . - Thrill Seekers ? What 's gonna happen to this train ? I won 't tell ... that 's part of the agreement . This is Murray Trevor requesting an emergency reset now ! What are you doing ? I need that to get off the train and I need it to get home ! - How is this train gonna crash ? - Ok ! The engine driver had a heart attack . When he died he was holding the deadman 's switch . So the train kept on accelerating . After Clayton it couldn 't hold on to the tracks on the curve . - He speaks as if it HAS already happened . - It did ! About 70 years ago . I 'm a tourist . The flight you were in was supposed to be the worst mid-air collisionin US history . Because of you nothing ! Zero perished ! I need to get a refund . - Insane . Let 's stop the train . - No ! You can 't do that . Just ... Just give me that . - Do you travel to disasters ? - Disasters , sporting events ... - It 's only a few minutes left . - Let 's go ! Wait ... wait ... It 's against rules to intervene . Please give me back my RTT ! Please ! You do not understand ! I need it ! Please Open up ! Open up ! It 's an emergency ! Open up ! It is Whittier . Three stops to Clayton . We have maybe two more minutes . Open up ! Open up ! - He can 't hear you . He is dead ! - The emergency brake . Damn . - Maybe we can separate this coach from the others . - No ! We don 't know how to do that . Everyone ! This train 's gonna crash ! Move into the rear coach now ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Please ! Give me back my RTT ! Move ! Move ! Down the rearmost coach ! Train 's gonna crash ! It is the last chance , come on ! I can 't wait for you . - What should we do ? - I do not know . Look around ! This is it . One on each side . Both at same time . Come on , jump ! Come on ! Jump ! What now ? Come on ! Move back ! Train 's gonna crash ! Move back , everybody . Keep moving . Get on the floor now . Get down ! Hey ! Thanks . - Is this your place ? - My folks ' . Dad 's out . Dad always said you can never have too many types of tools . Do you surely know what you 're doing ? Yeah ! I once saw him use it when I was around three . It looked so easy ... kidding . Hold the stretcher . - Sure , we have a match . - Get him out of here . - Oh ! Surprise me . - We talked to the passengers . Merrick and Wintern were on this train , but they are not . - Any luck at Union ? - The other two also escaped as well . Oh ! Great ! It 's great ! Okay , listen up folks ! I wanna run search on Merrick , Wintern and the two unidentified purverts . Check all hospitals , motels , hotels within 50 miles radius . You know the drill . I wanna check anyone driving , walking or riding a horse . You know what they look like . Right now ! Results ! Do it ! Go ! - I 'm not getting a contact . - You shouldn 't have stopped me from shooting him the first time ... - They were not our orders . - That train would have gone down . We were supposed to interrogate Merrick , determine the point of deviation and reset . We didn 't interrogate him , and thanks to you he 's still walking . Don 't let this on me . The man has figured out . He knows . ... this kept the death toll now standing at two . ... . of course it could have easily been in the hundreds . It is the first subway crash in the city has eperienced in 20 years . Transportation authorities now speculating whether it is operator error or ... - Right from the dryer . - Thanks . I have trying to put the pieces together ... In the plane ... That brochure I saw ... In this Evanston Power Plant fire ... . It stated that 12 people died . There was only 11 dead . Who is the 12th ? - Me . - What ? The tourist guy travels to disasters . And Power Plant fire was one of his stops . That 's right . His coin was there . The one he had on the train . He must have dropped it , and when I saw it ... I hesitated . I mean ... long enough to change things forever . Because if I hadn 't stopped when I saw it I would have been killed along with my crew . - You can 't know that for sure . - It makes sense . I am alive because that tourist from the future ... dropped the coin . The two Freaks ... . they are from the future too . They are to stop me before I alter the past . This is nuts . Okay ? The guy from the train was nuts . But if some future scientist were to develop technology for people to travel through time - - Do you really think this is what they use it for ? To tourism ? For entertainment ? If what you 're saying is true , they 're not coming back to see some TV image gets blown to bits . They are coming to see thousands of real live people die ... . - It 's sick . - I don 't see how it is any worse than tuning into 6'O clock news ... Or reporting . - Hey ! There 's no comparrison between you and them . - Isn 't there ? I 've watched some of your news segments ... Occasionally ... Sometimes I got carried away . Remember the time you drew right up to that tornado ? That was quite a piece , wasn 't it ? Thank you for purchasing Thrill Seekers ' ten pack ! Your best value at temporal travel entertainment ! Your 10 pack covers some of most famous disasters in the history ... - What did you do ? - I do not know . Starting from April 14 , 1912 , sinking of the " Titanic " - and the December 24 , 1998 the catastrophic fire at the Evanston Power Plant . And of course the big three . That 's right . Those legendary 3 days in June when you get back to back , to back a plane crash , - - A train wreck and the grand daddy of all disasters ... The Copps Coliseum fire ... . that killed more than 11,000 people ... It 's tomorrow ! When you 're ready to begin your first trip just use remote temporal transmitter with the built in isometric frequency blocker that guarantees you from the time police detection . Within seconds we rescue you to the start of another adventure ... - He 's there . At Copps Coliseum . - Who ? My son . - Hello ? - Kevin , I need to talk to your mother ! - She 's not here . Christie 's here . - Okay ! I need you to listen very carefully . I can 't explain how I know this ! But tomorrow during the hockey game , there 's gonna be a fire . - You , your mother and Steve cannot be there . - I don 't understand ! I 'll explain later . Just promise me you won 't go to the game . - No ! I wanna go ! - Kevin , this is one time you gotta trust me . Promise me you won 't go ! Talk to me , Kevin . - Mom said you might get jealous , because I 'm doing stuff with Steve . - No , it is not that , believe me ... I guess that he didn 't believe you ? - I have to get there . I 'm gotta stop them from going . - Okay ! Maybe there 's something else we can try . You suggested a bomb threat somewhere ! We can try that at Copps Coliseum . No ! There are situations like that all the time . When the security sweeps and when they don 't find anything , the game goes on as planned . We can give the deivce you took from time traveller . That will get their attention . Maybe ! But by the time you explain what the hell it is , the Coliseum will all be in history . No ! This is an emergency ! The FBI would be able to move in pretty quickly . No matter what FBI comes up with those two people will destroy the arena . They need those 11,000 people dead . Maybe we can slow them down . Wintern got parents in The Heights , couple of friends in Eastburn And one ex-boyfriend on the Gold Coast . Put him through . It is Patterson from the office . It 's Merrick . Line 2 . I didn 't cause the subway wreck . I tried to stop it from crashing . Then why not turn yourself in ? The man and woman who grab me from your office they tried to stop me from saving it . Now they wanna take down Copps Coliseum tomorrow during the hockey championship . You got to stop them . I 'll tell you what ! Why don 't you come down here and work with me to identify who these two are ... Thank you . We got it . It 's her parents ' place . The sketches I ordered of those two that helped Merrick to escape , I want them to be delivered along with the photos of Merrick and Wintern to the Copps Coliseum security . Tell them to get extra police and fire managers , just a precaution . Do you believe it that those two are looking for Copps ? I do not believe a damn thing he says . But I do believe in covering all the bases . - Should I call off the search Sir ? - I don 't know . Maybe he 's just trying to put us off . Oh ! You gotta be kidding ? I should be there in three hours if I fly . You are suspected hijacker . If you go near an airport , cops will be all over you . Don 't worry . It is old , But it can get us there . If we take turns at driving even if we stay away major highways - - We 'll get to Copps Coliseum in 15 hours . Well before the game . I already emailed my mom . I told her that we 're taking the car . So ... well ... Let 's get out of here ! - Finally getting him . - How could you let this happen ? What the hell is going on ? - Grafasi looks different . - Looks like there 's some leakage ... Do you have any idea what you 've done ? By not stopping Merrick , nearly 500 people lived , who were supposed to die . So ? Time-shift police again zeored on your organisation again ? Just give up the hatch money and ... - Do you think that we 're dealing with some law enforcement issue - What else is there ? Just a few little problems like population shifts in the hundreds of millions , - plus new governments and technology popping up and disappearing , you 've never even heard of . - What happening in L.A. ? - Who cares about L.A. ? My kid lives in L.A. Southern California was wiped out in a fusion melt down 22 years ago . What ? I have to get back to my time . You have to get us a reset now ! You still don 't get it ! Do you ? Your timeline does not exist any more . Do you understand ? Your family , your friends are all gone . And temporal accelerator ... that 's right ... The core technology of Stanza-displacement ... Somebody Merrick saved one on that plane killed its inventor - In an automobile accident three years before he invented it . So right now we can 't reset anybody anywhere . But Sir you 're in a containment bunker . So the accelerator should be shileded against any timeline deviations . We never had deviations of this magnitude before . It 's blown all over like fish out of water . Have we got a team working on it ? A team ? Get the whole dame conglomorate on this . I have to get a reset and save my son . Listen Cortez ! I have bigger problems here than worrying about your progedy ! If we are lucky , I repeat if we are lucky , we might have a working model within a week . - Then you can reset us ? - We can stop Merrik before he gets on that plane . That 's the plan . But nothing 's gonna happen unless we get a stable temporal zone . That means that you two have to make it damn sure that Merrick doesn 't cause any more deviations from the current timeline , or it 's over for all of us . How do we find Merrik now ? He 's got client 's RTT . He doesn 't know that it gives us the track of him . - I transmit his coordinates.Standby. - Standby for downstream ... download ? - We have them . - Good . Now ... whether you get Merrick or not we need to get some insurance . Insurancce ? The last of the big three disasters ... The fire at Copps Coliseum ... . No matter what Merrick does ... make sure it comes down ... . - You gotta be kidding ? - Fire or no fire ... - 11,369 people need to die ! It 's our only chance . Sir , with all due respect , I am a temporal security agent , not a murderer . Consider it done ! - Hey ! Wait a minute . - Lets pull this up , Sabbar or I 'll kill you . - I 'm the least of your worries , Cortez . - What the hell are you talking about ? You saw Grifasi . We got a temporal containment leak . Few more deviations , Grifasi and the whole organisation will not know even we exist . Merrick , if this is all true may be we shouldn 't interfere . - Then 11,000 people will die . - I know , I know ! But it 's just that , the guy from the photos , warned us about interfering . The two who are after are gonna kill or risk being killed to stop us . What if somebody we save goes on to cause something so terrible to happen which is much worse than Copps Coliseum coming down . I don 't see it that way . If those three people are from the future - - Then yes ! Their past is set . that 's gone down on one way . But our future can go on infinite number of ways . Any one of which may be a whole lot better than the world they are from . Or a whole lot worse . You 're right . But all what we can do is act on what we do know . And knowing that 11,000 people are going to die , including my son , - - I 'm ready to do whatever I can do to save them . With this speed we should be able intercept Merrick in about five minutes . Round up this area for any neighbors who may have seen traffic coming in and out of here . Look for some security cameras , whatever . Sir , I found this and an e-mail . She had attempted to trash the mail . - I just ran a digital decompiler ... - Just get to the point . - She borrowed her mother 's car . They 're heading to the Copps Coliseum . - Damn ! This is Baker . We 're doubly heading for Copps . That 's right ! Cancel the local search . Put everything there . Let 's go ! Merrick , can I ask you a question now ? Only if you keep calling me Tom . Ah ! I got this feeling earlier as if you and your son aren 't that close . I was just wondering what reall happened ? After the plant fire , I ... . shut down ... from work , the world , everyone ... You can 't just drop out of a kid 's life , and expect walk back when you 're ready . You must really miss him . Do you miss his mom , too ? From day one I married I lost out to my job , till the jolt I got from covering disasters . Were you that turned on ? Until I got those men killed . That was when I crawled into my cave and disappeared . Now that you 're out of hybernation , what do you think ? I like some parts of it . Maybe we should stop for gas . He stopped . Just ahead . Time to put him out of our misery . - Fill her up . - Check the oil and tires ? - That would be great . I 'll handle this . - Son of a bi ... . - Why are you trying to kill me ? Did you ever stop to think about the consequences of what you 're doing ? May be my son is dead , because you decided to stop the plane from crashing . Oh my god ! Come and help me ! - How long till we 're there ? - I don 't know . I said how long ? May be 50 minutes . It 's okay , it 's okay . Stay there . Just stay there . It 's alright . The ambulance is here . It 's alright . No ! Elizabeth ! There 's nothing you can do for her . Hey , what do you think you 're doing ? That 's my truck ! Officer ! Park it for me . Will you ? Looks like local boys took our warning hard . What are you doing now ? Setting for local time . Working on creating one with few more changes , resets ... - Resets to whatever time zone you 're in . - I eagerly await . I eagerly await . Ladies and gentlemen , we have a full house ! 16347 spectators to watch the game . Good day , I 'm Baker . I don 't know if it really going to happen , but for safety 's sake ... - Ladies and gentlemen ! - Awsome ! Welcome to Copps Coliseum ! Here is tonight 's schedule . We got fire ! Fire ! Cortez , Merrick 's dead . The fire which is supposed to bring this place down will still work , so we don 't need to kill anybody . Listen to me ! It is one thing is to defend an existing timeline . An other thing entirely , to purposedly invoke a disaster . Have you listened to a word I 've said ? Do you feel any responsibility ? What kind of a person are you ? Kind that 'll do anything , anything , to stabilize this timeline , long enough to get a reset and save my son . You understand ? - You don 't give a damn about any of them . Do you ? - To the extent that they don 't screw our timeline . - Yeah ! They 're people . - They are dust ! If you 're so worried about them , why the hell are you here ? Do you think I wanna be doing this ? Working for some two big underground firms ... - that uses the greatest technology ever invented for amusement rights ? - I was a genesist oncee . - You are right . I was with the government temporal development programme , Cortez . Oh ! Lemme guess ! When they shut it down and illegalised time treavelling ... - You were already hooked . I 'm trying to figure . Who is low on your moral scale .. Me , who does it for money , or you , who does it for twist ? The tragedy struck when a series of explosions devastated the arena killing nearly two thirds of the 16,000 spectators . Lord , have mercy on this soul . This is Tom Merrick ! Leave a message at the tone ! Merrik , it is Eleanor ! You 're not handling hijacking charges for the public defender . There 's an old buddy of mine , Irwin Thompson who is now a Defense attorney , he 's agreed to represent you during Tuesday calling . I 'll send you the details . Good job with the Copps Coliseum ! The stable temporal zone you created works ! We 'll be ready in a few minutes to reset you . Permanent insertion point 24 hours prior to Merrick getting on that flight . That 'll give us plenty of time to stop him . Just name any of these disasters , and you 'll instantly be transported back in time exactly three hours prior to the disaster you select . One more thing ! Stanza-displacer is still unstable . And each test run is causing more for burn out . Bottom line ... . You only have one round trip ticket . Back to stop Merrick from getting on that plane and redirect our timeline and then back here , to home . We are online now ! Good luck ! Copps Coliseum fire . Now that you have come out of hibernation , what do you think ? - What the hell ? - This is all wrong . You 're alive ! Yes ! Last time I checked . What is wrong with you ? Nothing . We are back at Copps Coliseum three hours earlier . Somebody must have entered an alternate date . - What the hell are you doing ? ! - Connecting with Grifasi . He already said he has no more resets on this timeline ! We have no choice . We have to take Merrick and Copps Coliseum down again . And then wait a week for Grifasi can create a new reset . - Maybe we should stop for gas . - No ! We definitely don 't wanna do that . You 're not one of those guys who refuse to pull over till the car tries to run on steam ? In this case , yeah . We get some near the Coliseum . - What are you doing ? - Those guys who were after us from the train station .. Let 's just say I have a very important hunch - - That this leads them straight to us . This time we 'll get of him out of our misery for good . Where the hell is Merrick ? Hey ! Did you have a 1984 Oldsmobile Cutlass here filling up in last few minutes ? An Oldsmobile Cutlass ? No . You want me to check the oil and tires ? Over here . Damn it ! Hey ! It 's fine . We can save your son . Officer ! Park it for me . Will you ? Looks like local boys took our warning hard . What are you doing now ? Setting for local time . Working on creating one with few more changes , which automatically ... - Automatically resets to whatever time zone you 're in . - I eagerly await . I eagerly await . I 'm Baker . This is Stans . I can 't guarantee that anything 's gonna happen , but thank you for taking my warning seriously ... You can not come in . - I have to get my family . The grandmother is seriously ill . It 's an emergency . - What 's her name ? - Ah ! Lindquist ! A couple more We 'll be ready to go . Lindquist party ! Please report the first-aid station on the main con-course . Thank you . - If you could just point me to the first-aid station ? - Sure ! Absolutely . Alright ! Go out through the door here , straight down the hallway , and when you get to the end ... Open this up ! Open this up ! - Steve ! Could you go and get something to eat ? - They just paged us . It 's an emergency . No . There is no emergency . - I 'm testing . - Hurry ! Hello ? Is this thing working ? Attention ! Attention ! ... - What are you doing here Tom ? - There 's gonna be an explosion . We must get out . Fine ! Last time you said that there gonna be a fire . And this ... . ? Attention ! There 's a bomb in the arena ! I repeat ! There 's a bomb in the arena ! - Please ! Evacuate immediately ! - We must take Kevin . Please try to be calm ! Head to the emergency exits ! Please stay calm ! I repeat ! There 's a bomb in the arena ! Hey ! I 'm out of here . We gotta do this now , before any more of these people get out . Where 's Kevin ? Dad ! I 'm not gonna let you do it this time . You idiot . Put the detonator down , Cortez ! - You have any idea what you 're doing ? - Now ! Merrick ! This way . Jen ! We must try to get out of here ! No moves ! Drop your weapon ! Get away ! - We 're trapped ! - How do we get out ? Stanton ! You are Stanton ! You shouldn 't have invented Stanza-displacer . You shouldn 't have invented ... Stay down on the floor . Merrick ! Put it down ! Damn you ! Put it down ! Put it down ! - If I do that , we all are dead . - I don 't negotiate . Drop it ! Now ! We are trapped . You 've seen what weapon could do . - It 's our only way out of here . - He may be right . Shut up Stanton . Put it down ! now ! My leg ! Everybody out . Now ! Now ! My leg ... Easy . Thank you ! Stanton ! What I said earlier , that you 're not having what it takes for the field work ? Ignore it . But Sir ! I think I 'm gonna take your suggestion and switch to the technical field . ... killing 200 of the 16,000 in attendance ... Kevin ! Mom ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah . How did you know about all this ? It 's a long story . I 'll tell you some day . Thank you . Am I gonna see you soon , Kevin ? - Yeah ! - Sure . Anytime . Look ! I 've got to take care of something . - See you real soon . - Okay ! - Bye . - You can 't stand here , folks . Where are you going ? - Look , Tom ... - Tom . You called me Tom . That 's , that 's good . Tom . It looked like you were staying , and I didn 't wanna interfere . Anyway , I thought ... We at Time Shifters , hope that you enjoyed this rare and informative moment , that combines first three disasters with genuine statle selectors . And now it 's time to take a deep breath and get those camers out ! As we prepare to temporaly reset you to one of most fantastic disasters in the history . Are you ready ?

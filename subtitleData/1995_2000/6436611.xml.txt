 You make man ? No . Woman . Woman ? [ THEME MUSIC ] THEME SONG : Weird Science ! Pictures from a magazine , diagrams and charts , mending broken hearts and making Weird Science . Something like a recipe , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation . My creation . It 's my creation . No heart of gold , just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation . Oh , my creation ! It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hands , why don 't people understand ? It 's alive . Alive ! Spring break ! Look out ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! We 're going to Barcelona . I can 't wait . Spanish babes , spicy food , lots of- - what do you call ? Pachinko . Flamenco . OK . File up . Click on Lisa , and press the magic button . Oh , let me . Let me . Ole . Spring break ! Let me guess- - you 're excited ? We 've been waiting for this all winter . No parents , no homework . Just fun in the sun , and fabulous Barcelona . Ready when you are . Just let me grab my sunblock , and we are out of here . Barcelona , here we come . Ole , ole . Greetings . That 's real mature , Chett , spying on us . Not spying . Observing . And would you like me to share with you what I 've observed ? It seems you two booger bibs have a little toy- - a secret toy . A gorgeous , curvacious toy . A toy with magic powers . A toy I 'd like to get to know better . But first , lunch . Excuse me . All right , Matlock . You figured out our secret . We have a genie . Yep . I knew you were hiding something up there . I didn 't have proof- - until now . Too bad you 'll never remember it . Lis , blank his memory . One mind sweep special coming up . Try not to move around a lot . It makes it easier . Wait . Can I at least ask Lisa a question before my mind is grilled like a cheese sandwich ? OK , but make it short . I was curious- - what 's your power source , technically speaking ? Essentially a cold fusion self generating power pack . Catalytic initiators ? Biologically based . Transmogrification ? Tachion interceptor . Hm . OK , OK . You can read all about it at your local library . Yeah , we got a bullfight to go to . Lis , fry him . What I don 't completely understand is the nature of your imaging center . It didn 't work . Hit him again . If you generate the positron particles within your fusion unit , then yes , I can see how that might be effective . However- - [ BEEPING ] that must be my burrito . Excuse me . Maybe if you crank up the voltage ? I did . He must have developed some kind of brain callous , or maybe he 's figured out a shield against my magic . How ? He can 't even figure out how to get ice from the fridge . There 's something very weird , guys . Mothership ? Contact made . Presence of alien supercomputer Lisa verified . Proceeding to- - no . I 'm making a burrito . Compact nutrient unit consisting of beans and solid milk curd . About 18 grams of fat per serving . Oh . Proceeding to phase two . Unit 6 out . Oh , man . Did you see that ? Chett 's an alien . My brother is an alien . Alien android . Wait . Before we get all crazy , are we sure ? He unscrewed his hand and used it to make a long distance call to outer space . What do you think ? I know , but my dad got one of those football phones for Christmas , and you 'd swear it was real . Just watch the door . I don 't want that thing coming in here . I can 't believe it . He 's going to take me away . No one 's taking you anywhere , Lis . You heard him . Phase two . They 're probably planning on using me for spare parts . Don 't worry . We 'll figure this out . I just thought of something . If there 's a Chett android downstairs making burritos in the kitchen , where 's your brother ? That 's right . They must have taken Chett . See ? There 's some good news in all this . [ SCREAMING ] I 've got more questions . Mm . Want some ? This is very good . Get us out of here ! Good . Put some distance between us and him . Not where I thought we 'd be spending our vacation . It doesn 't make sense . Why is he after me ? What do I have that some alien species could possibly want ? Well , for starters there 's that matador outfit . Were you guys going somewhere without me ? Lisa ! [ LAUGHTER ] That 's the right idea . Keep going ! [ LAUGHTER ] Do another ! OK , you space freak . You asked for it . I think you peaked with the giant foot . Grr . [ WHIMPERING ] He 's still coming ! Get us out of here ! Where the hell are we ? I didn 't want to take any chances . No , you 're right . We should be safe here . Just don 't lick any metal . I don 't know why you continue to run from me . There is nowhere you can go that I cannot follow . Stand back . I think I 've got one last zap in me . No . We 're not gonna run anymore . Wyatt ? You want to suck our brains out of our heads . Fine . But we 're not giving up Lisa without a fight . You misunderstand . I don 't want to hurt you . You don 't ? Then why are you after me ? My mission is simply to observe you on behalf of an alien species , and until my orders change , that is all I 'm gonna do . [ RINGING ] Hold on . Yes ? Very well . Well , my orders have changed . I 'm to abduct Lisa , and then kill you and your friend . [ SCREAMING ] Hello , Steve . Hi , Steve . Whoa ! Sorry ! I 'm sorry ! Are the humans being lifted ? That should be them now . [ SCREAMING ] Welcome back , Unit 6 . You 've done well . These are the chosen subjects ? Yes . There were no problems with the abduction . Skankhead and butt boy are a little panicked , though . You 've spent too much time on the planet , Unit 6 . It 's the human I was built to replicate , sir . His personality is hard to override . Be careful , Unit 6 . Your newly acquired habit of shotgunny brewskis has not gone unnoticed by the high council . If I were you , I 'd watch your back . Yes , sir . Now then , these humans , um- - they all look alike . Which one is the female ? The one with the fun bags , sir . Sorry . That one . [ SCREAMING ] Hello , and welcome aboard my ship . My name 's- - [ SCREAMING ] Happy hats , please ? Hello , and welcome aboard my ship . My name is Steve . Hi , Steve . What 's going on ? Where are we ? And what have you done to them ? The happy hats help to make their abduction experience more pleasant . Well , take them off . Now . What 's going on ? Are you OK , Lis ? That was awesome . Lower that baby back down , my friend . Gary ! No . Why have you brought us here ? We 're searching the universe for life forms of the highest intelligence . Our scanners have scoured your planet and found it to be completely devoid of intellect . Except for you . Oh , yeah ? Well listen up , you big headed alien freak . If you want our minds , you 're going to have to- - As I was saying before I was interrupted by the tiny brain , yours was the only life form on the entire planet with an intellect equal to our own . What are you going to do to me ? If you will cooperate , we are prepared to offer you a tremendous opportunity . And if I don 't ? We 'll part as friends , and then I 'll reduce your planet to a smoldering , demolished piece of rock . You got that , baby ? You hang with us , or it 's blue ball in the corner pocket . Capiche ? Perhaps now would be a good time to purge my memories , sir . OK , I 'll cooperate . On one condition . Return Gary and Wyatt to Earth . They 're the only people I care about . You don 't need them . Very well . As a gesture of friendship and goodwill , they 'll be returned , along with the human called Chett . Oh , Steve ? Lift the tiny brains back to Earth , will you ? Lisa ? Help ! Oh my god . We 're back home . I want my happy hat . Snap out of it , Gar ! We gotta get help . They still have Lisa and Chett up there . [ SCREAMING ] It 's the android ! Get him ! Oh ! Gary ? I think this is the real Chett . That 's it . You 're dead , butt crimp . Yep , it 's him . Chett ? Are you OK ? It was terrible . One minute I 'm making a sandwich , and the next thing I know there 's these bright lights , and I 'm rising out of the kitchen . They did tests , they connected me to machines , they drilled my teeth . And then the probe . I 'm going to stop you there , OK ? Why don 't you just try and repress that next memory ? We need a plan . I 've got a plan . I 'm out of here , throat cheese . We could really use your help . Tell me something I don 't know . The doorknobs are gone . The phone 's dead . These fish are plastic . Something weird is going on . No kidding . Look at this . There 's nothing on this shelf but cookbooks and squirrel figurines . What ? A guy can 't have hobbies ? Holy monkeys . Wyatt , unless Dad just dropped a chunk of change on Central Air , I don 't think this is your room . OK . So , who ordered the Hawaiian Sunrise ? Oh my god . It 's Ted Lange from " The Love Boat . " Hey , So how are you swinging dudes doing ? I thought these drinks might help you relax . What were you doing in my closet ? That 's not important , my man . What is important is that you forget about that ventilation shaft and just kick back and have fun right here . Call me crazy , but I 'm finding it a little hard to kick back when there 's a billion miles of empty space where the front yard used to be . Whoa . You 're not really Ted Lange , are you ? OK . I 'll be straight with you cats . I 'm just a comforting image plucked from your memories to help you stay cool . So , how about a little shopping trip in the Puerto Vallarta ? And which Puerto Vallarto would that be , my man ? The one with the dissection tables and the butt probe ? Thanks , I 've been there , and it was no day at the beach . Let 's blow ! I really don 't think that 's a good idea . Yeah , well neither was the reunion show . See ya . Say hi to Doc . Our scanners have shown you to be a very special being , Lisa . Intelligence , a staggering level of physical attractiveness , much like ourselves . Did your scanners tell you I possess magic power capable of reducing you and this ship to space dust ? Magic ? Your tricks may appear as magic to the tiny brains , but to us your powers are nothing that the Zappermatic couldn 't handle . That thing ? You 're gonna have to do better than a TV remote to replace me . Pretty good . Huh . You see , it 's not your powers we want . It 's you . We 've traveled through many galaxies and seen many candidates , but you , Lisa- - you are the one we 've chosen to be our new queen . A queen ? Like the queen of England , with the throne and the crown and beautiful clothes ? Actually , less like the queen of England , and more like a queen bee . Huh ? Our race is dying out . We need a female to reproduce with . You could still wear a crown . Where we going , Chett ? This may surprise you , but I know a little something about surviving an alien abduction . All we have to do is find the power source at the center of this baby , drop an explosive charge down the chute , and smacko , it 's over . Yeah , we all saw " Star Wars , " big guy , but I don 't think we 're inside the Death Star . You want to settle this right now , spaz ? Make my day , probe boy . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Will you guys grow up for a minute ? Lisa 's trapped somewhere on this ship , and we are her only hope of getting out . She needs us . Yeah . You 're right . I 'm sorry . Me too . Lost my head . Who the hell is Lisa ? So explain this again . As your queen , my duties would be- - Host diplomatic dinner parties , christen new ships , and mate with every male of our species to produce the next generation of alien babies . Of course , we don 't call them that . To us they 're just lovable , gooey gray sacs of joy . Uh-huh . Newsflash , rock head . It ain 't gonna happen . You 're not exactly my type . I know , I know . The thought of mating with someone like me is hard to imagine , but we don 't all look like this . Some of our species are staggeringly attractive , even by your standards . Perhaps this will change your mind ? These are some of our most handsome males . Well , now we 're talking . A little cologne , nice suit . Sure . What the hell ? Help ! Help ! Why are you screaming ? This is how we humans show sexual arousal . I 'm afraid I can 't control it . Help ! Help ! Help ! Are you guys smelling something ? Yeah . Like old spaghetti . Or cat litter . Or coffee grounds . This isn 't a ventilation shaft ! It 's a garbage chute ! I 'll go to hell before I let the kennel club flush me out into space . Come on , let 's go . Go ! Go ! Go ! Lisa , have you ever held a glittering piece of crystallized antimatter from the twin time holes of Andromeda ? No . I haven 't . Because I happen to have one in my suite , if you 'd like to see it . Maybe later you- - Unit 6 , this is a bad time . But sir , the tiny brains have- - It can wait , Unit 6 . I 'm about to orscay . Whoa ! Well , this is inconvenient . Lisa , you all right ? Yes . You said you were beaming them back to Earth . You think all this beaming up and down is free ? We 're accountable , you know ? Besides , it was too risky to return them . Looks like it was risky to keep us , too . Get back , butt crack . You don 't know what you 're playing with . Like I 've never seen a portable high energy particle beam blaster . I get these mail order back home . Listen to me , tiny brain . You 're dealing with a species so far advanced from your own that all I have to do is think it , and your planet is destroyed . Oh , yeah ? Well , you do that , and you 're going to be in a lot of trouble , my friend . [ LAUGHTER ] What 's so funny ? You said trouble . That sounds like our word , trundle . So ? In our language , trundle loosely translates to your word doody . See what I mean ? Oh , yeah . You 're highly advanced , all right . Well , sorry we couldn 't come to an agreement , Lisa . Unit 6 , delete the humans . Yes , sir . I 'll have this flesh bag subdued by the time you can say po- - You 're quick . You 're ugly . You don 't stand a chance , human . I 'm stronger than you in every way . Whew ! You can say that again . Come on , Chett . Do that thing you do to me . You know , the really painful thing . - The nipple twister ? - Jinx ! 1-2-3 . You owe me a Coke . Ha ha ha ! Finish it , Unit 6 , or you 'll be vaporized . You 're going down , pus wad . Who 's the pus wad here ? At least I don 't have to take orders from Johnny Good Looking over there . I have to , human . They 're far superior than any other creature . You could kick his butt . Yes . But I 'd have to find it first . [ LAUGHTER ] What 's so funny ? Come on , you 're fighting the wrong guy here . Who are you more like , him or me ? Capiche ? You 're right . Do I have to do everything around here ? All right , Chett ! Let 's get out of here . Stay . Together we can whip these leather heads and take over the ship . I don 't know . I 've got a whole life back on Earth . Friends , responsibilities . And your face is kind of freaking me out . I know a planet populated entirely by sex-crazed Drew Barrymore look-alikes . Little bro , you can have my room . What do you say we pack up our tiny brains and blow this popsicle stand ? Ready when you are . Pretty close call , huh , Lis ? If Chett and his buddy hadn 't come through , I 'd be out on some dinner date with Steve number 6,000 . Ew . You think Chett 'll ever come back ? I don 't know . I bet by now he 's missing home . Hey , guys . Drew , Drew , Drew . Wait for me , Drew . Drew , Drew , Drew . I 'm coming , baby ! You 're going to have to zap him back . No rush , though . THEME SONG : Weird Science . Fantasy and microchips shooting from the hip , something different will make it weird science . Pictures from a magazine , bits and pieces . Bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation . I do not know . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand my intentions ?

 - Hey ! - Right here . I say , my good man - Sir ... ? I say - ! Day laborers on a street corner . My friends , we are reduced to an all-time low . God , and it 's cold out here . Mark Twain once remarked the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in San Francisco . Why couldn 't you have invented sliding in Miami ? That way you 'd be all warm , I wouldn 't even be here ! One more day , guys . We 're almost out of here . I hate being an illegal immigrant in a country that used to be my own . Kind of nippy out here , eh ? Reminds me of Vancouver . Another computer whiz looking for an opening in the Silicon Valley . Professor ! Why are you disrespecting me , bro ' ? We 're all in this together . I am not your sibling , sir - for which I thank God and good breeding . Hey , guys , here comes somebody . Dos hombres - for dig un stump - 40 pesos cada hora . Señor , normal rate is 50 pesos . Hey - cuál hombre quiere 40 pesos ? Hey , Q-Ball , we got trouble . Immigration ! Stay where you are ! You 're all under arrest ! Put your hands over your heads . Stop and no one will get hurt . Stop , we have you surrounded ! I repeat , we have you surrounded . You cannot get away . Stay where you are , you stupid " furback . " You there , stop ! Alto , I say ! Go after him ! Go after him , damn it . After him ! Alto ! Alto , I say ! Easy , easy . I swear on my mother 's grave , you will curse the day you ever came to my country . Get back here , you ! Get back here ! What if you could travel to parallel worlds ? The same year , the same Earth , only different dimensions ? A world where the Russians rule America ? Or where your dreams of being a superstar came true ? Or where San Francisco was a maximum security prison ? My friends and I found the gateway . Now the problem is finding a way back home . SLIDERS 2x13 " AS THE TIME GOES BY " Subtitles subXpacio Good boy . Stay , boy . Down , boy . Nitro , Cajun , Heel ! Heel ! Good boys . Go on . Daelin ? What did you say ? Shh ! I 'm sorry . It 's okay . Just , please , keep your voice down . Okay . Thank you . Thank you . My grandmother always said I was a magnet for the walking wounded . Seems like I 'm always rescuing some sort of injured animal . Why did you climb the fence ? You don 't look like you would be a thief . I was running from Immigration . There must have been 100 cops . And how did you know my name ? Out in the yard , you said , " Daelin . " We ... kind of grew up together . Went to the same school , till you left in 10th grade . I think you really must have hit your head . Anyway , I never had much time for classes . Why are you looking at me like that ? I thought about you ... a lot . It broke my heart when you moved away . Who 's he ? That 's my fiancé ... Dennis McMillan . You know him , too ? He was on the corner , looking for work with my friends , just before Immigration raided us . He was there today ? That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . My friends - everyone there was rousted . Oh , my God . He 'll be deported . They 'll send him back to Canada . Daelin ? Please , you 've got to hide . Please , downstairs in the cellar . Please , I 'll lose my job . Daelin , is someone in there ? Open the door . Señora . Jacob the gardener says you have a man in here . Is that true ? Of course not , Señora . And who is this handsome young man ? That 's my fiancé . He 's studying to be a doctor , like the mister . Well ... I 'm sorry to suspect you , Daelin . But you have to understand , I have to be careful with two small children in the house . Of course , Señora . Jorge is still at play-date with Tomás , and Ana María is napping . Oh , good . Come with me . We need to have a talk about the upstairs bathroom . Sí . You have to do a better job on the tile . Got to be something I can use in your defense . Did you come here because of political persecution from Canada ? Of course not . Would it be dangerous for you to go back ? - No . Not really . - Got to help me out here ! Madam , I 'm a professor of Cosmology and Ontology at the University - Excuse me , Mister ... Arturo , but you were looking for work as a day laborer , okay ? Ms. Sánchez , did Immigration pick up a man named Quinn Mallory ? - Señora Sánchez ? - Uno momento , Juez . I don 't see a " Mallory " on the list . Is he a relative ? Señorita ? I 'll see what I can find out . Thank you . Ready , Your Honor . For my clients ' sake , may we proceed in English ? Sí . What is the plea ? Your Honor , these are hardworking people that , having fled the poverty of their native Canada , are simply trying to eke out a meager existence in this wonderful country of Nueva España . Is this a speech , Counselor , or will there be a defense ? I 'm simply trying to help you understand my clients ' desperation . You may not believe this , Señora Sánchez , but I have heard it all before . Defendants Arturo , Brown and Wells are ordered deported to Canada as soon as possible . That 's it ? ! That 's all there is ? Chill , babe , we don 't want any more trouble than we 've already got . This is too bizarre . You really expect me to believe that you 're from another planet ? Not another planet , exactly . I come from a parallel Earth where time is the same , but the outcome of many events were different . And in this other world , - Spain lost the New World to the Anglos ? - Yeah . And all the people speak English ? California is part of the United States , the most powerful country in the world . I 'm not expecting you to understand it , but everything I 'm telling you is the truth . The point is , if we can save my friends , I can take you there . I can 't believe I 'm buying this . What about Dennis ? What about him ? He 's being deported to Canada . I can 't just leave him here . He 's everything in the world to me . You help me , we 'll see if we can save him , too . He 's my brother . He 's a member of " La Raza Blanca . " Did you get word to Dennis ? Yeah , it 's all set . He 'll be ready . I 'm Daelin 's brother . Yeah , I remember you . Quinn Mallory . My friends are the ones being deported . We traced the bus leaving the sheriff 's station , they 'll be taking Route 1 all the way up to Vancouver . It 's critical I get my friends 23 . Yeah ? Well , it 's always critical . No sweat , homie . Your needs and our plans coincide . I can 't believe they got us up at 5 : 00 a. m. to deport us . I wish we knew what happened to Quinn . That boy is as slippery as an eel . He 's probably sleeping in the lap of luxury even as we speak . Come on , you " furbacks . " Get on board . Vamos . Rápido ! We slide in less than two hours . Any ideas ? I wish to hell I had . I want to go home , Rembrandt . I don 't want to spend the rest of my life in Canada . You think I do ? It 's wet , it 's cold , my records didn 't sell spit up there ! All they ever listen to is Anne Murray and Gordon Lightfoot . ¿ Qué diablos es esto ? iQuita esta basura de aquí ! All right , don 't be stupid . Take it easy , and everything 's gonna be done . Dennis ! Daelin ! Oh , my God , thank God ! La Blanca , man ! Quinn , I knew you 'd be here . Good to see you , man . Cutting it a little fine , aren 't you , Mr. Mallory ? Two whole minutes . Piece of cake ! You are under arrest ! You are surrounded ! You cannot escape , estúpidos ! Stay where you are . Mr. Mallory ... do it . You did well , my friend . You did this , you son of a bitch ! Dennis ! I had to , Daelin ! They promised me a green card so we could get married . Dennis - ! Then you could be legal , don 't you see ? No , no . Murderers ! Kit ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Daelin , come with us ! He 's going to die . Quinn , let 's go ! Come on ! Oh ... Oh , oh , oh - ! English ! Everything 's in English again . The good old US of A ! I never thought I 'd be so happy to be back here again . I wonder if we 're home . I don 't think so , Professor . Check out this bench . Last time I looked , they were called the " 49ers . " Well , how long till the next window , Q-Ball ? Where the hell is he ? Quinn ? ! Over here . A little over seven hours . The boy looks a little peaky . Perhaps I should have a word with him . You better let me , Professor . Obviously something must have happened back there , huh ? Wait up ! Quinn ! I can 't get over it . She moved away in 10th grade . I thought I 'd never see her again . Hmm . I know exactly what you mean . When I was " Little Rembrandt and the Shandelles " there was this backup singer , Violet . Man , she had my mind night and day . - Thank you . - Here you go . Only problem was I was 17 and I think she was about 29 . Your heart can sure play tricks on you , I tell you . This - this is worse than that . We 'd known each other since we were kids . We dated a couple of years in high school . I keep thinking I just should have grabbed her and dragged her off that world . It seems to me this is a new world with new opportunities . So instead of crying in your beer , why don 't you try tracking her down here ? I don 't even know if she exists on this world . What have we got , two hours ? There 's a telephone book there . See if you can give her a call . What have you got to lose ? Yeah ? Quinn ? You 've been crying . Yeah . It 's nothing . It 's nothing . Gosh ... it 's so good to see you . Come in . Sorry about the mess . I was about to clean up when you rang the bell . Thank you . I 'm sorry - I didn 't mean to barge in on you . No , please . It 's a wonderful surprise . Look at you . How did you ever find me ? Only one " Daelin Richards " listed - I figured it had to be you . So , when did you move back - to San Francisco , I mean ? I 've been here the whole time . It was you that moved away . What was it ? 10th grade . You told me that you were going to Seattle 'cause your dad got a job in aerospace . I thought about you a lot , Quinn . You broke my heart when you moved away . Me , too . I guess that 's why I 'm here . I 've always had this fantasy ... about coming back for you . Going off on an amazing adventure together .. Oh , no . Oh , it 's Dennis . Dennis McMillan ? Yeah , you know him ? Where do you know him from ? It 's kind of hard to explain . Where were you last night ? When you didn 't come home I was worried . Gig ran late . Who 's he ? It 's Quinn Mallory . He says that he knows you . Mmm . Quinn Mallory ? You 're a liar . I don 't know you . My mistake . I thought you were someone else . Yeah . Julie 's sleeping . If you go upstairs , please don 't wake her . Wake her for what ? She 's not going anywhere . This is my house ! Don 't tell me what to do in my house . He wasn 't always like this . Before we were married he was kind and he was gentle . Who 's Julie ? My daughter . God , I hate this stinking house ! Damn him . Can you believe he dropped out of graduate school to join in a band ? He 's such an idiot . Where was my brain ? God , could you just please shut your door , Dennis ? ! God - bitch , bitch , bitch , bitch ! Ever since we had the kid that is all you ever do ! I am so freaking sick of it I could puke ! Hey , hey , hey ! Get your hands off her ! Who the hell are you to come into my house and tell me what to do ? I am going to give you two seconds to get your ass out that door . You 're pathetic . You 've got a family with the most incredible woman in the world , and you 're trashing it . - You 're looking for trouble . - I 'm not looking for any - Thank you . Do you remember what you said about wanting to take me with you ? Did you mean it ? I 'm going on a long journey , Daelin . It 's dangerous . The baby we could never take with us . Hey , you ... want her so bad ? Take her . She 's yours . Take the little bloodsucker , too . Maybe there 's something I can do . Trust me , okay ? Okay . Right . Look , I really appreciate this . I know how hard it is to accept . Great. she feels the same way . Here 's the address and the phone number . Oh , thanks . You sure you got enough for gas ? Oh yeah , I think so . Just in case . No . Take it . Thanks . So explain it again how the real Quinn Mallory is in Seattle . I could explain it for hours , it wouldn 't make a difference . The point is , he 's the one you belong with . He couldn 't be any more amazing than you . Thank you . Goodbye . Goodbye . I got his number from Seattle Information . He 's a grad student at the University of Washington . He said he never got over her either . Wow , so did you tell him who you are ? No time . I just told him I was a mutual friend . It doesn 't matter anyway . At least you got her away from that lowlife . Hey - maybe on this world you and she will get a second chance . Well , are we all assembled ? Yeah , Professor , we 're all here . Let 's do it . You okay ? Yeah . You think I care ? What is this ? What 's going on ? Hey , Q-Ball , what are we doing here ? Where are our clothes ? I don 't know about this , guys . Wait a minute . Where 's Wade ? Wade ? Wade , where are you ? Shut up ! I don 't think she 's close enough to hear . Guys ... look at the towel . It 's San Quentin . At least tell me we 're not going to be on this world long . I don 't know . What do you mean , you don 't know ? Something 's wrong with the timer . It 's gone haywire . The numbers are going up instead of going down . What does that mean ? I don 't know yet . Does that mean we 're going to be here forever ? And what about Wade ? Do you think she 's in some women 's prison somewhere ? Brown , Mallory , Arturo , your lawyer 's here . Excuse me , sir . Could you tell us exactly what we 're accused of ? Gallows humor , huh ? Tsk-tsk-tsk . If she 's our lawyer , we 're in deep trouble . Please sit . This might take a while . I wish I had better news , people , but Judge Ginzburg turned our appeal down . Our appeal ? She just wouldn 't believe the argument that the confessions were coerced . I 'm sorry . Confessions ? What are you talking about ? So Judge Ginzburg shot us down ? That 's it ? That 's the final word ? She 's Chief Justice of the Supreme Court . How much more final does it get ? I 'm sorry , but am I missing something here ? No , ma 'am . If anything , we are . You act like we haven 't gone through this . Madam , is it possible to have a copy of the original police indictment ? It might help my friends and I to adjust to the reality of our situation . Now , I 'm not a great legal mind , but I 'd like to see the indictment , the court transcript , and any other documents that may be relevant . Well ... I suppose so . Thank you very much , ma 'am . Look , it 's possible that in this world we have doubles . It 's possible that we have been incarcerated for a crime that the doubles committed . I n any event , the only way we can defend ourselves is to establish what supposedly happened . Our doubles , right . They just conspired to commit a crime and set us up for the murders ? According to this , we pled guilty to the murder of an undercover policewomen investigating corruption in the SFPD . A policewoman ? So you 're saying that our doubles could be crooked cops or something ? How you coming with the timer ? I took it apart , I put it back together - it 's still running backwards . Daelin Richards . What ? Daelin Richards . That 's the woman we 're alleged to have murdered . Daelin Richards ? That 's - Let me see . I don 't believe it . - Everybody up and at ' em ! - What now ? You got a van waiting to take you to the courthouse . First , we 're going to make you look all pretty in civvies . We 're going to have an arraignment today . Arraignment ? Let 's move it ! I thought the arraignment came before you got sent to jail . Guys , thank God , I was so freaked out . Well , so were we . Have you figured out what happened ? Why are we in prison ? Girl , we don 't know any more than you . Bad news , I 'm afraid . Do you ever have any other sort ? Look , Professor , I 'm every bit as committed to your defense as you are . Let 's try and maintain a positive outlook , okay ? " Positive outlook , " my behind . Woman , we want answers . What are they trying us for this time ? We 've already got life in prison , what more do they want ? Just a minute , isn 't that the judge that deported us a couple of slides ago ? This is so trippy . We keep getting involved with the same group of people . All rise . Criminal Court , County of San Francisco , State of California is now in session . Judge Ramon Estevez presiding . Be seated . " Case of the People of California versus Quinn Mallory , Maximillian Arturo , Rembrandt Brown and Wade Wells on the charges of conspiracy and murder of one Daelin Anna Marie Richards in the first degree . " Guys , look at the clock . The face is in verted . Not inverted , Professor , backwards . First we 're in prison , now we 're on trial . Good Lord - " Time 's Arrow . " Miss Sánchez , do your clients plan to enter a plea ? Excuse me , Your Honor , we are absolutely 100 guilty . Every single one of us . Are you crazy ? - What ? Your Honor , my clients have been under enormous stress . I urge you to disregard this plea . That 's enough . I am entirely in my right mind , Your Honor . - I throw myself on the mercy of the court . - I plead guilty , too , sir . What about the rest ? Oh , sure , why not ? I 'm guilty too , Your Honor . I don 't know what to say . Do you have any idea what you have just done ? I hope so . The plea is accepted . Under the circumstances , this court finds no reason to delay sentencing . The defendants will be remanded , therefore , to the Federal Penitentiary at San Quentin to spend the rest of their natural lives . Court is adjourned . Your Honor , may I approach ? Will somebody please tell me what the devil is going on ? Put it this way - if I 'm right , a federal marshal should be coming over any second to take off these handcuffs . What ? Try to understand , Miss Wells , We are going backwards in a world that is going forwards . Or rather , vice-versa . Here we go . The physicist Steven Hawking pointed out there 's no theoretical reason why " time 's arrow " should point forward . It could just as readily point backwards . We have obviously landed in a universe where Hawking 's theorem is proven true . But we 're living forward ? Yes , as far as we are concerned . As far as the people in this world are concerned , they 're living forward , too . But their forward happens to be the reverse of ours . Hence the clocks . Which would account for why things keep jumping . Like the skipping record - of course things would be discontinuous . They 'd have to be . I can 't wait for you to tell Hawking that his theory was correct . He 'll be so delighted . Well , this is all very " deep dish " and fascinating , guys , but bottom line , okay , when do we slide out of this nightmare ? I don 't know . But at least we know what we 're dealing with . You realize that as far as this world is concerned , we are suspects in a particularly gruesome murder case . I suggest that we just hole out and wait until we have to slide . - I can 't , guys . - What ? You read the indictment . The policewoman who was murdered was Daelin Richards . Q - Ball , don 't even go there . It 's predestined , guys . This world is taking us right back to the murder . Don 't you get it ? I can save her - I can change what happened here . Do what you want , I don 't have a choice . Who 's got a quarter ? " Daelin Richards , an undercover officer investigating police corruption , was shot to death in Golden Gate Park last night by a drifter identified by police as Quinn Mallory . " It says she had an appointment to meet with someone at the Water and Power Dam and that the backup officer identified you as the gunman . Your fingerprints were found on a . 38 caliber revolver . This is unbelievable . Wait a minute , this says that this murder was committed last night around about 9 : 00 . Wait - does that mean that it has happened or it hasn 't happened ? For us , it hasn 't . For everyone else , it has . What do you say , people ? Are we in this together ? Mr. Mallory , are you familiar with the story of " The Appointment at Samarra " ? No . What 's that ? A certain rich merchant was walking in the marketplace in Baghdad . As he looked across the street , he suddenly saw the figure of Death beckoning to him . The terrified man rushed home , mounted his fastest horse and rode 100 miles to Samarra . That night there was a knock on the door of his bedroom . He opened it ... there stood Death . " Why did you beckon me in the marketplace in Baghdad today ? " asked the man . " I was not beckoning you . " said Death . " I was merely surprised to see you in Baghdad , since I knew that tonight we had an appointment in Samarra . " The point I 'm making , Mr. Mallory , is we have no idea of the consequences of interfering in this universe 's timelines . Uh-oh , man , let 's move it ! Move it , man , move it . So much for our plan to hide out till the end of the slide . Wait a minute , what do you mean , slide ? I thought that thing was broken . On the contrary , Mr. Brown . it 's working perfectly . It 's just going backwards in accordance with the physical laws of this universe . Now if my surmise is correct , we will be compelled to slide shortly after the murder is committed . Oh , man ! What do we do ? I don 't know about you , I 'm getting out of here . Take off ! We 'll meet at the Presidio . Courage , Miss Wells . Walk calmly . We 've gotten out of worse situations than this . Not lately . Spread out , all right ? This is unbelievable . Every cop in the city must be after us now . Hold on . Listen . What 's going on ? Man , I hate it when it does that . You know what ? I think we 're okay now . Come on . They shouldn 't be looking for us anymore . Shouldn 't be looking for us ? Why not ? We just had another discontinuity . The record skipped . We jumped back in time . Have you noticed it 's gotten darker all of a sudden ? Come on . Hey , look , what about Wade and the Professor ? They know to meet us in the park . What ? We 're going to stop Daelin 's murder , Rembrandt . What for ? If time is moving backwards here , she 's going to come back to life anyway . Don 't you get it ? We 're the ones moving backwards , not them . - Let 's go . - Oh , man , I 'm so confused . The paper said something about a dam near the Presidio . That 's got to be it . You hear it ? What time is it ? How do I know ? My watch is backwards . This doesn 't make any sense . It 's got to be 9 : 00 by now . Where is she ? Q - Ball . Oh , my God , it 's Dennis McMillan ! Be careful , man . Dennis ! Put the gun down ! I said , put the gun down , man ! I 'm not going to let you do this ! Idiot ! Are you out of your mind ? Get the hell out of here ! He 's not the killer . What ? He 's got a rifle . My fingerprints were found on a pistol . That 's the mistake I must have made . There 's the real killer . He must have been the one who framed me . What , he 's the one ? Are you sure ? Stay with me , Rembrandt . I know what I 'm doing . I 'm glad somebody does . Daelin , it 's a setup ! Daelin , get down ! Freeze ! Ugh ! Daelin ? ! Ow ! Daelin ? ! Who the hell are you ? Are you all right ? Jeez , this jerk almost got you killed . Are you nuts ? He saved her life . Yeah , maybe that 's how you see it , but not me . This is obstruction of justice . Send in my backup and we need an ambulance . We got an officer down . I 'm fine , Dennis , it 's just my shoulder . Whoever you are , you really screwed up . If you wouldn 't have blown it , that dead man would have coughed up information to put away half this city 's crooked cops . Daelin , it was a setup . He wasn 't going to let you out of this park alive . What do you know about it , huh ? What are you , some kind of inside guy ? Who are you to her ? I 'm her partner ... and her fiancé . Well , I guess that does it , huh ? Three worlds , three strikeouts . But if you can look at it this way , at least you saved her life . That 's got to be something , huh ? Besides , the way your karma was headed , if you two ever did get together , you 'd probably have a child that would destroy the world . There 's no need to invoke a destructive child . Mr. Mallory has done it all by himself . Have you looked at the heavens ? Oh , my God , there 's a hole in the sky . Hey , what 's going on ? You 've changed the future . You 've ripped a hole in the fabric of time . God knows what the consequences will be . What could it mean ? In layman 's terms , I fear tomorrow may no longer exist . Wow ! Well , we could look at it this way . Maybe it 's all for the best . Then again , maybe not . The timer ! Look ! How are we supposed to reach that ? Why is it pulling us ? Wait a minute . Don 't forget that for us time is moving in reverse . We entered this world some time in prison , and we depart now . Go with it ! Go ! Take us out of the equation , this world may have a chance . Go on ! Everyone all right ? It 's working again . So , how long till we slide ? Three days , seven hours and 14 minutes . There 's a phone over there , Q-Ball , in case you want to call her .

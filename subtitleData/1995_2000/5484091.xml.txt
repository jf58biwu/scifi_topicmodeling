 # Sometimes it 's hard to be a woman # Giving all your love to just one man # You 'll have bad times # And he 'll have good times # Doing things that you don 't understand # But if you love him , you 'll forgive him ... # Post 's arrived . Brilliant . A bit of excitement at last . See that ? It 's a beaut . Some of the structure 's collapsed on me bed . I think it was those beans . Oh , the mail . Haven 't had a chance to look . Anything from my mates ? Don 't think so . There 's nothing in orange crayon with half the letters backwards . - Anything for you ? - The usual . A couple of death threats . And I 'm in the " Reader 's Digest " lucky dip . Apparently , I 'm one of the special few selected for their lucky dip . That 'll be you and 12 zillion people . I 've won either a holiday in Mauritius , a soft-top sportscar , or a fabulous matching set of egg cups . " Scrape with a coin to discover which . " I 've won the holiday ! What ? Three million years into deep space where I can 't claim it , I go and win a smegging holiday in Mauritius ! - Oh , they 're taking the smeg . - What now ? I 've won the Lottery as well . " To collect your cheque , " bring your winning ticket to Lottery House , 24 Argyle Street . " Four million ! No luck , that 's my problem . No luck at all . It 's a wind-up from the guards to sap our morale . - This is for you . - Who from ? Petersen . My God , that is tragic . Has he died ? Died ? Do you think he 'd write and tell you ? You 're right . I 'm not thinking straight . He 'd be too busy with his funeral , wouldn 't he ? - What 's happened to him ? - Something catastrophic . Hideous . He 's found your guitar in Starbug 's wreckage and he 's sending it here . Brilliant ! - Are you OK ? - Of course I 'm not OK . I hate your guitar . If I wanted to live with an irritating lump of wood , - I 'd have moved in with an Australian soap star . - I didn 't know you thought I was that bad . Didn 't you get a clue that time I tried to insert it in you ? You 'd have stood a better chance if you 'd used the neck end . Anyway , you were revising . You always get uptight when you 're revising . Come on - what about the Om song ? That was a classic ! # Om ! People who heard that formed self-help groups . Don 't give me that . They played me demo on hospital radio . Three patients came out of comas , packed their bags and went home . Hey ! The axe man is back ! You beaut ! Hang on . There 's no strings . They 've confiscated the strings ! I feel like a man who leaps out of a plane with no parachute and lands in the hot tub at the Playboy mansión . Why take me strings ? It makes no sense . - You could use them to hang yourself . - I wouldn 't wanna hang meself if I had me guitar strings . I think they were thinking of me . Maybe my luck 's changing . At last a break . By the way , I forgot - for you . " Because of the nature of your crime , blah-blah-blah-blah ... " we are willing to review your case . " For this process to be successful , you will need a record of good behaviour . " A successful appeal would mean similar amnesty for colleagues in your situation . " Yes ! Well , thanks to Kill Crazy , that was the least enjoyable suicide missión I 've ever been on . Right in front of me was this weird mutant thing with two heads and all these tentacles . It took one look at me and ran off . Why do you think it done that ? You don 't know what it 's like being classified as a woman . The humiliation ! I know . I know . Why should I , a series 4000 mechanoid , have to endure the turgid monotony of showering with the girls three times a week ? - Tell me that ! - It 's not fair , I know . It 's just that ... - You shower with the girls ? - It 's so hideously dull , I can 't describe it . They stand around soaping themselves . Their bodies all wet and foamy . Can you imagine it ? Oh , my goodness . We 've been frozen in time again . Hello ? Extraordinary . It must be a warp in the time-space continuum . How curious it isn 't affecting me . We 're not frozen in time . We were thinking about what you said . It 's times like this that make me thankful I 'm just a head . Oi , toy boy . Next time you 're in the showers , why don 't you smuggle in a camera and film ' em ? That 'd be brilliant ! I haven 't seen a naked woman since ... Well , ever . I 'd pay ya . - What do you say ? - No . I forbid it . Yeah , me ... What ? It 's voyeuristic , exploitative and immature . All right . Who are you ? And what have you done with our Rimmer ? Allow me to clarify my position . Morally speaking , using a hidden camera in the women 's showers , taking shots of them sudding themselves with mounds of foam , without their permissión ... Morally speaking - I 'm speaking morally here - I 'm all in favour ! However , Listy has been invited to appeal and a scam like this could ruin it . - Appeal ? - Yeah , I 'm appealing . That 's a minority view . Look , we can all be successful . We 've just got to be model prisoners . Screw his appeal . I wanna see skin ! Yeah ! What do you say , bird-tray head ? Are you asking me to betray the people I live with ? To reduce them to mindless sex objects for your moronic titillation ? Yes , please ! I forgot who I was for a moment . - What are you doing ? - I 'm a woman and proud of it . I 'll be with my fellow sisters , doing it for ourselves . I 'm going to make this quick and easy . Last night , on D wing , I was beaten up and mugged . You have one chance . I 'm turning the lights off for precisely ten seconds . I want whoever took it to return my glass eye . Kill the lights . Ten ... nine ... eight seven ... six ... I 'm glad to see good sense prevailed . I have a date with Miss Patricia Carling from Supplies on Saturday night . She thinks my eyes are my loveliest feature . If I go like this , I 'm only half lovely ! If it 's not returned within 30 seconds , all Canary privileges suspended . One month . I know who stole your left peeper , sir . It was him , sir . I saw him playing marbles with it this morning , sir . Thank you , Rimmer . Have you gone mad ? You don 't rat on inmates . It 's an unwritten law . Look , if it helps the appeal , what else matters ? Model prisoners . Would the sky really fall in if people just tidied up a little ? They 're here ! They 've landed ! - Who have ? - The invisible aliens . - Look ! There 's one . - And there 's another . Agh ! From the people who brought you " Vampire Bikini Giris Suck Paris " , comes another cinematic masterpiece . - Horrible special effects ... - Looks like another pearl ! Why do they show us these lousy B movies ? To sap our morale . Next week , it 's the George Formby season . Get your hanging rope now while there 's still some left ! Good evening . Tonight 's scheduled feature has been replaced by a special live pay-per-view event brought to you courtesy of Krytie TV . Transmitted live by my optical receptors , we bring you live and live , women 's shower night ! Are they really gonna show this ? No way ! This is a joke , right ? This is a ... - Oh , Mama ! - You know what this means , don 't you ? There is a god ? They got to him . They reprogrammed Kryten . - If we get caught , your appeal 's dead . - Forget the appeal . - I already have ! - Kris won 't believe I wasn 't involved in this . We 've got to stop it . - You 're right . I want no part of this . - Me neither . - We 've gotta go . - Right now . - Not a minute to lose . - I 'm dust . Me , too . After two . One ... two ... Go ! And now , I 'm gonna stare at a cracked floor tile . What 's he doing that for ? Remember - shower night is a pay-per-view event . Start filling those buckets ! I can 't believe this . He 's running it like a business . There 's a bloke selling ice creams . Never mind him . Now ! - We 've gotta go right now . - I 'm going . Now , let 's get up close and personal with one of the showerees , Miss Kristine Kochanski . Fancy a choc ice ? OK . Splendid . - Later . - Mr Kryten . Visitor , sir . Kryten , I know Kill Crazy 's reprogrammed you - turned you into a ruthless entrepreneur - but I may know how to change you back . Well , keep it to yourself , sir . I 'll make it worth your while . Look what it 's done to you ! It 's made me rich , feared and respected . I 'm loving every minute of it . I 've bought the rights to the soccer tournament . I hope to get the boxing . - Ah , Miss Kochanski ! I 've a little gift for you . - Ooh , another one ? Nothing 's too good for you ! You know you were worried about picking up verrucas in the shower ? I 've got the perfect solution - a waterproof pogo stick . This has got to stop . But the pogo stick will put the ratings through the roof , sir ! Think of the money ! Think of the show ! I 'm crazy about her . I 'm not gonna let you do this . Do what ? How do you think Kryten got all this ? " Shower Night Live . " Oh , God , is he paying some of the girls to do this ? Who 's that with the sponge ? That 's me ! It replaced the Wednesday night movie . I saw the whole thing - all three terrible hours of it . - It was awful . - Is that the time ? I 've got a merchandising meeting in two minutes . Excuse me . You are dead , nickel-hydrate breath ! And you ... What have I done ? You were there for three hours of it . Well , I didn 't enjoy it . I was outraged . - Why do you think I only had one choc ice ? - How could you go along with this ? I 'm only human . You were completely naked . Starkers . Nude . In the buff . Totally kitless . You had no clothes on . You 've seen me naked - when we went out . Yeah , but I wanted to see if anything had changed . Why didn 't you just ask instead of filming me in secret ? - You 'd have said no . - Not necessarily . If I 'd known that you needed to see me naked so badly , I wouldn 't necessarily have said no . - You wouldn 't ? - No . We 're friends , aren 't we ? It never occurred to me that I could just ask . You 're such a great friend . I love being your friend . - Kris ... - No ! Not now . Not ever . - But you just said ... - We 're not friends any more . Appeal applications . Character testimonials ! - What 's this ? - Kris found out about the shower thing . - She went ballistic . It 's a present to say sorry . - A bag of flour ? No , two bags . I 'm in the Tank , in the middle of deep space . I can 't just get on the blower to Interflora . Flour . Flours . - It 's the closest I could get . - You romantic fool . It was hard to get this . I nicked it from the bakery . She 'll appreciate that . I can just see her reading the card , " Dear Kris , " I 'm really sorry for ogling you and the girls in the shower for three hours of steamy fun . " To make up for it , and to indicate how truly sorry I am , here 's two bags of self-raising . " Something I didn 't need any help with yesterday . " It 's easy for you . You 're not in love . It 's debilitating being nuts about someone . You lose 20 IQ points every time you talk to them . You must be nuts about a fair few people , then ! The girls found out about " Shower Night " . They cleaned out my system and kicked me out . I 've been reclassified as a man . I feel terrible , sir , for endangering your appeal . It 's not your fault , Kryten . They got to you . - Do you know the news about Miss Kochanski ? - What news ? - You haven 't heard ? - Heard what ? - The news . You haven 't heard the news ? - What news ? - No one 's told you ? - Told me what ? - About Miss Kochanski . - What about her ? - About her and her ex-boyfriend Tim . - What about her and Tim ? - I can 't believe you don 't know . - What ? ! - No one told you ? - What ? ! You mean you 're blissfully unaware of the news about Miss Kochanski and Tim ? - What news about them ? - I don 't believe it ! Believe what ? ! I 'm so traumatised no one 's had the guts to tell you the horrible , terrible , appallingly hideous , awful news . I 'm not sure I can even speak now . Heurgh ! There 's a 200-foot drop down there . Now tell me the news . Tim 's taking her to the officer 's club tonight . Probation permits it provided she 's back by 10 . Oh ! This is all down to that shower thing , isn 't it ? Well , you know what Tim 's like - impossibly handsome , oozes charm , a great lover , and you 're just ... you . It 's so unfair ! You must feel awful . I do now . God ! - You 're taking this very well . I 'm impressed . - No , I 'm not . I 'm falling apart . I know that . I was trying to cheer you up . - What can I do ? - You 've gotta deal with your grief , man . A break-up is very much like a bereavement . It 's usually followed by a cremation and some sandwiches . You don 't know what you 're on about ! Mark my words , time is a great healer , unless you 've got a rash , in which case use ointment . Look , they 're only going out for a meal . What 's the worst thing that could happen ? How 's this , Listy ? A little wine and laughter , then back to his place for coffee and chess . Before you know it , she 's sandwiched between two bishops , and the queen 's exposed to an attack from the rear . It 's a tragedy ! What are you so bothered about ? You hated the idea of me and her . That was the old me , sir . I 've grown and matured since then . The new me wants you to have children so I can iron those itty-bitty socks . You 're not getting any younger , sir , and neither are your sperms . I 'm getting worried about those guys . Any older , and they 'll need a Stanner stairlift to get up the fallopian tubes ! - So what do you propose ? - We nail that horny stag . - We get you and the divine Miss K together . - Do nothing that 's gonna endanger the appeal . First , we sabotage the date . - We ? You mean you wanna help me ? - Step onboard the Love Express , sir ! We get to his quarters through the air-vents . I paid off the guards . Then you make him look like the nerdiest slob in the universe . You leave this in his quarters . A half-eaten onion sandwich . That 's always a passión-killer . Is it ? I like those . Then there 's this . " Morris Dancer Monthly " . What a total dweeber-nerd maestro he 'll look with those ! They 're mine . Then there 's these . Tragically unfashionable underpants . They 're mine . And finally , Christian rock music . If that doesn 't scare her off , nothing will . Have you been going through my things ? And not forgetting ... - A pair of scissors ? - The piece de resistance . Frank Assisi and the Apostles . " Hymns in Rock " . # Kum ba yah , my Lord ! # Digestive biscuit . Lo , the assassin ! Boom , boom , boom ! What Mr Lister doesn 't know is he 's been set up by Krytie TV . Ssh . Here he comes now . Mr Lister ... - Kryten , is that you ? - You trashed that room . - You thought Miss Kochanski was dating Tim . - You mean she isn 't ? Look whose quarters you really trashed ! You said the girls had restored you back to normal . Whoops ! You 've been Krytied ! - I 've wrecked Ackerman 's quarters ! - The appeal ! The surprises haven 't finished yet on Krytie TV , because Mr Ackerman and his red-hot date are due back any second . It 's a race against time ! Start cleaning that room ! Sorry to keep droning on about this , but what about ... - ... the appeal ? ! - Smeg ! Smeg ! Agh ! Thanks for watching , folks . See ya next time ! - There he is . - Kryten , come here a minute . - I was just trying to boost the ratings , sir . - Get him ! It was nothing personal ! The appeal . Oooh ... Yes ! " Dear Mr Lister , your appeal has been successful . " All inmates with no records of violence or depressión " will be allowed to have ... strings on their guitars . " This appeal was all about guitar strings ? You didn 't think it was about getting out of here , did ya ? You mean I 've been busting my balls so you can have strings on your stinking guitar ? ! You 've been a brick , man . And as a personal thank you I thought I 'd write you a song . # It 's cold outside , there 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

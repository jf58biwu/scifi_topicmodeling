 Ouch . Wake up . Who 's there ? Naomi . Come back later . You know what I think ? I think you 're scared of the tree monster . I 'm not scared of any tree monster , Miss Wildman , but , as you know , I need my beauty sleep . I 'm sorry I woke you , but we have a mission . You and your missions . Lucky for you , your old pal Flotter has everything ready . Follow me . I 've laid a trap . When he climbs this tree , he 'll trip the alarm . Tree monsters are terrified of high-pitched noises . I never heard that . Ah ! It 's a well-known fact . The bell will scare him high into those branches where counterweights will bend the treetop till it springs back , catapulting him pondward and splash . He 'll sink like a log . But , Flotter ... logs float . Details , details . That is a terrible plan . It 's him ! The name 's Trevis , and you are ... ? Flotter . Flotter T. Water lll . Well , of course you are , drippy . You . Naomi Wildman , but my friends call me Naomi . I don 't recognize your element . You 're not earth or water or plasma . I 'm human . Where do you live ? In space . Nobody lives in space . She does ... on a starship called Voyager . I 'm an explorer . Really ? An explorer . Timber . What 's that like ? Well , you know- - space battles with aliens , strange anomalies . May I visit your starship ? Well , I 'll have to ask my mom . You know , for a monster , you 're very polite . That 's because I 'm not a monster . You see that ? I 'm not scared one bit . My bark is worse than my bite . Maybe we jumped to conclusions about him . Well , he may not be a monster , but he is stealing my water with his roots . Stealing ! Absurd ! Why , I ought to dry you out . And I ought to chop you down . You want a piece of me ? Excuse me. lt sounds like you two need each other . I mean , think about it . Flotter , your water helps his trees grow , and , Trevis , your branches shade his pond from the sun . It 's a well-known fact that the sun makes water evaporate . She 's got a point . The girl 's a thinker . Now , shake hands and make up . Ugh ... moist palms . Sappy fingers . Neelix to Holodeck 2 . Naomi here . It 's bedtime . Can 't I stay a little longer ? You know the rules . Besides , someone special wants to say good night . Mom ! Computer , end program . And how 's Flotter ? Grouchy as ever , but we made a new friend today named Trevis . I 'll introduce him to you tomorrow as soon as you get home . I 'm afraid the away mission may take a few more days , sweetheart . Days ? Yes ... but I 'm bringing you back some beautiful sillinite crystals and lots of holopictures for your data album . Now be a good girl and get ready for bed while I talk to Neelix . All right . Sweet dreams . Samantha ? We ran into an ion storm . How bad is it ? We took a real beating . We 're trying to make repairs , but there 's another storm on the way . Better go . Say good night for me ? I 've lost the com signal . A level-7 ionic front is closing aft at 33,000 kph . I need more power to the thrusters if I 'm going to outrun it . I 'll see what I can do . The leading edge is approaching . I 've given all the power I can spare , Tom . It 's not enough . I can 't keep ahead of this thing . Brace for impact ! Mayday , mayday . Delta Flyer to Voyager . We need assistance . Warp drive is ... Impulse power is down . .. thrusters only . ... ion storms damaged our primary systems . Life support is failing . We 're searching for an emergency landing site . We require immediate ... . That was their last transmission . We haven 't been able to raise them since . If they 're looking for a place to land , they must be in pretty bad shape . Anything on long-range sensors ? We lost their signature when the second ion storm hit , but we 've triangulated the coordinates of the distress call . They 've entered a planetary system about .6 light-years from here . Problem is , there 's another ion storm- - a level-5- - blocking our path . Level-5 ? We 've been through worse . Let 's just batten down the hatches and reinforce the shields . We 're not going to let a little bad weather stand in our way . What about Naomi ? I guess somebody 's going to have to explain why her mother 's not back . Maybe we shouldn 't tell her anything . Why not ? She 's a very sensitive girl . l-l don 't want to alarm her unnecessarily . With any luck , we 'll have her mother back before she starts to worry . Well , you 're closer to her than anyone . I 'm inclined to let you take the lead on this . Thanks , Captain . All right . Consider it your mission to keep her occupied . Aye , Captain . Dismissed . I was thinking ... Oh ? It 's time I carried my weight around here . Ah . They could use a hand in the airponics bay . I was thinking more of the Bridge . Captain 's Assistant . Would I get to fly the ship ? Well , we 'd have to take it up with the Captain . We need to check the internal sensors . Neelix , don 't move . What 's wrong ? The Borg lady . She has a name , you know . Seven of Nine , Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix Zero One . Don 't look . She 'll assimilate you . Naomi , Seven is a nice person and she 's a valuable member of this crew . I don 't want to be in her collective . I don 't think there 's much danger of that . Hey , Neelix . Hey , Naomi . Neelix , can I talk with you ? Yeah. I 'll be right back . Sick Bay 's running short on emergency medkits . We 're going to need a few more if we send another away team after the shuttle . I 've got half a dozen stockpiled in Cargo Bay 2 . How is she ? On the Naomi anxiety scale of one to ten- - where one is a touch of insomnia and ten is a panic attack- - about five . is this chair occupied ? Yes or no would suffice . No . I mean , yes . Explain . You can 't sit here . Somebody else is sitting here . Very well . So ... I thought we 'd pay another visit to Sick Bay . The Doctor says he has time to give you a ... botany lesson . What 's wrong ? I am Borg . No , you 're not . Could we go to the holodeck first ? I want to play another Flotter story . Well , the Doctor 's expecting you . I don 't like Sick Bay . Why not ? It 's full of creepy things- - alien organs and hyposprays . Well , that 's not true . The Doctor talks too much . Well , that 's his way . Can 't you reprogram him or something ? Oh , l-l don 't think he 'd like that very much . Come on . Rumor has it there 's a planetoid around here . Sorry , Tom . The storm is throwing off my readings . There 's definitely a big rock nearby . I just can 't find it . The wave front is accelerating . How long till it hits us ? Less than two minutes . Great . That gives me 30 seconds to land this thing . Samantha , I don 't mean to rush you . Got it . Class-M atmosphere , nickel-iron core , bemonite mantle . Bemonite ? I want to land this shuttle , not bury it . 73,000 kilometers , bearing 0 mark 4 . We 've entered the upper atmosphere . Nothing but impact craters , volcanoes ... We can 't land here . The storm is closing . lncreasing shields to maximum . Just keep us away from the volcanoes and we 'll be okay . I 've got a big meteor crater , 500 kilometers across , 3.7 deep . I 'll take it . Starboard thrusters are down . Tuvok , if you don 't have something positive to say ... We 're coming in too fast . Hang on ! The Flyer has landed . She needs immediate medical assistance . What happened ? We made it . Delta Flyer 's first landing . Where ... About three kilometers beneath the surface . At least our primary hull 's still in one piece . Wish I felt the same . You 'll be all right . Minor concussion , a few fractures- - nothing I can 't handle . You 're a great nurse , but you 're a lousy liar . You 've got a punctured kidney and you 're bleeding internally . You need surgery . Voyager ? . I 've transmitted another distress call . No response . It 's all this rock . I 've got to talk to Naomi ; let her know we 're okay . Conserve your strength , Ensign . Mr. Paris and I have the situation under control . Nice bedside manner , Tuvok . Sam , I 'm going to give you a mild sedative and something for the pain . Any chance we could abandon the shuttle , make our way on foot ? Unlikely . Not only are we buried under several kilotons of rock , but the atmosphere in this cavern is flooded with fluorine gas . Nothing to do but sit back and enjoy the view . Captain 's Log , supplemental . We 've weathered the ion storm and tracked the Delta Flyer to an M-class planetoid . I 'm picking up a residual impulse signature in the upper atmosphere . Try to pinpoint their location . How 's our littlest crew member ? She misses her mother , but I don 't think she suspects anything . I was just about to take her to the holodeck for some more storytelling . Call me an optimist , Neelix , but I 'm still counting on a happy ending . Me , too . Got it ! The impulse wake leads to the northern hemisphere : coordinates 121 mark 16 . Any sign of them ? Plasma fires ... hull fragments ... Either they vaporized on impact or they 're buried beneath the surface . Any life signs ? Maybe they beamed out before the crash . Harry , anything ? Nothing . We built the Delta Flyer to take a lot of punishment . I 'm betting it held together . Commander , take rescue teams down to that crater . If sensors can 't find them , we 'll have to do it the hard way . Harry . Now , see the organelle just over there ? The one that looks like a little bitty potato ? The mitochondria ? Yes . " Mitochondria : The warp core of the cell . " Exactly . Now , what if I told you that this fellow was invited to dinner , but never got around to leaving ? What do you mean ? Well , turn back the clock a few billion years to when cells first evolved . These early cells had no mitochondria . They struggled along without them , making do with whatever energy sources they could find . Then , one day , a mitochondrial ancestor arrived , broke though the cell wall and made himself at home . They became friends ? The correct term is " symbiosis . " - Friends . - Friends . My mom says cooperation is more important than competition . Mm-hmm . She was supposed to call me today . Well , she 's probably just a little busy . Now , let 's have a look at the cell wall . It looks simple enough , but believe you me , there 's more here than meets the eye . Can we try to call her ? Neelix . What a pleasure to see you . How was school today ? Good . There 's a time for school and there 's a time for ... Flotter . Uh ... aren 't you forgetting something ? Oh . Thank you , Doctor . You 're quite welcome , Miss Wildman . In the blink of an eye , there was Trevis above us . Then what happened ? He turned out to be very nice . His bark was worse than his bite . Where did you learn to make such silly puns ? You . Oh . Neelix , did you have a favorite holodeck program when you were growing up ? Well , we didn 't have any holodecks on Rinax , but it didn 't matter because we had a great big forest right behind my house . Really ? Uh-huh . And my sisters and I would go exploring every day . We 'd make up our own stories . Imagination . Exactly . Deck 6 , Section 9 . Where are your sisters now ? Oh ... they 're far away from here . I haven 't seen them in a very long time . How long ? Many years . But you haven 't been on Voyager for that long . True , but before that , my work as a trader kept me away from home . That 's too bad . Do your sisters ever call you like my mom does when she 's on an away mission ? No . I bet you miss them . I do , very much . Here we are . Computer , display chapter headings The Adventures of Flotter . Let 's see . " Flotter and the Tree Monster " ? Played that one yesterday . Okay . " Trevis and the Terribly Twisted Trunk . " I promised I 'd save that one for mom . It 's her favorite . " Flotter , Trevis and the Ogre of Fire . " Yeah . That one . Huh . That sounds a little scary . It 's okay . I won 't be scared if you 're with me . Once upon a time in the Forest of Forever , Flotter and Trevis encountered a strange element they 'd never seen before . Trevis , you 're on fire . I told him not to touch it , but this blockhead never listens . Stop complaining and help him . Me ? Water puts out fire . Oh , thank you . Hey , it worked . Watch this . Good thinking , Naomi . Who 's the furball ? The name 's Neelix . What caused the fire ? It came from up there . In a flash . Lightning . But the sky is clear . It doesn 't look like a thunderstorm . What 's your theory , Naomi ? There 's only one other explanation- - the Ogre of Fire . The Ogre of Fire ? Who 's he ? He is me ! And I 'm going to burn this forest to the ground ! Oh ! Oh ... Oh ! Flotter ! Maybe ... we should play another program . No , we have to find Flotter . Hello ! is anyone there ? Over here . Trevis , are you all right ? Uh-huh . A little hot under the bark , maybe . What about Flotter ? is he dead ? Neelix ? Well , I ... I don 't know . He can 't be dead . Flotter ! I think it 's your bedtime . But I want to find Flotter . Don 't argue with your godfather . Come on , now . Take this to Lieutenant Torres . You 'll find the phaser drills in Cargo Bay 3 . Aye , sir . Are you sure you have time for this ? I know you 're busy . No problem . Glad to be of service . Maybe a shade bluer . And the head 's a little disproportionate , don 't you think ? We 're not shooting for an exact replica , Neelix . Artistic license . Sorry . Guess I shouldn 't barge into your kitchen and tell you how to cook . Flotter- - now there 's a name I haven 't heard in a while . I used to be nuts about those holostories when I was a kid . Did you see the one where Flotter suspects Trevis to be a rubber tree ? Not yet . He keeps trying to trip him to see is if he 'll bounce . Yeah , those two were a lot of fun . Actually , the last scenario that Naomi chose was pretty frightening . No fun at all . Kids love to be scared . Not Naomi . Computer , transfer the design parameters to the replicator . How 's she holding up ? Fine . Right now , she 's busy with her homework . Neelix , what 's wrong ? Everything . Everything 's wrong ! lon storms , crash landings , alien attacks- - a starship 's no place for a child . I don 't know . I 'd say Naomi 's pretty lucky to be growing up on Voyager . Lucky ? Think about it . Think about all the things she 's experienced- - stars being born , supernovas , life-forms no one from the Alpha Quadrant has seen before . When I was a kid , I would have given anything for a chance like this . Well , here goes . Hi , Neelix . Did you miss me ? You know , I forgot how ugly this guy was . Thanks , Ensign . Naomi . Guess who I found in the replicator . Thanks , but that 's not really Flotter . Well , Flotter 's not really Flotter . He 's just a holodeck character . What are you working on ? I 'm researching the evaporation of water . Why ? Well , I 've been thinking . Water doesn 't just disappear when it 's heated . It turns into invisible gas . So , if we could get the forest to cool down enough , Flotter might reliquefy . Clever . I miss Mom . I know you do . When 's she coming back ? Soon . Why hasn 't she called ? She must be very busy cataloguing all the geological specimens she 's collected . Has anybody talked to her ? Well ... not in a day or two , but ... " Starfleet Regulation 47 6-9 : " All away teams must report to the Bridge at least once every 24 hours . " You really are going to make an excellent Captain 's Assistant . What if something bad happened to them ? I 'm sure everything 's fine . Come on now , bed . Promise to wake me up if Mommy calls ? Promise . Even if it 's 0200 hours ? Even if it 's 0200 hours . Sweet dreams . Neelix ? Computer , access Personal Database Neelix . File index 291 . Hello , Alixia . I 'm sorry it 's been so many weeks since I 've thought about you , but we 've been very busy here on Voyager . I miss you . My goddaughter , Naomi , she 's in trouble . We 're in trouble . She may lose her mother . Alixia , you always knew the right thing to do , the right thing to say . I wish you were here to help me . Come on ! Hurry ! We 're under attack ! Get up ! The metreon cascade ! Run ! Computer , switch to polythermal imaging and enhance resolution . Neelix , do you require assistance ? No , no , I was just passing by . I thought I 'd pay you a visit , see how things were going . How are things going ? I 'm mapping the caverns surrounding the crash site . How far do they extend ? Approximately 37 kilometers . What about the search- - anything new ? Every scan reveals something new , but as yet , little of relevance . Seven ... your family- - your human family- - do you ever think about them ? lnfrequently . I was only six years old when I was assimilated . Not much older than Naomi is now . Do you miss your parents ? I barely remember them . Maybe that 's a blessing . Rescue team alpha to Seven of Nine . Yes , Commander . We need that data . I will meet you at the transporter site . I adapted . The child Naomi will adapt as well . Borg wisdom . Lieutenant , get me an update from beta team . They haven 't checked in for over an hour . Coffee , anyone ? Captain ? No , thanks. I 've had enough . One more cup and I 'll jump to warp . Any news ? I 'm afraid not . No debris , no life signs ? We 've got three teams beneath the surface and so far , nothing . Well , so much for that happy ending . We 'll turn that planetoid inside out if we have to , but I think we have to be prepared for the worst . Maybe it 's time you told Naomi . No , not yet . She 's an astute girl . She must be aware that something 's wrong by now . She 's been asking a lot of tough questions . " Why hasn 't her mother filed a status report ? " " What if she 's in trouble ? " But I 've got a big day planned for her tomorrow . Plenty of distractions . She won 't have time to be worried . Your mission was to keep her occupied , not to lie to her . First thing in the morning , I want you to explain the situation . I don 't think that 's such a good idea . Why not ? Like I told you , she 's sensitive . All the more reason to answer her questions . With all due respect , Captain , I 'm her godfather . I know what 's best for her . Neelix ... I realize you care about Naomi and you are only trying to protect her , but you 've got to tell her the truth . " Good morning , Naomi . " Would you like some papalla juice with your cereal ? " And , oh , by the way , your mother is buried under 30 kilotons of rock . " Neelix ... When we know something for sure ... when we find her mother , alive or dead ... I 'll tell her then . Not before . If you can 't do it , I will . You don 't have the right ! You don 't understand what 's at stake here ! When you were her age , you were safe and sound on Earth with two healthy parents to take care of you . You never had to worry about the possibility of being alone ! You take it from me- - you wouldn 't have liked it . Oh , I know . You must identify with Naomi 's situation . When my family was killed , I lost everything . I still have nightmares . It hasn 't been easy . I don 't want Naomi to go through what I did . I understand and you 're right , but this situation is different . How so ? Naomi has you . Neelix , she has to be told , but I know she 'll be better off having you here to help her through it . First thing in the morning . We 've got a few hours until then . Why don 't you come back on the Bridge ? Give us a hand ? Ready , Tuvok ? Ready . Cross your fingers . The magnetic relays have overloaded . We better find another way to polarize this hull or their sensors won 't be able to pick us up . We 're never getting out of here . Do not give up hope . The probability of our being rescued is low , but not statistically impossible . Comforting . Who 's going to look after Naomi ? You should not concern yourself with that now . How can you say that ? My youngest child has been without a father for four years , yet I am certain of her well-being , that I conveyed my values to her before leaving , and I have confidence in the integrity of those around her . You have been an exemplary mother to Naomi and she is in the hands of people you trust . She will survive and prosper , no matter what becomes of us . Thanks , Tuvok . Mom ! Neelix ? Computer , locate Neelix . Neelix is on the Bridge . Thanks . Strickler , we need three more phaser drills . You two , pattern enhancers and medkits . Aye , sir . We 're going to have to recalibrate these tricorders . Put us with the alpha team . Setting coordinates . Energize . Deck 1 , Bridge . Chakotay to Voyager . We found what looks like a piece of the starboard nacelle . Any sign of the shuttle itself ? Not yet . Captain , the cavern has collapsed ahead of us . However , I am reading a hull signature behind the debris . The Flyer ? . I 'll need to take a closer reading . Do it. I want alpha and beta teams to search for survivors . Tell Sick Bay to stand by for heavy casualties . Naomi ? Naomi ... Naomi ? Computer , locate Naomi Wildman . Naomi Wildman is in her quarters . Clever . Computer , resume program " Flotter , Trevis and the Ogre of Fire . " Program activated . Commander , I 'm reading duranium alloys . I believe it is the shuttle . Approximately 80 meters beneath this rubble . Life signs ? None . Commander , without life signs to lock on to , we cannot beam the crew out . Maybe we can transport the entire ship to the shuttle bay . Through 50 kilotons of bemonite ? Chakotay to Voyager . Janeway here . We think we 've found the shuttle , but we need to dig it out . Have all teams rendezvous at my coordinates . Acknowledged . Phaser drills here and here . But , hey , B 'Elanna , look on the bright side . No more day-old pizza laying around . And you 'll never have to watch another chapter of Captain Proton again . Warning . Life support has fallen to critical levels . Don 't mind the computer . She 's just jealous that I 'm spending my last few minutes talking to you . So long . Sam ... it 's your turn . I ... haven 't thought what to say yet . Tuvok , why don 't you go next ? I prefer to make my farewells in written form . Computer , begin recording . Encode message for delivery to Naomi Wildman . Acknowledged . Hi , honey . I know you 're feeling sad right now , but I want you to listen to me very carefully , okay ? First of all , I love you . Second , I want you to know that I 'm proud of you , how smart you are , how funny , how kind you are to other people . And I know that you are going to grow up to do extraordinary things . Last- - and I know this is a hard one- - try not to be scared . Warning . Oxygen depletion in ten minutes . Listen to Neelix . He 'll be taking care of you now . Bye , honey . Naomi ? Go away ! Where is she ? She doesn 't want to talk to you . You lied . I thought you vaporized . Naomi reliquefied me . Now leave . Computer , delete characters . Unable to comply . Holodeck controls have been encoded . Delete us ? I wonder if this liar can swim ? We could always hang him from one of my branches . Naomi . Please let me talk to you . It 's okay . You be nice . No more lying . Hey , there . is my mother dead ? We don 't know . What happened ? The away team was trying to avoid an ion storm . They had to land on a planet . I saw that crater . Something was burning . Plasma fires , pieces of debris ... but not the hull . Until we know for sure what 's happened , no one 's giving up on the rescue attempt . You really think they might find her ? Yes . How do I know you 're telling me the truth this time ? I ... I never told you this before ... but when I was much younger , I lost my mom in a terrible war ... my father and my sisters , too . It was the worst thing that ever happened to me . Always wondering ... How did they die ? Were they worried about me ? Could they still be alive ? I thought if I could just keep you from wondering ... you wouldn 't have to feel what I did . You were pretending that nothing was wrong ... that nothing bad happened . Do you ever pretend that nothing bad happened to your family ? Sometimes . Does it help ? Not really . Don 't be sad , Neelix . All hands to emergency stations . We 've got a level-8 ion storm approaching . lon storm ? What 's that ? The Ogre of Fire . He 's attacking us again . We 'd better get back to your quarters . Naomi . Don 't leave us . I 'll be back . I promise . Voyager to Chakotay . Go ahead . We 've got another ion storm approaching . When it hits the planetoid , your entire cavern is going to destabilize . Just a few more meters and we 'll be close enough to beam out the shuttle . How long before the storm hits ? Six minutes . Make the most of it , because it 's all you 've got . The storm is moving in . Shields down to 86 percent . Keep a transporter lock on the away team . We 'll give them till the last second . Helm , lay in a course out of here . Stand by to engage at warp 2 . Aye , sir . Warning . Oxygen depletion in two minutes . I never thought it would come down to this- - suffocating beneath kilotons of rock on some nameless planetoid . Did you envision a more heroic death ? I didn 't envision dying at all . In accepting the inevitable , one finds peace . If that 's another Vulcan saying , Tuvok , I 'll stick with " live long and prosper . " We 're here . We 're here ! Chakotay to Voyager . Yes , Commander . Pattern enhancers are in place . We 're ready to transport the Flyer . Locking on . They 're in the shuttle bay . Helm , engage . Thank you . Captain 's Log , supplemental . Ensign Wildman has recovered from her injuries and the Delta Flyer , though battered , is intact . And how are you today , Mr. Trevis ? Feeling a little stiff , my slippery friend . And you ? Well , now that you mention it , I 'm feeling a little washed out . Well , it 's about time you showed up . The tea is getting cold . Samantha ? is it really you ? Long time no see . You 're all grown up . I 'm an Ensign now . I missed you . Likewise . Well , now that everyone 's reacquainted , I bet you 're all eager for a new adventure . Now that you mention it , there is a castle that I 've been meaning to explore . Castle ? I hear a giant beetle lives there . Come on , Neelix . You go ahead . See you later . Here 's to happy endings . Captain ! Just checking on my future Captain 's Assistant . Well , right now , she 's off to conquer a giant beetle . Oh , sounds like a dangerous mission . She can handle it . She 's a courageous girl . Oh ... Did I ever tell you about the time I flooded this entire forest ? I was six years old . Flotter claimed we were in for a dry spell , so I came up with the obvious solution . Why not just divert the river ? This entire forest was a swamp by the time we were done . At which point , Stinger ... Stinger ? The biggest mosquito ...

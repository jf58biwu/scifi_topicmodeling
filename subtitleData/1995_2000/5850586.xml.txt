 Oh , yeah , baby . You know you want it . You 're dirty . Chett 's going to give you what you need . - This is way too , too ... - Sick , twisted , unholy . And then some . Oh , yeah ! I think this calls for some world class Chett humiliation . Lis . Any suggestions ? - Bad haircut ? - Bladder infection ? You guys are weak . - Yeah ! - Aah ! - Still got it , Lis . - Thanks . Here you go , bud , you earned it . Got to be yanking me ? What the hell is going on ? He wants to know what 's going on . You want to know what 's going on , Chett , for real ? Yes . Please tell me . Our friend Lisa here , is a magic genie . Hi . All we have to do is wish for something and zappo ! Lisa our magic genie makes it so . Magic genie ? Right ! What do I look like ? An idiot ? - Yeah , pretty much . - They don 't come any dumber . What the ... ? This isn 't happening , man ! - Trust me it is . - Ah ! And the best part is in a few seconds you won 't remember any of this . - I think I will remember alright . - No , you won 't . You see , Chett , Lisa 's got this nasty little number called a memory wipe . [ french speaks ] - Huh ? - Memory . Ah , right . Ow ! My memory is gone , I can 't remember anything ! Wait a minute , yes I do . I remember that you said I wasn 't going to remember anything . - And that you 're a magic genie . - Whoops . A minor glitch . Hit him again , Lis . I can 't remember anything , that I ate for breakfast . But I do remember that you 're my brother , you 're his creepy friend and you 're a magic genie . [ laughing ] - I don 't get it , Lis . - Why didn 't the memory wipe work on Chett ? I don 't know . I need time to think . Coo ! Hi , kids ! Whose your friend ? A magic genie ! Whoops ! I remembered ! Gee , too bad you can 't erase my memory with your magic powers , you magic genie . That ought to shut the little bugger up . What now ? Let 's take a look under the hood . Yuk . Chett 's skull . What 's that ? My God . It look like an alien mind control device designed to brainwash him . Actually , Lis , it 's redness , he shoved it up his nose when he was eight and the doctors said it was too dangerous to remove it . Oh , right . So , what exactly are we looking at ? See this funky sparkly thing here . Damn it , Lis , speak in English . - It 's a brain callous . - A brain callous ? I must have erased his memory so many times , he 's developed a resistance to my memory wipe . You mean from now on he 's going to remember everything ? - He 'll know you 're a genie ? - Yep . That 's it , boys . The party 's over . We can 't erase Chett 's memory ? This is a complete disaster . He 'll make our lives miserable . Lisa , maybe we 're underestimating Chett . I mean he just found out this amazing thing . Maybe he 'll understand all of Lisa 's power and treat her with the respect she deserves ? Hey , magic genie . How about a cold brew and a hot tongue bath ? Chop chop ! Okay , Chett , time out . She 's our genie , not yours . - Live with it , smirky . - I don 't think so , baby . Your tune is going to change when you experience a heaping helping of my hospitality . Ooh ! Pudding cup ! I love those things . And he 's fat free . Is that the best you can do ? - Get me a spoon . - Okay , I give ... Alright , genie chick , if that 's how you want to play I just might have to go public with my information . [ sirens ] - You wouldn 't dare . - Watch me . - Lis , I think he means it . - Lis , do something . Way ahead of you . Just so you know , I 'm a perfectly normal average , Joe . I 'm not tripping or out of my head like a loco weed , but what I 'm about to tell you is going to sound a little bit fantastic . - Uh-huh . - Okay , here it is . - See that number over there ? - Yeah . - She 's a genie , a magic genie . - I see . - She turned me into a pudding cup . - Ouch . She thinks I can 't do anything about it . But I 'm showing her . Umm ... I wonder what kind of reception he gets ? Let 's find out . Aah ! What the hell ? There 's something on my head ! Oh , really ? I hadn 't noticed . Ugh ! I can 't get it off ! She zapped it on me . See this proves I 'm not nuts . Right , right . It was classic , Lisa . Looks like our secret 's safe after all . Oh , look . It 's radio free Chett . Yeah , good one . You jokes made me look a major wacho , thanks to you I 've got group three times a week . So do we understand each other now ? You 're not the boss of me . You bet . So we 'll share the genie ? I 'm cool with that . Chett , you 're not her master , we are . Master ? Geez . Gar , not the " M " word . I can 't believe you guys think of yourselves as my masters . What Gary was trying to say was that we have an equal partnership of genie and guys who control the genie . - Control ? - Not control , no , uh , use . - Use ? - Wyatt means we order you around . I 'm out of here . You know , boys , I think I detect a slight character flaw . You 're morons . [ laughing ] Hello , Lisa . Can I call you Lisa ? No . Look , Lisa , I know you 're hurting and I feel for you , I do . Those two zit wrenchers don 't appreciate you . - Oh , and you do ? - Hell , yes . You see , we 're alike you and me . No , I mean it , people don 't understand us cause we 're different . - Special , we have so much in common . - Oh , please . No , let me show you . Our hands , they 're beautiful things aren 't they . Yours can create a rose out of thin air , mine can make coasters out of a mons ears . Gross ! Look , my point is , we both have powers that other people don 't understand . Oh , you have a power alright , the power ot make me spray . OK , you leave me no choice , babe . I know this isn 't fair but even your magic powers can fight this . Aah ! I 'm only going ot say this once , when you home . Better call me . Aah ! It 's got to be here . - What the hell are you doing ? - Ah ha ! Don 't play stupid with me , I know you 've hidden it somewhere . - Hidden ? What ? - The genie lamp . - Genie lamp ? - Genie lamp ? I 'm not stupid , grain pole . Everyone knows where genies come from . They come from magic lamps . Trust me , you 're not going to find it . - Ah ha ! - Son of a gun . Come to Daddy ! You 're all mine now ! Chett , I swear I 've never seen that thing before . Nice try . I know the score . He who controls the lamp controls the magic genie . Appear , O , genie of the lamp . You sent for me . O , wise and powerful , Master ? I demand . I stand ready to serve you . All my magic powers are at your command O , Master Chett . Ah , Lisa , what 's going on ? You 've just discovered the secret of lamp . I will grant you three , only three wishes . Then I will return to the Magic Genie Land from which I have travelled . Cha cha ! Three wishes from my own bad ass genie . Let 's see ... I wish for a million wishes . That 's a new one . Aw , you displease me . I will now retire to my lamp . When next you summon me will behove you to give your wishes some serious thought . Okay . Ah , you go take five there , slave girl . In your face , chumpniks . The mightiest magic power in the universe at my fingertips . I can do anything , go anywhere , rule the freaking planet . This calls for a beer . What just happened ? We 've been genie hoaxed . Oh ! Oh , his masters . I know we were out of line with the master stuff , we 're sorry . Won 't happen again . What 's with callous brain three wishes ? I overhead Chett talking about a magic lamp . So I figured fine , let him think I 'm his magic genie . Give him three stupid wishes and before he knows it , I 'll be gone forever . I like the plan , but I love the shoes . Do you ? I dig the curly toes . Smart yet , sassy . Now , you do know you already have three wishes . Are you sure that 's your first wish ? Yes . I want to see you naked . Okay . Hey , what 's going on ? For God 's sake cover yourself . You wanted to see me naked so you 're seeing me naked . One down , two to go . - Do you want to wish for a robe ? - Hold on . That doesn 't count . You tricked me . Gee , I 'm sorry . I must have misunderstood . Too bad . All wishes are final . I 'm on to your little game . I won 't get fooled again . Oh , Master , you look tired . Do you wish to sit down ? Yeah , thanks . Worth a shot . Nice try . Alright , let 's go down to business . Number 2 . This is a wish so simple , there is no way ever you 're going to screw it up . - So young . - So innocent . Ready , here we go . I want be ... - King of the Universe . - Okey doke . Is this it ? Am I really the king ? The one and only . Oh , yeah . Check me out . King of the Universe . Listen up . My small and pitiful minions . You , skim latto for your king . You . I dub thee " Duke of Puke " because I can . You . You 're firm yet supple , entrance me , dance with me . Hey , she doesn 't do that anymore . If I had a dime for every jerk who thought he was King of the Universe . What happened ? I thought I was King of the Universe . Oh , wait . I see the problem . - You want to be king of this universe . - Huh ? There 's more than just one universe , you know . - Oh . - I 'm serious . Watch Star Trek sometime . There 's an infinite number of universes , bonehead . - Should have been more specific . - What a rip . If it 's any consolation , the alternate universe where you 're king is populated by beautiful women that naturally secrete a hardly air like brew that must constantly like form their bodies . Well , let me limber up the royal tongue and we 'll be on our way . Bad idea . You see , unfortunately these beautiful women breathe mustard gas . You wouldn 't last ten seconds . Can you send me there for nine seconds ? Crap . Who am I kidding . - Two wishes shot to hell . - One more wish , Your Highness . If I were you I 'd make this one count . Don 't worry , this next one will be a mother . Here it is , wish number three . Just try and weezle out of this one . " I , Chester Palimine Donnelly , here after ot be know as the wisher , " must not be misinterpreted , blah blah , do hereby make my wish , " to be endowed with all the magical power abilities of you , Lisa , my genie . " You 're most clever , Master . You 've finally bested me . I have no choice but to grant your wish . - Smokin ' ! - What 's she doing ? It 's Lis , she 's got it covered . Right . Chett , do you realise once I grant your third and final wish , I 'll be gone form this world . You 'll never see me again . Yeah , but I ... Very well . With this wish , I bid thee farewell . - Chett ? - Did it work ? That answer your question , plungee . [ zaps up motorbike ] Look out , world . Magicman is coming ! - Plungee ? - Did he do something to us ? I don 't think so . Nope , you 're fine . He thinks he turned you into toilet plungers . - Why would he think that ? - Because I put him under a spell . I couldn 't give him any real magic powers , so I gave him the illusion of powers . - So he just thinks he has magic ? - Right . That way he happy and the worlds safe . - But he looks like an idiot . - A perk . - [ cars horns ] - [ Chett imitate bike noises ] Hey , babe , how 's it going ? Plenty of room for you on here . Want to ride ? Oh , get lost . So we meet again . How 's your magic genie ? I 'm the magic genie now . Fat boy , you 're beginning to bug me ! Eat my dust ! [ imitate bike ] Baby , you look good . Thanks . I try to take of myself , eat right , the ususal . Well , it shows , baby . Um , um ... We can 't just leave him in there . What 's the rush ? He thinks he 's in paradise . What say after dinner you dazzle me with another one of those fiendish hot finger dances . Well , since you ask nice . What the ... ? How did I get here ? Where 's my harem ? Why don 't I go find out what 's keeping them . Hey , on the off chance I don 't run into them , what saw we just heavily medicate you instead ? Okay , no problem . I 'll just wish myself out of here . Oh , God . I 've lost my powers . Help . If I was a betting man , I 'd say the spell just wore off . Guys . I hate to say it but I think we may have gone too far . I suppose she 's right . Can 't we just leave him in there a little longer ? He 's got shock treatment in three . Poor guy . He wanted to be king of the universe . Look at him now . He 's pathetic . Chett may be a crude , sexist jerk but doesn 't deserve this . Well , why don 't you just zap him home ? I can 't . He thinks I 've gone back to genie land . If I used my magic to rescue him , he 'll know I 'm still around . So what do we do ? Help , somebody ! I 'm chaffing ! Holy monkees ! My leige . I have travelled across space time to find you . Who are you ? I am Doug , your loyal subject from Vegas 5 . All bow down for the King of the Universe . - You mean you 've come to rescue me ? - If my king commands it . I command it ! I command it ! Whoa ! Am I glad to be out of there . I thought that back stabbing genie had boned me big time . I know not of this boning you speak , but I do know this , in my universe you are a wise and powerful king . - Were ? - Unfortunately you have been dethroned . - Dethroned ? - There was a bloody unrising , your subjects fought valiantly but alas at the moment of their greatest triumph , they choked . - You should have wished for a bush . - Ah , I was gonna , but I thought- - Wait a minute . - How did you know I had wishes ? - Whoops . I gotta go . - Hi . - You . - What are you still doing here ? - Uh , I forgot my lamp . You know what , you 've been a great sport about this . How about I give you a bonus wish ? Huh ? So let me get straight . These two nose wipes created you out of the computer . - Yep . - I 'm a state of the art Genie . Now remember , Chettler , just because you know about Lisa , doesn 't mean you can call the shots . Wyatt and I are in the drivers seat , capice ? Guess again . The only one with a licence to drive is me . Hey , relax , babe . All I can say is all the peewee adventures you have before , forget them . Me onboard , your future just became a magic logride . What do you say , girls ? Are you with me ? Huh ? Huh ? Welcome to our world . Captioned by Grant Brown

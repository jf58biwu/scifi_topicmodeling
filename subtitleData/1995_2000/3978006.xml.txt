I think that 's Heavenly Haven ! Better than prison . Jesus Christ ! Eat recycled food for a happier life ! Be kind and peaceful to each other . Eat recycled food . It 's good for the environment and ok for you . Hey , look what I got ! A little cupcake . What have we got here ? You a Judge spy , little man ? Me a spy ? This guy , he 's funny ! No . I live here ! I mean I 'll live here . If I live . Maybe I should go to a hotel . No way , man ! Don 't you hear ' em out there ? It 's block war , man ! Block war . Block war ! Like an academy simulation , right down to the cross fire ! I lead off , you follow . This is no sim , rookie ! You will stand down and wait for backup ! Hershey and Brisco in position ! We 're under fire from the upper floors . Inside Heavenly Haven . Request backup ! Level Y , yellow , repeat ! Nearest Judge ! Holly crud ! He knows what he 's doing . I am the law ! Drop your weapons ! These blocks are under arrest ! This is your final warning ! Judge Dredd ! Hey ! You wanna be afraid of somebody ? Be afraid of me ! I got it ! Why don 't I run down there and surrender ? Sorta throw him off guard ? Bad idea . - Hey , Dredd ! Come and get us ! I knew they 'd do that . - Take cover ! They 're firing 20 millimeter caseless flechet rounds at 300 meters . The effective lethal range is 200 meters . You 're safe ! What are you doing there , Judge Hershey ? Waiting for backup . It 's here . Move it out ! Keep it simple , single file , standard relay , I 'm point . You 're last . Grenade ! Meet me on the 40th ! - Hey , get some more ammo ! Be kind and peaceful to each other . Eat recycled food . Hey , you guys with us ? - Yeah ! All right ! - Move out ! This room has been pacified . - Next one 's mine ! No ! This room is under arrest . No ! You 're under arrest ! Throw down your weapons , be prepared to be judged ! Judge this ! Lawgiver man ! - No ! Don 't , they 're booby trapped ! Holy drock ! - Auto rapid fire . Armor piercing ! Drop dead , Dredd ! Double whammy . Mega City Municipal code 2-13 , willful destruction of property . 2 years . Code 3-10 , illegal possession of assault weapons . 5 years . Code 4-57 , resisting arrest , 20 years ! And code 36-13 . The first degree murder of a Street Judge . Let me guess . Life . Death . Court 's adjourned . 53 hospitalized . 5 of them children . 19 dead . Damn it ! I 'm supposed to be watchin ' out for him . Don 't blame yourself , Hershey . He made the mistake , not you . Wouldn 't it feel good to have an emotion ? Emotions . There outta be a law against them . Halt ! You have 5 seconds to surrender ! - Dredd , it 's just a servadroid . Five , four , three , two , one ! Boy , am I glad to see you ! Mega City Municipal Code 75-92 . Willful sabotage of a public droid . That 's 6 months , citizen . Your Unicard ! Come on , give me a break , Judge Dredd . Dredd ? Holly God ! H. Ferguson , hacker . Illegal tampering of droids , computers , cash machines , taxis . And not even out of jail for 24 hours . He 's habitual . Automatic 5 year sentence . How do you plead ? - No guilty ? I knew you 'd say that . - 5 years ? I had no choice ! They killed each other ! - You coulda gone out the window . 40 floors ? It woulda been suicide ! Maybe ! But it 's legal . Judges ! Five years , Aspen Penitentiary ! Case closed . Take him away ! Don 't close the case ! You 're misjudging me ! Open the case ! And if he told the truth ? Never heard of extenuating circumstances ? I 've heard it all , Hershey . I knew you 'd say that . My fellow Judges , have we forgotten the lessons of history ? However quickly these block wars can be contained , it 's clear : they 're becoming an epidemic ! We should deal with it at once . A tougher criminal code is the only solution ! Our situation gets worse every day . 73 citizen riots in 16 different sectors in the last two months alone ! - Violent crime is rising at 15 percent every quarter ! If we don 't increase our resources , they will be inadequate . In less than three years . - Three years ? They are inadequate now ! My fellow council members . As a city , we continue to grow . Growth is painful . 65 million people living in an area designed for no more than 20 ! It 's not enough that they rely on us for food , clothes , water , for clean air . Chief Justice . The city is in chaos ! For social order we need tighter reins ! Incarceration didn 't work as a deterrent . I say we expand execution to include lesser crimes ! My fellow Judges . I was barely in my teens when I put on this badge . When it comes time for me to take it off , please , let me do so knowing that it still stands for freedom . And not for repression . 53 hospitalized . 19 dead ! 4 of them killed by a gang of squatters , who were themselves killed in summary executions by Judge Dredd . As my special report continues I take you behind the scenes of the halls of Justice . With a probe into these recent riots and block wars . Coincidence or deliberate ? Dredd ? Joseph . - Chief Justice Fargo . You may stand at ease , Joseph . So tell me , seven summary executions ? Were they necessary ? Unavoidable , sir . - Unavoidable . Life doesn 't mean much to some people any more . You 'd see that if you weren 't ... If I weren 't what ? - Always at the Academy , sir . Oh , don 't you mean at the Academy wiping cadets ' asses ? That 's what they say in the squad room . - It 's irrelevant . You set the standards . Well , now you do . Well , at least to many young cadets you 're a legend . Sir . You remember your days as a cadet , Joseph ? - I remember what you taught me , sir . You were my finest student . So I got a new assignment for you . Starting tomorrow , you 're going to spend two days a week at the Academy . I 'd be honored , sir . Unarmed combat or marksmanship ? - Ethics . Remain still . Identify yourself . - Miller . Warden . Voice sample recognized . Thank you , Warden . So why are you here ? You come for another chat ? Just a short one , I 'm afraid . Duty calls . Ah , duty . Feeding these parasites here ? At the public 's expense ? Yeah . You especially . I don 't cost anything ! I 'm a ghost . And we 're both prisoners here . You 're behind your desk . And I 'm behind this . What a clever reward from Fargo . I mean considering the services . When you started killing innocent people , Rico , you went beyond service . The innocent exist only until inevitably they become perpetrators . Like you . Guilt and innocence is a matter of timing . Your , our mysterious benefactor has sent you a package . Deactivate shield . Auto guns only . What is that ? - That 's an ancient puzzle that contains the meaning of life . So tell me , Rico . What is the meaning of life ? It ends ! Activate alarm ! Voice not recognized . Guns are training . No ! Secure good ! Three , one , two . Come on ! Kevlar-9-helmet and body armor . Yours when you graduate . Lawgiver 2 . 25 rounds of side arm with variable voice programmed ammunition . Signal flare ! Yours if you graduate . Mark-4-Lawmaster , improved model . With dual on-board laser canons , vertical take-off and landing flight capabilities . Range : 500 kilometers . Men ? Yes , sir . Yours if you can ever get it to work . All of these things you see here are toys . At the end of the day . When you 're all alone in the dark . The only thing that counts is this . The law . And you will be alone when you swear to uphold these ideals . For most of us is death on the streets . For the few of us who survived to old age . The proud loneliness of the Long Walk . A walk that every Judge must take outside these city walls . Into the unknown of the Cursed Earth . And these spend your last remaining days taking law to the lawless . This is what it means to be a Judge . This is the commitment I expect . Class dismissed . I can hear you thinking . I caught your lecture today . You think the cadets really need to hear that ? I told them the truth . - Your truth maybe . You made it sound like our lives are over ! Don 't you think ours are , Hershey ? I have a personal life . I have friends . You 're the smartest one of the new breed . You 've only been on the street a year . You haven 't gotten use to the isolation yet . No . I don 't think that 's right . No one is supposed to be always alone . Is that really been what it 's been like for you ? Have you never had a friend ? Yes . One . What happened ? Dredd ! Wait . I want to know . What happened ? I judged him . 2 loads from the prison factory in hold 1 . We 're closed for the night . You 're holding a package for me . The code name is Lazarus . I 'll just be a second . You got a nice place . Yeah . A lot of this is antiques . That 's funny . I thought they destroyed all these ABC Warriors during the war ? Well , you can still collect ' em . As long as they 're non-functioning . Like my wife . Yeah , these must be 50 or 60 years old . Anyway . There you go . Hey , wait a second ! Don 't touch it ! Why is that ? - Why it 's a Lawgiver . That 's programmed to only recognize a Judge 's hand . It 'll take your arm off ! Gee . How do you like that ? I must be a Judge . Happy Birthday . Status ? How ' bout bodyguard . Commander ? - Rico . Mission ? - Mission ? We 're going to war . War . I followed up some grumblings confirming a suspicion of mine . The cancer of oppression goes far deeper . - You 're going to say that over the air ? It 's the truth . - Vardis , you 're insane . I 'm a reporter . They 'll never let this get on to the air . This could bring down the Council . Maybe it should . The whole system is the problem . Not just Judge Dredd ? No ! Ok , baby , up we go . Ok , hang on to your seat , cuz here we go ! Step outta the car , please . - What the hell 's the problem now ? Get outta the car ! Unicard , please ! Did you hear me ? Unicard ! Mr. Susa . You have a suspended license . 3 counts of driving under the influence . Hey ! You better listen ! I suggest you walk away and bother somebody else ! I have powerful friends , I mean powerful ! Are we having a problem here , Hershey ? - Not at all . Nothing that I can 't handle . Suspended license . Three DUIs . - That 's getting boring . What 's the tab ? How much ? You name your price . Hershey , call control for an H-wagon . - What ? You 're gonna tow me ? Towing if for a first violation . That 's your 4th , bar breath . How do you plead ? Not guilty . - I knew you 'd say that . Hey , wait a second . What are you doing ? - Grenade . - No ! Happy motoring . Subtle . Judge Joseph Dredd ! Dredd . You 're under arrest . - What 's the charge ? Murder . Joseph . - Sir ? Is it true ? - I 'm innocent . The Council 's said to have irrefutable proof . - You believe that ? Let there be a full tribunal . Do you believe that , sir ? I just needed to look into your eyes for myself . I 'm sorry I asked . I would never do anything to disgrace you . I 'll use every resource to find out . Have you selected someone to defend you ? - Judge Hershey . - Why Hershey ? At the Academy she was at the top of her class in interpretation of the law . And I trust her . The facts will come out at the tribunal . I 'll personally make sure of that . Sir ? I 'm sorry about this . Dredd ? No ! Stop video . The video is prima facia evidence that the defendant is guilty as charged . Mark it peoples ' exhibit A. - Objection , your Honor . This video is inadmissible as evidence . If I may begin in a moment to explain . Please do . I have an affidavit from Nathan Olmeyer , currently a junior at the Academy . He has been acknowledged by every one of his instructors to be an expert in digital and video graphics . The surveillance video , as his affidavit states , is of such low definition . No positive identification can be made of the killer . The uniform of a Judge can be counterfeit . And the badge can be duplicated . Neither the video nor the audio in this presentation identify the accused . I repeat my objection to this video being allowed as evidence in this case . And I ask for a ruling . Objection sustained . The video is inadmissible . Yes ! Admit it , Dredd . - What ? You 're impressed . Very . - You owe me . I have to move to technical information of a criminal nature . I will need the court 's permission to access top secret documentation with the help of Central Computer Bank . - You may proceed . Central , are you on line ? - On line , Judge McGruder . I wish you to access weapons schematic . Please describe the working of the standard Judge 's sidearm , Lawgiver 2 . Model 2 is coded to the personal DNA of the Judge using the weapon . By the skin 's contact with the grip . Did you know it ? - No . - The DNA is from my medical files and upgraded automatically when the weapon is reloaded . When a round is chambered , the projectile is tagged with that relevant DNA . The defense was not made aware of this . Judge Hershey ! The prosecution must be given time to finish . Central , were the bullets recovered from the bodies of Vardis and Lily Hammond so DNA coded ? Yes , Judge McGruder . It could not be otherwise . What was the result of the computer check of the DNA on those bullets ? The DNA 's a perfect match for Judge Dredd . A lie ! The evidence has been falsified ! It 's impossible ! I never broke the law ! I am the law ! We have no case ! - You 've gotta believe me ! You have to believe me ! Say it ! Your Honor , the prosecution rests . The tribunal needs to confer . What have I done ? How could I have been so wrong ! Dredd ! Both of them homicidal ! This time it will be impossible to cover up ! Chief Justice . We carefully buried the Janus project . Nine years ago . Along with Rico and all his victims . No one 'll ever learn of your involvement . The media knows how close I am to Dredd . They 'll find the truth . The best excuse to ruin what government we have left . Your motives are pure . You thought Dredd was different , that 's why you spared him . A mistake which may bring down the Judicial System . There is a way out , Chief Justice . If you 'll forgive me . The Long Walk . That 's a death sentence , Judge Griffin . Mine . Your retirement grants you the power to save Dredd 's life ! This gesture may also allow Janus to remain a secret . In the charge of premeditated murder , this tribunal finds Joseph Dredd guilty ! As charged . Joseph Dredd , you 're aware of the law allows only one punishment for your crime . Death . However , it has long been our custom to carry out the last order of a retiring senior Judge . And so ... I step down . - No ! - I can 't believe it . As I leave to take my long walk into the Cursed Earth I ask that this court honor my last order . Be lenient with Judge Dredd . In gratitude for his years of service . We will so honor this one , Judge Fargo . Dredd ! Step forward ! The sentence shall be life imprisonment ! At Aspen . To be carried out immediately ! As it is written ! - Justice Griffin ! The trial was a farce ! I demand an appeal ! You will accept the court 's decision , Judge Hershey ! Dredd , I 'm so sorry . I let you down . You did your best , Hershey . Thank you . Let the betrayer of the law be taken from our courts ! Let his armor be taken from him . And all his garb of justice . Let him be stricken from our hearts and our memories for ever ! Let his name be recorded in every place of honor . Let him take the law he served so well to those who have it not . Let him be written . In our hearts . And our memories forever . Judge Hershey . Ah , there 's gotta be some . What 's this ? Baby Dredd ? Ah , I can 't believe you were ever a baby . Who 's this ? Chief Justice Griffin . It 's got a nice ring to it . - We were supposed to meet a place safe ! What 's not safe ? Your reporter 's dead , right ? Fargo 's on his walk . Dredd 's in Aspen . So what 's not safe ? - It 's unfortunate Hammond had to be silenced . He 'd find out about Janus . But I coulda used Dredd . - Forget Dredd ! There is no Dredd ! Let me tell you what Dredd worships . He worships the law ! He 'da blow you away ! The minute he found out how much you 're pissin ' on it ! Yeah . Let him see what it 's like to freeze his ass off in Aspen ! Let him see what it 's like to be me ! There 's a lot of work to be done . Janus ? Well , where is it ? You 'll see it ! - When ? Soon enough ! In the meantime , I want chaos , Rico . That block war was just the beginning ! Now I want fear racing through every street ! Then the Counsel will have to turn to me . And to Janus ! You want fear ? I 'm fear . You want chaos ? I 'm the chaos ! You want a new beginning ? Here ! I am the new beginning ! Dredd ? Don 't hit me ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Don 't hurt me . What are you doing here ? I was convicted of a crime . Wrongly convicted . Really ? That 's kinda weird . What are the odds ? Two wrongly convicted guys ? Sitting right next to each other ! You got the sentence the law required . Five years ? Just for saving my own ass ? That was a mistake . - The law doesn 't make mistakes . Really ? Then how do you explain what happened to you ? You can 't , can you ? Great ! Mister " I-am-the-law " can 't ! So maybe this is some kinda typo ? Maybe it 's a glitch ? Or maybe it 's poetic justice ! So someone 's comin ' , Pa ! Praise the Lord for bringing us this generous bounty . My sons . Gather the harvest . So maybe you 're here as some sorta field trip ? Yeah . Maybe this is as some sorta surprise party ? Gonna catch me some city boy ! Knife ! Knife ! It 's payback time , Dredd ! Dredd ! What 's happening ? By a blast of God they parish ! And by a breath of his nostrils are they consumed . Hallelujah ! Central , I need you to access database . I want you to run an ID on this man . Scanning for identity . Unknown male . Approximately 200 centimeters tall . Skin tone three . Ten , nine , eight . Central . Hello ? This terminal has been disconnected from the main system . This is Capture Team . No sign of Dredd . He appears to have survived the crash . You are in error , Capture Team . No one survived the shuttle wreck . The pilot , sir . He 's alive . No one survived the shuttle wreck ! Do I make myself clear ? - Yes , sir ! Am I dead ? Am I dead ? I 'm dead . Awake ? Good ! We 're running outta sinners ! Oh my God ! Dredd ! Do something ! - Dredd ? You talk too much . Can it be ? The great man of the law himself . Oh Lord , you have blessed us indeed ! Judge . Rat . Dredd . You creeps are under arrest . - Is that so ? Let me crush him , Pa . Excuse me , we 're not together . Allow me to introduce you to my family . There 's Link , my oldest . Bite me . - Hi ! My youngest , Junior . - Howdy . - Hi ! And this here is Mean . We had to make some alterations when he was a child . Well , the Cursed Earth 's a tough place on young folks . I now have him set on one . I don 't suggest you make him angry . The legendary Angel family . Cursed Earth pirates , murderers , scavengers . And of course , scumbags ! - Oh , how to win ' em over ! Did I leave something out , Pa ? Let me kill him , Pa . I want his ears . - I want his teeth ! Does that come with a fork handsome ? Hallelujah , brother ! - Wait a minute ! Can it be ? Can it be that from the City of the Fallen we have one of the faithful ? Amen , brother ! Praise the Lord ! I 'm a believer ! We have a believer in the gallery ? - Yes ! Cut him down ! - Go tell it on the mountain ! - Fergie ! You 're making a big mistake . Well , maybe the law doesn 't make mistakes , but I 'm free , and you 're toast . Actually , you 're toast ! I forgot to mention it : your new friends they 're cannibals . You 're cute ! - Fresh meat ! Prepare the supplicant for sacrifice ! Wait ! You can 't eat me ! I 've got eczema ! I 've got warts ! I 've had gonorrhea ! Eat Dredd , he works out ! It 's been fun . Law man . Mean ? Finish Dredd . My pleasure , Pa . - Come on ! Kill him ! - Come on , Junior ! Guilty ! Dredd ! Look out ! Dredd ! Get up ! Well , we did it . We got ' em all ! Pussies ! Is that all you got ? They are dead , right ? Have you been crying ? - No ! I 've got something in my eye ! Have you ever had allergies ? Dredd ! Look out ! Chief Justice ? - Joseph . Together again . Together again , sir . No ! God ! Not again ! You 've got three strikes , lawman . Strike one ! Strike two ! Strike three ! Lawman , you 're too late ! You killed Junior ! You got Link ! He who killed my Pa ! Mega City Municipal Code 47-22 . Illegal use of city electricity . How do you plead ? I knew you 'd say that ! Graphics analysis , now . Olmeyer , you stupid futz ! I can 't ... You analyzed the wrong viewie . This one ! I don 't believe it ! You just wasted three hours ! If this is the wrong picture , why is it a fake ? What ? - Look ! It 's full of anomalies , really clever ones , too ! Somebody must have used a CGI terminal and a scan quad to make this state of the art . 20 years ago . Are you saying that this isn 't real ? Yeah . Look . I 'll drop out all the artificial pixels . Dad . Mom . Foreground . Background . All fake . The only thing that 's real is the baby . The blind lady . Who is she ? - Justice before your time . We should have never taken Justice out of their hands . You put order to chaos , sir . - Yeah . That we did . Solved many problems . And created many more ! Being a Judge , Joseph , you unite perhaps too much power in one person 's hands . We once tried to compensate . Created the perfect Judge . We called it Janus . Four decades ago , DNA samples were taken from the original Council . One was chosen : mine . We altered it to enhance the best qualities . And to screen out the worst weaknesses . Frailties . We created you . You didn 't create me , sir . I have a family . - No . At the Academy you said they were killed when I was very young . - I lied . I have a picture of them . - They 're a fake . We lied to both of you . Both ? In that experiment another infant was created . But something went wrong . Genetically mutated to the perfect criminal . I have a brother ? - You were best friends at the Academy . Star pupil , and then he turned . And for his crimes , you judged him . Rico ? Rico ! You let me judge my own brother ? You never told me , sir . - I couldn 't ! You were like a son to me . A son ? My whole life is a lie . Rico had to be executed . To protect you . To protect the city . Rico . He 's alive ! No . I signed the order myself . I saw the report . I didn 't kill Hammond . It was him ! It was his DNA that convicted me . Griffin . It was Griffin ! Griffin , yes . - We 've both been deceived . I 'm so sorry . Rico 's killed me and destroyed you . Find them , Joseph ! Don 't die . What do we do ? What do we do ? Find Rico . Welcome to Janus . Ah , Rico , I think you know Dr. Hayden . I remember you . Justified in front of the Council that I was insane . And therefore innocent . I tried to save you . - You insulted me ! Because I knew exactly what I was doing ! Then and now . Miss Hayden has been a loyal supporter of this project for a long time . She 's kept it alive for me . I 'm sure you 'll find her expertise invaluable . Excuse me ? That 's useless if you can 't get into Central 's Janus files because the Counsel has ' em locked ! - Leave it to me ! Meanwhile , you 've work . On the streets . Ilsa will help you . - I don 't need to help . Thank you . I thought you said he was created here by the finest scientists of Mega City ? A bold experiment . A patchwork child . Let 's not bicker ! We 're all committed to do the same thing ! An ordered society . You 'll have your new order . Attention , all Judges ! Reporting unrest . Code D 9-2-4 . Downtown sector twelve . Backup requested ! My boy . Dredd , there 's no way in ! Hello ? Have you been listening to me ? We can 't just knock on the wall and say , " Hello , Cursed Earth pizza . " There is a way in . Six years ago , two refugees figured it out . The vent to the city 's incinerator . There 's a burst twice a minute . That means you could run through that tube and have 30 secs before it flames again . And these refugees made it through , right ? Actually , they were roasted . But the theory 's sound . Maybe we should consider other theories ? I 'm in green quad 4-11 . Need a pick-up ! Copy , Hershey . I have Central for you . Patch it to my Lawmaster . Oh my God ! The latest report : 96 Judges assassinated ! Someone knows our procedures , our security measures , even our scrambled frequencies ! No Judges on the streets riots break out . We can 't replace those Judges ! Even if we put the cadets on the streets ! There is a solution . Project Janus . The Council tried to play God once before . If this wholesale slaughter of Judges continues , there won 't be a Council ! Janus could . - Janus could what ? A new bath of test tube babies won 't solve this crisis ! We don 't need reliable Judges 20 years from now . We needed them today ! Accelerated growth incubators are more developed now . We could create adult subjects . I 'm only asking to unlock the Janus files . That way we at least have an option ! If the Council decides not to go forward , I 'll accept that decision . And resign . You ready , kid ? - No ! Now what 's wrong ? What 's wrong ? Did this helmet compress your brain ? You 're going to get me killed ! There 's a maniac loose in the city ! - What a coincidence ! One 's out here , too ! Oh ! - Great time I 'm having ! The shuttle crash ! The Cursed Earth ! Cannibals ! And now a fireball up my ass ! All your fault ! - My fault ? Yes ! - You care to explain that ? If you hadn 't arrested me , I wouldn 't be here in the first place ! Hey Dredd , why don 't you just kill me now ? That 's it ! I 'm through schlepping ! I 'm going to stay here until I 'm caught . Or until you apologize ! - The law can 't ! That 's just it ! You 're not the law anymore ! Now apologize ! I deserve that ! I 've never apologized . Now run ! 30 , 29 , 28 , 27 ! Run ! - 25 , 24 , 23 , 22 , 21 , 20 , 19 ! Dredd ! Dredd ! Dredd ! No ! Run ! I 'm alive ! I 'm alive ! Oh , so are you . Esposito , Carlos . Council Judge . Authorize access to file . Code name Janus . Acknowledged . McGruder , Evelyn . Authorize access to file . Code name Janus . Acknowledged . Silver , Gerald . Authorized access to file code name Janus . Removing security blocks now . Awaiting password command from Chief Justice . Password : " origin " . Janus file open . I 'm lost . Is this the bathroom ? - Hey . Now you have to admit , I helped out on that one . I mean that was all me , baby . Central , using current technology , how long would it take for Janus to produce a fully grown adult subject ? Using genetic engineering , an adult subject could be incubated in approximately 8 hours . - We could replace our losses in a day ! Madness ! Dredd . - Silence ! Dredd . Dredd ! - Silence ! It 's inhuman . It 's not for this Counsel to play God ! No , Griffin , restore the security blocks . It seems none of you have the force of will that these times require . Central . Leave Janus unlocked ! Griffin , this is treason ! You have just sealed your fate . No ! You have just sealed yours ! Rico ! Who says politics is boring ? Hey , Dredd . I thought it was you ! That 's right ! Cover your ears ! Joseph ! Get outta here ! Now ! Oh , you son of a ... - No ! You 're under arrest , Griffin . - Really ? Stop him ! He killed the entire Counsel ! Move it out ! - Dredd , tell them I 'm innocent ! Come on , Fergie ! Come on ! You 're a lot of fun to be with , Dredd , you know that ? What do you do ? Now what so we do ? Hope it works ! Shit ! - Work ! Dredd , you may want to wash this seat after we get off the bike . Sorry . Dredd ! Cover the rear ! - I never fired a gun ! What kinda criminal are you ? - A nice criminal . Nothing 's happening ! - You got to cock it first , moron ! You didn 't say anything about cocking ! She 'll not get her cleaning deposit back ! I mean that 's for sure ! It doesn 't pay to be one of your friends . Sorry ! Hands against the wall ! You know the drill . Who are you ? - Dredd said ... - Shut up ! What happened ? - Why don 't you tell me ? We 're dying out there ! 148 Judges in 48 hours ! What the hell is going on ? Do you think I 'm part of this ? - I don 't know who or what you are ! I would never do anything to her . Nothin ' . All right . You tell me about him . You make me believe in you like I did when I defended you ! His name is Rico . And he 's my brother . The DNA sample has been taken out of frozen stasis . Ready for cloning process . We got a slight change of plans here . I want to take the existing DNA sample right now and trash it . Activate this DNA sampling counsel . What are you doing ? - Central ! Take this DNA sample ! Now ! - This wasn 't part of our plan ! Griffin would have never authorized this ! Griffin got to be my keeper by putting me behind bars . What 's your excuse ? He said I had no feelings and no emotions . Now you know why . - Dredd . Look at me . The Janus Project didn 't do that to you . You did that to yourself . Sorry , guys , I 'm getting nowhere with your terminal ! But I fixed the microwave . Is this a bad time ? Hey , look , I tried dialing everything I could think of to find this Janus thing . It isn 't in the program ! Nowhere ! Nothing ! They won 't put it on the computer network , but they need power . They 've to steal it . So check every sector for blackouts and sudden power surges . Let 's stay here longer ! - Wait a second ! There was a big power surge just before they blew up my Lawmaster in sector 4 ! Three blocks wide ! The last time I felt something like that they shut down the whole power grid . - But they moved the statue of Liberty and put it on top of it . - Could we go ? Dredd ? That 's twice you owe me . Rico ! Dredd got away from the hunters . He 's about to be seriously outnumbered . Right , Central ? Affirmative . The new DNA samples have been multiplexed . And the gametes are already diving . - New sample ? You left that DNA there for over 30 years . Somebody has to clean out the fridge . We made the sample from the best specimens on the Council of Judges ! What did you replace it with ? No . My God . You know you should congratulate me because I 'm about to become a daddy . And you 're being very rude ! You don 't know what you 're doing ! - The next batch of Janus Judges are going to be my brothers and sisters ! And mine to control ! - Just stop all this ! Central ! Help me ! I 'm sorry , Chief Justice , the ABC robot is not tied into my main processors . That 's right , Griff . You know you got to get with this high-tech stuff ? Robot ! Rip his arms and legs off . - No ! And you save his head for last ! I don 't want him to miss anything ! You stay here . - I wanta go with you . You need me to shut down the Janus system . We 're a team ! We could use some work , but we 're still a team . I 'll handle it . - I bring you luck ! Luck ? You are still alive , Dredd . - Hm . I 'm getting a signal . Jesus Christ ! Get back ! Dredd ! Drop the gun . Robot ? On the count of three , break her neck . One , two . No ! Hershey . I 'm still here . How romantic . Step inside . He looks a lot like you . He is a lot like me . - I 'm nothing like you . The only difference about us is : you destroyed your life to embrace the law . And I destroy the law to embrace life . And speaking of life . Send in the clones . Behold . This is where you were born . You feel that magic ? You must have known . All along . You were different . Fergie ? Are you still alive ? - Technically yes . Your brother and your sister will be born in two hours . One big , endless supply of perfection ! We have a choice . We can stand here and create a whole race of goddamn brainwashed morons . And call them Judges ! Or create some free-thinking people ? We 'll call them human . Human . You could never control yourself . What makes you think you can control these things ? Because you 're in control . You 'll be head of the Counsel . You choose . And you choose quickly , too . I shall put you down myself . Personally . You know , I never understood that ! Why did you judge me ? Why ? - You killed innocent people ! The means to an end ! - A massacre ! A revolution ! - You betrayed the law ! No ! I betrayed this ! You are Counsel 's experiment which failed ! In you ! I was your brother , blood and friend ! Who betrayed who ? When will you stop being the goddamn slave and grow up ! That 's your birth right , your family ! I 'm your family ! The only family you had ! Now choose ! The best thing that you can do : kill me . Why ? Because it 's your only chance , brother ! Fido ! Rip this bitche 's arms and legs off ! Save her head for my brother ! - No ! Halt ! Rip his head off instead ! Give it to her ! What 's a matter with you ? Rico ! Boy , is he pissed ! - Fergie ! Dredd ! Hack you , asshole ! Rico ! Central , hatch the first set of clones ! - The process is not finished . The clones will be only 60 % complete . I need reinforcements ! Hatch the goddamn clones ! Now ! Fight girls much ? Do ya ? Bitch ! Judge Bitch ! I 'm the only one who never lied to you . I 'll be the Judge of that ! Now , Joseph Dredd , I hereby judge you . The charge : betraying your flesh . Guilty ! And the charge of being human ! When we coulda been Gods ! Guilty . The sentence is death . - Don 't miss . Lethal rounds exhausted . Phaser flare ! Court 's adjourned . Dredd ! Give me your hand . Stand back , Hershey . Am I under arrest ? That won 't be necessary . Central broadcasted Janus plan after Griffin 's death . They all know the truth . Judge Dredd . We have to reconstitute the Counsel . We would like you to consider the first position of Chief Justice . I 'm a Street Judge . Mr. Olmeyer . I 'm dying . I 'm too young to ... Excuse me ! Oh , that 's great , he 's the number one ! Dredd ? I told him everything he knows . Dredd ? That 's it ? A mere death experience and no goodbye ? - Goodbye , Hershey . It goes without saying that I kiss better . Ow ! Come on , guys , let 's get going ! Feels good to be human , don 't you think ? I knew you 'd say that .

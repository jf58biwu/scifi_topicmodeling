WE 'D HAVE ROLLED OUT THE RED CARPET AND HAD YOU PIPED ABOARD WITH FULL HONORS IF I 'D KNOWN YOU WERE COMING . WELL , I DON 'T LIKE SECRECY ANY MORE THAN YOU DO , CAPTAIN , BUT SOMETIME IT 'S UNAVOIDABLE . OF THE 120 MEMBERS OF EARTH SENATE , ONLY A DOZEN OF US WERE OFF PLANET WHEN EARTH WAS HIT BY THIS DADGUM PLAGUE . THE DRAKH WOULD LOVE TO WIPE THE REST OF US OUT ... AND LEAVE EARTHGOV ISOLATED , BEHIND THE QUARANTINE ZONE . BUT THIS MISSION HAS RISKS OF ITS OWN . BUT THIS MISSION HAS RISKS OF ITS OWN . WHAT KINDS OF RISKS ?

TILL WE 'RE DONE . AND WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE DOING , SENATOR ? ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW NOW IS THAT THIS MISSION IS URGENT AND MUST NOT BE DELAYED . ONCE YOU SET COURSE , WE DON 'T STOP FOR ANYONE , ANYTHING ... OR FOR ANY REASON . OR FOR ANY REASON . THIS IS DELTA ONE TO BABYLON CONTROL . DO YOU READ ME ? OVER . DO YOU READ ME ? OVER . REPEAT . THIS IS DELTA ONE TO BABYLON CONTROL . DO YOU READ ME ? DO YOU READ ME ? THIS IS CAPTAIN ELIZABETH LOCHLEY , EARTHFORCE , TO ... ANY SHIP IN THIS SECTOR ... I 'M WOUNDED . MY SHIP IS BADLY DAMAGED .

IT 'S A FINE SHIP , CAPTAIN . IT COST THE FOLKS BACK HOME A WHEELBARROW FULL OF MONEY , BUT GIVEN WHAT 'S HAPPENED , I 'M GLAD I VOTED TO SUPPORT FUNDING THE PROJECT . ACTUALLY , SIR , YOU VOTED AGAINST IT . ACTUALLY , SIR , YOU VOTED AGAINST IT . DIDN 'T YOUR DADDY EVER TEACH YOU NOT TO CONTRADICT YOUR ELDERS ? NO , SIR . WELL , I SEE PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE . WELL , I SEE PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE . DOCTOR ? GOOD . DOCTOR ? GOOD . THIS IS SENATOR JACOB REDWAY AND MR. WILLIAMS . THEY WANTED TO SEE YOU . HOWDY , MA 'AM . ACTUALLY , I WANTED TO SEE YOU . IS THERE SOMEPLACE THAT--THAT WE CAN TALK ... PRIVATELY ? YES , MY OFFICE , BUT- - I 'M SURE THAT 'LL BE JUST FINE . OH , DAVID , UH , YOU 'LL BE NEEDIN' TO TAKE THIS WITH YOU . HERE 'S THE ACCESS CODE . NOW ... LIEUTENANT , WHEN OUR GUESTS SHOWED UP , DID THEY GO THROUGH THE USUAL I.D. PROTOCOL ? YES , SIR , BUT SENATOR REDWAY DID INSIST ON LOGGING ONLY NAME AND POINT OF ORIGIN . WHY ? I 'M WONDERING WHY A CIVILIAN IS TRAVELING ON A CLASSIFIED MISSION WITH A HIGH-RANKING EARTH SENATOR ALONG AS A NURSEMAID . ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT I LOG ONTO EARTH-NET AND FIND OUT WHAT I CAN ABOUT HIM- - PROFESSION , AGE ... ? I 'M NOT SUGGESTING ANYTHING . BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT BREACH IN PROTOCOL . I UNDERSTAND . I WOULDN 'T DREAM OF ASKING YOU TO- - DAVID WILLIAMS . AGE 32 . BORN PATTERSON , NEW JERSEY . AMERICAN STATE . A PLUMBER . A PLUMBER ? AS IN FIXING DRAINS ? THE SENATOR MUST BE AWFULLY INSECURE ABOUT OUR FACILITIES . CAPTAIN , WE 'RE GETTING AN AUTOMATIC DISTRESS SIGNAL IN NORMAL SPACE . IT 'S ... WEAK . BARELY GETTING THROUGH . IT COULD BE A STAR FURY OR A MILITARY TRANSPORT . PREPARE TO JUMP TO NORMAL SPACE . I 'M SORRY , CAPTAIN , YOU CAN 'T DO THAT . I AM REQUIRED BY EARTHFORCE REGULATIONS TO INVESTIGATE ANY DISTRESS BEACON FROM ONE OF OUR SHIPS . I 'M WELL AWARE OF THE REGS , CAPTAIN , BUT , UH , THIS TIME ... YOU 'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO LET SOMEONE ELSE DEAL WITH IT . BUT BY THEN , WHOEVER 'S OUT THERE MIGHT DIE FROM LACK OF OXYGEN . IT 'S AN AUTOMATIC DISTRESS BEACON . THE PILOT COULD BE DEAD OR ... IT COULD BE A TRAP . EITHER WAY , REACHING OUR DESTINATION ON TIME IS CONSIDERABLY MORE IMPORTANT . SENATOR , THIS IS MY SHIP , AND IT 'S MY RESPONSIBILITY . I INSIST ! INSIST ALL YOU WANT , BUT YOU CANNOT ISSUE A DIRECT ORDER TO ME OR ANY MEMBER OF MY CREW . IT MUST COME THROUGH THE CHAIN OF COMMAND . AND YOU HAVE YOUR ORDERS , STRAIGHT FROM THE JOINT CHIEFS ! YOU ARE NOT TO STOP FOR ANYONE OR ANYTHING FOR ANY REASON ! FOR ANY REASON ! WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT STOPPING ? WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT STOPPING ? LIEUTENANT , JUMP TO NORMAL SPACE . AYE , SIR . AYE , SIR . GETTING SIGNAL LOCK ON DISTRESS BEACON . ONE STAR FURY . DISTANCE : 5,000 KILOMETERS . READING ONE LIFE SIGN . BARELY . MAINTAIN HEADING . SLOW TO ONE-THIRD . CAPTAIN , EVEN AT ONE-THIRD SPEED , IF WE LAUNCH A RESCUE TEAM , THEY WON 'T BE ABLE TO CATCH UP WITH US AND DOCK SAFELY . WE HAVE TO COME TO A RELATIVE STOP . MAINTAIN COURSE , SPEED , AND HEADING . WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU 'RE- - THEEXCALIBURUSES A GRAVITETIC PROPULSION SYSTEM . AS A BYPRODUCT OF THAT , WE HAVE ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY AND INERTIA DAMPENERS IN THE LANDING BAY THAT HELP A DAMAGED OR OUT-OF-CONTROL FIGHTER LAND SAFELY . BUT , SIR- - YES , LIEUTENANT ? THAT SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO BE USED WITH SHIPS UNDER SOME POWER AND COMING IN ON AN APPROACH VECTOR . TO GET THAT STAR FURY INSIDE THE LANDING BAY WE 'RE PRACTICALLY GOING TO HAVE TO RUN HER OVER .

STAR FURY CAPTURED . NO DAMAGE REPORTED . GOOD . JUST FOR THE RECORD , SENATOR . ONCE UPON A TIME , I WAS AT THE OTHER END OF A DISTRESS BEACON LIKE THAT , WONDERING IF SOMEONE WAS GOING TO COME FOR ME . AND I WAS LUCKY , SOMEONE DID . SO I WILL NEVER TURN MY BACK ON A DISTRESS BEACON . NOT FOR YOU , NOT FOR ANYONE . NOT FOR ANYONE . NOT EVER . JUMP TO HYPERSPACE , LIEUTENANT . AYE , SIR . AYE , SIR . SO I WAS STILL WORKING ON THE MINING COLONY ON OMEGA 7 WHEN- - WHEN THE DRAKH ATTACKED , BUT I WAS DUE TO GO HOME IN JUST A FEW DAYS . THEN YOU 'RE LUCKY . IF YOU 'D HAVE GONE BACK TO EARTH A FEW DAYS EARLIER , YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE PLAGUE . NOW , AT LEAST , NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS , YOU 'LL SURVIVE . THAT 'S THE POINT . SEE , THAT 'S WHY I NEED YOUR HELP . I WANT YOU TO INFECT ME WITH THE PLAGUE . I WANT YOU TO INFECT ME WITH THE PLAGUE . GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN , CAPTAIN . GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN , CAPTAIN . HOPE I 'M NOT BOTHERING YOU . THEY TOLD ME YOU WERE AWAKE . NO , NO , THAT 'S FINE . NO , NO , THAT 'S FINE . WHAT HAPPENED ? UH ... WE 'D SET A TRAP FOR SOME RAIDERS THAT HAD BEEN HITTING CIVILIAN TRANSPORTS . LET 'S JUST SAY THERE WERE A HELL OF A LOT MORE OF THEM THAN WE EXPECTED . HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN OUT ? LITTLE OVER 2 DAYS . YOU WERE IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE WHEN WE FOUND YOU . DR. CHAMBERS FELT THE BEST THING WAS TO KEEP YOU OUT UNTIL YOU GOT PAST THE WORST OF IT . 2 DAYS ? NO , I GOT TO CALL B-5- - I 'M AFRAID THAT WE CAN 'T DO THAT . NOT FOR A WHILE LONGER ANYWAY . NOT FOR A WHILE LONGER ANYWAY . WE 'VE BEEN RUNNING SILENT EVER SINCE WE STARTED OUR APPROACH TO SECTOR 100 . EVER SINCE WE STARTED OUR APPROACH TO SECTOR 100 . SECTOR 100 ? EARTH ? EARTH ? WHY ? I CAN 'T TELL YOU THAT .

NEVER EAT ANYTHING BIGGER THAN YOUR HEAD . NEVER SHOOT POOL AT A PLACE CALLED " POP 'S . " NEVER EAT FOOD AT A PLACE CALLED " MOM 'S . " THE MISSION IS CLASSIFIED , CAPTAIN . I DON 'T EVEN HAVE THE FULL STORY MYSELF . AS SOON AS I CAN FILL YOU IN , I WILL . UH , I 'M HAVING YOU MOVED TO THE INFIRMARY . UH , IT 'S MORE COMFORTABLE , AND I 'M TOLD WE 'LL NEED THE SPACE . WE 'LL DROP YOU AT BABYLON 5 AS SOON AS WE CAN . MEANWHILE ... CONSIDER THIS A SURPRISE VACATION . [ BEEP BEEP ] YES ? Matheson : APPROACHING THE RENDEZVOUS POINT , CAPTAIN . I 'M ON MY WAY . AAH . AAH . PERHAPS , UH , YOU 'LL JOIN ME FOR DINNER ONCE YOU 'RE UP AND ABOUT . WILL YOU BE SERVING ANYTHING BIGGER THAN MY HEAD ? NOT ON A FIRST DATE , CAPTAIN . NOT ON A FIRST DATE , CAPTAIN . IT 'S A STRANGE THING , LIEUTENANT . IF I CLOSE MY EYES , I CAN SEE EVERY DETAIL OF THE EARTH 'S SURFACE AS CLEARLY AS WE 'RE SEEING IT RIGHT NOW . BUT AFTER MY FATHER DIED , I TRIED TO REMEMBER HIS FACE . BUT IT ALWAYS SLIPPED AWAY FROM ME . WHY IS THAT , I WONDER ? MAYBE IT 'S BECAUSE WE CAN 'T DECIDE WHICH FACE TO REMEMBER . WHICH FACE TO REMEMBER . THE FACE OF OUR FATHER WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN , THE FACE OF OUR FATHER THE FIRST TIME WE LEFT HOME , THE FACE OF OUR FATHER THE LAST TIME WE SAW HIM . THEY ALL BLUR TOGETHER . WE LOSE THE DETAILS ... BUT EARTH IS CONSTANT . EARTH IS FOREVER . YOU 'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE HAVING THOUGHTS THIS OLD , LIEUTENANT . TO BE HAVING THOUGHTS THIS OLD , LIEUTENANT . WE 'VE GOT AN ATMOSPHERIC SHUTTLE ON APPROACH VECTOR . ON APPROACH VECTOR . THAT 'S OUR PACKAGE . SENATOR , STANDING ORDERS FROM THE PRESIDENT REQUIRE THAT ANY SHIP TRYING TO LEAVE THE QUARANTINE ZONE WILL BE SHOT DOWN . ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF , CAPTAIN . SHUTTLE IS EJECTING A LIFE-POD . SHUTTLE IS EJECTING A LIFE-POD . [ BOOM ] [ BOOM ] THE RECORD WILL SHOW THAT THE SHUTTLE MALFUNCTIONED DURING A TEST OF ITS AUTOMATED SYSTEMS . HAVE THE LIFE-POD BROUGHT ABOARD . NEGATIVE , SENATOR . THAT POD IS CONTAMINATED . I REFUSE TO ENDANGER MY CREW BY LET- - I TOLD YOU THERE WERE CERTAIN RISKS INVOLVED , CAPTAIN . BUT WE 'VE MADE SURE THAT THOSE RISKS ARE KEPT AT AN ACCEPTABLE LIMIT . THE OUTER SKIN OF THAT LITTLE OLD LIFE-POD 'S BEEN COMPLETELY STERILIZED AND CERTIFIED ... FREE OF CONTAMINATION . AND WHAT ABOUT WHOEVER 'S INSIDE ? AND WHAT ABOUT WHOEVER 'S INSIDE ? WELL , GUESS YOU 'LL JUST HAVE TO OPEN IT UP TO FIND OUT . OPEN IT SOMEWHERE SAFE . OPEN IT SOMEWHERE SAFE . SEND OUT A PAIR OF MAINT-BOTS . BRING IN THE POD AND PUT IT IN MEDBAY ISOLATION . USE THE NEGATIVE PRESSURE BASE , HIGHEST DECONTAMINATION PROTOCOL . THEN JUMP TO THE SECONDARY LOCATION . BUT YOU SAID- - I HAVEN 'T MET A POLITICIAN YET WHO WOULD ENDANGER HIS OWN LIFE WHEN HE CAN GET SOMEONE ELSE TO DO IT FOR HIM . IF HE 'S STAYING ON BOARD WHILE THIS THING COMES IN , IT MUST BE REASONABLY SAFE . LET 'S FIND OUT WHAT THE HELL 'S GOING ON . LET 'S FIND OUT WHAT THE HELL 'S GOING ON .

Senator Redway : CAPTAIN GIDEON , DR. CHAMBERS , MAY I INTRODUCE DR. STEPHEN FRANKLIN . HEAD OF XENOBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH AT EARTHDOME . WELCOME ABOARD , DOCTOR . ARE YA ALL RIGHT ? YEAH . YEAH , I--I THINK SO . IS THE PATIENT HERE ? UH , DAVID WILLIAMS . NO , HE 'S IN HIS QUARTERS- - HOLD ON ! WHAT DO YOU MEAN , " PATIENT " ? CAPTAIN , WE- - HE DIDN 'T TELL YOU THE NATURE OF THE MISSION , DID HE ? NEGATIVE . I TOLD YOU HE HAD TO BE INFORMED . I TOLD YOU HE HAD TO BE INFORMED . YEAH , WE THOUGHT IT WAS TOO GREAT A RISK . YOU KNOW , WE HAVE TO CONSIDER INTERPLANETARY SECURITY , DOCTOR . INTERPLANETARY SECURITY , DOCTOR . DAMN IT , SENATOR ! THAT WAS THE DEAL , RIGHT ? DAMN IT , SENATOR ! THAT WAS THE DEAL , RIGHT ? CAPTAIN , BEFORE WE CAN STOP THE VIRUS LEFT BEHIND ON EARTH BY THE DRAKH , WE FIRST HAVE TO IDENTIFY IT . NOW THAT MEANS TRACING A COURSE OF INFECTION FROM THE MOMENT OF CONTAMINATION TO SEE HOW IT SPREADS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM . BUT THE VIRUS , ONCE IT WAS RELEASED INTO EARTH 'S ATMOSPHERE , IT QUICKLY SPREAD TO EVERY AIR-BREATHING CREATURE . NOW , ONCE INSIDE THE HOST 'S BODY , THE VIRUS MUTATES QUICKLY , AND WE CAN 'T FIND IT AGAIN . WE NEED A BASELINE STUDY TO MONITOR THE TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS , AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT ... IS TO INFECT SOMEONE AND FOLLOW THE VIRUS AS IT ENTERS HIS SYSTEM . AND FOLLOW THE VIRUS AS IT ENTERS HIS SYSTEM . MR. WILLIAMS . MR. WILLIAMS . Computer : CONNECTING . [ BEEP BEEP ] DAVID ? DAVID , MY GOD , WHERE ARE YOU ? I CAN 'T EVEN TELL YA , BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW I AM COMING HOME . BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW I AM COMING HOME . [ SCRAMBLED AUDIO ] [ SCRAMBLED AUDIO ] David 's voice : I AM COMING HOME . I AM COMING HOME . SET COURSE TO INTERCEPT ... AND NOTIFY THE FLEET . AND NOTIFY THE FLEET . DON 'T DO THIS , DAVID . NOT FOR ME . I AM NOT DOING THIS FOR YOU . I AM DOING IT FOR ME . [ DOORBELL CHIMES ] I HAVE TO GO . I HAVE TO GO . I LOVE YOU . I LOVE YOU . I LOVE YOU . OPEN . OPEN . MR. WILLIAMS . THOUGHT I HEARD VOICES . YES , I--I- - I WAS WATCHING A VID . IT 'S--IT 'S TO HELP TAKE MY MIND OFF- - IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN HELP YOU WITH , CAPTAIN ? DR. FRANKLIN SAYS THAT YOU VOLUNTEERED TO BE INFECTED WITH THE DRAKH VIRUS AS A HUMAN GUINEA PIG TO TRACK THE INFECTION , BUT HE DIDN 'T TELL ME WHY . PERHAPS YOU COULD . BUT HE DIDN 'T TELL ME WHY . PERHAPS YOU COULD . I--I 'D--I 'D--I 'D RATHER NOT , CAPTAIN . THIS IS MY SHIP . IF I ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE , IT 'S ON MY CONSCIENCE . I WON 'T SANCTION THIS UNTIL I KNOW WHY YOU 'RE DOING IT . I WON 'T SANCTION THIS UNTIL I KNOW WHY YOU 'RE DOING IT . THAT 'S CAROL . THAT 'S CAROL . HER , UH ... HER NAME IS CAROL MILES . HER NAME IS CAROL MILES . WE , UH , WE MET WHEN WE WERE BOTH WORKING THE OMEGA 7 MINING COLONY . THE OMEGA 7 MINING COLONY . FELL IN LOVE . FELL IN LOVE . ABOUT 7 MONTHS AGO , SHE WAS REASSIGNED BACK TO EARTH . AND RIGHT BEFORE SHE LEFT , I ... ASKED HER TO MARRY ME . ASKED HER TO MARRY ME . SHE SAID YES . SHE SAID YES . AND THEN THE DRAKH ATTACKED , AND--AND- - AND BEFORE I KNEW IT , THE WHOLE PLANET WAS QUARANTINED . WE HAVE SET A DATE , CAPTAIN . I AM GETTING MARRIED IN A WEEK , AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT I 'M GONNA MISS MY WEDDING . I 'M NOT GONNA LET THAT WOMAN DOWN . I 'M NOT GONNA BREAK MY PROMISE TO HER . YOU SEE , THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN DO THAT , THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET THROUGH THE BLOCKADE , IS IF I AM CONTAMINATED . MR. WILLIAMS , IF YOU DO THIS , YOU COULD BE DEAD IN LESS THAN 5 YEARS . AHH ! CAPTAIN , I COULD BE DEAD TOMORROW . WE ALL DIE . WE ALL DIE . I CAN 'T LIVE WITHOUT HER . AND I 'D RATHER LIVE 5 YEARS WITH HER , THAN A HUNDRED YEARS WITHOUT HER . THAN A HUNDRED YEARS WITHOUT HER . CAN 'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ? CAN 'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ? MAYBE SOMEDAY , IF I 'M AS LUCKY AS YOU ARE . MAYBE SOMEDAY , IF I 'M AS LUCKY AS YOU ARE . [ TAPPING ] [ TAPPING ] YOU ALWAYS THIS QUIET WHEN YOU 'RE WORKING ? HEH . WELL , ONLY WHEN I 'M TRYING NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT . WELL , ONLY WHEN I 'M TRYING NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT . WHEN THE TIME COMES , I 'LL PUSH THE BUTTON THAT WILL MIX THE AIR BETWEEN THE OTHER ISOBAY AND MY OWN . I DON 'T WANT YOU DOIN ' IT . I 'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE . NO , IT 'S NOT THAT . NO , IT 'S NOT THAT . I JUST DON 'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO HAVE IT ON YOUR CONSCIENCE , THAT 'S ALL . ON YOUR CONSCIENCE , THAT 'S ALL . HAS THERE BEEN ANY LUCK WITH ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS ? MAYBE WE CAN AVOID- - NO , THE VIRUS WORKS DIFFERENTLY ON EVERY SPECIES IT INFECTS . FINDING THE CURE FOR GUINEA PIGS ONLY SAVES GUINEA PIGS . NOTHING ELSE . THE ONE THING IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT IT INFECTS ALL AIR-BREATHING MAMMALS . IS THAT IT INFECTS ALL AIR-BREATHING MAMMALS . WE HAVEN 'T EVEN BEEN ABLE TO ISOLATE THE DAMN THING . WE HAVEN 'T EVEN BEEN ABLE TO ISOLATE THE DAMN THING . WE KNOW IT 'S AIRBORNE , BUT FINDING SOMETHING SO SMALL IN SUCH A HUGE BODY OF AIR- - DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE . WE 'VE GONE AS SMALL AS A 50-MICRON SCREEN , WE STILL CAN 'T FIND IT . WE STILL CAN 'T FIND IT . BUT WE KNOW IT 'S THERE . Gideon : HOW ? Gideon : HOW ? THE DAY THE VIRUS WAS RELEASED , 850 PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD DIED OF A RARE STRAIN OF EBOLA VIRUS . ONE WE 'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE . THEY ALL GOT SICK AT THE SAME TIME , AND THEY ALL DIED ROUGHLY AT THE SAME TIME . 2 OF THEM WERE ON AN ISLAND IN THE PACIFIC WHERE THE VIRUS COULD NOT HAVE POSSIBLY REACHED , BECAUSE NO ONE HAD COME TO THE ISLAND FOR 2 WEEKS DUE TO A HURRICANE . DUE TO A HURRICANE . 48 HOURS LATER , ANOTHER 712 TOTAL STRANGERS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD , ALL DIED OF A PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN STRAIN OF HEPATITIS B. OTHERS FOLLOWED . THIS TOLD US THAT THE SAME VIRUS WAS OPERATING ALL AROUND THE WORLD AT THE SAME TIME , GOING THROUGH PROGRESSIVE CHANGES , MUTATIONS , AS IT ADAPTS TO OUR BIOLOGY . IT KEEPS POPPING UP IN DIFFERENT FORMS . THAT 'S HOW WE GOT THE 5-YEAR FRAMEWORK . ODDS ARE IT 'LL HIT THE RIGHT MUTATION WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD OR SO COMPLETELY DECIMATE THE ENTIRE POPULATION THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR THAT THERE WON 'T BE ENOUGH PEOPLE LEFT ALIVE TO MERIT BEING CALLED HUMANITY . IT 'S ALSO POSSIBLE WE HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT VIRUSES ON OUR HANDS . WE HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT VIRUSES ON OUR HANDS . I KNOW . AND IF THAT 'S TRUE , WE MIGHT AS WELL START LIGHTING 10 BILLION FUNERAL PYRES , BECAUSE WE CAN KISS THE HUMAN RACE GOOD-BYE . BECAUSE WE CAN KISS THE HUMAN RACE GOOD-BYE . SO , UH ... SO , UH ... THINGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE DESPERATE BACK HOME . HENCE , THIS . HENCE , THIS . AS DOCTORS WE SWEAR AN OATH THAT WE WILL DO NO HARM . AS DOCTORS WE SWEAR AN OATH THAT WE WILL DO NO HARM . AND NOW I HAVE TO PUSH A BUTTON THAT WILL SENTENCE A MAN TO DEATH IF I CAN 'T FIND A CURE . IF I CAN 'T FIND A CURE . AND I DON 'T KNOW IF I CAN LIVE WITH MYSELF . AND I DON 'T KNOW IF I CAN LIVE WITH MYSELF . IT 'S A DAMN HARD THING , CAPTAIN . IT 'S A DAMN HARD THING , CAPTAIN . DAMN HARD THING . DAMN HARD THING .

Matheson : THEY 'RE READY FOR YOU , SIR . I 'M ON MY WAY . I HAVE TO GO . OH , AND , UH , CAPTAIN , IF BY CHANCE I SHOULD RUN INTO ANY OF THE MEDICAL STAFF , SHOULD I MENTION HAVING SEEN YOU ?

Dr. Chambers : WE 'RE READY TO PROCEED . Dr. Chambers : WE 'RE READY TO PROCEED . ALL RIGHT , DAVID , THIS IS HOW WE 'RE GOING TO DO THIS .

WHICH I 'M RELEASING EVERY TIME I EXHALE . NOW , IN A MOMENT , I 'LL OPEN AN AIR VENT BETWEEN YOUR ISOBAY AND MINE . NOW , THE SERIES OF INJECTIONS WE GAVE YOU EARLIER WILL ALLOW US TO SCAN YOU ON A MOLECULAR LEVEL .

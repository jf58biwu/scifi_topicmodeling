 A war in which rivers ofblood flowed in trenches ... for a few yards of advancement . A cold , modern war born from ancient nationalist hatred . A war which saw the introduction of awesome technological weapons - the machine gun ... the armored tank ... nerve gas . And yet , on December 24 , 1914 ... German , British and French soldiers climbed out of their trenches ... to meet in no-man 's-land to peacefully celebrate Christmas . They sang Christmas carols , exchanged cigarettes and autographs ... posed for pictures ... buried their dead . The silence remained throughout Christmas day . In the following three years , nearly eight million would die . And less than two decades later ... the same armies would be engaged in the greatest loss ofhuman life in history . The world had never seen anything like it before . And 149 years later to the day ... it 's impossible to imagine ever seeing it again . [ Alarm Blaring ] [ Beeping ] Bandits ! 2 : 00 , 6 : 00 ! - [ Explosions ] - [ Alarm Continues ] I got it . 6 : 00 ! 6 : 00 ! Come on ! Come on ! Get some ! Red Devil , this is Wild Card . The enemy is superior . We 're tight on your 5 : 00 . Tight on your 5 : 00 . Bend over , chiggie man . - [ Alarm Blaring ] - We 're hit ! [ Groaning ] - [ Groaning ] - [ Alarm Blaring ] Engines one , two , four and five are out ! Mayday ! Mayday ! [ Nathan ] The main port engine 's grinding us in an introverted spin . It 's venting fuel . Shut it down and it might not fire up again . [ Cooper ] That freeye-dried burrito is talkin 'to me . ! Shut down main port engine ! Burn primary and vernier R.C.S. Thrusters to stabilize ! Negative ! It 'll take all the thrusters fuel ! We can 't land ! We 'll roll forever ! Lose consciousness ! Well , fire those thrusters ! Burn ' em now to stabilize in four ... three , two , one ... now ! - [ Beeping ] - Shut ' em down ! Vansen , shut ' em down ! - I don 't have to . We 're out of fuel . - [ Alarm Stops ] - So much for the thrusters . - [ Beeping Stops ] [ Vomiting ] Hey , good flying . You did the right thing . [ Buttons Clicking ] [ Nathan ] Home Base , this is Wild Cards . Come in . Repeat . Home Base , this is Wild Cards . Come in . - [ Beeps ] - [ Static ] Radio 's dead . [ Man ] Yes , sir , I definitely saw it . The ship in front of the 58th took a hit , then they got it . Left engine . - No , man , right engine . - Right . Left . They 're toast . No , man , we got a Mayday after they got hit . - Where 's the communications officer ? - [ Both ] Over there . - Left . - Right . [ McQueen ] You got a Mayday from the 58th ? Yes , sir . I confirmed they received our signal , but they never responded . Transmitter could have been damaged . Or there could have been no one left to respond . I want your radio receiver 's log . Get me the 58th 's last known position . Do it ! Inform Commodore Ross I want 10 S.A.R. Teams formed immediately ... - to be deployed in 30 mikes . - Aye aye , sir . [ Kelly ] Four out of 10 momentum wheels are down . Main propulsion system 's inoperable . Partial pressure O2 sensor 's at 24 kilopascals . [ Vanessa ] Main on board computer ... [ Sighs ] Is singing with Elvis . - We 're dead . - Without a computer , we 're on our own . I guess it won 't be the first time . Damphousse , radio ? - Left high gain antenna damage is nominal . I think I can - - Get on it . - Right . - Fuel cell damage ? Extensive . Solar arrays are inoperable . Fuel cells , secondary batteries were low when the dogfight started . We 're gonna have to shut down some electrical systems in order to save power ... for cabin air , thermal control , the radio , if it 's working . Without propulsion , we won 't need telemetry , navigation . But if we 're getting home , it looks like someone 's gonna have to find us . Make it happen . [ Typing ] Twelve minutes after midnight . Christmas . [ McQueen ] Wild Cards , this is Queen 6 . Wild Cards , this is Queen 6 . Queen 6 , this is Wild Cards . Queen 6 , this is Wild Cards . Wild Cards , this is Queen 6 . - Respond . - Queen 6 , this is Wild Cards . Queen 6 , this is Wild Cards . No response , sir . And the T.D.R.S. System confirms our signal has been received . Have it pinpoint the location of the signal reception . The linking tracking satellite was taken out in the firefight . So what you 're saying is they can hear us , but we can 't hear them . Sir , just because a signal is being received ... doesn 't mean there 's anyone around to receive it . They 're out there . I can feel ' em . [ Static ] [ McQueen ] We believe your radio to be in receive-only mode . We 're presently conducting search and rescue operations in the Procyon System . I know you 're out there . Hold on . Don 't lose faith . [ Beeps ] We 're not in the Procyon System . We 're far from it . - [ Paul ] We got knocked out in the firefight . - We 're dumping ' in the river . That must be Hawkes 's way of trying to say that we 're up a creek without a paddle . Well , he 's almost right . If we were on Earth ... our ship would seem to be going through the Eridanus Constellation . A river of stars . When I was a kid ... in the winter , it 'd get dark real early . On my way home from basketball practice , I 'd see Eridanus in the sky . It gave me comfort to see it return every year ... to know some things never went away . We 're gonna go away we can 't do somethin ' . If Wang knows our position , we can send out a bistatic LI DAR flare . If they find it , they 'll know our actual position . B.L.F. Canisters are fired out of pulse cannons . We haven 't the power . Look , we could drop it out of the air lock . It 's better than nothing . It isn 't better than nothing . Our position is beyond the Von Braun line . We 're in no-man 's-land ... falling towards enemy territory . A flare will just announce our presence to the Chigs . Colonel , you 've requested 10 S.A.R. S to search for the 5-8 in the Procyon region ? - Yes , sir . - That area was just subjected to an intensive aerial engagement ... one from which our heavily armed ships were forced to retreat . - I cannot dispatch 10 lightly armed - - Then send five , sir . The battleship Charles Lacy Veach is under attack . We have been ordered to provide all possible - Then send one , sir . I 'll fly it . Colonel , searching for them with a hundred ships in that vast a region of space ... is the equivalent of trying to find a specific drop of water in the Mississippi River . As long as I know that drop is there , sir , I 'm gonna try to find it . You can have three ships . No fighter support . And the first sign of any Chigs , they are to get the hell out of there . Aye aye . Thank you , sir . [ Shivering ] Cabin temperature is dropping . Secondary power is running low , that 's why . If I were at home in New York tonight ... we 'd all be around the fireplace right now . At this rate , in a couple of hours , we 'll be below freezing . - [ Static ] - McQueen . # # # # [ " Batman Theme " ] What the # # Batman # # - It 's that old TV show ... where one guy 's like a bat and the other one 's like a bird . # # Batman # # - I liked that show . - # # Batman # # Wow ! I guess we caught a lucky break . A good TV show before drifting off into eternity . [ Chuckles ] If we ever get home , we should chip in and get McQueen a good therapist . - That 's not McQueen . - # # Batman , Batman # # Television signals have been inadvertently beamed into space since the 1940s . - We 're probably just intercepting it - - [ Engines Thumping ] [ Thumping Continues ] Chig fighters ! This is it . What the hell was that ? Those were fighters , not scouts . Maybe they wanted to be home for Christmas . Must have taken us for dead . No . They 're like a cat that 's got a mouse by the tail . Coop 's right . I don 't know why they took off , but they 'll be back . Chigs always finish the job . Look , I know this is weird , but under these circumstances , I don 't want to not do it . And I don 't want you guys to feel weird about it , all right ? I had been hiding them in here , so I just happened to have ' em . Shane . I don 't know what to say . - You shouldn 't do this . - I just happened to have them . It 's no big deal . Just pretend that there 's a big Christmas tree with lights ... and dinner cooking in the kitchen and a big bag for the wrapping paper ... and we are far from this dark , cold box , and it 's safe and warm ... and the Whos in Whoville are singing " Dah-Who-Dor-Eh , Dah-Who-Dor-Eh " - Just open ' em . L - I wish it could have been a necklace or something , but ... we are light-years away from home and that 's all they had in the Saratoga P.X. Shane , it 's beautiful . Thank you . They 're engraved . " To ' Phousse . Hoo-yah ! Christmas , 2063 . " It 'll be an honor to stab a Chig with this . Mm . Uh , Nathan , you 're hard to buy for . You don 't have too many interests outside of Kylen . [ Chuckles ] I guess I shouldn 't have put it that way . [ Vanessa ] Well , let 's face it . Nathan is a little different from the rest of us . You , Wang , Winslow ... we all joined the Corps because we wanted to be life-takers and heartbreakers . Coop , he was sentenced to the Corps , but he 's got it in him . - West doesn 't have it in him . - Oh , yes , he does . [ Shane ] And he 's got a lot more than that . Nathan is notjust some guy pining away for his girlfriend . She 's become his faith . Something that he would die for because he believes it 's right . - Are you going to open yours , Coop ? - What 's it for ? It 's a Christmas present . Listen , I , um , I never told you guys this ... but I kinda took off from the invitro educational facility ... before they taught us stuff like this . So , all I know about Christmas is that there was one day out of the year in Philadelphia ... that everything was closed and it was a headache ... and it was lonelier than usual . Coop , Christmas is the celebration of the birth ofJesus Christ . Actually , it 's the continuation of the Roman festival of Saturnalia . Jesus of Nazareth was born on September 15 , 7 B.C. - Nazareth and Christ , now who are those guys ? - It 's one guy . [ Vanessa ] And He was born in Bethlehem . A star directed three wise men from the East ... who believed the son of God had been born . And this " star " was actually a rare alignment between Jupiter and Saturn ... or possibly a supernova or maybe even a comet . He was conceived through the miracle of Immaculate Conception . His mom and dad didn 't ... do it . The myth of Immaculate Conception . Be like an InVitro ? - You gonna open your present , Paul ? - Shane , it 's , uh ... it 's really nice of you to do this , but I , uh , I can 't take this . It 's just I-I really don 't believe in it anymore . - That never stopped my family from opening gifts . - Well , it stops me . Paul , you cross yourself before every mission . It 's superstition . It 's habit . It 's-It 's like my Chicago Bears T-shirt . Something happen to make you feel this way ? With all the death we 've seen in the last six months . The things I 've ... done ! How can you believe in all this garbage ? [ Vanessa ] Shut it off ! - [ Shane ] Don 't touch it . ! - [ Screams ] - Oh ! It - It 's frozen ! - The bolts are brittle . They 're breaking . West , decrease O2 / N2 control valve to 400 KPS ! Lockhart , get those pipes secured , now ! Maybe some warm water . [ Shane ] Look , even if we had hot water , it would only cause these pipes to crack more . It 's comin ' off the hard way , Kelcher . Coop . Come on . - [ Ripping ] - [ Screams ] It 's all right . It 's all right . - We probably lost about two hours of O2 supply just now . - More . Everyone 's to limit their movement . I know it 's probably impossible , but some sleep would help . Yeah , that way we don 't have to see the Chigs coming . I 'll pull watch on the radio . Oh , no , it 's okay . It 's just-just that you got me something makes me feel good . Oh , Coop . You may have run away from that InVitro facility ... but you do know what it 's all about . Queen 6 , this is S.A.R. 1 . We got a negative on any sighting of the 58th , visual or LIDAR . Permission to sweep area 300K M.S.K. S from sight of dogfight . Roger that , S.A.R. 1 . Colonel , here 's the optical disc you requested . Queen 6 to Wild Cards ... this is your interstellar disc jockey , Colonel McQueen . Here 's a little something I 'd like you to hear . It occurred 95 years ago last evening . It 's a message to the Earth from the first men to orbit the moon . It 's not my Christmas present . That 'll be to get you home . [ Man ] " In the beginning , God created the Heaven and the Earth . " And the Earth was without form and void . " And darkness was upon the face of the deep . " And God said , ' Let there be light . ' And there was light . " And God saw the light , that it was good . And God divided the light from the darkness . " [ Man # 2 ] " And God called the light Day ... " and the darkness He called Night . " And the evening and the morning were the first day . " And God said , ' Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters ... " let it divide the waters from the waters . ' " And God made the firmament , and divided the waters which were under the firmament ... " from the waters which were above the firmament : And it was so . " And God called the firmament Heaven . And the evening and the morning were the second day . " [ Man # 3 ] " And God said , 'Let the waters under the Heaven ... " be gathered together into one place . " And let the dry land appear : And it was so . " And God called the dry land Earth , : " And the gathering together of the waters called He seas : And God saw that it was good . " And from the crew of Apollo 8 , we close with good night ... good luck , a merry Christmas ... and God bless all of you , all of you on the good Earth . [ Static ] [ Beeping ] [ Pulsating ] [ Pulsating Continues ] [ Pulsating Stops ] Chigs ? A comet . And it 's approaching at an angle and a direction that 's on a direct path with this ship . How did you know it was there ? I don 't know . Those numbers mean anything to the star charts ? [ Sighs ] Sorry , Colonel . We had a little off-duty Christmas Eve party in the astronomer 's quarters . Some corporal tried to make scotch out of his aftershave ... and these charts are all looking like nothing but a bunch of white dots . There are men and women out there who will never have the chance to have a hangover again ... if you don 't get those white dots focused . Did you locate the source of the transmissions ? They 're not from any frequency used by the Armed Forces , even classified frequencies . And the Morse code , it 's weird . It 's like broken English . Like someone who doesn 't quite know it . All our pilots and crew know it inside and out . It could be a distress signal . Any reports of civilian activity in the Procyon region ? You 'd be looking in the wrong area . These coordinates indicate the position of the comet Yanelli-Wimberly . That 's closer to Epsilon Eridanus . A short burn from the main engine could take us out of its path . We 'd run the risk of tumbling again with no thrusters to stabilize . - This code is weird . - I 'm telling you guys , it was really weird . It 's like I could feel , even through the radio ... that the sender wasn 't human . [ Vanessa ] Are you sure you recorded it correctly ? Look , everybody 's exhausted , okay ? We 're freezing - What do you mean , did I get it right ? There 's a comet barreling down on us we wouldn 't know about if I didn 't get it right ! Wanger , why don 't you let me take a shift on that radio . - I 'm fine . - [ Shane ] Hey , take a break , Paul . - I 'm fine . ! - Take a break , Paul . - [ Static ] - Wild Cards , this is Queen 6 . As your position remains undetermined to us at present time ... we 're reporting the presence of a comet ... bearing 89 degrees by 15 degrees ... 0 - niner in the Eridanus region . See , they intercepted the same signal . - Think it could be an enemy trap ? - A trap ? They would 've blown us out of the sky when they flew by us . Maybe they just wanted to save their missiles and let this comet do the work . [ McQueen ] 5-8 , we 're still out there searching . Don 't let down . I 've , uh , got a message here from the commodore . [ Glen ] I won 't insult you by wishing you a merry Christmas , 5-8 . I 'll say it to your faces when you return . Now , this may not be proper conduct for a commander ... but given the circumstances , I , uh - And , no , I am not drunk . # # # # [ Guitar : Blues ] # # # # [ Humming ] # # # # [ Humming Continues ] That 's " I 'll Be Home for Christmas . " - [ Pulsating ] - M-Move it ! Coop , move it ! Move it . You 've even got a problem with a Christmas song ? Shut up ! Shut up ! - [ Pulsating ] - # # [ Stops ] - [ Nathan ] What was it ? - Some scientific language . Rudimentary . As if Einstein were trying to explain relativity to a child . Give me a minute . I know what it is . Telemetry data ... orbital mass , ISSCV mass ... speed , pitch , yaw ... azimuth . These are directions on how to get trapped into an orbit of the approaching comet . It 's trying to tell us how to hitch a ride . - What good would that do ? - Well , it 's heading away from enemy territory . In fact , back towards the Saratoga . We could drop a B.L.F. Canister once we got into friendly territory . Can it be done ? Asteroids and comets have been known to have orbiting satellites . But if we follow these signals , we 'll be going on complete - faith . What needs to be done ? It would require an approximate 56 second burn from the main left engine . Less than 56 seconds , we 'll miss the comet 's gravitational range . Fly deeper into Chig territory . More than 56 seconds will take us right into the comet . Hey , we 're gonna get nailed by it anyway . And the one thing is ... well , the primary one thing is ... the engine can 't be fired in its current position . - So much for that . - Well , we could try to manually adjust its position . That would require an E.V.A. We 've only got one suit with 15 minutes O2 supply . - I 'll do it . - I 've E.V.A. ' d before . - It 's my idea . - We don 't know whose idea it was . - Wang goes . - Why Wang ? I have faith in him . - I want you to have this , Paul . - Nathan , I - I can 't . You all said it yourselves . It means more than just a photo tag now . And you could use it . Let 's do it . [ Air Hissing ] Twelve minutes . [ Groans ] - The mechanism 's jammed . - [ Beeps ] Eight minutes . - Oh , yes ! - [ Clapping ] Hoo-rah ! I 'd like to dispatch a Navy LC with a squadron of SA-43s to the comet 's region . - You and I both know where that signal originated . - It 's an enemy transmission , sir . Probably disinformation . They 're aware we 're conducting a search and rescue . That 's why the fighter escort for the rescue vehicles , sir . Why doesn 't one of us come out and say what we 're afraid these signals could be . Setting up an ambush ? Presenting us with a gift . I wouldn 't bet on that . But I do believe it is something to go on toward finding the 58th . Dispatch the LC and the 32nd Squadron to comet Yanelli-Wimberly . Comet - 72,000 kilometers and closing . Bearing 7-5-niner . Roger that . Main port engine pressure is at 80 % . We are go for burn . Reset the flight clock . - It 's crucial we have a burn time of 56 seconds . - Roger that . Less than that we miss it . More than that , we 're all gonna have a hell of a headache . We 're reissuing partial power here . Telemetry and guidance are history . This whole thing 's off-line . We 're gonna have to fly manual . Don 't worry , I 'll guide you . Or anyway , the stars will . Ninety seconds to burn . Thirty-five mikes depletion of N2 / O2 supply . Let 's worry about that at two mikes . Eighty seconds . [ Sighs ] Seventy seconds . [ Vanessa ] Sixty seconds . " And when I shall die , take him and cut him out in little stars . " And he will make the face ofheaven so fine ... " that all the world will be in love with night ... and pay no worship to the garish sun . " Thank you , Shane . Forty seconds . Okay , let 's get lit . [ Vanessa ] Thirty seconds to ignition . Yaw axis , 10 degrees ... pitch axis , 20 - 24 . [ Vanessa ] Twenty seconds . Ten seconds to burn . Nine , eight ... seven , six , five ... four , three , two , one , ignition . ! Steady . Sixteen degrees . Ten degrees . Fifteen , 16 , 17 ... 18 , 19 - Come on . All right , adjust two degrees by one degree ! 45 , 46 ... 47 , 48 - Main engine off . It won 't shut down ! We 're over ! [ Man ] Queen 6 , this is Lightning Bolts . Approaching Yanelli-Wimberly . No sign of enemy activity . Any sign of the 58th ? Nothing on the LI DAR . Holy - I got a visual . I got an incredible visual . - Found ' em . ! - [ Chattering ] - [ Man ] Safe , huh ? - [ Woman ] Yeah . Look , ' Phousse ! Out there ! An LC convoy . They got us ! I though we were dead when we burned too long . Me too . Until , of course , I saw the actual elapsed burn time ... and then I knew we 'd be all right . [ Chattering ] Uh , I 've never done this before , all right ? So I hope I got it right . Free tickets to the Saratoga bowling alley . There 's a shoe rental too . Did I do it right ? Why is she - Uh - [ Clears Throat ] Hawkes . Remember last week , we all went to the lanes , everyone except Shane ? - Yeah . - She thinks bowling 's for dweebs . Damn . See , I got to remember that stuff . She all ticked at me ? No , man . You did good . - You think so ? - Yeah . Hey . ! [ Chuckling ] You ought to try some hooch . It 's pretty good . For some reason , it reminds me of shaving . Oh , I ... almost forgot . - Merry Christmas , Paul . - I don 't deserve this . When you talked about being a kid ... and knowing that the River of Stars would always be there in the sky ... I knew you never lost your faith . That 's what it is . Knowing something 's always gonna be there for you . From all of us , sir . Merry Christmas . Looks like I got two gifts . # # # # [ Guitar : Blues ] # # # # [ Humming ] # # # # [ Ends ] [ Man ] Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

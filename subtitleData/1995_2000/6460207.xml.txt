 Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi To the Navajo , the earth and its creatures have great influence over our existence . The stories , passed from generation to generation , " _ .help us to understand the reason for our tears of sadness and tears of joy . Animals like the bear ; the spider ; and the coyote- - . _ .are powerful symbols to our people . When the FB / man , Mulder ; was cured by the Holy People , - - . _ - we were reminded of the story of the Gila monsten- - _ .who symbolises the healing powers of the medicine man . In this myth , the Gila monster restores a man by taking all his parts ... _ .and putting them back together His blood is gathered by ants , ... _ - his eyes and ears by Sun , - _ _ _ .his mind by Talking God and Pollen Boy . Then lightning and thunder bring the man back to life . At the end of the ceremony when the FBI man had been healed , ... - -we heard the news from other Native Americans in the northern plains-- - _ .that a great event had taken place . Like the Navajo , these people have their own stories and myths . One of these stories tells of the White Buffalo Woman who came down from the heavens ... _ .and taught the Indians how to lead virtuous lives , and how to pray to the Creaton She told the people she would return one day . Then she turned into a white buffalo and ascended into the clouds , ... _ .never to be seen again . But on this day when the Holy People had given the FBI man a miracle , ... _ .a white buffalo was born . And every Native American knew , whether he believed the story or not , - - . _ .that this was a powerful omen . And that great changes were coming . I 've got the digital tape . You 're lying . I 've got it in my pocket . I took it out of Mulder 's desk . ( footsteps ) Drop your weapon ! - Put it down , Scully ! - No way . - I said put it down ! - I said no ! - You 're setting me up ! - I 'm trying to help you ! - Then put your weapon clown ! - Not a chance . - You 're not here to kill me ? Prove it ! - I 'm not here to have a gun in my face ! Damn it , Skinner ! Drop your weapon ! - Back off ! - Put it down ! What the hell is this ? - You OK , Scully ? - Yeah . Get his gun . Give her the gun ! - Give it to her ! - All right . Now I want an explanation . I was warned that somebody would kill me . Someone I trusted . I 'm gonna reach into my coat pocket and end this Charade . All right ? I presume you both Know what this is ? Now I want an explanation . Your cigarette-smoking friend killed my father for that tape . Then he killed me . - What are you talking about ? - I was a dead man . Now I 'm back . What is on this tape ? ! Defense Department files that reveal the truth about our government 's involvement ... _ .in the global conspiracy of silence about the existence of extraterrestrial life . - Give me that tape . - It stays with me . Give her the tape . If what you say is true , if the information on this tape is valuable enough to kill for , _ _ . _ .then it 's the only leverage we 've got to bring these men to justice . It 's not gonna do us any good if it falls back into their hands ! Then you 'd better make sure it doesn 't . - Come on , Scully . Let 's go . - Where ? There are truths out there that aren 't on that tape . - Mulder , I ... - Whatever you 're ... I went to your father 's funeral . I told your mother that you were gonna be OK . How did you know ? I just knew . My daughter was brought here . - What 's her name ? - Dana Scully . - Melissa Scully ? - No ... That 's her sister . We just had a Melissa Scully in surgery with a cranial gunshot wound . Missy ? It 's IVIom . We took drastic precautionary measures due to the nature of the wound . We 've induced coma to try and relieve the trauma on the brain . - Is she gonna be OK ? - We 've done everything we can . We 'll be monitoring her around the clock . Nurse , why don 't we get Mrs Scully a comfortable chair ? That 's my father on the left there . - This was taken when ? - About 1973 . Amazing . Langley , take a look . Do you recognise any of those men ? Are you familiar with a post-World War II project known as Operation Paper Clip ? The US government provided safe haven for Nazi war criminals ... _ .in exchange for their scientific knowledge . I know who this man is . Victor Klemper . The man next to your father is one of those criminals , _ _ _ _ .though not the most famous of the bunch . Wernher von Braun , designer of the V-2 rockets , ... _ .may be the most notorious , but Klemper takes the prize ... _ .for the most evil Nazi to escape the Nuremberg trials . - What did he do ? - Experimented on the Jews . Drowned them , put them in pressure chambers ... All in the name of science . Together with von Braun , Klemper helped us win the space race . Using his scientific data we were able to put astronauts on the moon before the Soviets . One giant step for mankind ( ! ) What would he be doing in a photo with your father ? I don 't know . - Do you recognise anybody else ? - No . Operation Paper Clip was supposed to have been scrapped in the 1950s . - But if this is 1973 ... - What happened to Klemper ? He 's still here , living very well at the expense of the American taxpayer . ( door opens ) Unbelievable ! We thought you were history ! You 'll have to wait for my video collection . ( Langley ) Where were ya ? At DC General , scanning the police frequency when I heard the report of a shooting . Agent Scully ... - What is it ? - Your sister 's in critical condition . Scully ! Scully , wait ! Scully ! Scully , wait ! Scully ! I have to go there , Mulder ! That bullet was meant for me ! If they 're trying to kill you , that 's the first place they 'll look . Those bastards ! I 'll call someone who can help . The only thing you can do for her right now is to try to crucify them . This is a serious mistake . An innocent woman 's been snot . - Can this be traced ? - This is your man . There was a mistake . It will be rectified . By whom ? By whom will this be rectified ? Your ridiculously ineffectual assassins ? They 're professionals . This is not a profession for men who make mistakes ! My God , you presume to make us believe you can simply fix it with enough bullets ? No . This woman ... Scully . I know she believes her partner is still alive . Mulder 's dead . I took care of it myself . And the computer tape containing the stolen files you tell us was recovered ... You can show it to us ? I wasn 't aware that my honesty was in question or doubt . Do you have the tape ? Of course I have it ! I think I 'd like to see it . So would I. I have vouchsafed it for reasons of security . I 'll have it here for you tomorrow . By which time this whole matter will be cleared up . ( door opens ) - Victor Klemper ? - Yes . My name is Fox IVlulder . This is Dana Scully . - Your name is Mulder ? - Yes . I think you knew my father . - What 's this about ? - You did some work for our government . I 'm old now . History bores me . Because it escaped you ? Or because you escaped it ? Freud , Salk , Crick , Watson ... These will be the names they celebrate at the end of the millennium . Great scientists . But Klemper ? He will be remembered only as a butcher . History may be the onlyjustice you 'll know . Do you know my work ? Do you know what we accomplished ? As a Nazi ? Or for the blood money we paid you ? We were young men caught in a fen / our . But our experiments changed the world . - For a lot of innocent Jews . - Progress demands sacrifice , and I ... I have confronted my demons . And soon I will die too . Like my father . They killed him and I believe you know why . I believe they would kill anyone if it is in the best interest of the work . What is this " work " that my father was involved in ? - I have no answer for you . - You knew him ! Was he a murderer too ? Some things you don 't have to know . No , I need to know ! I need to know the truth ! Isn 't that what you want ? For the truth to be known ? Do you know the formula of Napier 's constant ? Yes . Why ? The photo was taken at the Strughold Mining Company in West Virginia . That is all I will tell you . The rest you can find out yourself . Let 's go , Scully . ( ringing ) Hello ? Yes . One moment . It 's for you , sir . - Yes . - It 's Klempen Victor ! How are you , old friend ? - It 's been far too many years . - What is it , Victor ? I was just paid a visit by the son of one of our old colleagues . What did you tell him , Victor ? I told him that you were the most vena / man I 've ever met . Beyond that , I told him nothing . Mulder is alive ! I think it 's time to call our friends , . _ _ _ .who will handle this matter more satisfactorily . - Are you expecting visitors ? - Is it Dana ? Is Dana here ? No . It 's a man . He says he was asked to come here . My name is Albert Hosteen . I was asked to come and help with your daughter . - There must be some mistake . - Is your daughter the FBI woman ? - Dana ? - Yes . She 's very sorry she can 't come here to comfort you . - You know where she is ? Is she OK ? - Yes . I believe so . - She is weak . - She 's getting better . She has the best doctors . They 're watching her around the clock . If it 's all right , I would like to pray over her here . What would your father have been doing here ? I don 't know . He never came home wearing a miner 's cap . Mulder , take a look at this . - What do you think ? - I 'd like to try door number one , Monty . I 'm trying 27828. it 's not working . - Nor here . - Are you sure it 's the right number ? Napier 's constant is the basis of all natural logarithms With a crowbar and a small nuclear device , I might be able to get through one of these . Mulder ! No , wait . Hang on a second . Whatever we find in here , you haven 't had time to process everything . - I 'm OK . - You couldn 't go to your father 's funeral , . _ _ _ .and if something in here was to cast doubt on the kind of man he was ... I just know how it would affect me . You called me . Yes , I did . About ? I may have located the digital tape you 're looking for . You may have located it ? Yes , although it may fall into the hands of people ... _ .who might use it for purposes not your own . You wanna work a deal ? Is that what this is ? Let me tell you somethin ' _ I don 't work deals . I thought you should know of certain potentialities . - Do you have the tape ? - As I said , I may have located it . Do you have the damn tape ? ! - I 'll know more when we next meet . - I do not negotiate . Do you understand ? - Yes , sir . - I don 't think you do . I don 't think you understand at all . No , I 'm quite aware of your policies in those regards . Then I hope your next course of action will be more ... .. cautious ... and informed . Mulder , look at this . ( Scully ) It looks like they 're storing records . ( Mulder ) Of what ? Of medical files , by the look of it . They 've got names , alphabetised . Lots of files . Lots and lots of files . - What 's in these files ? - Standard medical forms . Birth certificate , smallpox vaccination certificate ... - And then there 's this . - What is this ? It 's an old tissue-collection cassette . The new ones are plastic . - Do they all contain the same materials ? - Yes , exactly . - What year was this person born ? - 1955 . All these files are 1955 . - What year were you born ? - 1964 . Why ? Let 's go find 1964 . You 're looking for a file on me ? Dana Katherine Scully . What ? It 's a recent tissue sample . What the hell is going on here , IVlulder ? I don 't know , Scully . - That 's your sister 's file . - Yeah . - What are you looking for ? - I don 't know . Look at this . - This file was originally mine . - I don 't understand . ( high-frequency tone ) - Wait here , Scully . - Mulder , where are you going ? Mulder ? ( hissing sound ) Mulder ? ( shouting / guns being loaded ) There ! Find the woman too ! Sullyi Mulder ! Sullyi IVlulder , I 'm down here . - You OK , Scully ? - I heard gunshots . - I 've been looking for you . - What happened ? We got a small army outside . I think they got us trapped . I think there 's a way out down here . This place isn 't even on the map . You 'd be surprised what 's not on the map . And what our government will do to keep it that way . - How 's that ? - Last night we were chased by a hit squad . Driving what looked like CIA fleet sedans . I may be able to negotiate a deal that would guarantee your safety . What kind of deal ? I 'll turn over the tape in return for your reinstatement . - No , sir . I need that tape . I need those files . - I 'm talking about a way to save your lives . And I 'm talking about an elaborate conspiracy . Do you know what we found last night ? What ? An elaborate filing system of medical records . Locked inside a mountain vault . - For the purpose of ? - I don 't know . But the answer 's on that tape . In those files . - Is that answer worth your lives ? - It 's obviously worth killing us for . What do you hope to find , Agent Mulder ? Why they killed my father . And what happened to my sister . And what they did to Agent Scully . I think we should let him make the deal , Mulder . Look ... Those answers mean nothing if we 're hunted down like animals . We are operating so far outside of the law , we 've given up on the very notion of justice . We have turned ourselves into outsiders . We have lost our access and our protection . What makes you think there 's any such thing as justice ? Then what good are those answers to anybody but you ? - What we found last night ... - Look , I want exactly what you want ! But I need to see my sister . I suppose you already tried to make a backup of the tape ? It 's copy-protected . I couldn 't get a hard copy to print either . What makes you think they 'll honour this deal ? Because if they don 't _ .. _ _ I 'Il go state 's evidence and testify . Or they 'll have to kill me too . It 's up to you , Scully . I told Skinner to make the deal . But not to hand over the tape until you agreed to it . - I 'm sorry about your sister , Scully . - I just need to know she 's gonna be OK . ( car starts up ) ( Albert ) For two days I had prayed for the FBI woman 's sisten Her doctor said she was getting betten ... _ - and her mother ; who would not leave her bedside , was able to sleep . But word had come from my brothers in the north that did not give me hope . The white buffalo Calf had Sur \ / i \ / ed , - -- _ .but after a day it would no longer drink its mother 's milk . On the third day the mother buffalo laid down in her stall and would not get up . They said the men could do nothing for hen That night she died . My father taught me when I was a boy that this is how life is . That , for something to live , another thing must often be sacriiiced . This was my fear now for the young woman . I 'm here to see Melissa Scully . My name 's Walter Skinner . I 'm an assistant director at the FBI . I 'm very sorry about your daughter . Dana asked me to deliver a message . - You 've been in contact with her ? - Yes . I wanna know where she is and if she 's OK . She 's OK , but she 's in a very serious situation which prevents her from being here . What kind of situation ? One that we hope to reverse so that Dana can come back to work . That man you just saw , he 's been very curious about this room . Who are you ? My name is Albert Hosteen . I was asked to come here . Albert , do not leave this room . Understand ? YSS . I could use a beer . Do you want anything ? No . Are you sure ? Yeah . ( Mulder ) Mr Klem per ? Mr Klemper ? Hello again , young lady . - Where 's Victor Klemper ? - Oh , poor Klemper . They found him yesterday . Apparently , his heart had given out . You killed him , didn 't you ? You 're one of the men in this photo . You knew my father . Yes , since we were young men . You were involved in this project . You know why medical data was collected . Yes , I do indeed . In 1947 a spacecraft was reportedly recovered in New IVlexico . No doubt you know of this , and of the reported recovery of a body at the site . These incidents coincided with not only the end of World War ll , _ _ _ _ .but an ignominious project which brought Nazi scientists and war criminals ... _ .to this country to exploit their knowledge . Operation Paper Clip . Yes , you know of it already . And you must also know the work of Dr Josef Mengele , _ _ . _ .the Nazi " Angel of Death " . He thought he could produce a super race through genetic engineering . As did many of his colleagues at the Institute of Hereditary Biology and Racial Hygiene . - Like Victor Klemper ? - Poor Victor . He loved his orchids . Did you know he was able to create some of the most beautiful hybrids ? Klemper was trying to create an alien-human hybrid . That 's what I saw in the boxcar . He was using human subjects . - Mulder , wait ! - My father was involved in this ? The technology wasn 't there ! DNA wasn 't even identified until 1944 ! This is all a lie ! When your father realised what the medical data was being used for , ... _ .he objected strenuously . He collected those files ? ! With the threat of nuclear holocaust , the government instructed men like your father ... _ .to gather genetic data on the general populace ... _ .for the purposes of post-apocalyptic identification . The vaccination records . They took tissue from everyone who had a smallpox inoculation . Hundreds of millions of Americans . So Klemper had access to a DNA database of nearly everyone who was born since 1950 . This man is telling you everything you want to hear . But it 's a fabrication . It is pure science fiction . - There were no experiments with aliens . - Why would I lie to you ? Like you said before , to protect yourself . And the continuation of the Nazi agenda . Human tests . Why was your file there , Scully ? - I don 't know . - There were current records ! - Yes , but records of what , Mulder ? - Of abductions ! Of abductees ! They took my sister . Why ? They took her as insurance because your father threatened to expose the project . Why her ? Why not me ? It 's not for me to say . But your life is in danger now too . You also threaten to expose the project . You have become your father . - Why are you telling me this ? - it 's what you want to know . Isn 't it ? Is there more ? More than you 'll ever know . ( ringing ) YSS . Yes , he 'sjust arrived . One moment , please . You have a call , sir . Thank you . - Hello ? - I 'm alive . Ain 't that a surprise ! Yes ! Good ! Good , good . Where are you ? Somewhere you 'll never find me , you double-crossing son of a bitch ! Are you sure ? I 'm sure of this . If I so much as feel your presence , _ _ . .. I 'm gonna make you a very , very famous man . You understand ? Yes , thank you . I 'll report that to the group . I 've just received confirmation that the digital tape containing the stolen files ... _ .was destroyed in a car bomb explosion ... _ .which killed Agent Scully 's would-be assassin . What about Mulder and Scully ? I 've a meeting with the FBI . They wanna make a deal . For what ? For nothing . There 'll be no deal . There 's no deal to make . Fox ? What time is it ? It 's after two . - Did you drive up here ? Why didn 't you call ? - I needed to see you in person . I need to ask you something . Something that happened a long time ago . Oh , Fox , I don 't remember anything . I told you before . Mom , listen to me . When Samantha ... Before she was gone , did Dad ever ask you if you had a favourite ? - Did he ever ask you that ? - Fox , please ! Mom , did he ever ask you to make a choice ? - Don 't do this ! - Mom , listen to me ! I need to Know ! Did he make you make a choice ? No . I couldn 't choose . It was your father 's choice ! And I hated him for it . Even in his grave , I hate him still . Now , ... _ .you wanted to see me ? I have the tape you 've been looking for . Really ? I 'm prepared to hand it over , or destroy it , in exchange for Mulder and Scully 's safety . - And for their reinstatement . - What did I tell you , Mr Skinner ? I don 't negotiate . Especially with punks like you who think they can bluff me . - Bluff you ? - You haven 't got any tape . You haven 't got any deal . You can 't play poker if you 're not holding any cards , Mr Skinner . You ever wondered what it would be like to , uh , ... _ .die in a plane crash ? Of botulism ? Even a heart attack 's not uncommon for a man your age . You think I 'm bluffing ? I 'm not finished yet . Albert . ( speaks Navajo ) What is this ? This is where you pucker up and kiss my ass ! - Listen ... - Listen to me , you son of a bitch ! This man 's name is Albert Hosteen . Remember that . If Mulder and Scully come clown with so much as flu , ... _ .Albert will recite chapter and verse , file for file , everything on your precious tape . It 's a nice try , Skinner . You 're thinking Albert is an old man , ... _ .and there are plenty of ways you might kill him too . Which is why , in the ancient oral tradition , _ .. . _ he 's told 20 other men the information on those files . So , unless you Kill every Navajo living in four states , ... _ .that information is available with a simple phone call . Welcome to the wonderful world of high technology . You 're bluffing . Am I ? It happened three hours ago . She went into surgery . The damage to her brain was worse than they had hoped . Her blood pressure started to rise and ... _ .she slipped away . She died for me . I tried to tell her I was sorry , but I don 't think she 'll ever really know . She knows . Melissa knows . You were right . There is no justice . - I don 't think this is aboutjustice , Scully . - Then what is it about ? I think it 's about something we have no personal choice in . I think it 's about fate . Skinner told me that he talked to you . That you were insistent about coming back to work . If Melissa 's death is ... I need something to put my back up against . I feel the same way . We 've both lost so much . But I believe that what we 're looking for ... is in the X-Files . I 'm more certain than ever that the truth is in there . I 've heard the truth , Mulder . Now what I want are the answers . Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi

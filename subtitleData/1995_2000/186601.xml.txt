 Man : Get the hell out of here ! - Stay in the truck , LJ . - You got it , man . How much time ? - Two minutes . - Quick ! Quick ! Hlde back here ! Man : Michelle ! Come on , baby ! I know you 're in here ! michelle , don 't make me lose my temper ! I 'm gonna count to three ! One ... two ... AII right , all right , I 'm coming out . Three . Have you learned nothing ? When I tell you to do something , you do it ! Quinn , he 's going to kill her . I have never seen such vermin as what passes itself off as human in this world . - ( screams ) - So who was it ? ! Quinn , don 't . Don 't get involved in this . Quinn , this is crazy . You 're going to get hurt . Who was it , michelle ? Run ! I 'II keep him back ! Who 's this ? I never saw him before . Quit arguing and get out of here ! - ( laughs ) - Stay back ! Take a swing , punk . ( grunting ) You laugh at that . Get up ! Let 's go . Go ! Go ! - Where to ? - Wade : Overthere . What 's that thing ? Don 't worry about it ! - Let 's go , Q-BaII ! - Yeah , I 'm right behind you . - I gotta go . - What ? Wait a minute ! What about me ? Thanks to you , he 'II probably kill me . No , no , Mr. MaIIory . Don 't even think about it . michelle ! - No choice ! - Mr. MaIIory ! No ! michelle ! michelle ? Quinn : What if you could travel to parallel worlds ? The same year , the same Earth , only different dimensions ? A world where the Russians rule America ? Or where your dreams of being a superstar came true ? Or where San Francisco was a maximum security prison ? My friends and I found the gateway . Now the problem is finding a way back home . ( theme music plays ) Give it up , LJ , it 's checkmate in three . Maybe , maybe not . You never know . ( portal roars ) - What the hell is that ? - What ? - That . - Watch it ! ( grunting , groaning ) Professor : How much time until we slide ? Wade : 26 Hours . Where are we ? What is this place ? Rembrandt : welcome to a new world , lady . ( groans ) - ( grunting ) - Sid , don 't . Get off him , man . You want to get us all in trouble ? Shut up , LJ . Let him go ! I never saw this guy before this morning ! - Thanks , man . - Yeah , no problem . I told you to stay with the truck . Wasn 't me , pal . You see any trucks around here ? Where the hell are we ? Webb Court . And there 's a custodian around the corner . So if I were you , I 'd stash the gat . Webb Court ? I know every inch of San Francisco , and this ain 't no Webb Court . Perhaps I can be of some assistance . Sid , is it ? Sid , this is not your San Francisco . When we entered that ... that tunnel , we came to a different San Francisco . We have , in fact , been to 20 or 30 different ones . Tomorrow , we 'll be going to another . Everybody , come here . Come here . C 'mon . Professor : How to explain this ? Sid , that tunnel is like a door . Hard as it is to believe , it takes us from one world to another . Each world is a little different . What 's this one ? I don 't know , but I suspect that we 'II find out soon enough . Woman 's voice : Please keep moving . The life you save may be your own . Come on . Come on . - What are you doing ? - Buddy bracelets . What are you talking about ? These right here . Great , a street hustler . - Rembrandt : Why ? What are they for ? - Wade : What 's the catch ? It 's required . It 's gratis . It 's no hype . When in Rome ... Man , I ain 't wearing this thing . It 's yourfuneral . Stay with me . You 're gonna need somebody to show you around here . Come on . Wade : The air 's so clean here . Professor : Yes , and they have electric carts . I wonder if they 've abolished the internal combustion engine . They certainly have a Iot of rules and regulations . AII right , here it comes . It 's about time to show the bracelets . Right here , sir . ( rumbling ) Earthquake ? How about that one , sir ? . An aftershock ? Move along . Rembrandt : So , you get a Iot of earthquakes ? You don 't know the half of it . Let 's get in the cab . - You 're a cab driver ? . - Something like that . could you just take us to the Dominion hotel on HubbeII Street , please ? HubbeII Street 's rubble , darlin ' . The whole section of the city came down in last month 's 6.4 . So , you planning on cutting out of here manana , huh ? You going to be going out the same way you came in ? Yes , but keep it under your hat . We 'djust as soon no one heard about it . I understand entirely . Let me show you around . Just a reminder , it 's not over between us . Woman 's voice : Please keep your bracelet visible at all times . LJ : Oh , yeah , this campus is great . I stayed there myself forthe first couple of months . No mortars going off . That 's a plus . Woman 's voice : This is your home . Please keep it peaceful and clean . Professor : Now there is a fine example of architectural hubris . Ageodesic dome built in an earthquake zone . Just imagine keeping the water out of that surface . ( chuckles ) Good morning , sweetheart . These folks need a place to stay . Minimum hassle . Think you can accommodate us ? These haven 't been processed yet . I said , minimum hassle . How long ? Uh , just one night . What 'd he do ? steal a penny ? Newcomers , Rosie . They 'II be on their way by tomorrow . Signatures and fingerprints at the " X. " You 're in Annex 7-7-0 . Here 's the group therapy schedule . Ladies at 3 : 00 . Men in the morning . Group therapy ? What is this , a loony bin ? Uh , LJ , I 'm not sure if we can afford this place . It 's taken care of . It 's " on the G. " Government housing . Woman 's voice : In case oftrouble , lie prone on the ground . Don 't litter . You 'll be very sorry , . Ahem- - all right . 7-7-0 's back there and I 'II be with you guys in a few . So where are you going ? I gotta smooth things over with the supervisor . Nothing major . Oh , keys . Where do we get a key ? Key ? There 's no locks . No one steals in San Francisco . Look , I know you guys don 't belong here . But everything 's gonna be fine , as long as you don 't go anywhere ortrust anyone . Except me . well come on , get out of here . Something awfully oily about that guy . Considering the nature of the sociopath we 've launched on this unsuspecting society , we should be grateful we met him . Um-hm , would you look at this ? ( chuckles ) Uh-huh . Wade : This is government housing ? Rembrandt : talk about your basic entitlement . You heard what the man said . No locks , Sid . We could be rich in no time . That 's right , baby . I 'm going to take home a bundle . I don 't know about you , but I don 't want any part of what that cab driver 's throwing out . Wade : Uh-oh . Excuse me , we were told to stay put . When I come back , you 're gonna take me and her home . I 'm afraid I can 't do that , Sid , because we cannot activate our device until tomorrow . Sid , it 's kind of a tricky situation , but we- - - Hey ! - Right there . michelle : Sld , don 't hurt him . Wade : He didn 't mean it . Sid : You shut up ! ( gasping ) AII I have to do is lean in on you and your windpipe snaps . Now , you listen to me . I don 't like it here and I wouldn 't be here if you didn 't stick your face in my business . Look at me when I 'm talking to you . So , here 's yourjob . Yourjob is to get me home when I want to go . You got that ? Sid , think . He 's the only person who can get us home . Get this ? Piss me off and you 're stuck here forever . ( choking ) ( gasping ) well , don 't expect any sympathy . If you 'd used your brain , we wouldn 't be in this mess . You and your misguided sense of bravado . will you stop it ? That 's not going to solve anything . I 'm gonna go get some air . Woman 's voice : Please keep moving . The life you save may be your own . Sorry . I- - I just wanted to thank you ... fortrying to help me . I mean , I know I caused a Iot of problems and yourfather 's all pissed off . Father ? . Anyway , thank you . ( chuckles ) Good morning , again . Now what ? These are the forms you have to fill out forthe Board of Registry . Last will and testaments , donor cards , etc . Hmm . Now , I count only five . Professor : Yes , one of our colleagues is napping . He was exhausted . That shouldn 't be a problem , should it , sir ? . Just as long as he fills out the forms . That 's--that 's quite all right . I 'm going to have to register your bracelets with the computer log . So if you 'II hold them out , please ? ( faint beeping ) Now , you and this good gentleman are buddies . And ... you two ladies . And ... That 'll put you with the otherfella whom you said is sleeping . Now , how the " Buddy System " works , is that each of you wiII- - ( beeplng ) hold on . hello ? I 'm looking at a red bIinker . Man 's voice : Curfew violation , 674-C . Safety check . No malfunctions reported . Oh , dear . What 's he doing ? It 'sjust policy . ( beeplng ) ( gunshot ) Now , where were we ? Woman 's voice : Remember , the custodians are yourfriends . We all live here together . What are you saying ? His buddy committed the crime ? That man didn 't do anything ? That 's The Buddy System , ma 'am . Friends do not let friends commit crimes in San Francisco . They 're carting him off like garbage . Oh , my God- - Sid . In as much as we shall be leaving shortly , hypothetically , if one of our group was to slip , how much time- - ? Between the bracelets and the Neighborhood Watch , they 'II be on you in no time . Neighborhood Watch ? Oh , yeah , major perks for reporting a crime . - Wade : Where would he go ? - How should I know ? Think , woman , think ! I don 't know . Where the money is . Quinn : My " buddy 's " out there . So , what 's he gonna do , knock off a bank ? Yes , I would think that would probably be his first move . - This is unbelievable . - Wait , I 'II give you a lift . - Okay . - No , no , no . You ladies have group therapy at 3 : 00 . - There are no exceptions . - Forget it . So what ? You want to end up like that guy on the street ? Great . LJ : What 's your buddy 's MO ? How should I know ? I just met the guy . It 's bad news . The whole idea is to keep tabs on each other . This Buddy System is insane . Yeah , it sucks . But the city would self-destruct without it . Everyone knows that they 're gonna die soon . - So how else you gonna keep ' em in line ? - What do you mean ? A big-ass earthquake 's due any day now . SeismoIogists say the peninsula 's gonna drop right into the ocean . well , if you know it 's coming , why don 't you leave ? Like I got a choice . This is prison , man . San Francisco national Penitentiary . Rembrandt : Listen , what do we do if we do find this guy ? Him and his bad temper and that big " Saturday night special " he carries ? We 'II cross that bridge when we come to it . Assuming he hasn 't burned the whole city down . Hunh . Mr. Brown , if we get through this , you and I must have a serious talk with the others . About what , Professor ? . AII about this , about the Sids and the MicheIIes and Mr. MaIIory 's penchant forthe quixotic rescue . What choice did he have ? Let the poor girl get her head beat in ? No , of course not . You understand , Mr. Brown , ourtimer was originally set forthree people . Now it seems to be handling the four of us quite well . But every time we add an extra body , we increase exponentially the chances of catastrophic failure . Whoa , whoa- - what are you saying ? What I 'm saying ... is we increase the risk that you and I will be spread like very finejam across an infinite number of universes . That is an ugly picture . Besides , our chances of survival here would be much greater if we didn 't have Sid to worry about . This is one strange world . - Wait . - Come on . Come on , man . You know , in some ways , this reminds me of switzerland or Singapore . clean streets , weII-reguIated citizenry . Stiff penalties in exchange for quality of Iife . Yeah , a paradise , if you Iike being caned for littering . Let 's go , c 'mon ! Yo , yo ! ( laughs ) Hey , Fish , my knife slipped . Bring it back here for me . First of all , my name is not " Fish . " secondly , I am not your slave . And thirdly , you should know that although I am a man of peace , I am prepared to make an exception in your case . You should be careful with this . - Give me the knife . - We don 't want any trouble . You give me that damn knife or we 'II hang you upside down and see what shakes out . Attention , please . I 'm with the Neighborhood Watch . as you know , there are rewards for preventing crimes , and I believe these punks here are contemplating one . I got a possible problem , sector nine . Next time , Fish . We 'II be lookin ' for ya . Woman 's voice : Friends don 't let friends commit crimes . Woman # 1 : We don 't have much time before the meeting . Do you think I have time to go to the ladies 'room ? Woman # 2 : You really want to take a chance ? Woman # 2 : I wouldn 't want to be late . Remember what happened to Betty last week . Woman # 1 : Oh , yeah , I do remember . michelle : So tell me again- - why can 't we get home ? Maybe it 's not impossible . What I 'm saying is we 've been trying for a really long time and haven 't been able to . If I was you I 'd try not to have any illusions about going home . These rehab sessions are a sham . Then why have ' em ? It 'sjust to keep us busy . That 's all it is . ( chuckles ) well , one good thing- - if you don 't make it home , you don 't have to stay with Sid . No one 's making me stay with Sid . I didn 't mean it like that . well , he doesn 't treat you very well . Sid 's okay . Everyone respects him . Nobody would dare lay a finger on me as long as I 'm with him . He beats you . What 's the difference ? Once you 're with them , they all do it . Not on my world . well , goody for you . Look , Sid came into my Iife when I was nothing . I was 15 and my entire family was wiped out with the war . So don 't nag on me about Sid . Okay . Forget I said anything . Woman : Ladies , would you all be seated , please ? Get your coffee and take your seats . Look , maybe it 's different on your world , with guys like Quinn , but on my world there 's no choice . So I do what I gotta do . That 's the point- - we 're not on your world anymore . I 'd like to thank you all for being so prompt . I see a few new faces in the crowd . welcome . Before we get started , why don 't we have the new members of the Wednesday group stand and introduce themselves ? My name is GIadys and I 'm a convicted felon . AII : Hi , GIadys . I got 35-to-Iife for poisoning my husband because he cheated on me with the babysitter . Now , GIadys , we 're going to have to stop you . Step one , ladies , never blame the victim , hmm ? Okay ... why don 't you in the back in the red tell us what you were convicted of ? . LJ : Coming up on another ATM . So , MaIIory , answer me a question . You know I studied the physical sciences before I was wrongfully incarcerated . So let me get this , you never know what the next world is gonna be like until you get there ? - exactly . - You ever hit a world was worse than this ? Not many . LJ , overthere . It 's him . Sid , stop ! Put that thing away ! Oh , seriously , man , they 're gonna kill you . Hey , LJ , don 't you have something betterto do ? ( gun clicks ) On thefloor . Now ! Don 't . Big mistake , Sid . You 're crazy man , you know that ? - LJ : Come on ! - ( grunts ) No , no , no , don 't go anywhere ! Ship has sailed , baby . Great . What is this ? What is this ? It 's the wrong color . ( grunts ) ( beeping ) Give me your wrist . It 's okay . Not for long . We 've got to get you as far away as possible . Oh man . You guys back off or I 'II blast him . No firing . No firing . He has a hostage , sir , and he wants to negotiate . Negative . Use standard . operating procedure . I 'II be in contact . Pain in the ass . ( beeplng ) - Get out . - Get out ? If I 'm seen driving with you , my bracelet 's gonna light up . Get out ! Look , just cover that thing up , hold up for a little while . Why ? I thought it had to be showing . people don 't notice it at dark unless it 's glowing . Just coverthis thing up . I got to get back to the others . Okay , but hurry . Listen , meet me at the BARTstation at Market and Van Ness . I 'II see you there . Later . Woman 's voice : Don 't venture too close to the perimeter . We 're watching you . Oh , no ! Not again . - I 've got a red bIinker . - ATM robbery . No malfunction reported . Action approved . Big trouble . Sid hit an ATM . What ? No time to explain . We 've go to find the professor , Rembrandt , and leave now . - You better come with us . - Sid told me to stay here . Sid 's not coming back . Sid 's got every cop within 100 miles coming down on him . You don 't know Sid like I do . He 'II make it . Not with one of these he 's not . Look , it 's your choice . You 're sure ? hold it . I 'm coming . Rembrandt : What do you mean , all of San Francisco is a prison ? Earthquakes . The government evacuated the local population and made this place a penal colony for every madman and murderer in the country . Is there a plan , Mr. MaIIory , or do wejust wander the streets till they catch us ? AII right , this is the station . A BARTstation , with all of these earthquakes ? Another strategic gem . Hey , Professor , any time you want- - Come on , this way . Come on ! Hey , Quinn , on my world , LJ was a lying , doubIe-crossing son of a bitch . Now you tell me . Wade : Don 't worry , Professor , we 're due for a nice luxury hotel any slide now . Professor : Hah ! I 'II believe that when I see it . Wade : Are you okay ? I 'm fine . There 's nothing you can do about it . There 's no point in talking . You 're worried about Sid . What if he came back for me ? What if he made it ? What if he did ? I can 't believe you could ever be happy with him . What is with you , huh ? Who the hell gets to be happy ? Why don 't you look around yourself , for God 's sakes ? Do you see any reason why you should be happy ? Yeah , I do . I see people I care about who care about me . people I can count on . I think I 'm pretty lucky . well , I think you 're dreaming 'cause nobody sticks their neck out for nobody . Quinn stuck his neck out for you . He didn 't even know you . LJ : Watch your step , here . Watch it . C 'mon , c 'mon , they 're waiting for us . - Rembrandt : Who 's waiting ? - LJ : The people who 're gonna hide us . - You mean people live down here ? - You got it , man . Right down this way . LJ : Hey , could you speed this up ? I don 't have a life sentence . AII right , come on . Let 's go . " Attention , K-Mart shoppers . " ( men 's voices ) LJ : Come on . Yo , Jakey ! Jake : Hey , LJ , you made it . We 've been waiting for you . Man : What took you so long ? You get lost or something ? Hey there , Kick . What is this ? Look at the fish the cat dragged in . Later , baby . Time is of the essence . Wait a minute . What the hell 's going on here ? What do you mean , " What the hell 's going on ? " The smarter you play it , the longer you live . - You got the cash ? - I want to see it first . Go ahead . Give him the gizmo . Give him that thing that makes the tunnel in the air . Give it to him ! Better do it , Professor . If you insist , Mr. MaIIory . But I do believe that I 'm making a huge mistake . This makes a tunnel ? There won 't be any tunnels , Jake . You can 't make it work without us . I said , " Be smart . " Now , I 'm trying to protect you people . Okay , I 'II do it . - Quinn , no ! - Shut up ! - Let me have it . - I 'II hold it . You just tell me what to push . What the hell ? Nobody move . Hey , Leo , is that you ? LJ , you should have told me about this if you wanted to stay alive . ( gunshots ) Wade : Where 's Quinn ? Rembrandt : He 's trying to get the timer . Professor : Quinn- - ! Wade : Quinn , be careful ! Quinn ! Quinn : I got it ! I got it ! Go ! Go ! Professor : You set a mean pace , Mr. Brown . ( bullets ricocheting ) Come on , hurry . Go . Go . ( police radio chatter ) well , well , look who we have here . Damn . Professor : The only reason we 're in this situation is because you insisted on meddling in a lover 's quarrel . Let it alone , Professor . We 'II get out of this somehow . Oh yes ? And how are we going to do that ? ( rumbling ) ( gasps ) well , good morning , boys and girls . Let me explain how it works . It 's quite simple , really . It 's called " survival of the fiittest . " Whoever comes forward first , volunteers to pilot this little baby here , gets to come with us . If not , we 're going to start executing you one by one . Either I get what I want , or you 're all dead . - Great incentive . - You kill us , you 'II never get it to work . We all gotta go sometime , sweetheart . Think about it , boys and girls . Think about it . I saw Sid use that a couple of times . It 's got his paw prints all over it . Did it work ? always , once he killed someone to prove he was serious . He 's right . You should 've just let him beat on me . Don 't blame yourself . What are we gonna do ? ( rumbling ) Quinn , I hate this . Rembrandt : It 'll pass ! It 'll pass ! I hope to God it 'll pass . Huh . Damn earthquakes . relax , would ya ? Just play the waiting game . You 're a cocky little son of a bitch , aren 't you ? You 're damn right . If I wasn 't , LJ would be getting out of here , not you and me . ( knocking ) Stay there . Stay outside . A guard found this outside the door . What is it ? We got one . ( laughs ) Okay , Professor , come on , let 's go . Get yourthings . Professor ? . What 's going on ? You , too , my dear . You sold us out . Professor , you can 't be serious ? Oh , grow up , Miss wells . As the man says , " survival of the fiittest . " It 's betterthat one of us should survive , than all of us perish . You can 't mean this . What are you going to do , Professor , steal the idea ? Wait till I 'm out of the way and call sliding your own ? No , Mr. MaIIory , I am going to go home and perfect it . Which is what you should 've done before you imperiIed all our lives . When I 've done that , I will have every right to call sliding my own . We 'II die here ! I 'm truly sorry . I 'II get you forthis ! I swear I will , you bastard ! This isn 't over ! You hear me ? ! Yourfriends seem pretty pissed off . That 's their problem . Give me the timer , hurry . - What 's happened here ? - What do you mean ? This timer has been completely reconfigured . I 'm going to have to take it to Quinn . - It 's a trick . - It is not . - You 're lying . - I am not . It is his invention . He understands it betterthan I do . Look , Sid , I abandoned my companions in orderto save my Iife . Now I can 't do that without his help . Drop it ! - ( gun clicks ) - No more , Sid . I will kill you . I guess it didn 't work . We 're gonna miss the slide , I know it . ( rumbling ) Keys ! It 's about time . well , it didn 't go exactly according to hoyle , but let 's not quibble . - Rembrandt : Hurry , up . - 30 seconds . Patience now . ( grunting ) If I had time , I 'd kill you . Yeah , when I get free , you 'II wish you had . ( laughs ) Come on , Iet 's go ! ( grunting ) You 're mine , pretty boy . ( laughs ) Get off him , Sid . What are you going to do , Michelle ? Huh ? Think you 're going to shoot me ? Give me the gun , bitch . No ! Michelle- - ! ( coughs ) Wade : We 're running out oftime . It 'II be okay . I promise . Come on , Iet 's get out of here ! Trust me , michelle , we have to go , now .

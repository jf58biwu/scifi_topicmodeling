 We were born 20 years too late . If this were 1975 we 'd be totally raging right now . Yeah , yeah , it would be a party . We 'd all be listening to Captain Tennille while free-spirited women with underarm hair - caress our bell bottoms . - You make it sound like a bad thing . Well , now , what do we have here ? Looks like big brother Chett 's been doing a little stealth-hacking unless you 're downloading pictures of Semiautomatic Sandy . Hello , ladies . You 're home early from the beauty parlor . You 've been busted , bro . Okay , I admit it . I 've been using your computer . And I 'm glad you caught me because seeing the two of you standing there looking at me like I was some common criminal has reminded me of something very important . I can still kick both your bony butts to the moon . - But ... - It seems unfair but you 're both going to feel a little bit better once you 've fixed me a sandwich and brought me a beer . Chop chop . What just happened ? I thought we had the upper hand . Oh , how do you delete this Lisa file ? It 's taking up all the space on the hard drive . It doesn 't even do anything . Look . " Lisa . " See ? Nothing . You left the file unprotected . I know . It was stupid . - Anyone could have accessed me . - WYATT : There were some safeguards . Like what ? You had to be able to spell " Lisa " ? Chett surprise me , that 's all . Make it so we 're the only two people who can call you up . Come on , I 've got an idea . I suggest a pass-key system . Choose a password and I 'll take care of the security precautions . That 's okay . You had your shot . I 'll choose the password this time . I can handle it . No , you 're too predictable . - Like someone will guess ... - " Telephone " ? - Okay . How about ... - " Desk lamp " ? Then " carpet . " Then " Lisa . " Spelled backwards . Okay . I got one . Good . Let 's try it out . Now for the sealer . ( both yelling ) Lis , you got to give us some warning before you do that . - I 'm blind . - There . It 's secure . No files can be accessed . No data can be read . I can 't even get into it . Now try the password . Let 's open it up . Gary , enter the password . It 's , uh ... uh ... - This is classic . - You forgot the password ? Sorry ! It must have slipped my mind when you detonated that little hydrogen bomb a minute ago . - I 'll make up a new one . - Let me help you understand this . There is only one password and until you remember it my powers are in there , and I 'm trapped out here . - No magic ? - No . It 's made of Titanic Beryllium . Nothing can penetrate it . I 'm completely locked out . No magic , no zapping , nothing . We should have stayed with " telephone . " WAYNE : Wyatt , are you in there ? Dad ! WAYNE : Wyatt , open up . What are we going to do ? He 's going to see Lisa . Be cool . I knew something like this would happen someday . I 'm ready . CHETT : Dad said now . He means now ! Don 't make me get my fire axe and come ... Door 's open . I heard a noise . And I smell something electrical . Oh , my goodness . I don 't know you . I don 't either but I 'd sure like to . I 'm Wayne Donnelly . And you are ... ? - I 'm ... - Valadja Slavko . She escaped in the middle of her trapeze act from a touring Bulgarian Circus . Yeah , Dad , and I 'm little Richard . The father of rock and roll . Is true . Circus treats me very bad . Must share tent with bearded lady and elephant boy . - Gary and Wyatt rescue Slavia ... - Nadia . - Valadja . - ... from certain death . And now they got the clowns and the dancing poodles looking for her . I know it sounds crazy , but look , here 's all her documentation . Well , it certainly looks official . Birth certificate , passport letter of commendation - from Siegfried and Roy . - Whoa , whoa , whoa . You 're not seriously buying this , are you ? This is obviously a scam job . Please , kind sir don 't send Valadja back to evil ringmaster . Well , I suppose Wyatt 's quiet respect and strong moral code have earned my trust . And I 'm sure by this time tomorrow he 'll put this entire episode behind us . - Isn 't that right , Wyatt ? - Absolutely . Valadja can stay until then , right ? She can stay in the guest house by herself for one day . I 'm going to figure this out . Have a party . " Clowns and dancing poodles " ? - Any luck with that password ? - I 'm working on it . Well , work faster . I hate being trapped in this lame , little world . You know what I mean . What are we doing now ? - Going to bed- - it 's late . - But I 've never slept before . I don 't even know how . You just take off all your clothes slip into the bed and press up against me as hard as you can . - You 'll be out in no time . - Gary , don 't you have to go ? Oh , sure ... and leave you alone and teach Lisa how to do all the things she 's never done before ? What am I going to do ? Wait for you to leave and teach her how to drive ? Lisa , have you ever taken a shower ? No . - I know how you work . - You 're paranoid . - GARY : Wyatt ? - What ? Is she asleep ? I think so . What time is it ? 4 : 30 . Never thought she 'd stop jabbering . She was nervous . It 's probably the first time she 's ever been unconscious . ( muttering ) I think she 's dreaming . You heartless bastard ! WYATT : Lisa , what are you doing ? Don 't play dumb . You were there watching him . Thought you could juggle those poor , innocent puppies . Where am I ? Where 's the blue giant ? - And the snake with the pants ? - You were dreaming . It wasn 't real . Let go . - But he was ... and you were ... - All in your head . It happens when you go to sleep . I 'm sleeping on the floor . Good . That 's where you deserve to sleep you stinking weasel . It wasn 't real . Poor little puppies . You remember that password yet buddy o ' mine ? She should be here somewhere . She said she 'd meet us after school , right ? I am kind of thirsty , come to think of it . Well , it looks like you got the human thing pretty much down . Yeah , it 's okay . I miss my magic though . You know I had to walk here ? It took 15 minutes . Tell me about it . I haven 't walked this much in months . - Or paid for stuff . - Or picked my nose . Have I told you about that ? I don 't know what 's so great about being human . It 's pretty boring , not to mention painful . - What 's so painful ? - I feel like I have this water balloon in my stomach that 's about to burst , and it just keeps getting worse . Lisa , have you ever gone to the bathroom before ? That 's what that is . How do you make it through a long movie ? I 'm sorry to interrupt , but I was watching you . I know this is kind of forward but I think you 're very beautiful . Take a hike . She 's spoken for . Oh , I 'm sorry . You guys are so much younger , I figured ... When you figure you make a fig out of " u " and " re . " What does that mean ? It means she 's busy . Why did you do that ? He was kind of cute . - He was going to ask me out . - Oh , so you 're dating now ? Well , excuse me for trying to make the best of being human . Excuse me for trying to learn about relationships and emotions . Excuse me- - I have to go to the bathroom . The toilet 's the one without the faucets . What ? She has a right to date if she wants to . I suppose . But we set the rules . No kissing , no touching , no nuzzling . No romantic walks , comfortable silences or childhood stories . No talking about sexy scenes in movies MTV videos or the diet coke guy . No beer , no wine , no oysters . Do we make ourselves perfectly clear ? Yeah ... I guess . Oh , hi . Lisa , Steve you 're on your own . Be home by 11 : 00 or you 're grounded . Your parents are strict . They 're just very concerned friends . I can see why . Have you had dinner ? I 'd love to . Your turn . There , that 's the last one . - Now what ? - What time is it ? She 's a little late . Probably ditched him and went to a movie . Exactly ! - Want to play another game ? - Good idea . Scrabble , Risk , Monopoly , Candyland ... - Candyland ! - You want to play Candyland ? - I love Candyland . - Candyland 's for two-year-olds . I remember the computer password . It 's horseradish . Oh , that 's great . How do you get " horseradish " from " Candyland " ? Duh . Oh , I had a great time tonight , Lisa . Me too . I 'm sorry I had to keep getting up . That movie was pretty long . This may sound like I 'm moving kind of fast but we should have kids , move into a big house and spend the rest of our lives together . - Or at least a second date . - Oh , decisions , decisions . Can I have a second date and the house ? How about a cond date and a kiss ? You 're home . About time too . - Hi , guys . - You have fun tonight ? I know I did . Hey , Lis , we got great news- - Gary remembered the password . You can get back in the computer and get your magic powers . Lis ? I 'm not going back . I 've decided I really want to be a human being . So I 'm going to try it for real . No more computer genie stuff . Isn 't that great ? BOTH : Great . - Lisa , we got to talk . - Yes , we do . And Lisa wants to hear everything you have to say but first you have to help me find an apartment . What does " FP WD LL " stand for ? Fireplace , washer / dryer , lava lamp . Oh , that sounds nice . Lisa ... You have to go back into the computer . ( makes buzzer sound ) Sorry . Wrong answer . How are you going to survive on your own ? You can 't zap up food . And how are you going to pay your rent ? Wow . You 're right . What was I thinking ? I need a job first . Jobs . Jobs ... " pastry chef . " Lisa , you don 't know anything about living alone . I won 't be alone . Steve 's my boyfriend now . Now I 'm completely relieved . Lis , you can 't just jump in the real world like this . You 're not ready . It 's too big a step . I 'm doing it . Then we 're coming with you . That 's it . We 'll all move in together . It 'll be great . We can hang out live by our own rules , carpool . That sounds great , Gary , but I have to do this on my own . I finally had a taste of what 's it like to be human and I like it . I like getting dressed and buying things . And I like being in love and I like doing things for myself without the magic . I need to do this . - Will we still be able to see you ? - Of course . Hey , come over to Steve 's place tomorrow night . I 'll make dinner . it 'll just be you two , me and Steve . Don 't worry . I 'll make a great human . I 've had great teachers . Uh-oh . Okay , it may not be exactly right but it 's the first time I 've ever tried anything without , you know ... help . - What is it ? - I kind of improvised . See if you can tell . - I 'm getting ... fish ? - Licorice . Some kind of paint . It 's chicken . - It 's great - You 're great . Honey , would you mind getting me a beer ? Cooking 's one of those things you either do and do it well or she could care less . - You guys cook ? - Not professionally . I probably shouldn 't be telling you this but Lila , my ex , now , she was a great cook . There would be something different every night- - pot roast , homemade pasta , lamb ... I saw a pasta dish I wanted to try . Honey , I 'm not finished . Fish , beef , salads ... beef . Oh , she could cook . Did I tell you I have an interview ? That was the great thing about Lila . She didn 't work so she had plenty of time for us for the relationship . But , hey , yeah , everybody 's different . Lis , can I help you with the dishes ? She 's pretty hot , isn 't she ? So , what do you think of him ? He 's a pig . You should dump him and come home with us . I can 't . He 's not perfect but every relationship takes work . I just need to try harder . I am getting better at being human , aren 't I ? Yeah . You 're getting better . - You wash , I 'll dry ? - Huh ? Anyone up for dessert ? You don 't think men and women belong together ? I 'm saying no couple can stay together forever - because animal instinct takes over . - Animal instinct ? Explain this to me . Steve , maybe we should talk about something else . It 's like we 're in this big human jungle and we got to keep moving meeting other animals , mating , hunting ... Killing the weak and eating their flesh . No . - You don 't get it . - I get it . You don 't want to date one woman . - Steve , maybe we ... - Lila , please . I mean , uh ... Lisa . Yikes . Deja vu . Why are you doing this ? If they keep fighting , they 'll break up . Who are we to decide who Lisa loves or doesn 't ? Do you want her wasting the rest of her life with this jerk ? Getting her heart broken ? Sleeping with him ? You know , Steve , Lisa put this whole dinner together . The least you could do is thank her for it . She knows I appreciate it . Who 's " she " ? Lisa or Lila ? He 's right , Steve . You could have said something . And my name is not Lila . It 's Lisa . I know . I don 't want you to be Lila . He just wants you to cook like her . - Stay at home like her . - That 's not true . I 'm here with you . Yeah , but for how long ? Like you say , you got to keep moving and hunting . Mating . If it 's so impossible for you to be with just one woman maybe I should leave . Maybe you should , you freaky chick . - Fine . - Fine ! - Fine ! - Fine ! Lila looked better in that dress than you do . Lisa , wait . So close . Look , I 'm sorry . A little too late for that , buddy . Yeah , she 's not talking to you . We are out of here . I just get so afraid of losing you . You 're so beautiful and so smart . I want to make it work . Then move in with me . If you 're serious , I 'll move in tonight . I am very serious . I 've never been more serious with anyone . I want to be with you forever . ( knocking ) Hello ? Lila ? What are you doing here ? Steve , I had to see you again . - Who 's this ? - Nobody . Nothing . What ? I came to give you another chance but if you 're with someone ... Me ? I don 't even know her . She 's wearing my dress and my shoes . She is ? Oh , wait . It 's so clear to me now . I 've just been making her a substitute for you- - a shoddy replacement that I tried to dress up like you in a sad attempt to fill my empty , aching heart . You 're full of crap . No , it 's true . I 'm begging you here . You 're the only woman for me . She means nothing to me . Nothing personal , baby . Lila ! wait ! Wait for me ! - Welcome to the human race . - I want to be a magic genie again . It 's all gone . Chett ! - What ? - Valadja wants more chocolate sauce . You know , I 'm starting to think that this whole Bulgarian Circus thing is just one big joke on me . No joke . Friends hungry . Be right back . Don 't you have more fun here with us ? Yeah , but someday I may want to try it again- - living on my own . But not yet . Whatever you want , Lis , we 'll always be here . And we promise not to freak out . You got to live your life . We got to live ours . You can have yours . I like being a genie . Beverage , madame ? Capioned by Grant Brown

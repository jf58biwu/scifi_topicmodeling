 [ Wind gusting ] [ Thunder rumbles ] [ Thunder roars ] [ The Avengers theme song , background ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Church bell ringing ] [ Church bell continues ringing ] [ Fast-paced , dramatic instrumental music , background ] STEED : Good morning , Constable . [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] [ Baby crying ] ALICE : Ooh ... . [ Baby crying ] [ Banging and yelling ] [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] [ Car engine rumbling ] Well done , Steed . My pleasure . STEED : But the nuns were a surprise . We try . DARLING : You never can tell- - STEED : When the enemy will strike . If we still have an enemy . There 's always an enemy , Steed . You just have to know where to look . DARLING : Something 's up at The Ministry . They want you to meet somebody . Well , they know where to find me . STEED : Macaroons for Mother . [ Electronic beeping ] [ Phone rings ] Good morning , Prime Minister . Yes , Prime Minister . The Prospero Program weather shield is down . MOTHER : Yes , all of it . The entire grid . [ Incoherent voice of Prime Minister talking on phone ] Yes , it 's bad . Right away . [ Doorbell rings ] MESSENGER : Dr. Peel ? " Please answer the telephone . " [ Phone rings ] VOICE ON PHONE : Good morning , Dr. Peel . We 've scheduled an appointment for you . John Steed . Boodle 's Gentlemen 's Club . One hour . Thank you . [ Footsteps ] PORTER : May I help you , madam ? EMMA : For Mr. John Steed , I 'm Dr. Peel . PORTER : I 'm afraid that 's impossible . - You are female . - As you see . Then you can 't come in . EMMA : I have an appointment . No women . PORTER : Not in Boodle 's . Not since 1762 . EMMA : Really ? [ Scattered conversations ] [ Crash ] STEED : Dr. Peel , I presume . EMMA : And you must be Steed . Please don 't get up . STEED : And I was about to throw in the towel . EMMA : Spot of bother at the door . Well , I shouldn 't wonder . Not a woman inside Boodle 's since- - 1762 . Yes . EMMA : So what was all this ? Some sort of test ? Congratulations . You 've entered a bastion of male privilege . You 're not someone who plays by the rules . Rules are made to be broken . STEED : Not by me . Play by the rules , Doctor , or the game is nothing . And just what is the game ? This is all terribly formal . Must I go on calling you Dr. Peel ? No , no . Under the circumstances , you may call me Mrs. Peel . Much better . EMMA : Now that we 've settled the matter of titles will you kindly explain why you wished to meet me ? I didn 't . Mother did . " Mother ? " Mother . STEED : Four o 'clock . Mustn 't be late . EMMA : Time for tea ? Word of warning : Don 't take the macaroon . Mother 's favorite . FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE : You are now entering a restricted area . [ Beeping ] I always prefer a room with a view , don 't you ? Tea ? I know about the Prospero incident . Sugar , one lump . - Is that why I 'm here ? - You 're here for tea , Mrs. Peel . Welcome to The Ministry . Macaroon ? Prospero . Prospero . Shakespeare 's magician . STEED : Do explain . Top-secret research . A government project I was working on to create a weather shield . A defensive umbrella . I get it . Someone attacks , we put up this umbrella everyone goes home for tea . Marvelous . Until someone blows up the research lab . STEED : But did they just walk in ? STEED : How did they get past security ? MOTHER : That 's what 's interesting . Security cameras at the Prospero lab picked up a picture during the attack . MOTHER : Something I 'd like you to see , if you have a moment . After tea . Of course . [ Beeping ] [ Soft , dramatic instrumental music , background ] Well , she looks terribly familiar . You 're our chief suspect . EMMA : I 'm innocent , of course . Or guilty until proven innocent . - Why would I sabotage my own project ? - You tell us . EMMA : Looks like me . But it isn 't . You will be allowed the privilege to prove your innocence . MOTHER : If you didn 't blow up Prospero , find out who did . Mother would like me to show you the ropes . He 'd like us to work as a team . You mean I have to trust you ? Absolutely , Mrs. Peel . Shall we ? MOTHER : Do you think Mrs. Peel is dangerous , Father ? All in my report , Mother . MOTHER : Why haven 't I read it ? Because I haven 't given it to you . My theory goes : Mrs. Peel may be ill . MOTHER : Amnesia ? FATHER : Possibly a split personality . Maybe trauma . There was a husband . Test pilot . Missing over the Amazon . Presumed dead . FATHER : He was one of ours . Revenge is a possible motive . She certainly fits our profile . FATHER : How could you have released her ? MOTHER : Mrs. Peel is our only lead . Either she 'll lead us to the real enemy or they 'll find her . [ Swords clanking ] We were bombarding protons and ions to make antimatter . STEED : I shall have to start calling you " Doctor " again . EMMA : Artificially creating new weather systems . You 're a lady of hidden talents , Mrs. Peel . [ Swords clanking ] [ Emma grunts ] A little more flexibility in the wrist . STEED : Scientist swordsman . To what do you attribute your overachievements ? EMMA : My father always wanted a boy . STEED : Oh , really ? I fail to see the connection . I had a feeling you would . So did he . [ Swords clanking ] Touché . The ebony handles are a touch heavy , Trubshaw . I 'll stick to the rosewood . Excellent , sir . If you 'd step this way ... . EMMA : Now my knight has chosen his armor . Shouldn 't we be on our way ? Well , Trubshaw 's a man worth meeting . No point in setting out half-shod . That 's why I ordered you a pair of boots , Mrs. Peel . Thank you . I hope your shoes and waistcoat please you , sir . STEED : lmpeccable . TRUBSHAW : Quite . Your items will be delivered to the usual address . Mrs. Peel 's boots ? - Send them on . - Of course . STEED : Mother suggested we go for a spin . EMMA : Do you always listen to Mother ? STEED : That depends . STEED : Marvelous weather . Not the sort of day to be stuck in town . STEED : I think we ought to get away . EMMA : " We ? " STEED : Yes , just the two of us . A weekend in the country , long walks , the wind in your hair . STEED : How about it ? EMMA : Depends what you have in mind . STEED : I 'm a nature lover , so whatever comes naturally . Should we take my car ? [ Engine stalls ] That 's odd . Rusty , perhaps ? I hope I haven 't lost the knack . [ Engine revs ] EMMA : ls the pot warm ? STEED : Always . - Milk ? - Lemon , just a twist . No cakes , I 'm afraid . You don 't mind roughing it , do you ? On the contrary . - Should we be making plans for tonight ? - We are . I thought we 'd have time to pay a social visit , since we happen to be passing . I thought as much . - Anyone in particular ? - Sir August de Wynter . Former Ministry man , head of Special Projects . Ran our Strategic Deception lnitiative . He 's retired now . Very rich . Very odd . Intriguing . - A wealthy recluse . - More interesting than that . Sir August 's a fanatical meteorologist . It runs in the family . Mother called April , sisters : May , June- - July , August . The family does have weather on the brain . Any other vices ? All of a piece , really . Sir August 's chairman of BROLLY : British Royal Organization for Lasting Liquid Years . It 's a private group recruiting top scientists . He thinks British weather has been tampered with by aliens . They 're not too keen on him at The Ministry . - Mother tells me he left under- - - A cloud ? Naturally . If it wouldn 't be too much bother , could you charm him a little ? I 'll see what I can do . More tea ? No , thanks . I meant me . STEED : I 'll snoop around . You distract him . EMMA : How ? STEED : Try small talk . The weather ? Maybe something more feminine . A woman 's touch . - That should do it . - Think so ? Your confidence is overwhelming . Such modesty . A minor talent . Or hadn 't you noticed ? [ Birds chirping ] [ Dramatic instrumental music , background ] [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] [ Dramatic music plays on organ ] [ Footsteps ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Soft instrumental music , background ] Curious . - Miss ? - Mrs . Mrs. - Thank you . - Ma 'am . EMMA : Hello ? [ Birds chirping ] EMMA : Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? [ Suspenseful instrumental music , background ] SIR AUGUST : Peel . Emma Peel . You 're all wet . Have we met , or is it just the rain that 's familiar ? We share a passion , I believe . I have always admired a woman who is meteorologically inclined . Mutual , I 'm sure . EMMA : The thrill of the monsoon ? SIR AUGUST : Ah , yes , the monsoons . Even as a boy , when Nana taught me the naming of the clouds ... . - Cumulus . - Yes . - Stratocumulus . - Oh , yes . Nimbus . I discovered then , nothing beats a good lashing . Mind your head . Take India . You can have a good ten inches overnight there . You know one should never fear being wet . Come this way . Allow me . These rapid climate changes . - The Ministry needs some answers . - Oh , that Ministry ! Dry enough , don 't you think ? Do you mind ? Very well . I need a specialist 's opinion . Theoretically speaking , if I wanted to alter cloud patterns how would I power it ? By microtransmission ? Yes , by microtransmission . The military applications were never looked into after the Cold War . The hot and the cold war . EMMA : Hot and cold war ? An outdated theory . Intriguing , but impossible . Nothing is impossible ! Only mathematically improbable . My dear Dr. Peel , look here . The twisted labellum . Note the upturned apiculus on the dorsal sepal . A genetic impossibility . That flower should not exist yet there she is . I did it . [ Dramatic instrumental music , background ] Beautiful , no ? Touch it , Dr. Peel . I feel I 'm wasting my time . No , please touch it . I 'm sorry to trouble you . It 's obvious you know nothing . I know nothing ? I have forgotten more than those fools at The Ministry ever knew ! [ Music intensifies ] SIR AUGUST : The ratio of protons to ions me ! The entire Microtransmission Theory me ! [ Yells ] I did it all ! [ Bell chimes ] Tea ? [ Soft instrumental music , background ] [ Various bird calls ] [ Phone ringing ] [ Wind gusting ] [ Phone continues ringing ] Hello ? Hello ? OPERATOR : Private property . No trespassing . Sorry ! I can 't hear you ! OPERATOR : Private property . No trespassing . [ Suspenseful instrumental music , background ] I say , this is a bit much ! Perhaps your friend would like to join us . My friend ? Some rather nasty weather out there . Perhaps he 's lost . I don 't think so . We don 't get many trespassers up here . EMMA : Really ? Why not ? We shoot them . Sugar ? [ Wind howling ] [ Eerie sound effects , background ] [ Dogs barking in distance ] [ Dogs panting ] STEED : ls that you , Mrs. Peel ? [ Steed groans ] Manners , Mrs. Peel . [ Gunshot ] EMMA : Steed ? Steed ? There you are . Tea ? With lemon . Grape ? I bought them specially . [ Steed groans ] EMMA : No ? I hope you don 't mind me taking liberties . I had to tuck you up in bed . You didn 't seem in good shape when I found you . I was frozen stiff . Now I feel much revived . Not me you should thank for that . Actually , I wasn 't about to . I recall a very strange thing . You tried to shoot me , didn 't you ? EMMA : I would never shoot you . EMMA : Not without my reasons . STEED : I remember it clearly . STEED : One shot to the heart . But , luckily , my Trubshaw waistcoat was bulletproof . Silly me , I thought you were just overdressed . EMMA : " Be prepared . " ls that your motto ? I thought it best to take precautions . One never knows . I suppose Mother warned you about women like me . STEED : Until now , I didn 't know there were women like you . EMMA : Obviously , I 'm the sort that doesn 't take " no " for an answer . I think that would depend entirely on the question , Mrs. Peel . [ Music plays softly on piano ] I say , you definitely are Mrs. Peel , aren 't you ? EMMA : You 're delirious . I should 've abandoned you . Nursing an invalid isn 't my idea of fun , after all . I could 've taken up any amount of offers . STEED : And ? I did find a clue at Sir August 's . [ Music continues playing on piano ] You see , Steed a woman 's touch ... . " Wonderland Weather . " Hello . Wonderland Weather ? TAMARA : Yes . STEED : You 've been recommended by a friend who said you 'd know all about our problem . [ Sighs ] We 're awfully worried about our roses . I don 't understand . STEED : My colleague and I represent a very influential group of flower growers working under tremendously adverse conditions . STEED : For some years , we 've been breeding a special rose the Crimson Monk until in the past week we 've been plagued by ladybirds . I thought ladybirds loved roses . A little too much , apparently . Now our flower show 's coming up . We need a few more warm summer days very quickly . TAMARA : Yes . Have you seen the seven-spotted ladybird in the mating season ? STEED : Speckled grey larvae ? A month to pupate , then no more roses . Voracious . I hope I haven 't come to the wrong place . I was recommended by a member of BROLLY . BROLLY ? Don 't say you haven 't heard of it . I was speaking to my colleague , Sir August . STEED : You do know Sir August de Wynter ? Of course . SIR AUGUST : Welcome to Wonderland Weather , here in our London headquarters . Now , allied with our colleagues from BROLLY together we will make history . [ Soft , dramatic instrumental music , background ] You all know who I am and I know all of you but you cannot know one another . Security is still paramount . SIR AUGUST : Our organization now faces its greatest test . Therefore I demand absolute loyalty absolute obedience . But if anybody wishes to resign he must do so now . And in recognition of your work a generous offer of $ 1 million awaits you . [ Sir August chuckles ] SIR AUGUST : Now does anybody wish to resign ? Please don 't be shy . Well . Well , now . We owe so much to both of you . Without your work , my humble project would perish . How can I show my appreciation ? [ Darts whiz ] Any other business ? EMMA : You actually sell weather here ? TAMARA : Yes . TAMARA : Our newest line : Summer or winter . Tuscany or Gstaad . Natural weather delivered down your phone line . All you 'll need is a radio transmitter . How real will it feel ? Very . A whole new line in personalized meteorology . Imagine ... an autumn mist , dappled sunshine through an autumn glade . TAMARA : Temperature- - STEED : Around 65 ° ? TAMARA : Whatever you fancy , sir . Marvelous . A solution to matters meteorological and horticultural and to my roses . [ Horn beeps ] Excuse me . Hurry back . [ Sound of wind gusting ] [ Thunder roars ] [ Dramatic instrumental music , background ] Babbington , head of Prospero Research . And ? EMMA : Morton his assistant . [ Loud clank ] [ Fast-paced , suspenseful instrumental music , background ] EMMA : I 'll take the high road . STEED : And I 'll take the low road . [ Elevator humming ] [ Suspenseful music continues ] STEED : Good morning . STEED : That was a very silly thing to do . [ Thug screams ] [ Fast-paced , dramatic instrumental music , background ] [ Bailey groans ] [ Tires screech ] [ Soft , dramatic instrumental music , background ] [ Emma groans ] STEED : Mrs. Peel ? [ Dramatic instrumental music , background ] [ Emma groans ] Just in time to save me from myself . STEED : Are you all right ? I thought I was seeing double . That makes two of us . So now you 're saying there are two Mrs. Peels ? FATHER : Preposterous ! Let me handle this . I 'm in charge . We both know who 's responsible . This story is a complete red herring . It 's quite impossible . Nothing is impossible . I often think of six impossible things before breakfast . Thank you for your contribution . And now will you kindly allow me to continue ? Steed , you were saying ? I was saying someone 's recruiting your Prospero scientists under a cover organization . But it 's not Mrs. Peel . If you 're so sure of her innocence , do you have another suspect ? I may . What makes you so sure of an attack ? The World Council of Ministers is meeting on St. Swithin 's Day the patron saint of weather- - FATHER : You see ? STEED : I do see . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . I saw both Mrs. Peels , with my own eyes . [ Bell rings ] We can 't waste any more time . He has his orders . MOTHER : I 'm counting on you , Steed . The clock is ticking . [ Dramatic instrumental music , background ] [ Electronic beeping ] [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] [ Thunder roars ] [ Thunder roars ] A perfect dress rehearsal . [ Electronic beeping ] STEED : Mother and Father are convinced an attack will take place . Could someone like Sir August really target a kind of weather bomb ? Queen to rook five . If they knew what they were doing . It 's all a question of protons and ions . STEED : Do explain . Left on their own , they repel each other . Very unstable . Knight to knight four . To achieve fusion , they require a little extra oomph . STEED : A gentle embrace , as opposed to a clinch . Low excitation energy , technically speaking . Then , boom . Exactly . The pawn to knight four . EMMA : Look , I 've been charting these weather outbreaks . Pawn to queen 's knight three . EMMA : Are you paying attention ? STEED : Absolutely . A believer in firm discipline . Do you always obey orders ? STEED : Always . Except when I don 't . Knight to queen five . For example , if I were , perish the thought , under orders to kill you ... . EMMA : Pity you never told me . STEED : You never asked . I can 't mention everything . Besides , we were getting along so well . You didn 't want to spoil the fun . STEED : It would 've put a damper on things , don 't you agree ? I 'm intrigued . Pawn to queen 's bishop three . What did you have in mind ? Nothing too messy , I hope . No need to dwell on the unsavory aspects . After all , according to your file , you 're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions , suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression leading to outbursts of antisocial and violent behavior . Knight to king seven . Check . Is that really what you think of me ? Well just my type , Mrs. Peel . [ Soft instrumental music , background ] Good , because I think I found something . You never fail to surprise me . On this map here a cluster of microclimates around a single area . Very , very strange . STEED : Time to pay Sir August another visit . Your move . EMMA : Queen takes knight . Checkmate . It 's just a game . I can 't hold off The Ministry much longer . This Mrs. Peel , I 'm warning you , don 't let her get too close . Good shot . Don 't worry . I 'll take care of Mrs. Peel . You 're playing rather well today , Father . - Shall we double the bet ? - Yes . I 've never been able to refuse you anything . Pity . Just missed . [ Sir August chuckles ] I win again . [ Electronic buzzing and beeping ] [ Engine revs ] I thought you lived on the edge , Mrs. Peel . Is this as fast as you can go ? Have I trespassed on a male prerogative ? We 're being followed . What 's that noise ? [ Propellers pelting ] Insects . Bigger every year . [ Buzzing and pelting sounds ] STEED : Sir August thinks of everything . Hold on . [ Electronic beeping ] [ Electronic beeping ] [ Fast-paced , dramatic instrumental music , background ] [ Propellers pelting ] [ Machine-gun blasting ] BAILEY : Let 's go ! [ Propellers pelting ] [ Machine-gun blasts ] [ Fast-paced , dramatic instrumental music , background ] [ Tires screech ] [ Bailey hollers ] [ Fast-paced , dramatic instrumental music continues ] STEED : Head down . [ Machine-gun blasts ] [ Propellers pelting ] [ Engine accelerates ] [ Men holler ] [ Men gasping ] [ Emma gasps ] [ Tires screech ] Would you please be so kind as to hit the ground if it 's not too much trouble ? I hope he was a baddy . ALICE : My name 's Alice . Mother said you 'd be on your way . STEED : John Steed . ALICE : And this must be Mrs. Peel . Mrs. Peel , Alice . EMMA : How do you do ? Cocky little bastard . Indeed . - Are you with Mother or Father ? - Both , actually . I 'm glad to hear they 're together at last . They don 't get along . Promotion , top job , most unfair . ALICE : Quite a fuss at The Ministry . STEED : You don 't say . ALICE : I think we should be on our way . ALICE : Someone didn 't want you to get to the party . EMMA : I expect we 'll have to gatecrash . ALICE : This way . I know a back way in . [ Light instrumental music , background ] [ Camera shutter clicks ] Excuse me . You are a Gemini , Mrs. Peel ? EMMA : How did you guess ? Let 's take separate paths . We 'll meet in the middle . Perfect . Ah , yes , it 's clear now . A love maze in a trapezoid shape . A love maze . Originally late-17th-century design , then copied . EMMA : Over here , by your side . STEED : I was worried . EMMA : How touching . Afraid you 'd lost me ? STEED : No , that you might escape . Still suspicious ? Just wondering if you 'd brought me here under false pretenses . Frankly , I 'm amazed . Perhaps I should run away . STEED : I 'll have to give chase . I 'll hide . EMMA : How romantic . Do try . [ Birds chirping ] [ Emma gasps ] Sir August de Wynter . STEED : John Steed . [ Fast-paced , dramatic instrumental music , background ] An old trick I learned from a dervish in Istanbul . Turkish rules . - If you insist . - Then try this . [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] A man with an umbrella is a man praying for rain . And a man without one is a fool . Never trust the weather , Sir August . Rain or shine all is mine . [ Soft instrumental music , background ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Electronic buzzing and whirring ] [ Emma groans ] SIR AUGUST : So glad you could come . I thought I 'd drop in . SIR AUGUST : Comfortable ? How cozy . Just the two of us ? SIR AUGUST : Yes , like spoons in a drawer . EMMA : Perhaps I could help you , if I knew what you wanted . The only thing I want is you . How touching . SIR AUGUST : Join me , Emma and we have the world . EMMA : You would have to say " please . " But of course . If you insist . [ Emma gasps ] Please . SIR AUGUST : When you awaken you will remember nothing . Remember nothing . ALICE : Steed ? Steed , are you all right ? I thought I was seeing double again . You were . A Gemini , definitely . No time to lose . Here 's the plan . [ Waltz music , background ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Waltz music continues ] [ Dramatic instrumental music , background ] [ Doorbell rings ] [ Doorbell continues ringing ] [ Doors slam ] [ Emma gasping ] [ Doorbell continues ringing ] Raffle tickets ? Church fete . Could I possibly winkle a cake out of you ? Or perhaps a small donation ? Not today , thank you . ALICE : Do come . Tombola , Lucky Dip , Pin the Tail on the Donkey- - [ Yells ] Nor any other day ! If you 're going to be difficult , I 'm afraid I 'll have to insist . Where 's Mrs. Peel ? [ Slow , dramatic instrumental music , background ] [ Emma grunts ] [ Emma gasps ] [ Eerie , distorted sound effects , background ] [ Emma gasps ] [ Sound effects continue ] [ Emma gasps ] [ Church bell rings in distance ] [ Rapping ] [ Emma gasps ] [ Smash ] [ Thud , Alice groans ] STEED : Mrs. Peel ? [ Footsteps ] STEED : Don 't worry , you 're in my flat . Quite safe . EMMA : What am I doing here ? STEED : Having tea . EMMA : ls that all ? STEED : After a manner of speaking . STEED : Your boots from Trubshaw . They might be useful . STEED : Allow me . I was worried . What happened to you ? EMMA : I remember the maze , a house some music . EMMA : Then nothing . STEED : Try to remember . It 's very important . I believe you 're in extreme danger . You 'd better stay here with me . Is that wise ? STEED : You 'll be safer here . We can talk things through . An official debriefing . No interruptions . You live alone ? No Mrs. Steed ? STEED : Well , since you ask ... . Mrs. Steed lives in Wiltshire . My mother . I had you down as a creature of habit . EMMA : A bachelor 's life . It 's worked quite well , until now . Don 't tell me you never met the right girl . There 's always the exception . That proves the rule ? Quite . You 're exceptional in many things . STEED : But duty ... Shall we make a start ? A time and place for everything . [ Soft instrumental music , background ] Now is definitely the time . And the place . Too tight . Push . [ Door bangs open ] Steed . Do come in . I didn 't hear you knock . FATHER : We can dispense with formalities . I want Mrs. Peel . Interrogation . Nothing I could do about it . FATHER : Security restrictions , Steed , applied to you . Mrs. Peel is under arrest . [ Engine revs ] SECURITY AGENT : ln you go . Sorry , Steed . Father 's taken control . She always wanted Mother off the case . There 's only one place to go , but I 'll need clearance . I 'll fix it . [ Thunder rumbles ] [ Dramatic instrumental music , background ] [ Knocking ] [ Door squeaks ] STEED : Hello ? INVISIBLE JONES : Hello . Brenda told me to expect you , Steed . Hello ? JONES : Talk to the pipe . That usually helps . STEED : Colonel Jones ? JONES : Don 't worry about me being invisible . Other than that , I 'm perfectly normal . I see . JONES : Or rather , you don 't . Learnt the trick in camouflage , till the accident made rather a mess of things . Now I 'm stuck away in the basement . Lucky if I even get the tea trolley . I 'm afraid I don 't have much time . I 'd like you to take a look at this map . I want to know something more about the Prospero Program . JONES : Where 'd you find this ? STEED : Wonderland Weather . JONES : Retail meteorology . JONES : I believe you 've jogged my memory , Steed . I may have to dig a little deeper , though . Shall I ? JONES : Follow me . FATHER : Hello , Mrs. Peel . Welcome back to The Ministry . Now , we 're going to have a talk . EMMA : About the weather ? How topical . It 'll help pass the time . EMMA : Time would pass anyway , if you think about it logically . But so few do think logically or even anti-logically . Clockwise or anti-clockwise . Tick-tock , tock-tick . Seesaw , Margery Daw . It amounts to the same thing . After all , how do you know I 'm the real Mrs. Peel ? How real do you feel , Mrs. Peel ? EMMA : I 'll repeat the question bypassing the weather , which , being British , we 'll return to in a moment . EMMA : Do I walk like Mrs. Peel ? Talk like Mrs. Peel ? EMMA : Am I witty , wise , wonderful to know ? Or do I go around shooting Ministry agents attempting to rule the world on my days off ? Now you 'rejust playing games . Of course ! The Ministry cloning program . Sir August ran it , but it appears he went too far . Some of his more advanced experiments are not too pleasant . So they pulled him off it . STEED : Anything else ? JONES : As I recall , there was some former Ministry land used as a secret military installation and sold by us to Sir August years ago . JONES : And authorized by Father . Eeny-meeny-miny-mole . JONES : And this is the site . STEED : But where is it ? JONES : According to your map , it 's an island right here in the middle of London . JONES : It must be where he 's controlling the weather . STEED : Why did you never tell anyone ? JONES : Nobody ever asked . COUNCIL MINISTER 2 : These changes in weather are controlled and aggressive . MOTHER : Yes , Prime Minister . We 're monitoring the situation . The Council of Ministers is now in emergency session . [ Incoherent discussions on TV ] The weather is getting worse by the minute . [ Loud drumbeat ] SIR AUGUST : Now is the winter ofyour discontent . Above you the weather is changing . The temperature is dropping . Soon it will be freezing . SIR AUGUST : Why ? Because the weather is no longer in God 's hands , but in mine . [ Excited reactions from ministers ] Those clouds all controlled by me are recreating the weather . SIR AUGUST : I have set off a chain reaction that will paralyze and ultimately destroy the city . SIR AUGUST : The countdown has already begun . [ Intense , dramatic music , background ] SIR AUGUST : And this is merely the beginning ! MINISTER 1 : This is outrageous ! It 's blackmail ! Do shut up ! Hundreds of millions will die . They 'll drown burn freeze . You and your governments have no choice . You will buy your weather from me and , by God , you 'll pay for it . MINISTER 2 : Unacceptable ! SIR AUGUST : Any attempt at interference will only lead to automatic annihilation . [ Dramatic music continues ] SIR AUGUST : And , by the way you have until midnight ... [ Yells ] ... tonight ! Alice , are you all right ? Sir August 's demands . He wants them delivered directly to the Prime Minister . " Ten percent of our gross national product annually . " That 's preposterous . There will be no negotiation . His words exactly . He says unless we accept his demands , the weather will get colder and colder until we 'll all have to go to hell just to warm up . Did Sir August torture you , Alice ? No , he didn 't have to . Knows everything already . Breach of security , top level . Father . [ Dramatic instrumental music , background ] Alert security . MOTHER : Sorry , Father . The game 's up . FATHER : Careful , it might go off . We don 't want another accident . Half-working , as you are . Poor Mother , finally figured it out . But too late . Nonsense . Mother knows best . MOTHER : I want you to release Mrs. Peel . FATHER : Certainly . But which one ? [ Gasping ] It really isn 't Mother 's day . [ Fast-paced , dramatic instrumental music , background ] [ Radar whistling ] [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] SIR AUGUST : On course to base . Seven degrees east , north by northwest . Navigation control . Anti-cyclone . Pull the right . FATHER : I have Mrs. Peel on board and heading back to base . We 'll keep you informed of our progress . FATHER : Message end . [ Gasps ] [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] MOTHER : The balloon , Steed . The balloon . Don 't mind me . [ Flames roar ] [ Emma groans ] SIR AUGUST : You 're drifting . [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] [ Beeping ] SIR AUGUST : You 're drifting off course . You 're losing altitude . SIR AUGUST : You 've drifted off course ! [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] [ Grunting and groaning ] [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] [ Radar whistling ] [ Beeping ] [ Radar whistling ] Prince Charming , I presume ? STEED : Hardly , I 'm afraid . A micro-tag concealed in your boots . Thank you ... . Trubshaw . Are you all right ? And the other Mrs. Peel ? Dispatched , I think . Sad , in a way . Here , let me help you . [ Soft instrumental music , background ] [ Emma sighs ] I wonder ... . [ Steed clears his throat ] EMMA : Unless I 'm very much mistaken that was a kiss , Steed . Yes . Technically . " Technically ? " Well , I would never presume . It was more in the spirit of scientific inquiry . Aah . Hard evidence , you might say . I realized that immediately . STEED : Of course you did . I needed proof that you were definitely Mrs. Peel . I see . And convinced ? Well , I 'm still thinking . Dense cloud formations moving northeast , sir . Some sort of radio transmitter . [ Prime Minister 's voice talking on phone ] Of course we have it under control , sir . [ Dramatic instrumental music , background ] Not quite under control , but- - Yes , sir . I understand , sir . Our agents are on the case right now , sir . Two of them , sir . A man and a woman , sir . [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] STEED : According to Colonel Jones this is the site of a Ministry installation sold off years ago to- - EMMA : Wonderland Weather , I bet . STEED : Quite . [ Dramatic instrumental music continues ] [ Suspenseful instrumental music , background ] EMMA : Something up ahead . STEED : Alas , poor Teddy ... . EMMA : I knew him , Steed . EMMA : Penrose head of Antimatter Fission at Prospero . The teddy bears are having a picnic . We 're getting warm . Seems familiar . Mrs. Peel , you 're needed . Excuse me . Equipment needs adjusting . Nothing broken , I hope . My umbrella . Tight fit in here . Allow me . [ Phone dings ] EMMA OVER SPEAKER : How now , brown cow ? Welcome .

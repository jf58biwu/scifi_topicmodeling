Let 's pray I have the energy to get myself another beer . What is this , the Middle Ages ? LEELA : Look at you guys . - You 've become a fat sack of crap . - Sack ? Bender , your beer belly 's so big your door won 't close . AMY : And that doesn 't make sense . LEELA : You 're coming to the gym . The gymnasium ? Excellent ! For some reason , I 'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday . [ GRUNTS ] Who 's up for a steam ? That phrase has unpleasant associations for me . I 'll work out with the Nautilus . - What up , Dr. Z ? - Yo , yo . What 's up ? Give up the rock ! Co-ed steam rooms . I love the future . - You 're in the women 's steam room . - Whatever . Look what life was like before genetic engineering . Those poor 20th-century women . Oh , yeah . Invigorating . Hey , handsome . Have room for two ? You wish . Hey , Leela , look who 's the super stud . Somebody must have turned down the gravity . [ CHOKES ] Give me that ! More weight . FRY : What 's that jazz on your head ? Enough questions . More weight ! More ! More ! Maybe you could do more reps with lower weight . [ SCREAMING ] Looks like Zoidberg 's finally coming out of his shell . Get it ? He 's coming out ... [ ROARS ] Nice and gentle . We don 't want any unnecessary stress . [ BABIES CRYING ] - Is there a doctor in the gym ? - I 'm a doctor ! [ SCREAMING ] [ GROWLS ] LEELA : Why 's he acting this way ? - He seemed the most normal . - I am normal . Amy , take off these rubber bands and I 'll show you . Fool me seven times , shame on you . Fool me eight times , shame on me . FRY : Maybe he has a parasite . HERMES : Maybe he is one . It 's sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a clambake and cook him . Yee-ha ! This won 't do . Let met give old Zoidie a sedative . - Much better . You can remove these . - I 'll do it . HERMES : Look out ! BENDER : Moron ! Hm . Oh-ho . A-ha ! There 's the problem . Give it to me straight . Is it fin rot ? It 's fin rot , isn 't it ? Relax , chum . There 's no problem . - You 're just heavy with male jelly . - Ugh . It 's mating season for his people . A time when his behavior is run by the brain in his rump . Yuck . - There 's one thing we can do . - I 'll boil the water . We , I mean you , have to rush him to his ancient home world which will soon erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex . - Oh , baby , I 'm there ! - Do you understand " invertebrate " ? It 's not the word I care about . No need to pack pants . Let 's roll ! Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these . [ ZOIDBERG ROARS ] [ SCREAMING ] BENDER : Moron ! Welcome home , old friend ! Just 1 9 hours until the frenzy ! - Excellent ! Excellent ! - See ya there , Doctor ... [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] Is that how you say " Zoidberg " ? You didn 't have to point out his speech impediment . BENDER : You 're looking less nuts . - I 'm feeling less nuts . Tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly in the cloacal vents of a female . - Lf you catch my drift . - Who 's the lobsterina ? Not sure . I shall attract one today with an erotic display . You people fall in love so fast . " Love " ? That word 's unknown here . I want a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material . You and me both , brother ! Ah ! My old scuttling grounds . Let 's pull over . I used to hang out here as a larva . It looked so much bigger back then . Who 's the tough guy now , Vinnie ? [ GRUNTING ] Look ! Outdoor theater ! Let 's get tickets ! It 's the Ceremony of Claw Plock . Where my species fight to the death over honor . Also sometimes money . Usually money . I didn 't come to see two guys . Where do you do your erotic display ? Same place as your species . The beach ! - How do I look ? - Like whale barf . Then the illusion is complete . I wonder if they 're here to watch the erotic display too . Perfect . This ought to make me stand out . [ CROWS ] [ CROWING ] - Look how silly they look . - He 's no different from you organisms shooting DNA at each other to make babies . It 's offensive ! You 're obsessed with porn . Your mail goes to a strip club . If robots can 't reproduce , why are they so interested in sex ? Entirely for the perversion . Keep your jelly away from my eggs . So not interested . I 've heard that line before . [ SIGHS ] [ PURRING ] [ CROWS ] What 's the point ? Why 's he still alone ? He 's a loser , that 's why . He 's the lobster equivalent of Fry . I can get any girl I want , any time I want . I 'm just too busy . [ PURRS ] Edna , it 's me , Zoidberg . Remember ? From high school ? [ PURRS ] My face was covered with barnacles . I didn 't know you were back in town . I heard you became a rich doctor . I 've performed a few mercy killings . So as long as I 'm in town , I was wondering if maybe , well ... . Gee . Yeah , I 'm just going through a lot of things right now , and ... Look , I carry more eggs than other females . I owe it to our race to pick a mate stuffed with jelly . - Maybe a rock star . - Or a doctor ? I 'm sorry . You 're just an inferior male specimen . Nice seeing you again . No one will ever mate with me . Not with a puny claw like this . You see those guys ? They were giant claws with bodies . - You didn 't smell as bad . - You 're right ! My stink gland is weak ! Smell ! You gotta fake like you 're in love . Look her in the eyes , start crying and say , " I 've never been so happy . " If a guy ever did that , I 'd know it . Wait a second . They 've all done that . Even Sean ! Hm . This " love " intrigues me . Teach me to fake it ! You 're on a date . What do you do ? - Ask her to mate . - Say she 's special . She 's not . She just has the largest clutch of eggs . - Well , tell her that . Then ? - Then mating ? No . Make up feelings and tell her you have them . Yes ? - Is " desire to mate " a feeling ? - You 're not even trying . It 's all so complicated . The romance and the lies upon lies . Don 't worry . The love meister will take you under his wing . Now there 's a bird involved ? FRY : Okay , go ahead . What the ... ? Dr. Zoidberg ? Your display failed . Why are you trying to talk to me ? I don 't know . You just wanna talk . I just wanna talk . That doesn 't make sense . That doesn 't make sense . But okay . Tell her she looks thin . You seem malnourished . Do you suffer from parasites ? Yes . Thanks for noticing . - Ask about her day . - Why would I care ? - You wouldn 't . Ask . - How was your day ? Well , first I got up and had a piece of toast . Then I went to the store . And ... Look , she won 't shut up . It 's normal . Just nod and say , " Uh-huh . " - Uh-huh . Uh-huh . EDNA : Then you threw an octopus . It 's crazy , but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies seem less obvious . Your genes seem less detrimental . You even stink more . - Ask her to mate ? - Third date . BENDER : So I returned his artificial heart . Since then , I 've been called " Honest Bender . " [ LAUGHING ] " I 'd like to propose a toast to ... Edna " ? Oh , Edna . " Truly the world 's prettiest , most kick-ass crab monster . " - That 's the most beautiful thing . - Yes , well excuse me , I must powder my mouth flaps . Me too . I 'm confused . I 'm feeling a strange new emotion . Is it love when you care for a female for reasons beyond mating ? No . Must be some alien emotion . He said some dumb stuff , but he 's a nice guy . Really . Fry 's been telling him what to say . And Fry 's a ... - Do you have idiots on your planet ? - Fry ? Words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous alien ? Yeah . What ? Look , never mind the words . Zoidberg 's a doctor . A doctor , honey . EDNA : Come in . [ EDNA PURRS ] Hello , Fry . Interested in some surf and turf ? I came to tell you that Zoidberg 's great . He 's got jelly out the wazoo . That is where it comes out . It 's not everything . I know Zoidberg 's words were yours . Teach me to love , you squishy poet from beyond ! I 'm flattered . If I did it with a mud-bug , you 'd top the list . Hush , you romantic fool . Engage your mandibles and kiss me . [ EDNA SUCKS ] [ FRY SQUEALS ] Edna ? I couldn 't stand it any longer . L ... [ SCREAMS ] [ FRY COUGHS ] Fry ! [ GLASS BREAKS ] It 's not how it looks ! - Her caviar is on your neck ! - But ... EDNA : It 's true , Zoidberg . We can 't hide it any longer . We 're in love , and we 're mating tomorrow ! - What ? ! - Fry ! I challenge you to Claw Plock ! [ GONG SOUNDS ] - English , please ? - A fight to the death ! [ GONG SOUNDS ] And if you survive , we 'll make sweet love . [ GONG SOUNDS ] The law is clear . Fry and Zoidberg shall fight to the death for the beautiful and egg-stuffed Edna . - But I don 't want her ! Once invoked , the tradition of Claw Plock can 't be taken back . It 's a recent tradition , only 1 8 years old , but it is a tradition . CROWD : Hooray ! I 'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you ! This is madness ! You 're being irrational ! Of course I 'm being irrational ! I 'm in love ! LEELA : Aw . - Leela ! - Right , right . You have to stop this ! Listen , lady . As you can see I 'm a highly desirable male groaning with jelly . Yet I embrace celibacy to uphold our crazy traditions . - One of your friends must die ! - Fate is cruel and unyielding . And what must be , must be . Taking bets ! 9-to-2 on Zoidberg , the crab with the jab ! The Great Red Hope ! Come on , baby ! It 's been years since medical school . Remind me : - Disemboweling you , fatal or not ? - Fatal . Large bet on me in round one ! KING : Have you anything to say before begins the Claw Plock ? I do . Today I got up and had a piece of toast then I brushed my teeth ... - Shut up ! - I love you , Fry ! [ ROARS ] KING : Fry , having guessed what animal I was thinking of you have first choice of weapon . Uh-huh . Eh ... . Ah ! - And you , doctor ? - I choose my claws . I want to chop him here , in the gonads . Shh . Nobody correct him . Fry , I 've never asked for anything before ... . When it comes to the ninth round , let him win . - It 's a fight to the death ! - Suddenly it 's all about you ! Thanks a lot , friend ! Please rise for the national anthem . [ ORGAN PLAYS ] Let Claw Plock begin ! [ LAUGHS ] Ow . [ FRY LAUGHS ] [ CHEERING ] Come on , Fry ! At least die with dignity ! FRY : A-ha ! ZOIDBERG : Thank you . FRY : Oops . EDNA : No ! I can 't stand to look ! [ GASPING ] SPECTATOR 1 : Crack him open ! SPECTATOR 2 : Kill him ! BENDER : Psst ! Fry ! Take a dive ! CROWD : Claw Plock ! Claw Plock ! [ GASPING ] Fellow fish monsters , I don 't want to question your stupid civilization but will killing someone with a nutcracker solve anything ? He 's my friend . Though a woman has come between us we 'll remain friends . And you know why ? One reason . You bastard ! I 'll kill you ! You bastard ! [ GROANING ] LEELA : Wait ! Stop ! Everyone is gone ! Edna ? Honey ? [ CROWING ] [ GASPING ] Edna ! [ WATER SPLASHING ] LEELA : Ew . BENDER : My god ! The frenzy ! Oh , the greatest experience in life and I missed it . I 'm sorry , Doc . The frenzy is over . How will I get rid of my jelly now ? - Well , first you ... - Fry ! - Hey ! - Shoo ! Get away , hey ! What 's with the flying jerks ? They feast after the frenzy . Once my species passes its genes , it dies . You have to choose between life without sex and death ? - Yes . - Tough call . It was nice of you to let me fix your arm . Especially after I made an eel out of myself . It was that or bleed to death . So no biggie . Yes , biggie . I felt things I never felt before . Love , jealousy , passion for disemboweling . I owe it all to you . Under your hard shell you 're really soft and tender . That 's true . What 's your point ? I pronounce the operation a success . - Hooray ! - Yeah ! I don 't know emotions . But medicine , forget about it . Not to nitpick , doc , but could you take one more whack at this ? All right . All right . Always with the arms . Tell you what . I 'll move your head between them . Never mind .

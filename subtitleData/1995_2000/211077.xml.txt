 I understand the pressure that you 're under , I do . Daddy , Daddy . I know how patient you have been with my handling of Jarod , but , No more excuses . I ¡ ­ wasn 't finished . What ? I thought you came here to kill me . Better to find the story . Who are you ? My name is Igor . - Let me go , Frankenstein . - I 'm going to ... Beautiful , beautiful . People think spontaneous combustion is a myth . I don 't . I wouldn 't be caught dead because of combustion in my pocket . Hey , look at this . Focus . There must be an connection between " ring a bell " and the Frankenstein movie . Do you remember any of the dialogue ? Something like : " Who are you ? " " My name is Igor . " Hey , Son of Frankenstein ! Basil Rathbone goes back to his dad 's castle and meets Igor , Bela Lugosi . And they bring the monster back to life . It 's not a Jesus James Whale 's movie , but , it 's definitely get a chatter . Oh , you are a lonely man , aren 't you ? Look . It 's an angel with the broken wing . Perhaps Jarod perceives himself as a fallen angel ? Or he simply forgot to put the caution fragile tags on the box ? Hey look ! Igor knows the secret . What 's secret ? The Center throw a rock in you head one . I am calling Bjorn to getting ... Broots , why don 't you watch Son of Frankenstein again , and see if Basil is a wonder boy . We have half of our sweapers out there looking for him . We are gonna find him . And when we do , we 'll have a little spontaneous combustion of my own in mind . That 's him ! Get him ! I 'll get him out ! Mark , get in ! There are pretenders among us . I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours , he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because what I thought up ? Since I broke up , I spent every moment searching for my past . He is a pretender . A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Center wants him alive . - Preferably . He defends the weak and abused . Life is a gift . THE PRETENDER Season 2 Episode 8 FX - = YTET PRESENTS = - DICTATION : ± ¿ ± ¿ / ´ Ð ´ Ð You are a doctor ? I am today . End , cut ! Beautiful work , Jarod . That is what I get paid for . Jarod . They said that you are the hottest new special ... in town that I realised that matter literally ! Brynne McLain . Thank you for comming . I just never doubt I get invited to alive at your resume . It 's a clever idea , really sense . Although I 've been wondering why a special effects coordinator will actually do that fire stunt himself . No one pulls the stunter design unless I try to first myself . - Noble . - Smart , considering the accident on the Blaster Beer set last week . I figured the FX coordinator was a little smart that 's exactly what you mean . Producing a Super Sunday can pay a new beer , can make a break of an agency . The accident put it on jeopardy . Which is what I have wanted you to see for yourself how my effects ... Say ! Bit better . With commercial time in three million per thirty , I need Pavarotti . Twitch , and I 'll be watching grey matter of the walls . - What ? - And how is Igor ? He 'd better not snore . Oh , sounds the noisy makes keep you up , So sharp toe nails . It 's all funny , Jarod . - Will you tell me what it means ? - Ask Igor . Right . " He knows the secret . " Can we do the kwit dance another time ? Sure , if you tell the secret of who I am . You know I cann 't help you with that one . Well , then I cann 't help you with this one . But I have a god 's feeling . You figure it all out . What 're you looking at ? And now we 've got Marianne Bosha live on the scene . Friendship and Fire . As tragedy striked at the filming of Blaster beer commercial . Stuntman Dave Dugger was hospitalized with severe burns and head trauma . who attending to drive this Cadillac through out an exploding billboard . Although a small explosion was planned witnesses describe the one occured as massive . Well , our thoughts and prayers , at secure ... as well as Blaster brewery , that make us blaster beers all with Dave Dugger and Dugger family . We all wish Dave Dugger 's recovery . In meantime , we want an internal investigation . to make sure we get to the bottom of what caused this tragic accident . Adding irony a pain , this stunt was maximized by Dugger 's long time FX coordinator , and childhood friend Mickey Clausen . Dave and me have done some of the stunts a hundren times . I ... I ... don 't know what went wrong . Dave is my best friend . Excuse me . Dave Dugger 's hospitalized in the intense care unit of Queen of Hope hospital . His prognosis remains uncertain . " Tragedy on Blaster Beer Set " We thought it 's a lot of times expensive in this campaign , Jarod . Blaster brewery spend millions to launch this new beer . That 's why I hire Jarod , Mr. Connelly . He will make your beer blast through America 's TV on Super Sunday . I like ... Let me show you what we have in mind . - You remember Ray Slater . He 's my assistant . - I was Mickey Clausen 's assistant . we redesigned the stunt , so that the Blast trajectory blows over the car , it 'll be safer , yet larger blast . It 'll be a shot to die for . Hey , Jarod , you have to show your brainstorm to the director . - lan ? Ian ? - Yes . Ian Tottenham , this is Jarod Lugosi , a new special effects coordinator . Hello , Jaord . We 've all seen explosions , but we need the audience to feel the explosion , touch it , taste it , cry for it . Excuse me . Cry for it ? He 's pump us and then secure , But he want a clear directing might .. glu spot . Sounds revealing . So you are up to speed on the campaign concept ? Well , I 've never actually seen any of the commercials . Show him spots . The campaign concept involves around two young guys . Sean and Joey . - Who finds tickets to the big game - In a case of Blaster beer . - So now they are driving across America ... - In Blastermobile . - to make a time for gig-off . - the gig get them lost . In our first spot , they winded in Louisiana . and an old Cajun guy tells them to go west . - so they blast off ... - And they end up here Wow , check it out , dude ! Polar bears , penguins , Santa Clause . Dude , I don 't think this is California ! No , man . This is Cream Day . Let 's punk ! Aren 't they big talking frogs ! So who are these talking frogs ? Last year 's big commercial ? This year will be all Sean and Joey who in the last spot finally make it to California - But they ... - use too much Blaster power and they end up overshooting in San Diego when they are crashing a billboard on a beach in Tijuana . Isn 't that great ? So let me get this straight . There are people out there who will buy your beers based upon two guys who are not only two ... to read a map . but simple-minded enough to drive through an exploding billboard ? That 's our target market . Jarod , we 've got three days to finish this spot make it on your date . Can you make a scene ? Like Pavarotti . I need some remote control to do whatever it does but I can 't find it . I 'm sure it 's whereabout its line with the clues he 's given us . Come on , Igor , do something . Catch on fire , ring a bell ... Help me ! Syd , give me your cell phone . Audio-sense triggering mechanism . Just like spontaneous combustion that blew up that crate in my office . Jarod is annoying , but he is clever . ... , Brootsie . It 'll take my fingers off . Give it to me . My name is Igor . " Ring a bell " , Igor knows the secret . Igor knows the secret . Igor knows the ... Igor knows the secret . That 's it ? Another dead end . You look just like her Just like whom ? Your mother . Igor knows the secret about your mother . Cancle clever . Jarod is just annoying . Broots , I want you to search the man from DSAs , anything else you can think of . Sydney , check your files . Any reference to Igor , a name , anagram or acronym , whatever . Ok , Jarod , you got my attention . You think we 're going to need stuntman for the shoe gag ? Not if we caught the socks with ... We can put rubbers mat on the shoes . - That toys came pretty sample ? - It 's a model kit . Didn 't build models when you were a kid ? I built the Empire State building once . And I carved the design of what later became the AMC Pacer out of a bar of soap . It wasn 't my best work . How long have you been on the program ? Your ... chip . I 've been sober five years and unchanged . That 's great . Dave Dugger sponsored me on the program . He was the stuntman that was burned . Dave is the reason I 'm sober today . And you know , he is the reason I 'm alive . Sounds like a good friend to have . So what I think it is ? She was built before the fire . That 's what happened when you go to have in the potassium chlorate . Is that what Brynne 's investigation concluded ? They know Mickey Clausen screwed up . Case closed . I just find it hard to understand how he can screw up so badly . I mean every effects coordinator knows how reactive PC is . At show base , you want to keep good rep , you get to produce the flash and fx . So you think Mickey put his best friend in harms way to , enhance his reputation ? As much as I hate to say . That 's exactly I will say . Halitosis . Excuse me ? The creature from death breath . Now that is destined to become a classical among special effects ... Do I know you ? I am Jarod Lugosi . I was wondering if I might pick your brain for a minute . Yeah , this is the first . Guy who replaces me on the job comes to ask me for some point . I always learn from the best . Those are your folks ? Those are Dave Dugger 's parents . You and Dave are really close , ah ? Yeah , like brothers . His folks practically raised me . But my days in Dugger 's family are over . Because of the accident ? I must have miscalculated the amount of the oxidizer . What 's that you think happened ? Well , cars don 't blow up by themselves . Were you able to detect anything when you watch the dailies ? I cannot watch them . Here . I want you to take them . I can 't see on tape what I see in my nightmares . I just wish it were me in that car . Have you seen Dave or his parents since the accident ? I can 't face him . I can 't face his folks . Not after this . If you don 't go to the hospital , they will never know how you feel . Don 't lose the people that you love . Guy , may you have a good ride . Let 's go ! How this happened ? Get him out of it . Help me , help me ! Oh , no ! How this happen ? Get him out ... There wasn 't one explosion . There were two . You look just like her. Igor knows the secret . My name is Igor . My name ... my name is Igor . - What 's wrong with the Igor , Broots ? - I don 't know . I don 't know what it is . Forget Igor . What do you mean you didn 't find anything ? I searched the main frame , checked all the DSA logs . Just no acronyms , no anagrams , nothing on Igor . And I went through my files but I find anything pertaining to anyone but that name . Igor knows the secret . Figure it out . I 've got to get feeling . Shut that thing up or I swear to God I 'll shoot it . It 's out of function . That is automatic . Don 't , Miss Parker . ... got to get feeling . Got feeling . Wait , wait , what are you doing ? How to get feeling ? Hi . I am so sorry . I never meant ... Mickey . Now the gag would look something like this . That 's it 's . I 've seen bigger rubber burns . Those snikers were supposed to step in rock of fuel . Maybe we should use some our rubber ... Just make it big . But not too big . We got millions of dollars invested in Joey and Sean . You should ... on some ... stunt .. That 's supposed to be cold supplement and petrol . Okay , first of all , lan , it 's not called petrol . Maybe in your country they are called petrol . But over here in America , we call it gas ! - And second of all , have you been snipping son ... - Okay , people . He is right . The gasoline is way too volatile . Safety doesn 't sell beer . Flash does . I got a day and half left on the shoot . Jarod , work with me here . I have an idea , Jarod . Napalm . Napalm ? Where did you get it ? I made it . You make your own napalm ? Mickey told me how . With right balance , you can create massive explosion under control burn . It 's perfect for the shoe gag . You might have a future in this business . The tape from inside Igor is a security record of sublevel twenty-seven . So that 's what it looked like before it burned . April 12 , 1970 . The day before your mother died . Mom ! Mr. Fenigor ? Mr. Fenigor ? Fen ¡ ­ Igor ! Can you recognize him ? Too damn dark . Did you find out where they 're keeping Timmy ? He 's in room 155 . I 've got to get Jarod and Timmy out of here tonight . I have got a feeling something 's going to happen . can 't escape ... special camera records us now . I can 't have to warn people finding out about these . I 'll take care of it . The children 's lives depend on us . Who the hell is Timmy ? Somebody Mr. Igor was trying to help my mother rescue . One was Jarod . Syd , do you remember Timmy ? I want more co-operation next time . Who is that ? When can I go home , Dr. Raines ? In good time , Timmy . He 's crying , Sydney . He 's scared . - I want to talk to him . - No , Jarod . Come on . It was one of Raines ' project . And if this was going on on in SL twenty-seven ... Timmy must have been ... one of Raines ' experiments . Broots Run in Fenigor . I need to know who he is . And Sydney , you go through your files again into searching for anything on Timmy . We 're going to find room 155 . What ? You mean SL twenty-seven ? Again ? My mother wasn 't afraid to go down there . Are you ? Oh , Yeah ! That 's Raines ' secrets in sublevel . If he finds out we have been down there , He 'll have us killed . Then make sure he doesn 't find out . With the smoke , it 's fire . You shut up ? I 've been sober 5 years and unchanged . There is actually nothing on Fenigor . And the only sound of Timmy 's stay in the Center is a simple discharge ... signed by then Dr. Raines , dated April 14 , 1970 . The day after my mother was killed . How coincidental ! Hey , look ! " Lindbergh Baby Kidnapped " - Jes How long has the Center been doing this stuff down here ? Are you going to browse or you are going to help us find ... ? - Sydney , what else do Timmy 's records reveal ? - Very little . No last name , no forwarding addresses . Common for a routine discharge . Well , if it was so common then why was my mother so intending to rescue him ? Like the creature said : " Igor knows the secret . " The secret as to what got my mother killed maybe even who murdered her . Easy , Parker . One stopped at the time . The information you are talking about could get us all killed . Miss Parker . What the hell ... ? What is that ? It 's a neuro-electric chair . For a kid ? I think I 'm going to hurl ! I remember rumours about clandestine experiments involving brain-waves manipulation . No wonder my mother was trying to save Timmy , save all the children . This is unbelievable . Hey , guys Let 's get out of here . This place was trashed in a fire , we 'll never know for sure what 's happened to Timmy . Maybe , maybe not . What are you thinking , Einstein ? Let 's bring in Angelo . Maybe he can empath what happened down here . What are you doing ? You cannot sell off your business . This is your life 's work . Tell that to Dave Dugger and his parents . Mickey , they are just trying to ... what happened . Hollywood just ... what happened . There is no stuntman in this town would work with me again . I cannot believe that . Everybody in town knows how wonderful you are at your job . You are only as good as your last project . It is over , Jarod . - Alright , I 'll buy it all . - Excuse me . I 'll buy everything . Mr. Formald ¨ ¦ hyde . The lipstick camera you used to trail the cyclops The bust that you created all these wonderful grotesque figures . This one is not for sale , alright ? This is Dave Dugger . We made this bust when our first gig together here . This is the face I 'll always remember . I do not know what I 'm going to do , Jarod . I just ... What am I going to do ? What 's the matter with him ? I 've never seen him ... ! He is on empath perhaps he is confronting some negative associations as what he has for SL twenty-seven . It could have meant both . Maybe this was not a good idea . Well if he can tell us something , it is a good idea . Get him in here . Come on , let 's go , Angelo ! Angelo , Angelo , tell me what happened here ? - Angelo is frightened . - What happened here , Angelo ? Tell me about ... - Miss Parker , please . - Tell me about Timmy . Timmy ... Timmy No more Timmy . - Angelo . Angelo . - No more Timmy . Come back , Angelo . No more Timmy . - Yeah . - Ray , It is Jarod . You 're working late . ( I do a little arrangement . ) I have got some good news . I just came to the hospital , Dave Dugger regains consciousness and he 's asking for you . Ray , are you there ? Yeah . It 's ... that 's great news , Jarod . I 'm on my way . - Is he ok ? - Angelo . Can you hear me ? Angelo , can you speak ? I am sorry , Angelo . Please , talk to me . What you know may help me discover who killed my mother . Angelo . Look , I know how much this information means to you . But down here will you hit a dead end . Dead end is not our option , Sydney . Somewhere in this hell hole are the answers about Timmy and Igor , and the truth about what happened to my mother . And it 's time to take a look in the Raines ' private deal and safe files . Hey , Dave . Are you awake ? Of course . Hard to talk . How are you doing ? ( I am not likely to go to dance . ) I am sorry . Don 't get on soft on me , Ray . Now that have drawn Mickey left me ¡ ­ I need my real friends to be strong . You are the only real friend that I have left . What 's up , buddy ? Your hands are shaking . I started to drink again , Dave . Why ? It is the guilt . About what ? The ... I did to you . I don 't understand . Mickey didn 't do this to you . He was looking out for you . But Brynne , she would take no for answer . One day she talked to me about the explosions and I told her about my napalm and gave her a little demonstration . When the explosion happened , I know she 's stolen some and put it on the radiator . I confronted her about it , and she threatened to off me if I talked . With my background , nobody 's going to believe me ? My career , my family my life would have been oversewd . I sold you and Mickey out to save myself . I am sorry , Dave . I am so sorry . It 's ok , Ray . The first step towards forgiveness , is telling the truth . Hello , Brynne ? It is Jarod . I made an explosive break-through , and I would like you the first see it . Would you come to the set , before two o 'clock tomorrow ? Wonderful . Jarod . You should know I make it apart to never get intimate with any of the man I work with . Like it 's for us . The job ends today . But we still work here . I get to tell you I put so much napalm on that billboard . When this Cadillac hits it , it 's going to explode like Baghdad during the Gulf War . Watch . Hey , Brynne , why don 't we take Cadillac for a little spin before we turn ... ? Okay . Thank you sir . ( Your belt . ) Do you have something special in mind ? Actually I thought of driving you into that billboard . - What ? - Don 't worry . I 've set it up to be very bit safe as you set up for Dave Dugger . I even spill Ray 's homemade napalm all over the radiator . Just like you did to Dave . I am out of here . Oh , there is no point of struggling . You know how strong ... glu is . You created the commercial for it . Are you insane ? People thought I was when I set myself on fire . But I did remember to put on the suit and cover myself with Zel-jell . So I should be just fine . I am sure Dave Dugger would take the same precautions . But how was he supposed to know that you re-did another explosion for inside of his car ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Well , maybe a little 3rd degree burn will help your memory . Jarod . Oh , come on , Brynne . You will be a shot to die for , remember ? Jarod , please ! Why would you put napalm on the radiator ? The bigger the explosion the better the commercial ? You tell me something . What demographic says that the beer sales are more important than that man 's life . The commercial had been ... lost in account . What about what Mickey Clausen lost ? What about Dave Dugger ? They lost everything . The only thing you could have lost was just a job . Just a job ? I work my ... to get what I am . It is a boys ' club . Through glass ceilings I am not about to lose it all because a funky special effects guy was too soft to do the job we paid him for . You know something , Brynne ? I don 't think your ... agency is going to be giving your ... officer after all this . Look on the bright side , maybe you have a career ahead of you . In stunt work . Jarod , Jarod . Jarod . No , Jarod . - Did the camera record all that , Mickey ? - We got we want . That 's rep . I found Timmy . In Raines archives . Run them . Mrs Parker , what are you doing here ? I came by to visit Timmy . I don 't think that 's a good idea . Well , Dr Raines , my husband thinks it 's important my visit with hold the children . Wait here . Hi . Timmy , my name is Catherine . How are you doing ? I miss my mum and dad .. I know you do , honey . Come on , Timmy ! That 's it ? Well , there is another one dated on the following day . No , no . Timmy . You ... to come in here . ! My god . What have you done to that little boy ? It was an experiment ! My husband was ... for this ! You don 't know your husband as well as you think you do . I advise you remain quiet about this . You know what 's best for you . Timmy ! Raines , what you can do with Timmy now ? There is no Timmy any more . From now on , he is being called ¡ ­ Angelo . Is Timmy Angelo ? What , what Raines do to him ? Somehow his emotions , his ability to relate to the physical world , were driven invert . And gave Angelo his unique gift . But took away his life . Were you involved in this ? If I had known about this , I would have done everything in my power to stop it . And then you were dead . Just like my mother . So you actually sold your effects stuff ? Yeah , I know , I know . I don 't suppose you will be willing to sell it back . For the right price . Then charge him double . It 's ... think he did this to me . Thanks a lot , Jarod . Hi , Mickey . Mickey . Timmy is gone . White choose the ... variation , to answer the blacks , ... in defence . Very good , Jarod . Who are you , Mr. Igor ? Sydney , when do I get to meet that boy ? He is gone . What do you mean " gone " ? I received a copy of paperwork today . Dr. Raines released him . Did he do something wrong ? He wasn 't special . You were special , Timmy . What ? How are you coming with my .. feeling ? You need to ask ? Why the game , with the creature , why not just tell me ? Sometimes the destination isn 't as important as the journey . Well , where on your journey , did you find that ... ? In one of your mother 's safe deposit boxes . Like her wedding ring and medical file . Oh , you will be surprised what one could find in there . Jarod . You know the dance , Miss Parker . You help me with one of my secrets , I help you with one of yours . We weren 't able to find anything about Igor or Fenigor . I don 't know if he was my mother 's ... or betrayer . Keep searching . Igor , he holds the secrets to both our pasts . What makes you so sure ? Call it , you got feeling .

 Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi ( woman ) Evan ! Evan ! Where are you ? Evan ! Evan ! - Evan ! Evan , hurry , please ! - Nothing 's coming out ! ( radio ) Our lead story : Tropical Storm LeRoy has been upgraded to Hurricane LeRoy . The entire Gulf Coast ... Goddammitm Mom , is Dad gonna be all right ? Mom ! What about Dad ? IVIom , what about Dad ? ! We need water , Evan . Right now ! - IVlom ! - Just do as I say , Evan ! Come help me . Help me pull the washer out . Please , Evan , just help me . - Mom , Lenny 's back here ! - Evan , let the cat alone ! OK , now unplug the machine . Unplug the machine . Pull that hose out of the wall . I 'm gonna pull . I need you to get behind the machine and push . I want you to push . We 're gonna tip the washing machine over . We need to dump the water out . All right , honey , push ! Push ! Push , Evan ! Push , Evan ! Are you pushing ? Evan ! Evan , answer me ! Evan ? IVlom ! Evan ! Let him go ! Let go of him ! Let go of him ! Let him go ! Let him go ! ( screams ) ( phone rings ) ( answering machine ) Hi , this is Fox IVlulder . Leave a message after the beep . Agent Mulder , this is Arthur Dales calling from Florida . I don 't know if you 're watching the news , but we 're in for a hell of a blow in the next 24 . I 've been through hurricanes - been through the alphabet - but I got a distress call from my neighbour down the road that set my teeth on edge . You don 't have much time to get to the airport , but if you 're the X-Files man you say you are , you better get your butt in gear . ( hangs up ) ( radio ) Collier County emergency response team advises residents to stay off the roads and either wait out the storm in a secure location or at the emergency shelter . Hurricane LeRoy remains some 20 miles off the Gulf Coast , sending high winds and up to six inches of rain onto coastal communities . It has not yet unleashed its potential heavy destruction on a very nervous populace from Naples to Fort Myers . Hurricane LeRoy is predicted to make landfall in the next three to four hours . We 'll be coming back to you in a few minutes ... ( Walkie-talkie ) No sign of anything amiss at the residence on the spit . Place is all boarded up tight . Over . Roger that . Maybe the occupants have evacuated . Over . That 's the Shipleys . But a neighbour called and says they couldn 't have gone far without their only vehicle , which is still in the carport out here . Over . - That sounds like a real mystery , don 't it ? - It sure does , you dumb fathead . ( car door shuts ) It couldn 't be that all the planes out were fully loaded , huh ? There 's a reason people don 't head out into hurricanes . The hurricanes 20 miles offshore . - Mr Dales , can we come in ? - Come in ! - Who 's this ? - Special Agent Dana Scully . - Scully ? - She 's my partner . Don 't get too comfortable . You 're gonna want to get right back out there . Out where ? Did you tell her what I told you ? Yes . But she 's not the type that 's easily persuaded . Is that so ? He means I don 't hear a story about a sea monster and automatically assume it 's the Lord 's gospel truth . Why did you bring her here ? She knows your reputation , your early work on the X-Files , and she has a knack for getting to the bottom of things . Apparently , so does Mr Dales . It 's a good thing I have a reputation . Otherwise , how could it be impugned ? Look , I 'm sure that there is good reason for your alarm . I listened to the message you left about your friends . Shipleys . A young couple with their son . Live on the end of the sand spit . Sara called me in a panic . She said that some thing in the house had grabbed Jack , her husband . - In the bathroom , you said ? - Yeah , of all places . It was your description that caused Agent Scully 's .. _ dubiousness . No , not my description . No , that was Sara 's . She said ... That it had tentacles wrapped around her husband 's neck and choking him . And you have no reason to doubt Ms Shipley 's report ? No . Both she and Jack are marine biologists . Well , at least they were . I fear the worst . She 's missing , too ? Uh-huh . Yeah . I spoke to the local Constabulary , but they 're about as helpful as a fart in a windstorm _ I would 've gone out there myself but for my bad hip . It 's not a night that anybody should be out in . Well , I don 't see that there 's a choice ... _ .if anyone wants to get to the bottom of all this . What is it that brought you out here in the first place , Mr Dales ? I came down for the weather . Don 't sneer at the mysteries of the deep , young lady . The bottom of the ocean is as deep and dark as the imagination . ( heavy pounding ) Hello ? Mrs Shipley ? Least it looks like they had the time and presence of mind to prepare for the hurricane . The place is boarded up from the inside . It makes you wonder how they got out . Hello ? Mrs Shipley ? Mulder ? There 's no sign of life . There 's something on the drainpipe . I can 't get it off . I don 't know if I 'm gonna need my gun or a harpoon here . ( squeals ) How the hell did a cat get in the washing machine ? Maybe he was taking a dip after he finished boarding up the windows . - Where do you think this leads to ? - To the bathroom . Dales told me the wife told him that the husband was grabbed from the bathroom . - Mr Shipley ? - Gimme a hand , will ya ? ( man ) Well , howdy do ! Yeah , right like that . Keep your hands up there where I can see ' em . Now , who are you and what the hell are you doin ' ? ( Mulder mumbles ) Yeah , nice and slow . You can put the gun down . We 're FBI . Don 't all the nuts roll down to Florida ? We 're Agents Scully and Mulder . I 'll show you ... This is Deputy Greer . I 'm out at the Sandspit Road . I 've got two suspects at the Shipley residence . B and E , possible foul play . Over . We 're out here like you . We 're ... - ( dispatcher ) No backup units available . - Roger that . - You 're under arrest . - We 're looking for the Shipleys . - You have the right to remain silent . - Dales called us . Anything you say can and will be used against you . You have the right to a lawyer . That name mean anything to you ? Arthur Dales ? - I know Dales . - All right . I got a call from him too . Drunk . What 's new ? What else would we be doing out here on a night like this ? You could be Iooters _ For all I know , you could be part of the Manson family . ( meows ) - I know you 're gonna kill me . - No , but I 'd like to . Deputy ? The FBI ? For real ? I 'll be in the car . I gotta at least make out a report . No , not before you help me finish what you interrupted . Yes , sir . May I have my gun , please ? Thank you . Come on . Yeah . No ... Thank you . No one in the bathroom . The deputy helped me pull off the plywood . No sign of anything , except more slime in the bathtub and 3 " of water on the floor . It 's like somebody left the taps running before they boarded up the door . Great . Tney 're threatening to close the airport . I think we 'd better get out of here . - Aren 't you curious what happened to them ? - Yes , I 'm curious , but I 'm also suspicious . I think that Mr Dales 's story is fuelled by more than his imagination and no deeper than the bottom of a highball . Don 't dismiss him so easily . He discovered the X-Files 40 years ago . He 's seen things I 've only read about . Because sea monsters can only be read about . Because they don 't exist . If the sea is where life began , where our ancestors first walked ashore , then who 's to say what new life may be developing in its uncharted depths ? You know what ? Maybe you are a member of the Manson family . Look , there is nothing more for us to do here . There 's nothing a local law enforcement can 't do for us . People are missing . There 's nowhere else to look . I 've done my duty for Mr Dales , for my conscience . I mean , haven 't you ? Well , we should at least tell him that we 're giving up . Shouldn 't we ? Sea monsters , FBI agents ... I 'm the one who could use a drink . ( grunts ) Howdy do , folks . You 'll have to turn around , find someplace dry to spend the night . - What 's the problem ? - The road 's washed out up ahead . This is an emergency . I understand , but unless your oar has wings , you can 't get through on this road . What about the airport ? Is there another route ? Airport ? Not tonight . This hurricane 's really bearing down on us . We got trees , power lines down all over the place . You folks shouldn 't be out here . Drive to the first safe place you can find . Sir , it 's important that we evacuate the area . We 're FBI agents , and we need to get to where We 're going . Don 't all the nuts roll downhill to Florida . - I 'd be happy to show you my ID . - Thank you . Appreciate the concern . - Mulder . - That was just one " howdy do " over the line . ( dispatcher ) Car 54 , please report back to base . Yeah , this is Car 54 . I 'm over at Nance Road . Over . We 're askin ' all mobile units to stay off the roads due to extreme weather conditions forecast for the next four hours , including a flash-flood warning now in effect for Collier County . Over . 10-4 . Gonna make a quick stop-in at the Breakers condo complex . Looks like some folks are stranded without power . Over . Deputy Greer , County Sheriff ! If you 're home , please answer the door . ( knocks on door ) If you can hear me , but you can 't answer the door , call 911 , tell ' em you need help ! Hello ! Deputy Greer , County Sheriff ! If you 're home , answer the door ! If you can hear me but can 't answer the door , call 911 ! Tell ' em you need help ! Hello ? Hello ? Somebody here ? Sir ? Ma 'am ? ( screams ) ( yells and grunts ) Hello ? The good thing about zero visibility , Scully : it can 't get any worse . Is this the Collier County Sheriff ? Yes . No , hi . We 're driving on , uh ... Nance Road . N-a-n-c-e Road . Nance Road . No , it isn 't very smart , is it ? No ... Yes , that would be much appreciated . He 's gonna guide us to the nearest emergency shelter . Not a moment too soon . Hello ? Hello ... No service . You know , Scully , some day ... We 're gonna look back on this and laugh . And we 'll just think of it as man pitted against the forces of nature . Think of it as a test of our mettle . I don 't need my mettle tested . ( rattling overhead ) - What was that ? - I think that was a tree branch . - Debris is starting to fly . - We have to pull over and wait out the storm away from the trees . We can 't dodge trees in a parked car . At least this way we 're a moving target . We don 't know where we are and we don 't know where we 're going . There 's somebody . I think he 's about to give us directions . Who says there 's never a cop when you need one ? - Mulder , isn 't that _ .. ? - Forrest Gump . Deputy ? Hello ? Anybody ... ? Mulder , he 's here . ( shallow breathing ) Can you talk to me ? Having trouble breathing ? This man needs a trach or he 's gonna die real soon . I 've heard of passing the time , but ... ouch . All right , I need you to hold his head real steady . Deputy , just try and relax . OK . Here we go . ( Splatter ) Looks like he was attacked or stung . What are those ? I don 't know , but he 's having a reaction which is affecting his autonomic response . Whatever it was , I think it came through the plumbing , through the toilet . We need a medevac unit as soon as possible . If it 's in the plumbing , I gotta make sure nobody else is in here . This is Special Agent Dana Scully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation . I need a medevac unit out here ASAP . I have an officer in need of emergency medical assistance . - ( dispatcher ) State your name again , ma 'am . - Dana Scully . I 'm a doctor ... Scully ! Oh , God ... _ .for a sheriff 's deputy who is injured . You have a deputy down ? I have a deputy who 's been attacked by something as yet unidentified . - Unidentified ? My ass ! - What is his condition , ma 'am ? His vitals are weak and he 's in shock . I need him taken to a hospital right away . ( knocks on door ) Excuse me , sir . Is everything OK in your apartment ? Uh , yeah , yeah . It 's all good . You need some help ... With your television ? I thought I heard voices . Thank God . We thought nobody was coming . - Are you the doctors ? - No . You need medical help ? Yeah . We called 911 , but no one came , and everyone else is already evacuated . We don 't have a car . Then the phone died . - Who 's " we " ? Who are you talking about ? - My wife and I. She 's pregnant , a week past her due date . - I hope one of you has a car . - You don 't know this man , Mister ... ? Uh , Suarez . Walter Suarez . Uh , no . He 's not with you ? - I 'll put it back . - Yeah . Everything in your pockets too . She 's right over here . Right this way . - Angela ? This is IVlister , um ... - Mulder . Stay there , Mrs Suarez . We 'll make sure your baby makes it safely . Well , thank you , but I 'm not in labour . And my name is not Suarez . It 's Villareal . He tells people I 'm his wife . Like he 's so macho . Walter , Angela , you 'll have to leave your apartment and come downstairs with me . Why ? You got a car ? Oh . Walter here doesn 't have a car - not to mention a job . Right now I just wanna get you someplace safe . From what ? I don 't know , but it may have injured a sheriff 's deputy . - Who ? Where ? - In the manager 's apartment . - It could be in the complex 's plumbing . - In the plumbing ? That 's great . I have to go to the bathroom about every ten seconds . Kid 's gonna be a fighter . - Anybody else in the complex ? - No one . - Oh , there 's George . - George ? Yeah . George Vincent . He lives on the first floor . I asked him for help , but he just yells " Go away ! " - He never listens to no one . - He 'll wanna listen to me . ( Angela ) Walter ! - Better go . - it 's for you . Mr Vincent ! George Vincent ! Quit banging on the damn door ! I 'm a federal agent . I 'm asking you to open the door . You ask away . Then go away ! IVIrVincent , your life may be in danger if you refuse to leave your apartment . You may be in danger if you refuse to quit harassing me . I 'm armed and I 'm within my rights . Great , but you may not be armed for what it is I 'm talking about . What the hell are you talking about ? Hm ? It don 't matter . I 'm armed against it . The junta , Cuba and Castro . I 'm not gonna cede my home to no revolutionaries without a fight . You got anything else you wanna throw at me ? Bring it on . All the nuts roll down to Florida . He 's had some foreign organism released into his body . - His condition 's worsening . - I can see that . - What the hell was chewing on his neck ? - I don 't know . It may have been a waterborne parasite . You see what happens when you live in a dump ? Where 's Harry ? - I don 't know who Harry is . - The slumlord who owns this place . - He may have evacuated . - Harry ? Right . And I 'm giving birth to the Christ child . Harry 's legs hardly work . He uses those crutches . He don 't have no car . Nobody likes him cos he never lifts a finger on this rat-trap . - Scully , can I talk to you for a second ? - Yeah . - Now , who are you ? - Nobody . Nobody ? Well , it is so nice to be surrounded by so many great men . - We gotta leave as soon as possible . - We can 't . Put the deputy in his car and take him to the hospital . They won 't even chance sending a rescue vehicle at this time . The roads are impassable , and I don 't know if the deputy is moveable . - You mean we 're stuck here ? - At least until the weather breaks . Federal agents . Fascists ! Bent on trampling the rights of the common man ! No need for them , no ! ( muttering ) Violence in pursuit of freedom is no vice . ( continues muttering ) I don 't think these wounds are bites or stings . There 's something in here under the skin . Tongs . Mulder , what 's his temperature ? Either he 's got no temperature , or he 's about to spontaneously combust You 're not far off. it 's 106 . OK , someone fill the tub with cold water and find as much ice as they can in the freezer . But that thing is in the plumbing . It may be , but unless we get his temperature down , he won 't survive this . Now get moving . I need a container . Mulder , lift him up . We have to get him into the tub . - ( gunshob - ( man yells ) ( gunshots ) Mr Vincent ? ( yelling ) Drop your weapon ! Put it down ! It 's gonna take a whole lot more than this to kill whatever it is I just saw . I don 't know what it was , but it came out of there . You didn 't see it ? I caught it out of the corner of my eye , but it swooped down at me . I ... - All that happened is a sewage pipe burst . - No , this thing came at me . That 's the 4 " tie-in to the second floor . Whatever it is , it didn 't just rip through the ceiling . - It ripped right through the pipe . - Where did it go ? It must still be in the building . Probably in the outflow system . Maybe it 'll just flow back out . Or come up through the can and grab you by the nugs _ Someone 's already got him by the nugs _ Look , whatever this thing is , there 's no evidence yet that it 's gonna kill anybody . What about the man in the tub ? The man in the tub may very well be saved if he can last out this storm . In fact , we may all be safe if we just remain calm . Remain calm ? I gotta pee so bad , my back teeth are swimming . ( whispers ) Victory ! - How is he ? - He 's good . - Supertanker coming through . - Angela , you can 't go in there . My bladder is pressing against your unborn child , Walter . - He 'll have a head like a tortilla . - This thing is in the plumbing ! The volume alone could push it right back out to sea . Scully , that 's how this thing is here . The hurricane is sitting offshore , dredging up God knows what . This thing must 've been driven into the reclamation system through an outfall pipe . Then it gained access to the sewer pipes in this building . - We 'll be waiting for you out here . - Thank you . ( Scully ) IVlulder ... I know you probably can 't hear me , but no listening anyway , OK ? Scully , something welled up out of the uncharted depths of the ocean . Something that had been there , undiscovered , for ages . Mulder , there is no evidence of any creature here . Those organisms might simply be waterborne parasites . But something from Jules Verne they are not . ( screaming ) I saw it ! it 's in the tub with the deputy ! It has giant arms like an octopus . Mulder ... What the hell is it ? He 's gone . - it 's gone ? - No . He 's gone . The deputy . Where 'd he go ? I think the deputy went out with the bathwater . You mean he was in there with it ? - No , I don 't think he was . - She said she saw it . I 'm sure she did . Scully , I think I know why nobody 's ever seen this thing before . It just doesn 't live in water , it is water , taking shape only when it attacks , like it did when the hurricane backed sea water into the plumbing . Virtually unseeable until then . If that were true , this wouldn 't be visible , would it ? What this is showing us is that water actually attempts to kill it . Maybe you just impeded its reproductive process . Maybe it needs time , like it had with the Shipleys . The Shipleys weren 't in their house . No , they were when they were attacked , just like the deputy was here . Using their bodies to lay its own spawn , using the body 's water content to reproduce itself , to make itself anew . - He turned into one of those things ? - There are more ? - We gotta get out of here . - We 're in a hurricane . - We gotta get to another building . - There 's no way to transport everybody . We can use the deputy 's prowler _ How many people ? Two , four ... Son of a bitch . The looter ? - ( Scully ) Mulder ? - Yeah ? If we 're gonna leave , we should leave now . ( Scully ) Mulder ? Hey , Mulder , are you OK ? Hey , wait a second . What are you doing ? - I am saving our lives . - That 's my partner out there ! - Then he should 've listened to you . - You can 't leave him ! - I 'm not letting him in . - He 'll die ! - What can you do for him ? - At least keep him breathing . You couldn 't save the deputy . At least let me try ! I 'm a medical doctor . That 's good , because my waterjust broke . - You 're going to be OK . - Yeah , that 's easy for you to say . It isn 't much of a choice really , is it ? We 're gonna need water . If I 'm gonna deliver this baby , you can put that gun down . - How do we know you 're really a doctor ? - You don 't _ The truth is I 've never delivered a baby before . So stand back or make yourself useful , but stay out of my way . ( screams ) - Long , even breaths ! - You got it . Breathe , breathe ... OK , Angela , I 'm gonna need you to push . I need you to help me help you . OK , so let 's push . ( Angela screaming and panting ) You got it , you got it . You 're on the right track . I 'm gonna need some towels , please . I need some towels , dammit . You 're doing good , you 're doing good . OK . You 're doing good . OK , let 's go . - OK , push . - ( yells ) ( cat meowing ) ( Angela panting ) I can feel it up there ! - She can feel it up there ! - Yeah , OK . Come on . Push ! Good . You got it . OK ... - Here it comes . - Here it comes ! Here it comes . It 's coming ! OK . Hey , lady , what are you doing ? - it 's the water . - What ? - it 's the water ! - I 'm having it ! - I 'm having it , I 'm having it ! - OK , OK ! I 'm having it ! - Push ! - I 'm having it ! ( screaming ) Hurry ! Push ! Push ! OK ! ( screaming ) - OK , now pick up the gun ! - Help ! Pick up the gun ! Shoot out the sprinklers ! Just point and shoot ! Shoot out the sprinkler ! ( Scully ) My name is Dana Scully . Yeah . Thank you . Yes . Oh , God . ( chuckling ) That 's terrible . It 's official - 10 pounds , 10 ounces of piss and vinegar . EI niio grande . LeRoy Walter Villareal Suarez , Junior . - Oh , no . - Oh , yes . Oh , it 's amazing. it 's truly amazing . What 's that ? That you could come here in the face of a hurricane , chasing a sea monster yet , and end up bringing a new life into the world . And then slaying the monster , and save this one 's life as he was quite literally circling down the drain . - She didn 't save my life really . - Yes , she did . - With a gun to her head , no less . - ( Mulder ) Well ... You wouldn 't have known to go in the rain if I hadn 't pointed it out , and it was the fresh water that killed the organism . No , no , I saw the Shipleys ' cat . Well , I can 't swallow that . No , I saw the cat , which had been saved , which had been in the washing machine . The Shipleys had boarded up their house , so the only way they could have vanished was if the creature came up through the plumbing in a backwash of sea water . And then the deputy , who vanished from a bathtub full of Epsom salts ... If Agent Scully had not been there with you , I shudder to think what would 've happened to you . I 'd say you owe her your life . It takes a big man to admit this , but ... If I had had someone as savvy as her by my side all those years ago in the X-Files , I might not have retired . I suggest that we have a toast to your good fortune , and I insist that we have it . SO ... What 'll it be ? ( mumbles ) Oh , uh ... - Anyone for water ? - ( both ) No !

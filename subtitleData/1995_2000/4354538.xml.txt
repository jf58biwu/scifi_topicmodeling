 [ Thunderclap ] Strange how Jarod left nothing in Hawaii ... as if he wanted us out of the way . Broots , find out why we haven 't landed . - Please , don 't make me get up . - Since when do you hate to fly ? I don 't hate to fly . I hate to barf . It 's important . Jarod 's trail 's cold . What could you possibly be late for ? Unless your appointment is not business but pleasure . Are you this chatty on commercial flights ? I 'm a shrink . What do you want ? So , what 's his name ? You did call him from Jarod 's cabana , didn 't you ? There was a certain glow about you . I don 't glow , Sydney . His name is Thomas , and he 's doing some work on my house . - He 's a fix-it man , Syd . - What exactly is broken ? [ Cabin Door Opens , Closes ] The pilot says we 're gonna circle for an hour , maybe two . Thank you , Jarod . And you just know he 's down there basking in the sun and surf . - [ Groans ] - Wake up , wiseass . I wouldn 't want you to sleep through this . You 're going in for a dip . [ Screaming ] No ! [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Jarod Narrating ] Ever since I was a boy ... people have been telling me that I 'm special , that I have a gift - that I could be anything I want to be . I never guessed I would end up here - in the Atlantic Ocean as a human anchor . But maybe I should start at the beginning . [ Man On Microphone ] Oh , you 're a lawyer , eh ? - [ People Shouting , Laughing ] - [ Continues , Indistinct ] I says , " All lawyers are slime . " Guy next to me screams , " You take that back ! " I said , " Why , are you a lawyer ? " He says , " No , I 'm a slime . " [ Narrating ] The Comedy Slot - where thejokes are as cheesy as the patrons . Well , no one was laughing , especially me . I 'd been tracking these classified ads for weeks ... but I didn 't know who was placing them . It was too obvious for a Centre trick , but I had to be careful . That 's why I left no leads in Hawaii . That 's also why I should have turned and run when I spotted the source of the ads . Argyle . He saved my life once , then tried to sell me to the Centre . [ Comedian Continues , Indistinct ] [ Spits ] Hey ! You call this a martini ? - You call this a martini ? I wouldn 't feed this to my dog . - [ Dog Yips ] And I said no olives , miss . He 's pimiento intolerant . But even ifhe wasn 't , I wouldn 't let this touch his little doggy lips . Know what I 'm sayin ' ? There 's a good boy . - She 's a bad girl . She 's a bad girl . - [ Barking ] - [ Clears Throat ] - J-rod ! What 's tricks , man ? How you doin ' ? I knew you 'd get my message . - Half the eastern seaboard got your message . - Well , it worked , right ? - [ Growling ] - Whoa . Dog , you rememberJarod . You 're in like Flynn , see ? Look at us three . Reunited , and we 're feelin ' good . Hey , you still carryin' all them crazy I.D. ' s ? - Whose skin you wearin ' this week ? - A sucker 's . - Now , what do you want ? - What do I want ? What do I want ? I want another couple of martinis . Hold the olives . Okay . What I want ? What I want is for everybody to get along . - I want everybody to be happy . - Starting with yourself . Of course , but how much happier can this snazzy boy be ? Check me out . I 'm a fat cat down here . Me llaman El Gato Gordo , dude . - Who did you have to sell to get it ? - That 's low . That is very low . Check this out . Voom ! I forgive you . - How did you break your finger ? - Um , that ? Job hazard . That would require a job . Now , what do you want ? Okay . Here 's the story , all right ? There 's this guy , Faddis , down here . Mr. Sonny Faddis . He 's the entrepreneurial type . He 's actually a friend of mine . Friends break bread , not fingers . I know what you 're saying about the finger , but you 're wrong . He 's got people who do that for him , okay ? He provided me , recently , with a little financial sustenance . - How much do you owe him ? - $ 5,000 . What ? You went through all of this trouble to get me down here for $ 5,000 ? Listen to me , Jarod . This Mr. Sonny Faddis is bad news , okay ? He made me choose which finger his goons would break . I told him this one , ' cause you gotta have a free picker , you know ? Thing is , Jarod , if I don 't pay this guy back ... Argyle is ancient history , man - phfft ! Besides , what 's five large between friends ? You tried to sell me for 10 . I know . I know what I did . I know what I know . I know what I did was wrong . I also happen to know that you , my friend ... and I are kindred spirits . Don 't give me that look . We both know what it 's like to be alone in this world . And we also both know what it 's like to have nobody to turn to . You 're all I got , Jarod . [ Narrating ] I was suddenly face-to-face with my toughest pretend - becoming Argyle 's friend . [ Whimpering ] You da man , Jarod . - I didn 't need forged papers or a fake I.D. - You da man , Jarod . Set us up with another couple of drinks . - Just a lot of patience ... and no common sense . - [ Groans ] [ Sydney ] You seem anxious . Thomas must be doing important fix-it work . I met him a few weeks ago . We spent a couple of hours together one night . Just talking . - He used to work on Wall Street , but he checked out . - Hmm . [ Sighs ] He 's renovating this absolutely ancient house near mine . He calls it a work in progress . I got to thinking I needed some work done on my house , so - [ Sighing ] Well , I wish I could tell you ... having him over was just about the water damage ... but ... it was more . [ Exhales ] Well , it 's definitely water damage . Yeah . [ Chuckles ] - This place is sweet though . It 's got a lot of character . - Lot of years . Yeah , but structure 's great and masonry out front . - Mm-hmm . - Own or rent ? It was a gift - given to me by my father when I graduated college . It was , uh , sort of a hideaway for my parents . [ Door Closes ] That 's gotta be Mom . - I look just like her . I know . - [ Chuckles ] - She passed away when I was a little girl . - Oh . Must have been tough . Yeah . Hey , you know what would be perfect right here ? A lighter color . Then we 'll lose the stained glass and the bay windows ... and get some light reflection comin ' in - brighten up the whole house . Let 's ... cover it with drywall and a fresh coat of paint . - Same color . - Mm . - What ? - [ Laughing ] [ Clears Throat ] You 're a-You 're a doer . - A doer ? - Yeah . I , uh - I worked construction to pay for college . Big Leave It To Beaver houses . - We had two kinds of housewives . - [ Sighs ] Fiddlers - always changed their tune . Made you replace cabinets after they were already in . And the doers . Well , the doers , uh - They always made the call . Once . I always get what I want . [ Chuckling ] [ Jarod Narrating ] I 've heard that love makes the world go round . Or is it money ? It is in Argyle 's world . I 'd gotten his $ 5,000 courtesy of Centre funds . But before we went to pay off his loan shark , Mr. Faddis ... Argyle insisted on making a stop . But as is so Argyle , around every corner is another surprise . Although his Pretender skills needed honing , Argyle was right . In a way , we were kindred spirits . - There was just something about Argyle I - - [ Dog Barking ] [ Clicks Tongue ] Understood . Dog . I gotta make sure he diddles on the balcony . Make yourself at home . Oh , no ! For the love of Pete . I told you the balcony . [ Dog Barks ] - [ Crowd Cheering ] - [ Triumphal ] [ TVContinues ] Freeze , soldier ! I 've tangled with S.S. Twice your size . - Whoa , whoa , whoa . - If you think you can just waltz in here ... and swipe my prize possessions for a vial of mind-altering crap ... - you got another think comin ' . - Argyle ! - Make your peace , son . - Yo , yo , yo ! Yo , hold up . Take it easy . This is my friend . This man is my friend . Oh . Wait a minute . What the heck are you doin ' here ? What , I can 't come here ? All of a sudden , I can 't come here ? - My buildings are done . - Oh , yeah ? Well , your manners ain 't . Name 's Benny , retired field medic . 101 st Airborne - Screaming Eagles - W.W. II . My name is Jarod . Firm handshake - sign of character . In some cultures , it means you 're a skilled horseman . I was a rodeo clown once . Which would explain why you work with my son . Um , yo , Pop . That 's , uh - Jarod , like myself ... has broadened his horizons in the ever-expanding ... and creatively exciting world of computer-aided drafting . - Actually , I was just - - [ Bell Dings , Tune ] - No . Medicine time , Pop . - The sacred timepiece has spoken . - [ Ends ] Cherish your health , Jarod . It 's the only thing you got that 's truly yours ... besides earwax and nose hair . " Demoxidyle . " " Recrotin . " Do you have an enzyme imbalance ? Brain condition . Also gave me this limp . - It could be enzyme-related , but it doesn 't - - Could be . Been a pleasure , " Jerry . " Pope 's comin ' back on . Uh , isn 't he on tape ? You don 't pause the pontiff . You borrowed the $ 5,000 for him , didn 't you ? Well , V.F.W. Gives him insurance ... but it don 't cover what he really needs . We lost Ma about a year ago . He 's been goin 'downhill ever since . They saw the pope together back in ' 95 . Giants Stadium . That was right after Ma got sick . Doc said she had , like , a month to live . My old man swears the pope gave her those three extra years . He just wants to go to Vatican City , you know ? See the guy , hear the mass , maybe thank him . - I don 't know . - $ 5,000 covers a trip to Italy . Yeah . I know . [ Clears Throat ] - But , um - - But what ? Well , uh , there 's this guy who works for Faddis . He , uh - He handles my high-yield investments . So you borrowed $ 5,000 from a loan shark ... and then you lost it to a bookie . Jarod , I just want my dad 's trip to be top drawer , you know ? First pew all the way . Is that too much to ask ? [ Narrating ] Argyle 's heart was in the right place ... [ Narrating ] Argyle 's heart was in the right place ... but , as usual , his brain wasn 't . I insisted we go straight to pay off Faddis . [ Chortling ] I can 't wait to see Faddis 's face when I slide him the green . He insisted on going it alone . Be careful . A little quick homework told me that Argyle 's loan shark was a man-eater ... a short-tempered , violent killer - Sonny Faddis . Along with Sonny 's Clam Shack , he owned a big piece of the waterfront ... and supplied seafood to most of Atlantic City . [ Barking ] It didn 't take long to see that Argyle was in over his head . - And his back against the wall . - [ Bone Cracks ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Tires Squealing ] - Get in ! Get in ! - [ Dog Barks ] You mamalukes ! - Ow , ow , ow , ow ! - Who were they ? Those guys ? Faddis 's boys . - The Africans . - Africans ? - South Africans . - Look , Argyle ... they would never have broken another finger if you were paid up . Well ? Okay , okay . I owe ' em a favor . Once I 'm done with that , I 'm free and clear . [ Sighs ] Don 't say it . Don 't even think it . The guy 'll fly solo on this one , man . No worries , man . Thanks for everything you done . And that five grand - back in your bank account before you even know it . Just give me a little time . That 's all . A little time . You know , he may be man 's best friend ... but you , J-dog , you are my best friend . [ Whimpers ] [ Exhales ] Argyle , here . Two first-class tickets to Vatican City . Make sure your dad sees the pope . I can 't , man . It 's gotta be from me . You 've already done enough . Sayonara , man . Adios . Take care of yourself . - [ Engine Starts ] - [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Narrating ] Second thoughts can be dangerous . But it quickly dawned on me that leaving Argyle and Dog would be like - Well , it would be like leaving two wounded animals in a trap . Itjust wasn 't in me . You guys coming or what ? - You were praying for your father , weren 't you ? - Yeah . He gave it to me . It 's laminated . He and Mom got it when they saw him in ' 95 . I was prayin ' that , you know , he 'd get to see the popester before it was too late . Too late ? Well , yeah , Jarod . He 's-He 's dyin ' . Argyle 's situation put into focus for me ... something I think I 've known for a long time - that until I find my family ... helping people like Benny and Argyle ... is the next best thing . [ Jarod Narrating ] On my end , things were going ... pretty smoothly . But how was I to know that the middle part of this story would get so messy ? Faddis had a simplejob for Argyle - pick up a bag of skimmed casino money from a Dumpster . - But something about this was nagging me . - [ Dog Yips ] Why would Faddis trust Argyle to pick up his money ? After all , Argyle 's a guy who named his dog ... well , Dog . No worries . Just like Argyle said . For a second , I believed him . [ Groans ] - A split second . - Uh ! That hurt . Turns out the bag-and the money inside - didn 't belong to Faddis . It belonged to this guy who called himself the Cuban ... and called me something else . [ Irish Accent ] LittleJoe from Chicago . What makes you think you can come to my town ... kill two of my couriers and steal my money ? This cash belongs to the Cuban . - The Cuban ? - Cuban ? - You never heard of the Cuban ? - Not one that sounds like you . I 'm not a Cuban . I 'm the Cuban . Remember those second thoughts ? And this is my little friend . [ Barking , Growling ] [ Argyle ] Oh , yeah ! Yeah ! - Whoa . - [ Barking ] - [ Loud Grunt ] You 're a good boy . You 're a good boy . You 're a good boy . - Get outta here ! - Yeah . - [ Argyle ] Aw , shoot ! The money ! - Forget the money . - Argyle ! - Oh , geez ! - [ Gunshots ] - [ Grunts ] Drive ! Drive ! Drive ! [ Thunder Continues ] He 's still out . God bless Dramamine . Tell me , Parker . This Thomas - Does he know where you work ? [ Thomas ] This really hits the spot . Mmm . Thanks for the eats . It 's comin ' out of your paycheck . [ Laughing ] Shrimp . - I got you hooked , didn 't I ? - I 've always been partial to Mu Shu . You mean that 's all you ever order . Someone once told me stability breeds success . That 's because they never had sweet-and-pungent shrimp . Oh . Uh-oh . Last piece . - [ Clicks Tongue ] - [ Laughing ] Are you always this demanding at work ? I 'm a doer , remember ? Ah , that 's right . Corporate risk assessment . Sounds like a fancy name for insurance . Fancy name for stress . I , um , mm - I solve problems for my company . I was gonna tell you - [ Clears Throat ] I , uh - I , uh ... went up on the roof to check for the leak . You know , water damage . And , uh - Well , there may be another room back there . Let 's just cover it up like-like we talked about . Look , my company makes me carry that . [ Murmurs ] Hey , work is work . Anyway , I should be done by Saturday ... if you don 't slow me down with more food . It 's a part of me I wish he hadn 't seen . The gun is something you carry , Parker . It 's not who you are . - [ Jarod ] Are you all right ? - Oh , J-man , I 'm cold . - I 'm so cold . - What are you talking about ? This is just a flesh wound . The bullet barely nicked you . - [ Whimpers ] - Yeah ? I know what you 're gonna say , but how was I supposed to know ... that an Irish Cuban was gonna show up and spout wiggy . He called you LittleJoe . What 's that all about ? He was obviously expecting this LittleJoe . Yeah , but too bad for him we 're the ones bringing home the green . Goodyear blimp says Argyle 's a pimp . Oh , no , J-man . Oh , no , J-man . [ Narrating ] I could see it in Argyle 's eyes . Before today , I would 've called it greed . - Oh , no . - But this was fear . No money in the bag meant no trip to Italy ... and no dying wish for the one thing that really matters to Argyle - Pop . Step back , son . Thanks to me , no man in the 101 st ever lost a limb . Except Bernie Sankowitz - He lost his big toe , but that 's barely an appendage . Lamina-pope let me down . Hey , what 's this doin ' in here ? - That 's not my key . - That 's an awful lot of sedative . [ Barking ] Hey , Pop , how about we skip the needle ? - Take it like a man , soldier . - [ Gasps ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Whimpering ] [ Scream Echoing ] [ Narrating ] I wasn 't having any luck with the key ... but I did track down the Cuban - A.K.A. Denis O 'Quinn . Turns out he was the second-biggest loan shark in Atlantic City ... second only to the clam king , Sonny Faddis . But what was the Cuban doing at the Dumpster ? Stealing from Faddis ? No . That didn 't make any sense . None of this does . It felt like Faddis had set Argyle up . But for what ? The key had definitely been planted on him . - And probably by the Africans . - Orlani . Faddis 's minions must have planted it on Argyle when they broke his finger . Yeah . He 's out colder than spit on ice . - You were right - too much knockout juice . - He 'll be fine . Not if he keeps up like this . A son should never stop listening to his father . He should know to stay away from the wrong people . My Adella would have made sure of that . - She had a beautiful smile . - Oh , yeah , didn 't she ? And such a way with that kid . - He was an only chid . - Yep . After he was born , Dr. Canepa told Adella she had to close down the baby foundry . [ Chuckles ] My buttercup always found the silver lining . - She said Argyle broke the mold . - Many molds . If she was here , he wouldn 't be sneaking around with a bunch of criminals ... pretending to be an architect . You knew about that . That kid wouldn 't know a straightedge if it bit him on the tokus . [ Chuckles ] I know he 's not perfect , Jarod , but he 's got a kind soul . He 's got her soul . You underestimate fathers . I may have fought in the big one ... but she was the real hero . When I lost her ... it was like bein ' at the front ... and losin ' contact with H.Q. I just didn 't know what was what anymore . And I can 't reach him . God knows I 'd love to find a way . Orlani ? I couldn 't find a bank or a key maker with that name . I got a buddy in the V.F.W. He 's a locksmith . I 'll have him take a gander . - Where you goin ' ? - Trolling . For shark . [ Narrating ] Loan shark , that is . Something told me that I was caught in the middle of a turfwar . So I put on my best wiseguy duds ... and paid a visit to the clam king . [ Jarod ] Mr. Faddis , Call me the pope . The pope , huh ? Well , I don 't serve loaves and fishes here . - Andres , get me a fresh plate after I deal with this clown . - [ Man ] It needs more garlic . [ Woman Chattering ] So , uh , what can I do for you , Mr. Pope ? Why would you loan $ 5,000 ... - to a guy like Argyle ? - Oh , you know that little weasel ? If he 's such a weasel , why did you ask him to make a pickup for you ? - Who said I did ? - He did . Now you listen to me . I don 't care what you call yourself . I 'm gonna spell it out for you like you were five . Argyle still owes me a big favor . You 're gonna tell me where that little insect is ... or you 're gonna go for a long walk off a short pier . Cliché , I know . But I happen to own the pier . I 'll deliver you Argyle ... for a price . - Ten . - Come on . You got more clams than that . Twenty . - All right . - Al ! Where are my cigars ? - Sorry , Mr. Faddis . I just got back from Orlani . - Thank you . - Orlani . - I eat there every Friday . I keep a humidor in the back . You like that place ? What 's not to like ? - You oughta try the osso buco . It 's phenomenal . - I don 't care much for veal . It reminds me of my childhood . [ Narrating ] My meeting with Faddis answered one question . Orlani was a restaurant , another restaurant . I had a feeling that the key - no pun - to this mystery ... was locked inside a humidor there . All I had to do was get that key back from Benny ... but he had a plan ofhis own . Benny knew about Orlani all along . And to make matters worse , the Screaming Eagle ... decided to take matters into his own hands ... drop behind enemy lines and strike a blow for his son . I wish I could say that the war was about to end , but it was just beginning . War is hell , especially when a slippery lock pick is suddenly the enemy . [ Muffled Yell ] Welcome to my Waterloo . I 'm warning you ! I 've tangled with S.S. Twice your size ! [ Jarod Narrating ] Benny took matters into his own hands all right . - And the Africans were about to take a finger . - Oh , no . - Geez . - I wouldn 't do that . I was unarmed , but Sydney always taught me ... that my brain is my most powerful weapon . - [ Grunts ] - Benny , don 't ! Hey . Let 's get outta here . Old Rommel ain 't got nothin ' on you . [ Chuckles ] [ Miss Parker ] The flight from hell . The pilot says we 'll be circling for another half an hour . Think you 'll make it in time to see Thomas ? It probably doesn 't matter , not after the last time . - Thomas ? - In here . I was right . There is a room behind this wall . And ... look what I found . It was a studio or something . The skylights back there are great . As soon as I lose this wall , it 'll really brighten up in here . Leave-Leave it up . - Are you kidding me ? - Leave it up . I have to catch a flight to Hawaii in an hour . Just - Cover it . You knew about the room . I saw your mother 's name on some stationery . Catherine Parker . It was her studio . - You knew it was there all along . - Yes , I did . I 'm the one who put the wall up , so just leave it up . Parker , why didn 't you say something ? What am I supposed to say ? [ Exhales ] You want me to tell you that that was her favorite room ... and that 's where she would read to me and tell me stories and braid my hair ? Is that what I 'm supposed to do - just bare my soul to a stranger ? Oh . So , I 'm a stranger . I figured at least , uh , acquaintance . [ Hushed ] Well , you figured wrong . - That what the gun 's for , hmm ? - [ Exhales ] To keep strangers away ? I 'm guessing your life 's filled with them - starting with her . Put the wall back up while I 'm gone . Sure thing . I 'll be back Saturday ... to give you the check . [ Exhales ] [ Exhales ] I let him go . He stood there waiting ... for me to stop him ... and I let him go . Your fix-it man is right , Parker . Why is everyone a stranger ? Aw , nuts ! We 're up to our necks in it now , Pop . Look , Faddis , that fungus , has been in the rackets ... since before you two were born . Understand something , Benny . Faddis is a killer , and he won 't stop until he finds both of you . And who 's a fungus now , Pop ? You lied toJarod about the key . You want him to fight your battles for you ? Is that it ? - Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Nobody fights my battles for me . - Oh , yeah ? Yeah , and not everybody was so lucky they got to go to World War II . - I was serving my country - - Okay . Okay . Enough ! Look , your father only lied about the key ... because he was trying to get Faddis off your back . - You were ? - [ Murmurs ] Your son borrowed the money from Faddis ... so he could surprise you with a trip to the Vatican . You mean ... see the big guy ? Yeah , Pop . If you just stick with me and Jarod , you know ? We wanna get you there so you can see the guy , you know ? Be-Before you die and all . Isn 't there something you wanna tell Argyle ? [ Clicks Tongue , Murmurs ] - Benny . - Hmm ? You don 't have a brain condition , do you ? And this medication - [ Crunching ] Mmm . Sugar pills . You mean , y-you 're not dyin ' , Pop ? I 've got a great idea here . Why don 't we try a little fact ... instead of fiction , huh ? [ Narrating ] It was the first time both of them had shut up ... since I 'd gotten there , and I knew where the silence came from . There was a time when it would have been filled with another voice . She 's gone . She can 't be replaced . That 's not an option with mothers . But , you two , you don 't have to lose each other . Hmm . It was the kind of moment I left the Centre for . Of course , helping Argyle 's father meant nothing ... if Argyle didn 't live through the week . That 's where the cigar box came in . [ Whimpers ] Argyle thought he had everything figured out . Hey , hey . Yo , I got this thing nailed , J-man . See , I 'm thinkin this guy 's the Cuban , right ? So he 's gotta have family on the island ... under the yoke of the evil dictator Fidel Castro and whatnot . But , of course , Argyle was way off . Faddis had killed two of the Cuban 's couriers and stolen his money ... and he needed someone to blame it on-Argyle . The contents of the cigar box fingered Argyle as a criminal nicknamed - LittleJoe from Chicago . You see , the Cuban was supposed to find Argyle at the Dumpster and kill him . He 'd find the key , the cigar box and have his culprit . - And Faddis would get away with murder ... - [ Rattling On , Indistinct ] - and a lot of the Cuban 's money . ... first flight straight to Havana . And bam , bam , bam ! They are livin ' high off the hog ... like capitalist pigs in Atlantic City . Hmm ? Hmm ? Am I good ? You nailed it , Argyle . Just one question - Where were the Cuban 's couriers ? You 're gonna go for a long walk off a short pier . Cliché , I know , but I happen to own the pier . Faddis had covered the Cuban 's couriers in chains and tossed them . It was a cliché - the worst kind . I was planning a similar fate for Faddis . It kind ofbecame my M.O. Since I escaped the Centre - payback against the people who think they can step on the little guy . In this case , one of the littlest guys on the planet . What are you doing with my case ? Oh . No , this ain 't what it looks like . - This ain 't what it looks like . - What are you doin ' with this ? I wasn 't stealing 'anything . I was borrowing that ... to make this . Lamina-pope gave me the idea . This way , she 'll always be protected from the elements ... and always close . Nicest thing anybody ever did for me . My pretend started out pretending to be Argyle 's friend . I wasn 't pretending anymore . I told Argyle to meet me at the pier at 8.00 . But unfortunately , he was followed there by the Africans . Coast is clear , big guy . We 're good to go . But Faddis 's goon had other ideas . Make that goons , plural . - [ Grunts ] - Oh ! Aw , no ! Aw , no ! Aw ! No ! Aw ! No ! Unlike his brain , Argyle 's feet were working just fine . I 'm sorry , J-man ! As for the goons , well , I think you know what they had in mind for me . [ Sydney ] Good luck , Parker , and don 't worry . Things with Thomas will work out for the best . - Miss Parker - - Not now , Broots . I 'm in a hurry . Oh , for what it 's worth , I say go for it . You were listening . Well , I heard parts . Oh , what , is everybody a spy ? [ Chuckles ] Who do we work for ? I 'm just saying that if I felt that way about somebody ... I 'd tell ' em . It 's like this plane ride we just took . At any second , we could 've been a statistic . We shouldn 't ever pass up an opportunity . Thanks for the tip . [ Jarod Narrating ] Which brings us to the end . And with any luck , not my own . Wake up , wiseass . I wouldn 't want you to sleep through this . You 're going in for a dip . [ Screaming ] No ! Faddis had sunk another victim ... but that 's exactly how I 'd planned it from the Africans following Argyle ... - [ Beeping ] To the camera we had set up to capture the whole thing . Losing the lock pick , however , wasn 't part of the plan . Thank goodness for my four-legged backup . Wait up . Wait up . Wait for me . Where 'd you go ? Give me that . - What are you lookin ' at ? - [ Whimpers ] Faddis had invited the Cuban to celebrate my long walk off a short pier . They were heading to Orlani for some osso buco . But like I said , I don 't go for veal . Everybody freeze . Nobody makes a move . The Cuban wasn 't too happy when I told him what Faddis had done . Neither were the police . I told them where they could find Faddis , the Cuban 's dead couriers ... and our videotape . Nobody messes with the ' Gyle and his sidekick , J-rod ! - [ Dog Barks ] - Didn 't anybody ever tell you crime don 't pay ? We 're a pretty good team , you and me . - Thomas ? - [ Keys Clatter ] You always this punctual ? The storm . [ Sighs ] We had to circle and - I know you didn 't ask for a door . If you want , I can put the wall back up . So , what 's the damage ? Same price . Nothing extra . It 's locked now , but if you want to open it ... you got the option . Tommy . I shouldn 't have lied . It 's just - I was ... very young when my mother died . And after it happened , I just - My - l - I just couldn 't bring myself to go into that room . [ Sighs ] Mom and I used to - used to ... talk all night in there . And moonlight made it so special . She had a very ... painful life ... and that room was her sanctuary . No , Parker . You were . But you can 't remember that . When you closed off that room , you closed off a part of your soul - the part that came from her . Get it back . I can 't do it alone . Come on . It 'll be okay . [ Key Turns In Lock ] [ Woman Vocalizing , Ethereal ] [ Chattering ] Your Holiness , this is truly a great honor . I only wish my Adella was here . But I guess she 's watching from up above . Huh ?

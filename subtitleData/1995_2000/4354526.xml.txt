 Now what the hell is this ? Looks like one of them medical beds - you know , for havin ' babies . With shackles ? [ Miss Parker 's Voice ] Mr. Fenigor , tell me who killed my mother . The answer is in the red files . - Red files ? - Prodigy red files . [ Jarod ] What secrets are in this envelope ? This is where you came from . Prodigy . This is where you came from . [ Echoing ] Came from . Came from . As much as I 'd like to make a sale , I have to admit it is kinda spooky . Tell me about the fire . A family lived here at the time - a mother , a father and a young son . The whole story was a tragedy . [ Imitating Airplane Noises ] Rumor has it that the boy was stolen ... and the parents disappeared the night the house burned . - Do you know where they went ? - They were renters . Property changed hands right after the fire . It 's now owned by an outfit out of Blue Cove , Delaware . Look , I 'm late for work . I 'd be glad to give ' em a call if you 'd like to make an offer . No , thank you . I 'm late for work myself . [ Man ] Harvard Med , Johns Hopkins . From a medical standpoint , I 'd be foolish not to hire you as head of Inseminology . Business standpoint ? [ Laughs ] I think a doctor named Spock on staff could be worth a million bucks . Well , I 'm glad to be part of the NuGenesis family . Family is what this fertility clinic is all about . You might say it 's our job to make the future . Dr. Haring , do you have a moment ? [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours , and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Miss Parker ] Mr. Fenigor ? I can 't eat . I can 't sleep . Please tell me who killed my mother . What did you mean by Prodigy ? What answers are in the red files ? Please help me . Miss Parker , you 're not supposed to be here . - No one is . - Has he talked ? He hasn 't spoken since they brought him in . Opinion around here is that he never will . Well , we 've tried in vitro . GIFT , ZIFT . We 've literally gone around the world trying to get pregnant . But NuGenesis has shown us they 're the only fertility clinic that seems to care . Always will . NuGenesis prides itself on being on the cutting edge of reproductive technology . And I 'm proud to say thatJarod here is on the cutting edge of all of them . - Can you help us ? - Any couple with as much love as you two obviously have ... - deserve to have a child . - Thank you . Dr. DeWitt will be sharing duties as well . Anything you need , they 're here for you . [ DeWitt ] Apatient 's mental attitude is sometimes more important ... than his or her physical condition . If the mind has faith , the body will follow . And it 's up to us to make sure our patients keep their faith ... so our science can do its job . Jeremy , run these and get the results back to Dr. Spock , stat . Spock ? Funny . [ Chuckles ] For over 30 years , we 've helped couples like the Brewsters ... realize the fruits of parenthood . Thirty years . Long before you were born . I like this guy . My brother Boris would have liked him too . - [ DeWitt ] My father . - And as he always said , get busy . [ Chuckles ] Well , I 've gotta go . I 'll catch up with you later . Red files . This is where you came from . [ Clears Throat ] Uh , any word out of Fenigor ? He 's still unconscious . You look like you need to change your Pamper . [ Broots ] Uh , something weird is going on with Mr. Raines . [ Scoffs ] Everything going on with ... that half-burnt , wheezing ghoul is weird . [ Whispering ] No , he 's packing up his office ... to go . Well , find out where . And while you 're at it , find out what Prodigy means . Oh , well , that 's easy . A prodigy is someone extraordinary . A very talented child - I know what it means to Webster 's . I want to know what it means to the Centre . - Okay . - So you and Sydney find out everything you can ... about Prodigy and something called the red files . Okay , well , I 'll do what I can , but Sydney 's occupied . Doing what ? Stirring Soup Head 's gray matter ? I 'm putting him through an experimental neuro-stimulation therapy ... that hopefully will unscramble Angelo 's mind . Wow . [ Gasps ] Good luck pulling Jell-O Brains out of the deep freeze . Let 's go back to work , Angelo . What are you doing ? Uh , a new blood workup on the Brewsters . I want to cross-check it with our old records . I 'm afraid you 're not allowed in here . [ DeWitt ] Jeremy 's a pit bull for protocol . Hell , even I 'm not allowed back here . Uncle Nicholas 's policy . [ Jarod ] I 'm sorry . [ DeWitt ] Infertility is a sensitive , personal issue . One reason NuGenesis has been so successful is because of trust and confidentiality . We don 't even use patients ' names . Only code numbers . Jeremy will get you anything you need . Thank you . - Good night , Jarod . - Good night . Only four more treatments left , my friend . Hope it works . Thank you , Sydney . [ Woman ] It 's just gonna sting for a second . Hold it still . - Keep your finger still . - Ow ! Ouch ! Good morning , ladies . Gotta have a special pass to go up that way . - A pass ? - That 's Corridor 7 . - You 're not allowed . - Hmm . I 'm finding there 's many places I 'm not allowed around here . Oh , my God . [ Wheels Squeaking ] [ Raines ] Make sure all of these boxes are out of my office tonight . Right . I 'll meet you later . [ Wheels Squeaking ] Hello , Jarod . My name is Sydney . I 'll be taking care of you for a while . Why ? Where are my mom and dad ? [ Young Sydney ] Here 's a fresh bandage . Ouch ! Why ? Where are my mom and dad ? [ Echoing ] Mom and dad . Mom and dad . - Ow ! - Ouch ! [ Man 's Voice ] I 'd like you to solve a problem for me . If he starts singin ' " The Rain in Spain , " I 'm gonna pass out . Angelo 's mind is working again . We 're restoring the neuro-pathways ofhis memory . You know that serotonin isotope ? It seems to regenerate deadened pathways . However , ifhe doesn 't get the entire dosage ... he 'll regress permanently . I 'm impressed , Einstein ... but my gut tells me thatJarod had something to do with this . [ Sydney ] Jarod wanted to know what could be discovered ... if Angelo 's mind returned . The potential is unlimited . I believe he can even play the piano . [ Stumbling Through " Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star ' " ] [ Laughing ] Music . - What 's going on ? - Cousin Itt woke up and remembered he was Liberace . He must 've learned to play that as a child . Information his mind has been absorbing for a lifetime ... is starting to reemerge . This is the icing on a very freaky cake . What are you babbling about ? I found this in Raines 's office . He had 20 more in a file on his desk . A desk which , incidentally , I hid under for over an hour . Hiding was bad enough , but I had to watch while Raines did , you know , personal stuff . What could have been so awful ? He , uh - He changed his pants . Oh , thanks for that ! [ Sydney ] Why is Raines packing and moving ? And why does the freak have 20 photographs of the same schoolchildren ? Red files . He can 't be doing it again . Not again ! [ Sydney ] Angelo ? Easy , Angelo . He said red files . Then if he 's getting his memory back , he must know something about them . If that 's true , then somewhere in that demented mind he might know who killed my mother . Miss Parker . [ Electronic Voice ] You have mail . This is ... where you came from . Red files . - [ Woman ] Rumor has it that the boy was stolen . - Where are my mom and dad ? Oh , my God . They 're doing it again . They 're going to take another child . The Centre 's going to make another Pretender . Ouch ! Ouch ! Ouch ! I thought the Pretender program was discontinued years ago , Sydney ! Calm down , Jarod . Calm down . They stole me from my parents , and now they 're trying to steal another child , aren 't they ? I 'm not sure , but recent events make me feel you may be right , yes . And what are you going to do this time ? - Are you just going to sit by and let it happen again ? - Jarod , please ! I think Angelo may hold some answers . - Are the treatments working ? - Yes . He saw something that seemed to trigger a bad memory . - I know how he feels . - [ Line Disconnects ] [ Broots ] He 's over here ! Angelo . - What 's wrong with him , Syd ? - Angelo needs to receive his treatment at timed intervals . - Come now , friend . - [ Stammering ] Answers below . - What is Prodigy , Angelo ? - Answers below . He 's pointing to the floor below us , Sublevel 27 . - [ Broots ] " Inception . ' " - Another birthing table . It 's a delivery room . Oh , my God . They 're re-creating this place . What ? Oh , come on . Let 's get out of here . - Broots ? - Answers here . Find the security camera archives that belong to this room . Anything and everything . - Yes , ma 'am . - Answers . Syd , give Angelo his next treatment . Find out what else is in his head . He may be the treasure trove I 've been looking for . My name is Sydney . I 'll be taking care of you for a while . Why ? Where are my mom and dad ? If you 're lookin for information ... the way you 're goin ' about it , you 're gonna get caught . - If you want help , I 'll help you . - Why should I trust you ? Because your mother did . I 've polished floors in this place for over 30 years . I 've seen a lot of people come and go . Their hearts and their hands filled with love they wanted to share with a child . - Your parents were like that . - How did you know them ? They were here over six months tryin ' for a baby . Your mother treated me with respect . I saw her a year or so later . I 'll never forget the gleam she had in her eyes when she showed me her baby boy . Same gleam that 's in yours . That 's what hurts so much . Hurts ? I saw them a few years later . She was scared , on the run . Somebody had stolen her boy . My guess is that was you . I 've been searching for them . [ Sighs ] Part of your pain is because of me . See , I told Dr. Boris what she said . There was a lot of weird stuff goin ' on in Corridor 7 back then with kids . Testing and stuff . Dr. Boris paid me to forget about it . The weird stuff stopped , Dr. Boris died ... and everything went away . - Until what ? - A while back , it started up again . Kids . Testing . And then you showed up . Do you recognize any of these children ? It 's a local elementary school . One of these children is going to be taken ... just like I was . I may need your help to stop it . I owe you that much . And your mother . Thank you . [ Banging Keys ] There is no Timmy . From now on , his name be Angelo . He 's remembering what Raines told my mother after he fried his brain . I 'm afraid he 's remembering too quickly . Well , cut his dosage . I don 't want him to pop before he can answer my questions . It can 't be done . The treatment is given in specific stages that can 't be interrupted . Any break in the schedule means the new pathways in his system will atrophy . And if they do ? Angelo will regress to his previous self . Permanently . Angelo ? There is no more Timmy . From now on , he shall be known as Angelo . Get me Mr. Raines . I stored Dr. Boris 's stuff down here , Jarod . If he kept the red files anywhere , there 's only one place it would be . You ain 't a safecracker , are you ? Maybe today ... I don 't have to be . Did you find something ? Yes . Me . And the red files . What 's it say in there about you ? It 's all impersonal . Blood type , blood scans , height , weight . It 's all medical . Except for one thing . Destination . - Destination ? - It 's blacked out . I 'd like you to solve a problem for me . I was here . Pi times the square root of 931 ... divided by the radius of the circle . [ Man On Film ] Very good , Jarod . You 're very special . Where are my mom and dad ? [ Broots ] You won 't believe what I found . What ? Security videos logged into the mainframe that corresponds with the inception room . And ? A visual record classified under " Catherine Parker . " What ? It 's from the day you were born . Keep pushing . - [ Sydney ] Miss Parker , it 's your birth . - Ew ! This is too weird . [ Broots ] Oh , well , it 's just beginning . - [ Moaning ] - Here it comes . Here it comes . - [ Miss Parker ] Is that - - [ Sydney ] The then Dr. Raines . Raines delivered me ? - Spanks your bottom in a second . - I 'm going to puke . - [ Groans ] - It 's a girl . - I can 't believe he saw me nude . - Okay , Catherine , the next one is coming and coming quick . - [ Baby Crying ] - Next one ? Sydney , what 's going on ? It appears you didn 't arrive alone . - There 's trouble with the boy . Nurse ! - [ Groaning ] - Syd ? - What 's wrong with him ? Tell me what 's wrong with him . - What else is on that ? - The tape ends there . - Either cut off or edited . - Or erased ... so no one would find out the truth . I had a brother . I feel like I 've found a treasure chest , and inside there 's only dust . Well , sometimes answers lead to more questions . But for what it 's worth , I do remember what your parents ' first names were . - Margaret and Charles . - Yeah . Which is still not to say they were your biological parents . - What do you mean ? - Back in those days ... this was also an adoption agency , not just a reproduction center . Dr. Boris headed up adoptions . Dr. Nicholas ran conceptions . Another dead end . Maybe not . " Oakview 555-6507 " ? The old Oakview Lodge near Stone Mountain . Your parents used to stay there when they were here . Could be treasure . Could be dust . Yes , just let me know when it 's done , will you ? I don 't want any excuses . And - Angel ! That thing have a " stop " button ? - Ah . Oh . - [ Clicks ] [ Chuckles ] Indulge me my parental pride ... but you do look exquisite sitting there . Someday you will ... permanently . Parents always want what 's best for their children . Of course , you 'll know that feeling - - How dare you ! - What ? Why didn 't you tell me I had a twin ? We-Your mother and I - [ Clears Throat ] wanted to spare you unnecessary pain . I was away when you both were born . He died before he ever lived . We buried him ... but not the pain . Pain or not , I have a right to know I had a brother . - Angel - - No , Daddy . [ Clears Throat ] Parents make mistakes too . He 's in a small plot here on the Centre grounds . Area 66 . I can take you there . No . I 'd - I 'd rather find it myself . [ Door Opens ] [ Rifle Cocks ] You take one more step , I 'm gonna blow your head off . I would settle for a " no vacancy " sign . I 'm so sorry . It 's just that we 've had a scad of burglaries around here lately . What with the hour and all , I just didn 't think anybody was gonna be checking in . - Are you the owner ? - Yeah . Louis " King " Rue . Innkeeper to the stars . Well , you can name your pleasure . I got mountain view , lake view . I even got one room my old man used to tell peopleJeff Davis slept in . Did you grow up here ? I grew old . Never up . Louis , do you recognize this woman ? Oh , my Lord . You must be BabyJarod . I 'll never forget the winter I met your parents . You know that lake view I mentioned ? Well , that thing froze over , and I went out on it . Broke through . Your dad rushed in and saved my hide . - What is it ? - Well , it 's funny . You don 't look like either one of your folks . This cottage right here was theirs . Let 's go take a look . Well , this is it . Hope that light 's workin ' . Well , it 's , uh - it 's not much ... but your dad loved the view - Major Charles . That 's what I called your dad on account of his air force uniform . - Air force . - Yeah , he was a pilot . He and your mom used to set out on this porch ... watch the sun rise every morning . They really loved each other . - Louis ? - Yeah . I would like to stay here for a little while if you don 't mind . Make yourself at home . Hell , you 're sort of family . [ " Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star " ] [ Sighs ] [ Bell Ringing ] [ Children Chattering ] Good morning , class .

[ Together ] I pledge allegiance to the flag ... of the United States of America ... and to the republic for which it stands ... one nation , under God , indivisible ... with liberty andjustice for all . That 's it ? That 's it . Okay , now we are going to divide up into groups . As I call your name , please move to the table I assign you . Table number one : Albert Williams ...

Let 's go to your room . - Okay . I don 't know how much more disappointment she can take . - How are you holding up ? - First time we started talking about adoption . The process takes forever . Wejust want a chance to raise a child . I 'm sure you 'll get that chance . Morning , Jarod . Good morning , Dr. Haring . - I take it the Brewsters aren 't pregnant ? - No . Not yet . Although I have found three excellent egg donor candidates . Has the lab analyzed these yet ? Not yet . But considering Mrs. Brewster 's cycle , I 'd like to get on it right away . Jeremy . I want a complete workup on these immediately . So it shall be written . So it shall be done . Let 's hope we find what we 're looking for . Yes . Let 's . Doctor , there 's something you should see . - Tell me you found Angelo . - No , uh , but I found something else . I think maybe Sydney should show it to you . - l-I 'll just take a little break . - Broots . Last time I saw that look , Bambi 's mother was in my crosshairs . Well , I 've been hitting dead ends on this birthing thing ... so this morning I helped myself to Raines 's moving boxes ... wherein I found some personal surveillance files . Twice in three days . Broots found something you need to see , Miss Parker . Sit down . I 'll stand . Uh , it 's more of your birthing record . [ Mrs. Parker On Monitor ] What 's wrong with him ?

I found these lab results in the donor bin . Three blood samples . I need to contact one of them right away . - Did you find a perfect donor ? - Well , unfortunately not for the Brewsters .

They found him a permanent home . - He just left . - They ? The man from Child Placement . Davy called him " The Snowman . " - Snowman ? - Because of his hair . It was solid white . - Raines 's cleaner , Gar . - Is something wrong ? Did he tell you where he was taking Davy ? I assume to the county airstrip . Where is he ? - Who ? - The child . Prodigy . They must have set up a relay - a safe house - before the boy arrives here . I 'm not going to lose him , Sydney . - What are you going to do ? - I have doors of my own to open .

[ " Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star " ] [ Playing Skillfully ] - [ Ends ] - [ Laughs ] Angelo ... do you remember anything about where you were taken ... before they locked you under the world ? Can 't remember . [ Cuckoo Clock Chiming ] Time for medicine . Two more treatments . Maybe this will help you remember . We have to remember . For the boy . For the boy . - Nothing on the mainframe about a safe house ? - Mm-mmm . - Fenigor 's red files . - [ Miss Parker ] All seven . I found them in my father 's office . You stole those from your - Mr. Parker ? Is that a problem ? Not for you . Fenigor said the answers are in these files . They 're designated by code numbers only . Do you think one of these files could have something to do with Jarod ? - What are you getting at ? - No one knows how old Jarod is . And if your twin was taken to NuGenesis ... do you think maybeJarod could be your brother ? The answer 's at NuGenesis . I wanna see the boy . He 's upstairs sleeping . You can see him on the monitor . [ Raines ] Neuro-pathways stimulation in progress . And progressing smoothly . Shouldn 't we get back to the Centre ? He can 't be moved yet . This treatment is predicated on a strict timetable . By morning , he 'll be ready for transport . Where am I ? [ Broots ] The 10-digit number ? It 's under the expediter . They 're the same on all seven files . [ Sydney ] Try running them as an I.D. number . - Oh , man . - What is it ? [ Sighs ] You were right , Syd . The number is an identification code for the expediter ... who brought the children to the Centre . - And ? - And you 're not gonna believe who it is . Fenigor . Fenigor . Fenigor , wake up , man . - [ Moans ] - I need to know about Prodigy . Red files . The children . Catherine . We couldn 't have saved them .

Are there more computer files there ? Answer ... red files . Eighth file . Eighth file ? Sydney , there 's only supposed to be seven files . [ Classical ] [ Ends ] That 's beautiful . People where I grew up played that when I was little . [ Sighs ] I need you to remember when you were taken . I know it 's hard . There 's a little boy out there in danger . - Like I was ? - Just like you . There were men . Where did they take you ? A house . A glass house . Tell me about this house . Big . Dark . What else do you see ? A statue . [ Jarod ] What kind of statue ? [ Angelo Sighs ] A lady . An angel . The sign said " Angel Manor . ' " Angel Manor . - Thank you . - [ Cell Phone Ringing ] Thank you . Yes . Charleston , South Carolina . That 's all I know . Thank you , Sydney . [ Raines ] The first treatment is almost done . What exactly are you doin ' to the boy ? Helping to prepare him for his future . As ... what ? A Pretender . His bloodlines show the gift . I 'm helping to focus his potential . Like you did with Angelo ? Angelo was a mistake , trial and error . With the new technology , I 'll be able to focus the neuro-stimulation ... to the parts of his brain I want to hyper-develop . Is that what you did to createJarod ? No . Jarod was a natural Pretender . I 'm merely trying to re-create him . - [ Loud Thump ] - What was that ? Willie ! - Willie ! - What is it ? Over there ! Angelo crawled into the storm drain . - [ Beeping ] - Get the generator on now ! Mr. Raines , the power 's out ! Get back to the boy , now ! Jarod . How is he ? They hurt him like they did me ! Like they did me ! Tell me how long he has . Basic motor skills have diminished ... and he 's been unresponsive to external stimuli for hours . What did you see at the Angel Manor ? Neuro-receptors . That 's the very same process Raines used on Angelo . Well , there 's one ray of hope . Angelo 's treatment seems to have worked . - He 's with you ? - Yes . - I 'm hoping the same treatment can be used on Davy . - It could . But Raines 's new process will be much harder to reverse , if possible at all . The brain is an unforgiving area , Jarod . Time 's against you . So you 're saying that if we don 't counteract Raines 's treatment ... - Davy 's degeneration could be irreversible . - It will be . You have three hours or less to synthesize the new serum . I won 't let them do it again . Jarod , there 's something else you should know . It 's about you - you and Miss Parker . Do you think it 's true - thatJarod is Miss Parker 's brother ? If Fenigor is right , the answers are in here . [ Footsteps ] Well , maybe we 'll find the blue boxes in the junk somewhere . Hello , Nurse . There it is , Syd . I got it . You know , this is one Rubik 's Cube ... I don 't know if I want to solve . Maybe if I don 't decrypt the information on it , I might even be able to sleep nights . - Syd . - [ Gasps ] I found it ! - How much longer ? - Ten minutes . Thank you for getting me in here . Save it till I get you out . I know you can hear me . I 've been where you are , Davy . I 've been you . [ Groans ] Uh - Uh - Um - - Jarod 's going to make everything all right . - [ Groaning ] - Uh - - [ Groaning Continues ] Jarod 's gonna make it all right . [ Variation Of " Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star ' " ] [ Ends ] Are you sure this stuff 's gonna help that boy ? If he gets it in time . I can 't believe I let this happen again . - This isn 't your fault . - But you were , Jarod . In all these years , I 've been askin ' God for forgiveness . Well , I don 't know about God 's , but you have mine . - [ Line Ringing ] - [ Louis ] Hello , Oakview Lodge . [ Line Disconnects ] It 's clear . Come on . Thank you for giving me a little piece of my past . And thank you for giving me peace of mind . - [ Footsteps ] - Good luck . Where 's the boy ? [ Gun Cocks ] - He 's safe . - Unlike you . Sorry ! Get up . - [ Weapon Cocking ] - Let him go ! Go , Jarod . You have no idea what you 're getting yourself into . This is my chance to make it right . Go ! For the boy ! No ! [ Grunts ] Damn it ! Oh , man . All seven red files . Plus the eighth , just like Fenigor said . Does it say if they 're brother and sister ? Oh , you 're not gonna believe what it says . Angelo ! Angelo ! I 've got it . It 's not the kid you need to worry about . Well , it 's good to see you again ... Sis . How do you know I have a brother ? You 've got the red files too ? Mr. Fenigor was right - about Prodigy ... our bloodlines , and the lies the Centre fed us . What are you saying ? That you 're my - - There were eight red files . - Eight ? Each of these files represents one of the children ... the Centre isolated as a potential Pretender . There were seven children that your mother tried to save . But the secret to your past ... is in the eighth file . - The eighth child . - You 've got my attention . NuGenesis monitored these eight children for the Centre . They screened them . You see , there 's a special anomaly in our blood ... in our genetics , that predisposes us with the gift . What is the big secret of number eight ? Number eight ... is you . My blood was tested ? Yours and your fraternal twin brother , who supposedly died at birth . Instead , he was whisked off to NuGenesis . I 've narrowed your brother 's identity down to these two files . One of those belong to you ? [ Sighs ] No . I 'm not your brother . But one of these files does belong to him . Him ? And the other to a boy named Bobby . But you know him better as ... Mr. Lyle . So you 're telling me ... that my brother is either a psychotic killer or Mush Head ? [ Jarod ] It 's unmistakable . I need a drink . A big one . - That him ? - His name is Davy . - Raines 's new Pretender . - As you can see , Raines already has a jump on it . Now , Davy 's only hope for recovery is this injection of serotonin . And if I don 't give it to him now , his condition becomes irreversible . No one 's doing anything until I figure out what the hell 's goin ' on . If you wanna shoot me , then go ahead and do it . [ Davy Whimpering ] False bravado . Never cared for that in a man . Help us ! Your mom - maybe my mom - died trying to save children like Davy . Do it for her . [ Sighs , Scoffs ] Do it . [ Inaudible ] I heard shots . You all right ? Oh , my God . What can we do ? Nothing . It 's over . No , it 's not . Angelo , that 's your last treatment . - Without it , you - - He 's a boy . Let him be a boy . Please ? [ Lullaby : " Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star " ] [ Ends ] Sydney , this is more than I can take . Stolen kids , stillborn babies that aren 't , Miss Parker 's brother . I mean , reactivating SL 27 . It 's my fault . I should have put a stop to this years ago . Come on , Syd . What could you have done ? I could have tried . Catherine Parker tried . Fenigor tried . Yes , and she 's dead , and he soon will be . No deader than I 'll feel inside if I don 't try now . Come on , Syd . I mean , what could you possibly do ? Syd ? Syd ? Wait a minute ! [ Object Clatters To Floor ] [ Birdcalls ] [ Whispering ] Hey . That lady with the legs ? She throws a wicked right hook . It 's difficult to distinguish between her bite and her bark . [ Chuckles ] I reckon so . Look at this . I found this stashed away in my parents ' belongings . It 's an early one of you . I remember your dad taking 'it . It was on a mornin just like today . Do you know if I was their child ? Or if I was adopted ? No . I just know they loved you ... very much . Where am I ? You 're safe . Aren 't you the substitute teacher ? Yeah . Yes , I am . Yes , I am . And you 're going to be home ... soon . [ Piano . " Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star ' " ] I like this song . Me too . [ Playing Wrong Notes ] [ Playing Worsens ] Is it possible ? - [ Stops ] - Maybe . I wish I could have known you - the real you . I wish I could have known the real you . Mom loved that song . She 'd play it for me . Tell me ... about her . Well ... they say she looked - Just like you . [ Chuckles ] Yeah . Her smile made me feel safe . Her compassion ... I can only dream of duplicating . She loved to read to me , take long walks with me . She loved me ... and I loved her . I miss her every day . Do you see her every day ? I know you don 't have much time , but ... do you remember something , anything ... that could tell me who killed her ? Who killed Mom ? I know it 's in there ... somewhere . I saw - l - I ... watched . - No ! - A man . What man ? No ! What man ? [ Mrs. Parker ] Leave me alone ! The man in the dark suit . Who ? I don 't know . Fenigor knows . Yes . Yes . But I hoped you did too . She played for you ! I play for you . [ Playing Poorly ] [ Stops ] That was beautiful . [ Wheels Squeaking ] [ Raines ] I want a 24-hour lockdown on all personnel ... for security checks and final test runs . No one in or out . - Is that clear ? - [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - [ Beeps ] - Raines . This is Gar . I 'm at NuGenesis . I know where they are ... and who 's with them . - Then we 're back in business . - [ Beeps Off ] In 12 hours , I 'm putting you out of business . He 's okay to travel now . We have to move . [ Miss Parker ] I can 't let you leave , Jarod . You know that . Is this what your mother would have done ? It 's time to go home . Where are you taking me ? It doesn 't have to be this way . New blood for the Centre . Your mother would be so proud of you . Save it ! - I saw your face when Angelo gave up his last treatment for Davy . - Keep moving . - [ Gar ] Let 's go ! - [ Jarod ] Angelo . - [ Grunting ] - Are you all right ? [ Groaning ] [ Miss Parker ] What 's wrong with him ? [ Yells ] Get off of me ! Jarod ! - Jarod ! - Save Davy . Angelo . Guess your gun jammed , huh ? Davy free . Miss Parker 's still in hell . [ Chattering ] We can 't accept this . Mr. Brewster , creating a whole new life doesn 't come cheap . Believe me . That should cover everything that Davy - your new family - is going to ever need . If you don 't want to do this , I 'll understand . Well , if what you 've told us is true ... Davy 's gonna need all the love he can get . Is that your family ? It will be . Someday . His regression is complete ... and irreversible . I 'm sorry . Will he remember anything ? Well , he 'll remember all that 's important . [ Strikes Piano Key ] Where are you going ? Unfinished business . Mr. Fenigor . Mr. Fenigor . Oh . Catherine . No . I 'm her daughter . Oh . Oh . My mother ... isn 't here . She is ... in spirit . How 'd you get back into the Centre ? The same way I 'm going to get out . If you get out . Why 'd you come ? I want to know who I am . And I 'd rather die trying to find out than live not knowing . - He 's slipping in and out . - [ Groans ] My parents . Tell me about my parents . - Who killed my mother ? - The man in the dark suit . The man in the dark suit . Who is the man in the dark suit ? The man who killed your mother . Who is he ? Jarod 's father . Jarod ! [ Gunshots ] - [ Clicks ] - Aah ! Oh ! [ Beeping ] - What 's that , Broots ? - It 's the security alarm . It 's in SL 27 . SL 27 ? There was to be no one down there . [ Broots ] Well , the surveillance camera says there is . It 's Jarod . - Mr. Raines ! Security has just reported a breach in SL 27 . - What kind of a breach ? - According to surveillance , it 's Jarod . - Jarod 's back ? Jarod ! Looks like another dead end . I know all I need to know . Do you ? After all the deceit and all the betrayal we 've both experienced ... how do you know what the truth is ? Fenigor had no reason to lie . Then you 're going to have to shoot me ... because I 'm going to find out the truth . But we want you alive , Jarod . I knew you had it in you , angel . Jarod ! Jarod ! Get out ! There 's a bomb ! Forgive me . [ Rumbling ]

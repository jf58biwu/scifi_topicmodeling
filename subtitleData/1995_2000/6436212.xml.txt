 [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Contessa , excuse-moi . Do you have a light ? You know , Darling , smoking can be dangerous to your health . Not as dangerous as feeling cornered to a bad monkey on a hot summer night . The badder the monkey , the better I sleep . And in the morning , how do you prefer to be awakened ? I prefer to be shaken , not stirred . Have you located the microchip ? It is in the ice sculpture frozen in the eye of this one . I 'll get the chip , but I 'll need a diversion . Leave it to me . Contessa . [ DANCE MUSIC ] Excuse me . Do you have the time ? It 's , uh , a quarter passed 9 : 00 . [ SHRIEKING ] Oops . You fools . The plan . Frisk everyone . [ GUNSHOTS ] Power up , Wyatt . Let 's rock . Wait ! To remember me by . I never got your name . Donnelly . Wyatt Donnelly . I think I love you , Wyatt Donnelly . Cool . [ MUSIC - " WEIRD SCIENCE " ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Fantasy and microchips , shooting from the hip , weird science . Weird science . Magic and technology , diagrams and charts , mending broken hearts , weird science . Weird science ! That little machine you zapped up kicks butt . Wow . Look at this . Hey , I still got the microchip . Sometimes there 's a little carry over from the VR world to the real world . It 's a very powerful machine . And I only had it set on two . Come on , Wy . I 'm ready for more . Let 's go live the sequel . I 'll pass . That hovercraft chase through the fireworks factory made me queasy . Besides , we got to get to school . I say we set this baby on 10 and see how the Contessa handles the love scenes . [ ZAPPING ] I don 't know about you , but I can sure take a break from that VR machine . I hear ya . I got an idea . Why don 't we just melt it into a big lump and never touch it again . Gary , there 's a guy in my locker . A guy . In my locker ! He was there . Uh-huh . And was this the same little guy who lived in your socks ? No . That was Mr. Hootie . SCAMPI ( ON INTERCOM ) : This is Principal Scampi . Will Wyatt Donnelly and Gary Wallace please report to my office . Is it safe ? Excuse me ? SCAMPI : Is it safe ? What are you talking about ? SCAMPI : I don 't have time for games , gentlemen . I want that microchip and I want it now . Principal Scampi ? The name is Scampfinger . Anything you want to tell me , Gar ? Anything important ? Important ? Let me think . Oh , yeah . I may have accidentally broken Lisa 's spy world simulator and turned our world into a life-threatening blend of fantasy and reality . If you consider that sort of thing important . I hope they shoot you first . SCAMPI : Silence . The microchip . You have it . I need it . Microchip ? The one you stole from me . From the ice sculpture ! Oh , oh ! The microchip . No , I have it . I mean , not on me , but I can just get it easy . I just have to run home . I suppose I can excuse you early . But first , a little fashion lift to ensure your return . These looks like bombs . 10 pounds of C4 to be exact . If you do not return in exactly one hour , the vests will explode . Contact the police , the vests will explode . Stop for tacos and the vest will explode . Lisa ? Silence , dogs . My name is Hotloins . Holly Hotloins . Boy are they ever . Scampfinger , please . I beg you . Let me kill them now . You know how much I enjoy mayhem . In time , my sweet . First , let me have a moment to tell the boys my master plan . The microchip you so recklessly stole is the brain of my water dehydration converter . With that chip , I will be able to condense all the water on the planet into a container the size of a Dixie cup . Why don 't you just use a Dixie cup ? Silence ! Arbor high will be the only high school with a full swimming pool . Our swim team will have a decisive advantage in every meet this season- - especially on the high dive . The school board will vote you Principle of the Year for sure . Arm the bombs . [ CAR LOCK SOUND ] You 'll never get away with this . SCAMPI : You have 59 minutes . I suggest you use them wisely . Send in the next student . Ah , Mr. Dinkler . Late for American history again , I see ? I suppose you expect me to give you some excuse . No , Mr. Dinkler . I expect you to die . No ! [ EVIL LAUGHTER ] Scampi 's a ruthless killer . Our genie 's an enemy agent . We got bombs strapped to our chest . Have I thanked you for being my friend today ? Thank you for being my friend today . Hey , guys . I 'm Winnie . This is Begas . You want to hang out or something ? You guys want to hang out with us ? Sure . Don 't think that as incredibly popular cheerleaders we 're bothered by your fringe-dwelling physically mutated geekiness . We 're not . We think it 's cute . That 's why we want to get up close and personal . They 're going to kill us . Fork over the microchip , uber geek . Why do you want it ? No more water , no more humidity . No more humidity , no more bad hair days . Duh . But we don 't have the chip . Bummer . But we still have to waste you . Ready . ALL ( CHEERING ) : OK ! Ricka-racka , ricka-racka , sis , boom , bah . Kill Gary , kill Wyatt . Rah , rah , rah ! You know what 's weird ? This has always been a fantasy of mine . Duck . Get in . They belong to me , you old stuck-up one . Take them at your peril . Come on , girls . Pyramid ! Boom-shaka-laka , sucker . [ GUNSHOTS ] Smells like teen spirit . Never thought I 'd be happy to see you , Chett . Don 't be , pucker butt . Ah , you 're finally awake and lucky to be alive . Dad ? You know the agency frowns on familiarity among its operatives . Call me Number 1 . I 'm disappointed in you , Number 7 . You 've blown your cover . You too , Number 2 . Don 't think I won 't be calling your father . I 'm sure he 'll want to see you terminated as well . Terminated ? For blowing our cover ? And for losing the microchip to our arch enemy , Scampfinger . Wait . Scampfinger doesn 't have the chip . We do . I thought you searched them , Agent 30-0-6 . 30-0-6 ! Full cavity search . No chip . Just a handful of bad memories . Oh . Now , you have your mission , gentleman . Go home , destroy the chip . I 'll see to it that the agency reinstates you and your allowance . WYATT : There 's the microchip . Right where I left it . Great . You know the mission . Now smash that baby . LISA : I 'll take that . Lisa ! The name is Hotloins . Holly Hotloins . We weren 't going to break it . We were just going to bring this to you and now you 're here . Here . Silence , dog . You betrayed us . Am I the only one loyal to Scampfinger ? Uh , just what exactly do you see in that guy anyway ? I love him- - all of him . The touch of his full , pouty Scamp lips pressing against mine . His pokey little Scamp tongue probing my inner ear . Thank you . Did not need to hear that . I 'll do anything to please him , and nothing would please him more than eliminating you . Well , when your time 's up , your time 's up . Let me guess . Another one of your fantasies ? Wait , you can 't kill us . Not here . We 'll be late for geometry class . If we miss class , Mrs. Fletcher will call my parents . My parents will call the police . There will be an investigation . And if there 's an investigation , Scampfinger will never become Principal of the Year . Fair enough . I 'll kill you at school . Comfortable , I trust . Actually , I 'd like to buy a value . You have the chip . What else do you want ? What any principle would want . Respect , some help with the morning announcements , problem students eliminated ! Gentlemen , let me introduce you to the men from AV . What are you going to do ? Show us a film strip ? On the contrary , dear boy . This elite squad of butt kissers has used its extensive knowledge of reel-to-reel tape recorders and overhead projectors to construct this lovely death ray . [ EVIL LAUGHTER ] Just for the record , this is not one of my fantasies . Pity I can 't stay for the big send off , but I 'm expected at an urgent engagement . The school board 's ready for you . And I am ready for them . I can 't believe I passed on the boobs of death for this . Agent 30-0-6 , shut off the laser ! We owe you . You saved our lives again . Don 't mention it , 00-Buttlick . I 'm very disappointed in you , Number 7 . You too , Number 2 . You let Scampfinger get away with the microchip . But Dad , Holly Hotloins stole it from us . And Scampfinger had this laser beam , and- - I 've had a belly full of your lame excuses . Number 3 managed to destroy the enemy 's orbiting death station and mow the lawn . Number 3 . What a suck-up . Agent 30-0-6 , report . Intelligence confirms Scampfinger 's throwing another lavish dinner party . Guests include a pack of international terrorists and the Vlemings- - Jim and Cathy- - cute couple who live next door . Well , you heard him , boys . This is your last chance . Destroy that chip and your mission 's accomplished . Wait a minute . Maybe that 's it . If we finish the mission , we 'll zap out of this screwed-up fantasy like before , when Spy World was just a game . DAD : We 've whipped up a few things to help you on your mission . Standard issue dart guns , exploding cuff links , cyanide breath mints . Ah , just what you need . What is it ? Some kind of explosive death gel ? Precisely . I call it dippity doom . You can hide enough in that mop of yours to blow a chunk out of the sun . You got anything here we could actually use ? Yep . The death pants . What are they ? Like , really , really tight ? These pants are the end result of decades of tactical fashion research . They were smuggled out of Communist China in 1963 . Two of our finest agents gave their lives for these pants . Now I give them to you . XYZ . Right back at ya . Stop . That 's how you arm them . Oh . Come on , I 'll take you to the minisub . You sure this is Scampi 's house ? How many principles do you know who could afford subterranean moats ? Good point . Ready ? Ready . OK , same game plan as before . I 'll cause a diversion , you get the chip . I 'll check the ice sculpture . That 's where it was last time . It take two to tango . Prepare to be swept off your feet , Contessa . Your fly 's open . Yes , I know . Hotloins ? Number 2 . You 're alive- - for the moment . It 's gotta be in here somewhere . MALE VOICE : The time is 9 : 20 . Great . Wrong watch . I should kill you , but I find myself strangely attracted to you . I know you only as Number 2 . Surely you have a more dignified name . Donnelly . Wyatt Donnelly . We are on opposite sides of the kill or be killed business , Wyatt Donnelly . Is there some way we can meet in the middle ? Only one- - the tango . [ DANCE MUSIC ] Don 't worry . They are disarmed . Your fly is open . Yes , I know . Snocone ? You dance divinely . I think I may be falling in love with you , Wyatt Donnelly . Think ? When will you be sure ? When I see how well you dip . You dip poorly . You must die . Scampfinger ! Ah , Mr. Donnelly . You have a nasty habit of surviving . He tried to seduce me . I resisted . Sorry , Wyatt . My fingers were numb and I couldn 't get my gun out . OK , boys . Class dismissed . Wait , stop ! Before you shoot , do you mind if we zip up ? Wouldn 't want you to meet your maker with your hangar doors open . Zip away . Ha ! We 're wearing death pants . Not the death pants ! You win this round , Mr. Wallace , but we 'll see who has the last laugh- - graduation day . You won 't make it off the acceptance stage alive . The joke 's on you . The way my grades have been sucking , I probably won 't graduate anyway . FEMALE VOICE : You have 45 seconds to detonation . Hey , Wyatt , how do we aim these things ? We can 't . Don 't you see ? We 're wearing bombs ! Bombs ? Thank you , gentlemen , for making my soiree such a blast . Adieu . Goodbye , Number 2 . You 'll always be Number 1 in my heart . FEMALE VOICE : 25 seconds to detonation . Gary , we have to destroy the chip . It 's the only way to complete our mission and get home . FEMALE VOICE : 20 seconds . It won 't break ! FEMALE VOICE : 15 seconds . WYATT : What are you doing ? Gary ! Dippity doo . You actually used that stuff ? It smells like gas , but it really gives me shape . FEMALE VOICE : Two , one , detonate . It worked ! Spy World 's over . SCAMPI : Mr. Wallace , Mr. Donnelly . Charming little trick with the pants . Unfortunately , it 's going to cost you a month 's detention and a session with the school psychologist . Check me for holes . [ MUSIC - OINGO BOINGO , " WEIRD SCIENCE " ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Fantasy and microchips , shooting from the hip , something different , we 're making weird science . Ooo ! Pictures from a magazine , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation . I do not know . It 's my creation ! From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand my intentions ?

 All right , could it be behind door number one , two or three ? And you have first choice right now , Kathy . What door do you want ? - [ Kathy ] Three . - Door number three . And , Debbie ? Debbie , just for the fun of it - Just for the fun of it , which one would you have chosen if you went for it ? - [ Debbie ] Two . - Number two . What was behind number two ? Just two - $ 2 , 000 in cash ... because the super deal was behind ... number one ! And number three had the $ 1,000 . - [ Knocking ] - [ Woman ] Ready to take the plunge ? Ready . It 's my " big deal of the day . " [ Man ] Jarod must 've screwed up bad ... if they sent three of ya out here to close him down . You sure that you 're his Amway field representatives ? Do you really think that we could fool someone as smart as yourself ? Well , uh , I-I guess it 's that Amway thing . Uh , I just never thought of Jarod as a glycerin and honey soap kind of guy . That is what you people sell , isn 't it ? Soap ? Yeah , uh , everything from , uh , baby shampoo ... to , uh , industrial-strength pool cleaner . That 'd be good foryou . Oh , look . The Match Game , the home version . Uh , Jarod , he 's a - he 's a regular lightning round lunatic . When he 's not surfin ' the waves , he 's surfin ' the Game Show Channel . Parker ? Pushing the Limits . Taking Risks . Confessions of an Adrenaline Junkie . What are we talkin ' about here , Syd ? Jarod Knievel jumping Buicks at Caesars ? It 's daredevil stuff , you know ? He 's always doing dangerous things ... like night surfing and street luge and - He even strapped that bullet proof vest on once and he had me shoot him blindfolded ! All manifestations of an obsession with risk-taking . What kind of training do you put your sales people through , actually ? We 'll send you a brochure . Dr. Quackenbush ... once again , your diagnosis has come too late to find Jarod . Well , not that late . He left less than an hour ago . Was that with or without his blindfold ? You don 't need a blindfold to jump off a bridge . [ Woman ] You sure you want to stay with this old cord , Jarod ? You 've done 295 on this one . Well , I only really need it to last 296 . [ Yelling ] [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . [ Jarod ] Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . Mr. Goltz 's M.R.I. reveals a closed fracture ... of the right parietal bone with a subdural hematoma . [ Man ] We 've inserted a C.S.F .. shunt ... so we should know more once his edema 's resolved . I notice on his admission chart the presence of glass fragments in his hair . [ Man ] It 's a mystery . I assumed they came from his glasses . But his mother says Tony doesn 't wear them . - Could it have been a sports goggle of some kind ? - No . Industrial-grade glass . I , uh , did a lab analysis myself . You did it , not the police ? [ Man ] They 're treating the entire Goltz case as a bungee stunt gone bad . Open and shut . No more , no less . Tony ? Honey , come on back home . Your sister and I miss you so . I always keep my family close too . Sorry . You must be Dr. Nichols . - Call me Jarod . - Oh , please , sit down . When Tony wakes up , I just want him to remember . Actually , I didn 't think I 'd ever see these photos again . I thought Tony 's wallet had been lost in the accident ... but somebody found it at the nurses ' station this morning . It was left in that envelope wrapped in wax paper . Well , at least the pictures were still there . His sister Carrie took those at his last birthday . A week later , he was off looking for his dad . He was searching for his father ? His father rode off on a dirt bike in ' 91 and never looked back . Searching for your family . It 's instinct . Now his - his sister Carrie 's doing it . Not long after we came out here to look after Tony , she just took off . I 'm just hoping that someday , we 'll all be smiling like in those pictures again . The best therapy for him is to hear the voice of his family and his friends . I guess that 's just me now . His friends used to come by and visit , but they stopped . - Where are they ? - I don 't know . He and his daredevil friend Zed ... used to ride motorcycles out at a place called Willow Ridge . I guess Zed 's riding alone now . # [ Rock , Indistinct ] - [ Honking ] - [ Tires Screeching ] You okay ? Hey , no problem . I always wanted to be a hood ornament . I 'll take that as a " yes . " You know , the way you flew up my tailpipe , I thought you were a cop . Not today . Are you sure you 're all right ? No , it 's okay . The chick can handle it . Chicks ? They call me Jarod . - Friends call me Shay . - Hmm . Friends like Zed ? - You know Zed ? - I understand that he and his friends race this road . Huh . Well , maybe I was right about you . Maybe you are a cop . Just somebody tryin to fight the boredom . Oh , by the way , nice racing . [ Engine Sputtering ] It 's not exactly a police escort , but I have an extra seat . Ask me , Speed Racer 's kissed the asphalt ... one too many times without a helmet . [ Sydney ] Could be a psychotic cry for help . Hi , Sis . So I heard Jarod never came back to his lair . Any luck deciphering his new occupation ? Don 't quote me , but I think he morphed into the human cannonball . Jarod seems to be exhibiting all the signs of an obsession with extreme thrill-seeking . Hmm . Maybe he 's rejuvenating . Some jump off cliffs , others seek religion . I , for one , replenish my soul by going back to nature . - Oh . - What , surprised to find I like to camp ? No . Surprised to find you have a soul . On that loving note , I 'm off to the wilds for three days . My office will know how to reach me . I can die now . I 've seen it all . [ Chuckles ] You wanna bet ? They were just delivered . Scratch " human cannonball . " - He 's freakin ' Chuck Barris . - Well , actually , Monty Hall . And what exactly is the deal with Jarod 's Big Deal , Broots ? We open door number one with this key . - What about the other two ? - Time-locked . - They 'll open at predetermined intervals . - [ Miss Parker ] Give me that . Okay , quizmaster , what is behind door number one ? [ Broots ] Looks like a giant fortune cookie . [ Miss Parker ] It is a giant fortune cookie . [ Broots ] So what 's our future hold ? It 's not about our future . It 's about the past . It 's a dinner bill from a few weeks ago . " The Hidden Truth . " And the waitress was called May Lin . " The Hidden Truth . " Yeah . That 's the Chinese restaurant I pass by on my way here . - I 've never been there . - Me either . You , Syd ? I don 't eat rice . So what do you think it means , Miss Parker ? That we need reservations . [ Man ] You lose . [ Shay ] Yo , Zeddie , Jojo , Mackey . What up , Shay ? Where you been , chillin ' on a beach with a coldie ? - Just riding . - Yeah ? You gonna do that luge in a wet suit ? I 've been surfin ' today , darlin ' . Jojo ? But I hear that whaling stretch of road in the Glen 's gettin ' shut down next week . - So they 're dropping the hill ? - Not soon enough . Name 's Zed . - Jarod . - He 's not some Jehovah 's Witness knockin ' on my door , is he ? Well , I 've witnessed a lot , but never Jehovah . That 's good , ' cause I 'm broke . And I haven 't seen God . At least not since I had that awesome meltdown lugin ' a canyon last week , hey , guys ? [ Man ] Right on ! - You like to ride , " J " ? - Anything and everything . What do you do for a living ? Well , I seem to have trouble holding down a steady job . I get bored pretty easily . Ah , boredom . The endless bowel . - What about yourself ? - A job here , a job there , you know . - Whatever keeps Cheerios on the table . - Amen to that . He can ride , Zed . I know since Tony 's been out ... - you 've been looking for another player . - Is that right ? - You up for an endorphin fix ? - If it takes more nad than luging down a canyon , sure . - Why not ? - Well , if you got ' em , bring ' em along . Then you tell me . Come on , mates . [ Zed ] 200yards , headon . Keep your wheels on the double yellow . In the old days , they used to call this chicken . I think of it more of a chance ... to , uh , get a grin from the gods . Let 's make them smile . Let 's do it . I 'm damn good , Jarod , but Zed 's great . Don 't blink . He 's cageable . - Oh ! - Ooh ! Nice one , " J " man . Not even my mate Tony took me that far . There 's a spot in my tribe if you want it . Mmm . Got nothin ' better to do . You know , I 've never seen Zed take to anybody so fast , Jarod . Easy come , easy go , I guess . - Are you talking about Tony ? - Yeah . - Who is this guy ? - Tony used to hang with the group before I got here . Then he got messed up in a bungee accident a little over a month ago . Did his cord break ? Frayed or something while takin ' a plunge off the Parker 's Mill Road . The doctors don 't give him much of a chance . But , hey , like Zed always says , first one to 40 alive loses . " J " man ! I 'm really glad you made it tonight . I don 't know if Shay told you , but Friday nights ... we don 't exactly square dance around the radio . We like to try new things , push the envelope . - Then let 's make the gods grin . - No , no , no . - Let 's make ' em laugh out loud . - [ Man ] Whoo ! Free the brain , free the body . Free the body , free the soul . And you thought we were goin hang gliding ' tonight , " J. " Fire walkers in Mauritius learn how to channel their fears , harness them ... to create a power that could not be denied . It 's a power free for the taking . Nothing is free . I 'm startin ' to think you 're a slave to the same demons I am , " J. " Without demons , there can be no angels . F.Y.I. Basaltic rock . It 's a much better conductor of heat . If you 're going to free your soul , I say free it . I guess our Chinese dinner was officially a zonk last night . Any results yet on that dinner bill from the fortune cookie ? Well , my pal Bodie down in Physical did a rush job for me . - The geek with cloudy cataracts ? - Yeah . Have you seen them lately ? It 's milkier than a Guernsey . Says the kids love it on Halloween . Some zombie thing he does . - The results , Broots . - Uh - The-The only prints on the bill belong to the waitress . May , last name , Lin . The one who quit over a month ago with no forwarding address ? Like I said , zonk . Oh , Miss Parker ? Jarod 's door number two just opened . Come see what I found inside . [ Jarod ] Thank you , thank you , thank you ! It 's time for another exciting game of You Don 't Have a Clue . I 'm your host , Jarod Winkerdale ... and it 's time to see if you have a clue . This is no stress disorder , Syd . It 's Chernobyl of the brain . Today 's lucky contestant is Miss Parker ! She 'll have overnight to figure out her clue . And if she does , she 'll win a trip to the beautiful Cabins O ' Love hideaway ... nestled into the rolling hills of Thompson , West Virginia . Don 't look at me . I watch soaps . Okay , Miss Parker , here 's your clue . The hidden truth may be missing ... but you won 't find it until you claim your prize . - [ Bell Dings ] - " The hidden truth . " - The name of the restaurant . - " May . May missing . " The waitress May Lin is missing . " You won 't find it until you claim your prize . " A trip to the beautiful Cabins 0 ' Love . Beautiful indeed . [ Tony 's Mother 's Voice ] Tony 's wallet had been lost in the accident ... but somebody found it at the nurses 'station this morning . It was left in that envelope wrapped in wax paper . - Four bucks . - These are delicious . Oughta be . Harry 's got the dirtiest dirty water dogs in town . Four duckies . My wallet . - Have you seen my wallet ? - How would I know where it is ? Well , since you have such a knack for finding wallets ... I thought maybe you knew where mine was . Look , when Isaw on the news ... that the guy was in a coma from that bungee accident , I felt guilty . - Oh , an honorable thief . - I didn 't rob him . I found it . - About a month ago in the bushes when I was sweeping ' up glass . - Industrial-grade glass . It was on the sidewalk below that high-rise there . The morning after the robbery , a rare coin dealer on the 30th floor . A bunch of 'em zip-lined from that building through the windows to that one . You 'd have to be crazy to try a stunt like that . Or searching for your soul . [ Door Closes ] Jarod , what are you doing ? I was looking for a wrench . My-My bike 's losing compression . - And you ? - Oh , uh , I thought you were Zed . Did you take this picture ? No . Before I got here . - Is that Tony ? - Yeah . I-I guess . Zed used to talk about him all the time right after the accident . More than he does now . Tony and Zed , they were really good friends ? Tony was in Zed 's inner group . See , with Zed it 's all about the ultimate thrill ... pushing the envelope , challenging the people around him to find their true selves . When he thinks you 're ready , he invites you on the ultimate thrill . Ultimate thrill , or ultimate test ? - Both , I guess . - Have you been invited ? - I guess he doesn 't think I 'm ready yet . - And Tony ? Was that the ultimate thrill , or the ultimate test ? I don 't know . If you 're not in , you 're not in . Well , I didn 't mean to interrupt . [ Forced Chuckle ] I 'll see you later . - So when does all this fun begin ? - Meaning ? Meaning I 'm not hanging around here for my health . The only people around here who are having any fun are you and your merry little men . Well , those merry little men are special people , Jarod . People who have proven themselves , you know ? - Pushed the limits of both mind and body . - And the law ? Your toys , they weren 't exactly dropped off by Santa Claus , were they ? Like I said , " J , " whatever it takes to put Cheerios on the table . Do you think you have what it takes , Jarod ? I don 't know . Why don 'tyou be the judge ? It 's simple , " J. " I dump you in the water , then I throw in a key . Object : Free yourself before you die . - Zed , this is too far . - A closed mind is a crippled mind , Shay . Make fear work for you . Conquer it . Jarod knows . You have to taste death to live life . Right ? Oh , I almost forgot . - Can you conquer the fear , " J " ? - You 'd be surprised what I can do . - One minute . - Give him the key . He 's just gettin ' started , my love . - What are you doing ? - Like the ads say ... helping him be all that he can be . How about you , Shay ? How far will you push it to be your best ? Ninety seconds . Two minutes . No . He don 't want help . 2 : 15 . [ Coughs ] Mind conquers body . Welcome to the other side , " J. " Welcome to the merry men . May Lin stayed in this cabin here . Perfect . I tried to engage May in some occasional chitchat ... but the little waitress was a bit stand-offish . I can 't imagine what would make her uncomfortable around here . Me neither . But I guess them people just like to stick to themselves . What kind of a racist comment is that ? Oh , no . I 'm not unsophisticated . I was talking about her gender . Single woman and such . You 're unattached , aren 'tyou ? As unattached as your limbs are gonna be ... if you keep eyeballing me like that , Mr. Datsun . Well , anyhoo ... May Lin up and vamoosed in the middle of the night , skipping ' on her bill . Left her stuff behind too - three dresses , four tops , shoes , socks , cosmetics ... and six pair of ... little black panties . Well , I had to inventory it . - I bet you did . - Kinda creepy . Pretty girl like that just vanishing ' and all . Yeah . Creepy . A good wrench is hard to come by , isn 't it ... Carrie ? [ Chuckles ] How 'd you know ? The pain in your eyes when you saw your brother in this picture . Tony is your brother . Your mother is very worried about you . I 'm gonna find out what happened to Tony . Now , I know Zed is responsible . I just can 't prove it yet . Zed is not someone that you mess with . Now , he talks a mean game about life and about death ... but when push comes to shove , you 'll be the one doing the dying . I 'm here to help you . You 're gonna have to trust me . Tony told me that he met this - He met this guy named Zed , who promised to help him find our father . He said he used to ride with Dad back in ' 96 . Tony trusted him . He believed him . What happened ? A month ago , the night of Tony 's accident , he called me . I told him that our mother got a call from our grandmother ... and they hadn 't spoken in years . She said my father died in ' 92 . That 's way before Zed claims he knew him . So Zed was stringing your brother along . Tony got really angry , and he said he was gonna confront Zed . But I guess he never got the chance . Maybe he did . Carrie , you are in way over your head . I want you to go home and be with your family . - I 'll find out what really happened to your brother . - No ! No way . All right . You mess with my family , you mess with me . - Carrie , listen to me . - I don 't even know who you are . I have no idea how you got involved in this , Jarod , but ... I like you . So don 't cross me . Please ? [ Broots ] Find anything at the Cabins O 'Love ? Yeah . How to ruin a pair of Gucci 's with red clay . Yeah , that 's funny . The entire trip was a regular laugh riot ... thanks to Jarod 's whacked-out rendition of Alex Trebek . It 's Monty Hall . [ BuzzerSounds ] No time like the present to find out just how whacked-out . What is it ? Something for you to clean up your theories with . There 's a note . " Be careful what you dig for . " There 's an address on here . - It 's Lyle 's address . - Huh . Hmm . Sorry , love . It 's up to you . What do you say ? " J. " Same invite stands for you as it does for Shay . - Invite ? - Yeah . Got a juicy little excursion to the other side planned for tonight . That is , if you 're up to it . - Anything Jarod can handle , I can too . - Even death ? As the ancients said ... when the gods created man , they saw death and saved life for themselves . I say , since we can 't live forever , let 's at least live . Time to do battle with the gods . Pass tonight 's test ... and there 'll be no limit . [ Door Opens , Closes ] You don 't have to do this , Carrie . The name is Shay . Don 't forget it . Good news , Shay . The owners of the house aren 't home , makin ' your job easier . There 's a set of blueprints in the desk in the office . Bring them to me , win valuable prizes . You want me to rob the house ? This is not about stealing ' , love . This is about pushing ' the envelope . - She 's not ready . - I can do it ! Hey , I know you can do it . But can you feel it ? Can you feel the danger ? That 's your passage to the other side . [ Dialing , Line Ringing ] Yeah , Pac Tech Security ? I 'd like to report a burglary . 1600 Seaward . - You 're setting her up ? - I 'm just adding a dash of Tabasco to the soup . You 're sending her into a danger she 's not ready for . There 's only one way to find out , you know ? Uh , hello . Sorry . I just made a real big mistake . It was just my daughter coming home late without a key . - You 're messin ' with my game . - Just tryin ' to have a little fun . Raise the bar a little bit . Nothing like a few 911 calls to spice up the soup . - Go . - [ Dogs Barking ] Circle . Carrie ? Carrie ? [ Grunting ] - It 's me ! It 's me ! It 's me . - Jarod ! - I did it . I got the blueprints . - You 're bleeding . I cut myself breaking in , and - Freeze ! Police ! Damn it ! Go that way ! Stop ! Go , go , go ! Move it ! " J " man . The Cheerios are in the cupboard . Damn thing started bleeding again . I was looking for something to stop it up . Yeah , well , there 's no thrill in bleeding ' to death , is there ? You know , whether it 's a suicide lunge ... bungee dive , it 's all about trust ... in yourself and the ones around you . - Trust is key . - Exactly . - First aid kit 's in the bathroom down the hall . - Thank you . [ Monitor Beeping ] It 's me . Shh . It 's Jarod . We 're getting out of here . Jarod , Zed 's been asking for you all night . It 's almost time . - For what , his final challenge ? You 're coming with me . - Forget it ! If this son ofa bitch is responsible for my brother 's coma , I have to prove it . That 's going to be very difficult for you to do from prison . I found out that the Acme Warehouse is a front for money laundering . He 's gonna use you to steal cash ... just like he used your brother to rob that coin dealer ... the night of your brother 's so-called accident . Now , we are leaving . I don 't think so , " J. " You know , Shay , your brother Tony ... was the calmest dude I ever saw at 30 stories . You , on the other hand , look a little pale . But that 's all right , ' cause I only need you as a sacrificial lamb right now . Isn 't that right , Doc ? Jojo followed you to the hospital . I don 't know who you are , but this different identity scene must be a rush , huh ? Let 's go . Now I know what Tony must have felt ... when you pushed him off that bridge wearing that faulty bungee cord . - This side won 't be the same without you , " J. " - Weights are in , Zeddie . Give my best to the beast of the gods . - He 'll die ! - Bring her with . You - [ Gasping ] [ Broots ] I sure hope Lyle is still on his campout . It 's stuffy in here . - Being here gives me the creeps . - Wow . His decor is like Kung Fu meets The Jetsons . [ Sarcastic Chuckle ] From Chinese restaurants to love lodges ... to this GQ spread for anal retention ... Jarod 's had us running around in his game show hell . - Why ? - To find a grand prize of some kind here in Lyle 's apartment . Something incongruous with the surroundings . Something out of place . A speck of dust would be out of place in this joint . I found his Centre expense report . You can learn a lot about a man based on the way he spends his money . Like the fact that my thumbless sibling rips off the Centre for everything ... from silk stockings to herbal laxatives . Likes to dine out too . Look at that . - There must be over a dozen charges for The Hidden Truth . - That 's where May Lin worked . And he has charges from the Cabins 0'Love Lodge . Checked out the same day May Lin vanished . Miss Parker ? There 's two shovels here . They both have red clay on them . Not unlike the clay you found on your shoes . - Uh-oh . - What ? There 's a door . Ow . I got a bad feeling about this . Smile , Broots . We just won the big deal of the day . [ Broots ] It 's a shed , just like the one Jarod sent us . This doesn 't make sense . It makes perfect sense . Mr. Lyle is locking himself away . Oh . That makes sense ? [ Sydney ] As a child , Mr. Lyle 's foster father ... kept him locked in a woodshed weeks at a time . We all try to preserve our childhood ... with one ritual or another . In Lyle 's case , this woodshed may be the only place ... in the whole world where he feels safe . - What does that have to do with May Lin ? - Everything . - You mean he - - I believe the word is torture . I believe the word is murder . And the Jeopardy answer is he sleeps in a shed ... just like the one he was tortured in when he was little . He stalks and kidnaps Asian women ... who he then brings to a hidden torture chamber . - Who is Mr. Lyle ? - Or what ? [ Zed ] We 're almost into the cash room , boys . - [ Beeping ] - Got it . We 're in . - [ Buzzer Sounds ] - It 's payday . Go get the cash . Go ! [ Gasps ] Smile , Shay . This is supposed to be the fun part . Come on . Let 's go . - Best thrill yet . - Yo , Zeddie ! It 's locked . Come on , Zeddie ! [ Men Shouting , Indistinct ] - [ Alarm Sounding ] - What is goin ' on here ? Aah ! You know , it 's amazing what you can do with a pair of wire cutters ... and a garage door opener . - Take these cuffs off now ! - That wouldn 't be any fun . Where 's the thrill in that ? Speaking of which , I got a surprise foryou . - Just ... don 't go away . - [ Yells ] Here . Go to your mom . She 's worried about you . Now , go . What the hell are you doing ? I 'm giving you something that you didn 't give Tony - a chance . Slim , but a chance . - What 's going on , " J " ? - The ultimate thrill . The ultimate test . Or should I say , the ultimate splat ? Wow . This cord is so old . I don 't - I don 't know if it 's gonna make it through another jump . Oh , well , like you say - [ Imitating Zed ] " It 's time to do battle with the beast of the gods . " - Pull me up , " J , " now ! - Oh , can you feel it ? Can you feel the fear ? That 's your ticket to the ultimate thrill . Yeah ! Get me down from here ! Did you give Tony Goltz that chance ? He trusted you . He trusted you to find the father that he 'd been searching for . He found out you lied to him , that you were just using him , turning him into a thief . Tony was gutsy ... but stupid . He was going to turn you into the police ... so you tied him to a faulty bungee cord and you tossed him to his death . Only he didn 't die , did he ? Now he 's lying in a hospital bed trapped inside his own body ... and he may never again experience another thrill . But then again , neither will you . No . No . No . - No . No ! - Ready , set - Okay ! Okay ! I did it ! I knew Tony was gonna go to the police . Now get me down from here ! You 'd better relax , Zed . - Come on . You feel it ? - Yeah , well - You feel the danger ? That 's your passage to the other side , remember ? - No ! - Enjoy your journey . - No ! - Oh , like you said - You 've got to taste death to experience life . [ Yelling ] I guess this old cord had one more jump in it after all . Get me out ofhere ! It 's a beautiful day in the neighborhood . What ? Jarod attend a Monty Hall garage sale ? Mr. Lyle , you seem so , um - Relaxed ? Yeah , I just came in from the mountains . I heard you had a lead on Jarod . No , all of this ... was a dead end . Didn 't even shed any light on his personality , Syd ? No . Not on his . Oh , well . Um , nothing personal , but you three look terrible . You should take a break , rejuvenate ... get into the great outdoors , relieve some ofthat stress . God knows it makes me feel so alive . # [ Whistling ] [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - I 'm gonna throw up . - What ? One of us has to stop him , Miss Parker . - I was too late for May Lin . - I 'll keep my eyes open . Count on it . Jarod , we took a hell of a risk breaking into Lyle 's apartment . Sometimes , the risks we take are worth it . Well , I 'll see you next time on " The Feud . "

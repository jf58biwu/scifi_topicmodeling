 All right , class , our next stop is the Inuit canoe , which was once used to hunt whales in the Arctic . Aw , man . We saw this in third grade . Miss Baker ? What 's in there ? I know , Miss Baker , I know . It 's the treasures of Akenubis exhibit . And can you tell us who Akenubis was ? A pharaoh ? Close . He was a high priest in ancient Egypt . They recently found his tomb , which was full of wonderful things . Can we go in ? Well , perhaps we can arrange a special trip after it opens . Let 's all go see that whaling canoe . Cool museum , huh ? Let 's go . Let 's not . You coming ? Come on , Hassan , I need your help . I 'll be right back . Quick , this way ! Over here . That was close . Whoa ! What 's this ? It 's just a cat . A mummy of a cat . Think it bites ? Here , kitty , kitty . Let 's get out of here ! What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * * Good morning , Chicago . It 's 6 : 30 in the morning in the Windy City ... All right . All right . You can 't believe everything you read in the newspaper . that 's what my daddy told me , anyway . But he was talking about today 's paper . Coming . What if you got tomorrow 's paper a day early ? Oh , surprise . You 'd have to believe that , wouldn 't you ? Wouldn 't you ? " Curse of the mummy ? " Right , curse of the mummy . Come on , it 's a publicity stunt . At the Museum of Natural History ? Hey , museums need money . It 's called show business . This is the biggest exhibit they 've had since King Tut . You don 't think they 're gonna milk it for every drachma ? You got Akenubis T-shirts , Akenubis tote bags , Akenubis breath mints , Ak ... Breath mints ? Look , you got the mummy , that is good . You got the curse , that 's even better . Am I right , Gare ? Gare ? " The gala opening of " the Treasures of Akenubis exhibit " turned from glamour to gore " last night when archaeologist Trevor Bradford was struck " in the head by an ornamental sculpture that broke free of its mooring . " The guy gets his head knocked off . That doesn 't sound like a stunt to me . Well , you 've got to stop it , Gary . How ? It 's the hottest ticket in town . The only way to crash that party is you give a million bucks to the museum , or you 're one of the Egyptian delegation . Thank you , Chuck . What 'd I say ? What 'd he say ? I feel ridiculous . Hey , you 're the one who said your grandmother had Egyptian blood on her side . No , I said she went to Egypt and had her picture taken in front of the pyramids . Step right this way . Thank you . Batter up . Good evening . Welcome to the museum . This is the Princess Effendi of the royal family Qatar and Khartoum . Great . Invitations , please . I don 't think you understand . This is the princess . She still needs an invitation . Listen , this is kind of embarrassing , but , uh , she lost her invitation . I mean , she has a tendency to do that . I 'm sorry , sir , our orders are clear : No invitation , no admittance . Listen , let me tell you something . You 're making a mistake . This is the princess ... This is an outrage . I have never seen such an insult to Egypt in my life . Do you not know the Princess Effendi ? She doesn 't have an ... She does not need an invitation . She is known throughout the Middle East as the blind princess . If that is not invitation enough , then I would be honored to have her and her escort enter as my guests . Okay , Mr. Bishara . I 'm sorry , miss . We understand . Tell me , Your Highness , how is it that our families have never met before ? We , um , don 't get out much . * * Why did you help us , Ali ? We both know I 'm no princess . Oh , on the contrary , you are , my dear . Maybe not an Egyptian princess . My friend Gary , um , had to be here tonight , and this is his idea . Most ingenious , too . Resourcefulness plays a big part in my business . Let 's just say I 'm a great admirer of ingenuity . And of beauty . MAN Good evening . I 'm Michael Lawson , museum director . And it 's my great pleasure to introduce the man who made this evening and this exhibit possible , archaeologist Trevor Bradford . Good evening . It 's been a long and arduous journey from the Nile Delta to Chicago , but tonight , I feel it 's all been worth it . With the discovery of the tomb of Akenubis , the world has become a much richer place . Excuse me , sir . Sammi Awad from the University of Chicago . Can you tell us the difference between what you 're doing and grave robbing , which I believe is a federal offense in this country ? Young lady , this exhibit benefits the entire world . So , why do you have a percentage of catalog sales ? Hey , look out ! Get down ! What 's going on ? What 's happening ? Hey , get out of there . Ooh , roses . Let me see . Let me see . Hey ! Ooh , what do we got here ? " My dearest Marissa , " I expected to see rare and beautiful things last night , but none so rare and beautiful as you . " Is he kidding ? Just keep reading . " I return to Egypt soon . " I must see you again . Signed ... " Ali Bishara . That can 't be his real name . No one has a name like that . That 's his real name , Chuck . He 's an art dealer , an expert in Egyptian antiquities , and he 's got offices on three continents . Yeah ? Mm-hmm . Sounds like he writes Harlequin romances . Oh , stop . I ... " Fire at the Natural History Museum . Akenubis opening postponed again . " Oh , no . Didn 't we just go through this ? It sounds to me like somebody wants to delay the opening of that exhibit . Who ? For starters , how about that woman from the University of Chicago ? Yes , bring them in . Oh . Oh , I thought you were one of the librarians . I have some books on call . Uh , no . Uh ... I 'm Gary Hobson . I saw you at the-the museum last night , didn 't I ? You saved Trevor Bradford , didn 't you ? Yeah . You a ... Egyptologist . One month short of my Ph. D. And you ? Me ? Well , I , uh , I , uh , run a bar . But , uh , well , I 'm here because I , uh , I don 't want anything to happen at the exhibit . What do you mean ? What I mean is I don 't want to see anything happen to it . You know , like , uh , say it might catch on fire . What are you , a cop ? Me ? No , I 'm not a cop . I ... Sit down , Mr. Hobson . Just because I 'm politically active does not make me an arsonist . Well ... I have devoted my life to Egyptian antiquities . Well , no ... And I 'm not planning to throw away my career in some act of obscene vandalism . What makes you think somebody wants to destroy this exhibit ? Well , I ... Let 's just say I 've got feelings about these kind of things . Like last night when you saved Trevor Bradford ? Well , yeah , something like ... I think I 've bothered you enough . Wait . You 're really serious about that ? Well , yes , I am . Hm . The ancient Egyptians believed in something called ka - a person 's spirit double . The immortal soul , if you will . They believed a dead person 's ka could communicate with the living . Sometimes , late at night , alone in here , I feel like the ka of some ancient Egyptian is trying to speak to me . I feel like there are mysteries out there that even science can 't explain . Boy , lady , you can say that again . Wait . You really believe someone is going to set fire to the exhibit ? Uh , yes , I do . Tonight . Well , then we should do something about it , shouldn 't we ? Well , I-I think that we probably sh ... What do you mean , " we " ? How did you know this door was going to be unlocked ? Uh , must have been the ka or something . This way . It can 't be ! Oh , my God ... What 's all this ? You know this guy ? Hassan Rajid , my foreman . We caught him setting fire to the exhibit . Setting fire to my treasures ? ! Your treasures ? I was the one who discovered them , not you . If it wasn 't for me , you would still be digging in the desert . Is that why you tried to kill him last night ? What ? ! I saw him standing by the cables right after the accident . Hassan ! Oh , are you all right ? Come on , let 's go . Oh ... You 're late . The cat , it ... What about the cat ? It came alive . My dear Hassan , you 're letting your peasant imagination run away with you . It was coming at me , Ali , I swear ! Yes . But you 're here now , all in one piece , are you not ? Yes . Yes . And the emeralds ? You 've done well , my friend . Don 't worry , it 's all there . And now , adieu . WOMAN Good morning , Chicago , and here 's the extended forecast for today and tomorrow . Dry and cool , with highs in the 40 's and lower 50 's , lows in the 20 's and lower 30 's . Friday , a chance of rain , highs in the ... " Mysterious death of ... " Hassan ! I thought that guy Hassan popped you in the museum . What do you care whether he 's dead or not ? Hey , I 'm telling you , Gare , it 's a publicity stunt . Where 's Marissa ? Oh , Our Lady of the Nile is presently engaged . With who ? With , uh , Ali what 's his name . Whom else ? Ali , I-I really should be getting back to work . You know , in my country , you wouldn 't have to pretend to be a princess , you could live like one . Well , I guess I was just born in the wrong place . No need to stay there . You could ... start a new life ... in a new country , with me . Uh ... Ali , um ... I 'm not quite sure what you 're saying . I think you are sure . I think you know exactly what I 'm saying . So ... what do you say , my dear ? Will you come with me ? A - Ali , it 's all happening so fast . I ... Sometimes life is like that . You must seize the moment . Absolutely right . In that case , my answer 's gonna ... Ali . I need to talk to you . Now , Ali . Will you excuse me , my dear ? Uh , sure . Ali . The jewels , I need them . You must be joking . Take your money - I don 't want it . Hassan ! Look at me , Ali ! It 's the curse ! What curse ? This . It 's a curse , I tell you . Where did you get that ? The cat . You idiot ! I told you to only take the eyes ! Give them to me , Ali ! Hey ! Hassan ? You all right ? The curse ... Huh ? Get away ! Hey ! I didn 't see him ! Man , you see that ? He came out of nowhere . Buddy , you okay ? Somebody call an ambulance ! Diane , got a minute ? I am so late for my OB appointment . Yeah , there 's a patient I want you to see when you got time - uh , Egyptian , strange rash . Yeah , great , I-I 'll catch you later . How is he ? Well , he , uh , he 's in surgery . What do you , uh , what do you make of that ? Where 'd you get it ? It fell out of Hassan 's hand in the ambulance . He kept mumbling something about a curse . It 's a scarab . An amulet in the shape of a dung beetle . Oh , that 's very nice . Beetles were a symbol of rebirth to the Egyptians . Very significant . What do you make of the hieroglyphics ? It 's an inscription . They were often commemorative and historical . Um ... I 'd love a shot at translating this . Is it okay ? You can have it . I 've got enough curses in my life right now . Okay . Mr. Hobson , um , your friend is out of surgery . He 's stable , but , um , he 's got a high fever and an unusual rash . Do you know anything about that ? No . Okay , well , you can wait if you want , but he 's not gonna be seeing anybody until that fever goes down . Ah ... What is with this guy ? I mean , to you , air freshener would have the same effect , right ? Marissa ? Hello ? You and Gary could run the place without me , right ? Uh ... wh-what are you talking about ? Well , Ali asked me to go to Egypt with him . Ali ? You 've known Ali for ten minutes . Well , maybe that 's enough . No , I don 't think that 's enough . Something very strange is going on here . Why ? You don 't think someone could fall in love with me ? No , it 's not that . I 'm blind , Chuck - it doesn 't make me any less of a person than you or anybody else . I never said anything about that . Ali makes me feel like a woman . Like ... an attractive woman , and I don 't get to feel that way very often . What are you saying , I don 't make you feel like an attractive woman ? Marissa . Oh , come on , Chuck , that 's not what ... Ali ! Ali ! Well , hello ! We ... Nice to meet you . I 'm Chuck Fishman - I work with Marissa over here . It 's a pleasure . So , uh , I 'll just be leaving you two alone . How are you , my dear ? A - Ali , what 's wrong ? You 're breathing very hard , and your hands , they 're clammy . Wha ... ? Is everything ... ? Just the excitement of seeing you again . Oh . Listen , uh ... time is running short . I may have to return to Egypt sooner than expected . Sooner ? How much sooner ? A day or two , no more . Have you thought about my proposition any further ? Um ... Ali , I-I still don 't know . Then perhaps ... these will help persuade you . They feel like earrings . Emerald earrings . They belonged to my mother . Now they 're yours . I - I couldn 't . Shh . Put them on . As long as you wear these , Marissa , I know that there 's a chance that you will come with me . Yes . Yes , I will . I will come with you . You 've made me very happy . Promise me something . Promise me you will always wear them . Of course , Ali . I 'll never take them off . Excellent . Coffee ? Oh , no , thanks . Okay , I 've got the first line of the inscription . " To all who enter here , may you show proper respect and ... " uh , something . Something ? It 's not like reading French , you know . No . " To all who enter here ... " What does that mean ? To all who enter where ? Perhaps a temple . Attention : The library will be closing in 15 minutes . How about a tomb ? Oh . You think this is from the exhibit ? Considering Hassan 's sterling personality , I think that 's a great possibility , yeah . Yeah , yeah . What is that ? It 's a catalog for the museum show . Voila . That 's a cat . The Egyptians buried all kinds of animal mummies . Um , cats , owls , falcons ... And check out the necklace . Are you telling me that you think that this is the same as that ? Mm-hmm . Sure looks like it . We better get this back to the museum then . Oh , let me finish translating first . Okay . Help me , please . I need a doctor . Good morning , Chicago . It 's 6 : 30 a. m . in the Windy City , and traffic is already bumping ' and grindin ' . " Epidemic linked to the mummy exhibit . " Health officials shut down " the Natural History Museum yesterday , " and seized artifacts from its mummy exhibit " to investigate a possible link to a mysterious epidemic affecting museum visitors and employees . " Epidemic ? Epidemic . Pain Management call 9340 . What do you think ? He 's sick as a dog . And look at this rash . The pustules , they 're like welts . I haven 't seen that before . How 's the other patient ? We 're having a hard time keeping him stabilized . He keeps jumping up to 105 . I 'll tell the lab to put a rush on this . This is something simple , right ? Probably . An epidemic ? How do you stop an epidemic ? I have no idea . Oh , by the way , Marissa 's going to Egypt . Yeah . She 's what ? ! Ali popped the question . Well , sort of . Ali Ba ... What do you mean sort of ? He asked her to go to Egypt with him . And she said yes ? All I know is , she 's wearing his mama 's earrings . Emeralds . Wait a second . She hardly even knows that guy . That 's what I told her . That guy 's , that guy 's old enough to be her father . She doesn 't know that . Guys , great news . They got it all wrong . They got what wrong ? Who got what wrong ? Trevor Bradford at the museum . This exhibit is not the treasures of Akenubis . It 's not ? Exactly as I suspected . Well , who are you ? Chuck Fishman , Gary 's partner . Oh . Sammi Awad . It 's a pleasure . Who got what wrong ? Oh . Akenubis was a priest who served a god - a goddess , actually - called Bastet . Mm ... Yes , here it is . Here , Look . That 's still a cat . Well , Bastet could take many forms - lioness , leopard , house cat . The Egyptians built many shrines to her , especially in Bubastis , where this tomb was found . Now , if they could build shrines , why not a tomb ? Are you telling me that that mummy was some special cat . You see , they believe she was a direct descendant of Bastet . She had special powers . What kind of powers ? She could see the future . Ah , a clairvoyant kitty . Well , she helped Akenubis see the future , but the people believed that the power came from her . Something strange is going on here , Gare . No . Don 't you see ? The exhibit has it backwards . The priest wasn 't buried with his cat . The cat was buried with her priest . Oh . What do you mean ? Wait a second . Wait , wait just a second . We 've got other problems , don 't we ? Not more ka ? That 's right , we - that 's right , we 've got more ka problems to deal with , don 't we ? Ka ? Ka . Oh , right , more ka . See , you see , I 'm getting the feeling that uh , people are gonna get sick , real sick - epidemic , sick - you understand ? Oh . That is so weird . You know , because Bastet was the protector against contagion and disease . And there is this inscription - the inscription said that if anyone plunders the tomb , there 's going to be a terrible plague . A plague ? You mean , like as in Passover plague ? That 's all it said , a plague . How bad ? They got counts that suggest everything from toxoplasmosis to viral pneumonitis . White cell counts dropping below 200 , bronchoscopy shows pulmonary lesions proliferating in both lungs . That 's bad . Whatever the exact pathogen is , both patients are clearly incubating it . How infectious is it ? Well , there 's no way of telling , not without an exact diagnosis . And you don 't have one ? Oh , not even close . All right , I don 't want to jump the gun , Diane , but don 't you think we should call the Health Department ? I mean , you 're the expert on infectious diseases , and you 've never seen this before . Exactly what are we dealing with ? The plague ? She 's nuts . She wants to destroy the exhibit . That 's not true . Look , look , look , what , what what if it 's possible that the exhibit is contaminated ? Now , you 'd at least have to check into it before you let the people in to see it , right ? Surely you don 't expect me to delay the opening any further based on some theory . Hear , hear . All right . Well , just suppose that uh , that there were forces at work that were , were unexplainable . What forces ? Well ... Dr. Lawson , you have an entire museum devoted to cultures and beliefs different than your own . Are you willing to say that you 're the only one who knows the truth ? Well , I ... Michael , they should both be committed . Well , of course the museum can always be shut down and quarantined . I 'm a scientist by training , Mr. Hobson . If you want me to even think about postponement , I need proof of a health risk involved . Quantifiable proof . Well , nice of you to drop by , Princess . I overslept . I think I want some tea . Are you okay ? I think I 'm coming down with something . I don 't think you 're coming down with something , I think , I think you 've got something ... Marissa ! Hey , fellas ! Chuck ? Ah , hey . She just collapsed . She was burning up with fever . What 'd the doctors say ? They didn 't say anything . They wouldn 't even let me see her . So far we haven 't been able to isolate any viral or bacterial agents . Three patients ? Right . And they haven 't responded to treatment ? Not broadspectrum antibiotics , not vancomycin ... I started them on acyclovir on the outside chance this is some form of herpetic infection . I mean , without knowing the pathogen , Phillip , there 's not much more we can do . All right , the first two are Egyptian nationalists . Any connection to her ? Not that we know of . Uh , excuse me . She was dating one of them . And you are ? Gary Hobson . He brought in the first patient . Um , what do you know about this ? Well , I know that the three patients you have here were all at the party for the new exhibit at the museum . And you think there 's some sort of link ? Well , that , that 's a possibility . I , I , I think maybe that something was brought over from Egypt , something contagious . Maybe in the artifacts themselves . Diane ? If it wasn 't for my work with Lupita , I 'd say it was crazy , too . Lupita ? Yeah . A frozen uh , 500-year-old Peruvian mummy . I was granted the opportunity to examine her on the outside chance , uh , she was carrying a disease we know nothing about . Well , then , then you , then you would agree that it is a possibility ... My results were inconclusive . You 're talking about thousands of years here . Well , right , but it , but if it 's a possibility , then you 've gotta follow that , because you don 't have any other leads here , and ... Listen , this , this is a very dear friend of mine in here , and I don 't want her to die . Well , neither do we . Oh , well , another thing . Uh ... The , uh ... Since we 're talking about life and death , you should know the mummy exhibit , uh may be cursed . Cursed ? Ali , where are you ? Ali , no ! Ali . Gare . Gary . How was she ? Huh ? Is she gonna be okay ? What did they say ? Everything was fine until I brought up the , uh , curse . I tried to explain everything to them , but they didn 't seem to-to want to listen . Maybe she needs more than medical science . What do you mean ? Well , maybe we need to lift the curse . The inscription said that , uh , there 'd be a plague if something was plundered . Yeah , but we already returned the scarab . Well , maybe there 's something else . Well , like what ? Oh . What 's wrong with you ? I don 't know . I - I don 't feel good at all . I just ... Mm . Oh . I 'll-I 'll be all right . I hope . N - Not now . Stop it . Not now . Get down . Get down . You can 't have these . They 're not yours , they 're Marissa 's . Where did she get these ? She got them from her , uh , Egypt friend , Ali . And where did he get it ? He got them from his mother . Well , not unless his mother was a cat . What ? Look at those . You mean he didn 't get them from his mother ? No . Those are the mummy 's . Then where did Ali get them ? Wait a second . Hassan steals them from the exhibit , he gives them to Ali . Ali stashes them on Marissa . She doesn 't know it , but she 's smuggling jewels into Egypt . Poor Marissa . Can 't she find a normal guy ? Well , if these are the cat 's eyes , and there 's anything to this curse , that 's got to be one very angry mummy . Angry mummy ? Ah , come on , that 's insane . Gary . I wouldn 't laugh if I were you . Listen to me now . Marissa 's sick and you 're sick . If there 's any truth to all this , we got to find out . I mean , it 's no crazier than any of the other things that goes on around here , if you know what I mean . Yeah , you 're right . Let 's go . W - Wait a second . You 're going to the hospital . No , no , I 'm going with you . Doctors don 't know what 's going on . You said so yourself . Between modern medical science and a 3,000-year-old curse , I - I put my money on the curse anytime . Let 's go . Feeling better already . I have something . You 're not gonna like it . I don 't like it , but ... Well , wh-why don 't you just tell me ? I have been back through every textbook I have , every database . I can tell you what it isn 't , for sure . It 's not rubella , varicella , mumps ... Just tell me , Diane . I think it 's smallpox . What ? A mutant strain , possibly . Diane , smallpox has been eradicated from this planet , I mean , for 20 years . It tracks , Phillip . The ancient Egyptians carried smallpox . The-the mummy of Ramses V even shows scars . We know the virus is extremely stable . It 's been documented to survive months , even years , outside the human body , in-in bales of cotton , in dust . I mean , put it into a virtually airtight environment , who knows how long it can lie dormant , or mutate . All right , call Atlanta . I already did . The CDC 's sending a team on the next plane . Well , we 'll have to get those patients in isolation . That 's gonna be a real problem . The first two are missing . What do you mean missing ? They 're not in their beds . They 're gone . All right , here it is . Glass . Give her the other ones . Hmm ? Oh . All right . Barely hanging on . GARY Come on , come on . Hey , come on , Chuck ! This isn 't happening . Hassan ? What are you doing here ? He was trying to stop me . Stop you from what ? From taking the emeralds . A nurse at the hospital told me they gave them to you , so I followed you here . Now , please , hand them over . I have a plane to catch . No , I can 't do that . If I do that , a friend of mine will die . It can 't be helped . Uh-uh . No . As you wish . Here . I can 't let you die , too . Very sensible . Ali , no . Wait ! The curse ! Get back ! The curse , Ali ! No ! No ... ! Where 'd they go ? Look . How bizarre . All right , clear . Clear . Anything ? No . All right , again . Clear . 260 , clear ! Ace and saline . Again . Clear . 300 . 300 , clear . No spontaneous rhythm . Prep atropine . Again . Clear . I 've got her prepped right here . Clear . Epi 's in . Again . Clear . Clear . Atropine in . Charge up . Okay , we got a pulse . Good work , people . Systolic at 90 . Gare . Gare ! Hey . I think , uh , I think my rash is gone . I feel better . Huh ? And so is your fever . Oh , good . Well , now what ? She stabilized . Yeah , from out of nowhere . You didn 't change treatments ? She stopped breathing , we brought her back , and within minutes , her fever dropped . Even her rash looks better . Maybe the amphotericin kicked in . Maybe . " Mummy draws cat-astrophic crowd . " Gare ! Come on ! Wow , they rearranged the whole exhibit . The cat gets top billing now . The museum offered Sammi a position in the archaeology department . That 's great . Are you all right ? Do you want to sit down , rest ? I 'm fine . Yeah ? Hey , the doctor told you you got to take it easy . I know what the doctor said . I 'm fine . Yeah , but you just got to rest sometime . Well , you know , it was just , um , one of those freak things . I don 't know . I think she should lie down . I 'm fine . Yeah , come on . Let 's go . Okay . Diane . Watters tells me you 're writing a journal article about what happened . Yeah . If nothing else , I 'm gonna try to convince Atlanta not to destroy their stock of smallpox vaccine . You realize there 's only four places in the world that still store it ? I mean , what if it turns out to be real next time ? Well , there 's a cheery thought . What do you think it was , anyway ? I don 't know . I 'd like to talk to that Gary Hobson . He seemed to know more than he let on . Are you kidding ? That guy 's nuts . He 's certifiable . Yeah , I suppose you 're right . Well , it 's best you forget the guy . Yeah . You deserve better than Ali . Yeah , well , I 'd still like to know what happened to the guy . So would a lot of people . Yeah . So would the hospital , Egyptian security , the police . Yeah , I just don 't understand how someone could vanish into thin air like that . Well , important thing is that we got you back . Yeah , and from now on , I 'm screening all of your dates . Excuse me a minute . Yeah , sure . Maybe you can 't believe everything you read . But how about everything you see ? Or do the eyes play tricks sometimes ? Do we only see what we want to see ? I 'd tell you what I think , but the cat 's got my tongue .

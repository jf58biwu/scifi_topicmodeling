 You keep your workstation so clean . - It 's next to godliness . - Godliness ... I reviewed your flight plan . Not one error in a million keystrokes . Phenomenal . It 's right that someone like you is taking us to Titan . Has the committee approved the mission ? There 's talk of delay . You shouldn 't listen to talk . You leave in a week . You 've got a substance test . If you have to take a substance test , report to the testing centre . Jerome . Never shy . Pisses on command . - A beautiful piece of equipment . - You tell me every time I 'm here . I see a great many in my job . Yours happens to be exceptional . why didn 't my folks order one like that for me ? - Have I ever told you about my son ? - No . Remind me to , sometime . So you 're about to go up . One week left . Please tell me you 're the least bit excited . I 'll tell you at the end of the week . congratulations , Jerome . Thank you . How many launches are there in a day ? A dozen ? - Sometimes more . - Only you watch every one of them . If you 're going to pretend like you don 't care , don 't look up . The most unremarkable of events . Jerome Morrow , Navigator 1st class , is about to embark on a one-year manned mission to Titan , the 14th moon of Saturn . This highly prestigious assignment was guaranteed Jerome at birth . He has all the gifts required . A genetic quotient second to none . There 's nothing remarkable about the progress of Jerome Morrow . Ex cept that I am not Jerome Morrow . I was conceived in the Riviera . Not the French Riviera . The Detroit variety . They used to say that a love child has a greater chance of happiness . They don 't say that any more . I don 't know why my mother trusted God rather than her local geneticist . Ten fingers , ten toes , that 's all that used to matter ... Not now . Only seconds old , the ex act time and cause of my death was known . Neurological condition , 60 % , manic depression , 42 % probability . Attention deficit disorder , 89 % probability . Heart disorder 99 % probability . Early fatal potential . - Life expectancy : 30.2 years . - 30 years ? - The name for the certificate ? - Vincent Anton . That 's a good name . I know he 'll do something . You 'll do something . I quickly thought of myself as others did. chronically ill . Every skinned knee and runny nose was treated as a fatal threat . The insurance won 't cover it . If he fell ... There 's nothing I can do . Like most other parents then , they wanted their next child to be conceived in what has become the natural way . Your extracted eggs , Marie , have been fertilized with Antonio 's sperm . we have screened two healthy boys and two very healthy girls . without predispositions to any inheritable diseases . Let 's select the most compatible candidate. what gender do you want ? we would want Vincent to have a brother to play with . You have specified hazel eyes , dark hair and ... fair skin . I 've eradicated prejudicial conditions : Premature baldness , alcoholism , propensity for violence , obesity . we didn 't want ... Diseases , yes , but ... we would like to leave a few things to chance . Give your child the best start. we have enough imperfection built-in . Your child doesn 't need any additional burdens . It 's still you . Simply the best of you . You could conceive naturally 1,000 times and never get such a result . That 's how Anton came to be . A son worthy of my father 's name . - I 'm proud of you , son . - See how much he 's grown . when we played blood brothers - - I understood my blood was very different from Anton 's . I 'd need a lot more than a drop if I was going to get anywhere . we played chicken . when our parents weren 't watching we 'd swim as far out as we dared and see who 'd turn back first . come on , you coward ! Of course it was always me . Anton was the stronger swimmer and had no ex cuse to fail . 300 million , 350 million , 400 million . Maybe it was my love of the planets or just my dislike for this one , but for as long as I remember I 've dreamed of going into space . 750 million , 800 million , 850 million . How many astronauts are there ? I bet I could be one if I wanted . Don 't eat that . It 's Pluto . My goals didn 't change a lot . Much to my parents ' dismay . Vincent ... Be realistic. with a heart condition like yours ... - There 's a chance my heart 's fine . - One chance in 100 . - I 'll take it . - They won 't . You 've got to understand something . You 'll only get inside a spaceship to clean it . He was right . I lied on my resumé , but my real resumé was my cells . why waste money on training me when there are 1 , 000 other applicants with a cleaner profile ? It is illegal to discriminate . " Genoism " , it 's called . But no one takes the law seriously . If you refuse to tell , they take a sample from a door handle or a handshake . Even the saliva on your application form . A legal drug test can become an illegal peek at your future in the company . Sure you want to do this ? You know you 're going to lose . It was the last time we swam together . Out into the open sea . Knowing each stroke out was one we 'd have to make back . But something was different . Every time Anton tried to pull away he found me right beside him . Until finally the impossible happened . Vincent ! For once in our lives Anton was not as strong as he believed and I was not as weak . That made everything else possible . Like others in my situation I moved around getting work where I could . I must 've cleaned half the toilets in the state . The underclass wasn 't determined by social status or skin colour now . - welcome to Gattaca , gentlemen . - Today discrimination is a science . There 's your cleaning material . Start here and clean to the back . I want to see my smiling face on that floor . Dreaming of space , Your Majesty ? come here . Start by cleaning this space . I knew how far away I was from my goal when I stood right beside it . - Don 't clean the glass too well . - what do you mean ? You might get ideas . But if the glass is clean , it 'll be easier to see me on the other side . I knew it was just brave talk . No matter how much I studied , the best test score in the world needs a blood test to match it . I had to go to extreme measures . The man who came didn 't ex actly advertise in the Yellow Pages . Stand straight . - How did you hear about me ? - People . Any distinguishing marks ? Tattoos , scars , birth marks ? No . Are you serious about this ? I hope you 're not wasting my time . - I 'd give 100 % . - That 'll get you halfway there . That 's an old edition , but I know it all by heart . - The commitment is binding . - You have somebody in mind ? For the genetic elite , success is attainable , but not guaranteed . There is no gene for fate . And when a member of the elite falls on hard times their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity . One man 's loss is another 's gain . He 's got impeccable credentials . An unbelievable expiration date . He 'll practically live forever . His IQ is off the register . Better than 20 / 20 vision . Strong heart . He could run through a wall . If he could still run . He was a big-time swimming star . You could go anywhere with this guy 's DNA tucked under your arm . - You look so right together . - we don 't look anything alike . Nobody looks at photos today . christ , you could have my face . - How do I explain the accident ? - It happened out of the country . No one knows he broke his back . He 's still a fully productive citizen . - Just fill in his last year . - You 're a foreigner . They don 't care where you were born . Blood has no nationality . As long as it 's got what they want , it 's the only passport you 'll need . - who lives up there ? - well , I certainly don 't . The process of becoming him began . Myopia is one of the most obvious signs of a disadvantaged birth . - Isn 't there another way ? - Surgery will leave scars . It 's contact lenses or a white cane . - Besides , the colour doesn 't match . - He 's right . My eyes are prettier . I take 25 % of all you make . If it fails , all this equipment must be returned in seven days . - And you lose your deposit . - wait ! You said 20 % . - 20 % . - It 's not negotiable . - I guess that 's it . - No . There 's still the height . How tall were you before the accident ? - His profile says he 's 6 ' 1 " . - I can wear lifts . Even with lifts you 're not that tall . So what ? No ... - we never discussed that . - I thought you were serious . I am . I 'm not doing that . No . Now Jerome knew I was committed . I endured the pain by reminding myself that when I did stand up - - I 'd be ex actly two inches closer to the stars . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Do you want to go dancing ? You had to be a right-hander . No one orders southpaws any more . Jerome Morrow . It 's a nice name . - It 's my name . - I can 't be you without it . what makes you think you can be me at all ? Look at this . - Look at it . - It 's nice . - Is it real ? - Are you colour-blind ? It 's silver . Jerome Morrow was never meant to be one step down on the podium . with all I had going for me , I was still second best . Me ! So how do you expect to pull it off ? I don 't know , exactly . Your signature needs work . Soon we were put to the test . Jerome had the genes to get into Gattaca , but not the desire . - Do you really want to be in there ? - Not in there . Up there . - what 's up there ? - That 's want I want to see , Jerome . call me Eugene . My middle name . If you 're going to be Jerome , you better start getting used to it . - I must go. where 's my sample ? - In the fridge . Door on the left . - which pouch ? - Any of them . - You think I should test it ? - If you like . - what 's wrong with the machine ? - You 've been drinking again ! - I haven 't . - christ , it 's eight in the morning ! This is no joke . My interview is in an hour ! - There 's more vodka than piss ! - I had half a glass to celebrate . - Friday 's will be all right . - There 's only wednesday left . That 's the one . It 's not too late to back out . This is the last day you will be you and I will be me . well ? - congratulations . - what about the interview ? That was it . I got it . Of course you got it . Each day I would dispose of all my loose skin , nails and hair . To limit how much of my In - Valid self I 'd leave in the Valid world . Eugene prepared samples of his body matter so I 'd pass for him . Urine for the substance tests . Blood for the security checks and vials filled with other traces . Eugene gave me his identity while I paid the rent and kept him in the style to which he 'd become accustomed . Eugene had never been called " utero " , " faith birth " , " In-valid " . As a " Valid " , he suffered under the burden of perfection . I was now a member of a new and detested segment of society . One of those who won 't accept their fate . A " borrowed ladder " . Or ... a " de-gene-erate " . In the guise of Jerome Morrow I 've risen quickly in Gattaca . Only one of the mission directors has come close to exposing me . He may have more success exposing me in death than he did in life . I think we can rule out suicide . Thank you . This will take a while . we may have to push things back . Irene , I want you to assist the investigators . - That would put me behind . - I appreciate your sacrifice . - I won 't lose my place in line ? - Your place is assured . So kindly inform the authorities we will cooperate in any way , although we can 't tolerate a major disruption . - Thank you , Irene . - Thank you , Director . - How will this affect the mission ? - we 'll go ahead as planned . The launch can only be this week . Tragic though this event may be , it hasn 't stopped the planets turning . - what happened ? - I 'm going up . - End of the week . - That soon ? - what about the mission director ? - He 's dead . Are you serious ? They found him beaten so badly they had to check his name tag . You are serious . There 's nothing between us and ignition . I 'm going up . - The man was murdered ? - I didn 't do it . - It 'll be crawling with Hoovers . - I 'll handle the J. Edgars . what if they do find something ? I 'll be out of their jurisdiction . we have to get drunk immediately . Good evening , gentlemen . I hear you 're leaving us , Mr. Morrow . - we 're going to miss you . - You 've opened the wine , I hope ? Pour yourself a glass , cavendish . How old is the specimen ? - I kissed him five minutes ago . - I 'll see what I can do . - You want the full sequence ? - Yes . Good luck . - 9.3 . Quite a catch . - Yes . Quite a catch . God , I 've told cavendish ... This has only been open five minutes ! wine needs to breathe . They say being weightless is the closest thing to being in the womb . I can 't believe you pulled this off . They 're sending you up there . Up there ! You , of all people . You 'll be alone in that room for a year . - It 's bigger than your tin can . - what are you going to do ? I have my books . I travel in my head . I wish you had company . Someone you didn 't have to pay for . - I wouldn 't have it any other way . - what are you going to do ? I 'm going to finish this . what 's Titan like this time of year ? what 's Titan like ? Titan is exactly like this . The cloud around it is so thick , no one can tell what 's underneath . - Maybe there 's nothing there . - There 's something there . - You should be going , not me . - why is that ? Because up there your legs wouldn 't matter . I 'm scared of heights . I 'm sorry . Do you want this ? I 'll save some for you , shall I ? I 'm so sorry . I 'm really , really sorry . Don 't give me a hard time . Give me a break . - come on ! Help ! - I 'm sorry . I wasn 't drunk when I walked in front of that car . I stepped right out in front of it . I 'd never been more sober , ever . - Go to sleep . - I couldn 't even get that right . If at first you don 't succeed , try , try again . Go to sleep . I 'm proud of you , Vincent . You must be drunk to call me Vincent . - How much do you need ? - 20 minutes . You can go . It 's all right , Irene . You 're excused . we found our man . It 's the only specimen we can 't account for . - Every 10 years things go our way . - Tell me about the eyelash . An unregistered In-Valid . A janitor . He disappeared a few years back . - The specimen could be from then . - Nothing lies around here for long . would a janitor come back after so long to kill a man he never knew ? His profile suggests he 's violent . It also suggests he 's a sick man . There 's a 90 % chance he 's dead . That leaves a 10 % chance he 's still alive . The owner of the eyelash is the murderer . I 'll do a cross-check ... - He has no living relatives . - That 's a damn shame , sir . check the entry log . Alibis , grudges . I see a lot of dry eyes . The mission director was not universally loved . He was leading cutbacks in the programme . with all due respect , sir ... whatever you say . Jerome the metronome . I could play the piano by that heartbeat of his . - we have a suspect . - That is a relief. who is he ? we found an unaccounted-for specimen . Here 's his picture . - An In-Valid . - we 're still following other leads . - I 'm posting this immediately . - I 'm curious , Director . An advantage , I should imagine , in your line of work . - Your hiring practices ... - Our " recruitment philosophy " . - who do you have to be , to be here ? - we don 't take common citizens . Are they all equally excellent ? Occasionally we 've had to accept candidates with minor shortcomings . But nothing that would stop them joining the police , for example . Now , there are enough of the right kind to warrant a new standard . Bodies with minds to match . Essential , as we push out further . - Yet you still monitor performance . - To see they meet their potential . - And exceeding it ? - No one exceeds his potential . If he did , we just didn 't accurately gauge his potential right off . - All right ? - Terrific . The entry log for the past week . what about you , Irene ? Do you have an alibi ? - I was alone . - I find that hard to believe . I 'll take care of that for you , Mr. Morrow . I see I 'm not the only one who looks up every time there 's a launch . - It 's awful about the director . - Awful it didn 't happen sooner . Didn 't he threaten to cancel your mission ? Somebody did you a favour . - Do they know who I should thank ? - They found an eyelash . - Does it have a name ? - Just some In-Valid . Jerome ... I had you sequenced . I read your profile . I 'm sorry . Seems you 're everything they say you are and more . You 're engineered just like the rest of us . Not quite . " Unacceptable likelihood of heart failure . " That 's how they put it . The only trip I 'll take in space is around the sun on this satellite . If there 's anything wrong with you , I can 't see it from where I stand . If you don 't believe me ... Here . Take it . If you 're still interested , let me know . I 'm sorry . The wind caught it . Please check the latest Gattaca bulletin . Jerome . Is this the approach path we discussed ? - Absolutely , Director . - Quite right . Listen , I want what I ordered . It 's a completely different colour . No . I 'm bored of talking to you . I 'll call you back . That was about your hair dye . They 've sent me " Summer wheat " . It 's too light . " why don 't you try a change ? " we can 't use it ! - I 'll probably have to pay for it . - we can 't stay here . - The idiots I have to deal with ... ! - They think I killed the director . - what makes them think that ? - They found my eyelash . - where ? - In the corridor . Thank God it wasn 't in your eye . My picture is everywhere . I can 't turn around without seeing my face . - They 'll recognize me . They will ! - I don 't recognize you . They won 't accept one of their elite could 've suckered them for so long . No , we do as we planned . You 're Jerome Morrow , Navigator 1 st class . I 'm not Jerome Morrow . I 'm a murder suspect . what are you doing ? That 's more than a day 's worth ! - we can 't stay here . - Stop that ! Fine ... fine ! Leave if you want . But don 't take that stuff . It 's mine ! I would 've chosen a brave partner if I 'd known you 'd go belly-up on me at the last gasp . You can 't quit on me now . Do you want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself ? - They are going to find me . - You still don 't understand ... when they look at you , they don 't see you any more . Only me . Keep your lashes on your lids where they belong . How could you be so careless ? - I 'm going out . - where ? I want some fun before they nail me . - Are you sure that 's a good idea ? - You said not to change anything . - who 's going ? - I 'd say everybody . If I don 't go it 'll look suspicious . You don 't want to look suspicious , do you ? Thanks . who ordered this ? what are we doing here ? I 'm following a lead . Forgive me , but I 'm a detective . I follow leads . - why should the suspect be here ? - He 's an In-Valid . - This is where the In-Valids are . - He 's an In-Valid . He 's been in hiding all these years . You think he 'll lie down for us now ? - what do you suggest ? - Go back to the scene . Sweep the area around Gattaca . - You 're a navigator ? At Gattaca ? - That 's what it says , doesn 't it ? - It doesn 't say you 're crippled . - I hurt my leg training , you moron . How dare you question me ? what 's your number ? - Your number , you fucking flatfoot ! - what do you want ? An apology ? It gets to you that I can live your dreams . I 'm leaving this dirtball ! - You 're harassing me ! - My mistake . what 's your number ? This is a crime scene . what 's this man doing here ? - what are you doing , old man ? - My job , sir . - This is evidence . - But it 's just trash . You didn 't know ? wonderful , wasn 't it ? 12 fingers or 1 , it 's how you play . That piece can only be played with 12 . - what 's all this about ? - It 's probably nothing . No . I don 't want to give you a contaminated specimen . Get it ? Thanks . You never know where those swabs have been . I want to show you something . come on , we 'll miss it . come on. we 'll miss it . what did I tell you ? Strange . Your eyes look different . - I guess it must be the light . - Must be . Positive match . I 'm impressed . - The cup was used recently ? - Two samples , two days . He may have returned to the crime scene to get a drink of water . - Or he may still work there . - we checked all the service staff . I don 't think he cleans any more . I think he 's there in disguise . - A borrowed ladder at Gattaca ? - Far-fetched , but not impossible . He can 't be among the elite . He 's mentally and physically inferior . Maybe he is an imposter and maybe the director found out . Let 's sample every employee intravenously . we 'd close them down for days . No , take a fingertip or a urine sample . I suggest blood from the vein . I hope I 'm not out of line . It 's only a matter of time , sir . what 's with the plungers , Lamar ? You open up a blood bank ? The detectives fear my methods may have been compromised . - Goddamn ! Are you out of practice ? - Let me look at that . - It 's all right . - Luckily , we have enough . If you need any more , you can get it off his shoes . Irene . - So you didn 't do it after all ? - I guess someone beat me to it . I guess . I leave in two days . I guess you know that . But ... That 's the last . - Something 's wrong . - He 's not here . - I say we test again . - No . No more disruptions . - You have a murderer in your midst . - Your presence is more of a threat . The window for our latest launch is open for seven days every 70 years . - It 's crucial we leave on time . - This mission means a lot to you . Your late colleague opposed it . Take another look at my profile . I haven 't a violent bone in my body . My apologies . He won 't trouble you any further . This is not the only place we can look . Let 's start making the rounds . I 'm luckier than most . Not as lucky as some . - I know something about that . - what heart problem have you had ? Did you get yours broken once ? I had this crazy idea you were more interested in the murder than in me . You 're right . That 's a crazy idea . would you like to dance ? It 's funny . You work so hard to get away from a place ... And when you finally get to leave , you find a reason to stay . - A year is a long time . - Not so long . Just once around the sun . Hello , I 'm your detective for the evening . Please stay here . Don 't leave ! Am I speaking in some strange foreign language ? check lenses , dentures , napkins , cigarette butts , saliva off cups . That 's a familiar face . check him out . - I thought you wanted to dance . - where are you going ? Jerome ! - Are you insane ? - come on ! where did they go ? come on . - I can 't do that ! - You just did . Don 't touch your face . Don 't swallow. clean his teeth . Vincent ! Vincent ! who 's Vincent ? I ... Don 't say anything . Don 't say anything . what happened ? The scars on your legs ? Remember the ' 99 chrysler lebaron ? I bumped into the front fender . Looked left instead of right . - Is that the new or the old excuse ? - The old one . - You are involved with the murder . - That 's not true , Irene . Isn 't that the man from last night ? He 's nobody . He 's one of our best . He has nothing to do with this business . Jerome Morrow . You don 't look well , Jerome . why don 't you go home ? - Yes ? - Jerome Morrow . He 's ill . A little nausea . It 's quite common before a mission . I want to visit him . I understand you can show me the way . You don 't know who he is , do you ? - Hello ? - Be yourself today . - I was never very good at it . - Tell the investigators you 're ill . - How long have I got ? - Not long . I guess he 's not home . - I 'm here to see Jerome Morrow . - That 's me. come up . I guess he 's home . come in . come in . come in . Hello , sweetheart . where 's my kiss ? - Good to see you 're feeling better . - Of course , now that you 're here . who 's your friend ? How can I help ? - It 's about the director . - Again ? - I hope it 's no trouble . - No , no . - I won 't show you around . Sorry . - can 't we do this another time ? - This won 't take a moment . - Maybe he can tell me why I 'm ill . who were you expecting ? - we have our man in custody . - I 'll come right away . - How are you , Jerome ? - Not bad , Jerome . - How the hell did you get up here ? - I can walk . I 've been faking it . Irene ... Don 't touch me ! I don 't even know who you are . - I 'm the same as I was yesterday . - No more lies , Jerome . My name is Vincent Anton Freeman . I 'm a faith birth or a de-gene-erate or whatever . But I 'm not a murderer . - You 're a God-child ? - we do have one thing in common . Only I don 't have 20-30 years left in mine . It 's 10,000 beats overdue . - It 's not possible . - You know what isn 't possible . Don 't you , Irene ? They 've got you looking so hard for any flaw , that that 's all you see . For whatever it 's worth , I 'm here to tell you that it is possible . It is possible . congratulations , sir . His spit was found in the dead director 's eye . while I obsessed over an eyelash , your instincts pointed the way . So the In-Valid wasn 't involved ? No , our friend acted alone . This mission meant everything to him . He 'll only live to see this launch . Since nothing can stop the launch now , he 's very , very cooperative . - So , will you celebrate tonight ? - Of course . - I think she likes us . - In time she 'll get used to it . - what was he like ? - Just a cop . - Did you get his name ? - No . - He 'll be back . - They have their man . It 's over . No , it 's not . I have to meet him . Vincent ? My God , you have changed . - Don 't you recognize your brother ? - Are we brothers ? Our parents died thinking they 'd outlived you . I had my doubts . - what are you doing here ? - I have a right to be here . - You don 't . - You sound as if you believe that . I committed no murder . You must be disappointed . You committed fraud . You 're in trouble . I can get you out of here . - I 've struggled to get here ! - You 've gone as far as you can go . There 's still a million miles to go . can you only succeed by seeing me fail ? God ! Even you are going to tell me what I can and can 't do now ? I don 't need any rescuing . But you did , once . - How do you explain that ? - You didn 't beat me . I beat myself . - who are you trying to convince ? - Do you want me to prove it ? It 's not important , Anton . It 's forgotten . I 'll prove it to you . Do you want me to prove it ? I do . Vincent ! Vincent ! where 's the shore ? we 're too far out ! Do you want to quit ? Do you ? No . Vincent ! How are you doing this , Vincent ? How have you done any of this ? we have to go back . - No. we 're close to the other side . - Do you want to drown us both ? You want to know how I did it ? This is how I did it . I never saved anything for the swim back . You couldn 't see , could you ? That night , crossing the street . You crossed anyway . If you 're still interested , let me know . Sorry ... The wind caught it . You 're flying today , aren 't you ? Look at what a mess you 're in . - I have your samples ready . - I don 't need any where I 'm going . You might when you get back . Everything you need to last you two lifetimes . - why have you done all this ? - So Jerome will always be here . - where are you going ? - I 'm travelling , too . - I don 't know how to thank you . - No , no ... I got the better end of the deal . I only lent you my body . You lent me your dream . Not until you 're upstairs . - what is this ? - New policy . - Flight got you nervous ? - There 's a problem , Lamar . I never did tell you about my son , did I ? He 's a big fan of yours . Just remember that I was as good as any and better than most . - He wants to apply here . - I could have gone up and back . Unfortunately , my son 's not all that they promised . But then , who knows what he could do ? Right ? For future reference , right-handed men don 't hold it with their left . Just one of those things . You 're going to miss your flight , Vincent . For someone who was never meant for this world , - - I 'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it . Of course , they say every atom in our bodies was once part of a star . Maybe I 'm not leaving . Maybe I 'm going home .

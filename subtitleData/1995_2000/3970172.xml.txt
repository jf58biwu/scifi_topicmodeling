 [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Liquid Sloshing ] [ Pages Rustling ] [ Ticking ] [ Screaming ] [ Alarm Beeping ] [ Alarm Stops ] Claire ... I miss you . [ Water Dripping ] [ Rinses Razor ] Woman Over P.A. : Dr. Weir , report to the Lewis and Clark in docking bay 4 . Man : lon drive set . Second Man : Thank you . [ Typing On Keyboard ] Heading--vector one , 9 degrees . We are prepped for lockdown . [ Beep ] I can 't believe this . It 's ridiculous . I haven 't got more than my hand in the last 6 weeks , and now this shit . I mean , why can 't we go to Mars , Captain ? I mean , Mars has ... has got women . Smith 's right . Neptune- - there 's nothing out there . Smith : Yeah , and if the shit goes down , we 'll be on our own . You know the rules , people . If someone drops the ball , we get the call . Now , let 's go . Have you got our course plotted in ? Yes , sir . Locked and cocked and ready to rock . Mr. Justin ? Everything 's green on my screen , Skipper . Skipper : Start your countdown now . Woman : lon drive will engage in t minus 10 minutes . Thank you , Lieutenant . Let 's go . Smith , you follow me . Yes , ma 'am . Justin , get those tanks prepped . Justin : Yes , sir . Mr. Cooper . Cooper : Skipper . Ion drive in 10 minutes . Ooh , it 's time to play spam in the can . Skipper ! Skipper : Peters . Uh , Captain Miller , I just wanted to say that this is- - The clock is ticking , doctor . Miller : You waiting for a personal invitation there , Mr. Smith ? Smith : No , sir . Uh , Captain , I don 't want- - Doctor , if you 'll just follow the rest of the crew to the grav tanks . We 're almost underway . That bunk better be squared away , Mr. Cooper , or you 'll find yourself walking to Neptune . What 's the holdup , Peters ? Just loading the last of the Co2 scrubbers , sir . You stand right here . Smith : Thanks , D.J. Miller : Hats off in the tank . First time in a grav couch ? Yeah . Uh-huh . I think your captain has some kind of a problem with me . Oh , well , don 't worry about him . He just loves having complete strangers on his ship . D.J. ! D.J. : Yeah ! Nah . Is this necessary ? When the ion drive fires , you 'll be taking about 30 Gs . Without a tank , the force would liquefy your skeleton . I 've seen the effect on mice . Claustrophobic ? Very . Hmm . Woman Whispering : Billy . [ Whoosh ] Woman : I 'm so alone . Hello ? Is anyone there ? Oh , God . Woman : Billy ? [ Gasps ] I 'm so cold . Claire . I 'm waiting . Aaah ! [ Coughing ] You 're all right . Breathe . D.J. ! OK , Dr. Weir . Let 's get you up . Come on . Take it easy . I 'm fine ! OK . There you go . Now , move nice and slow . You 've been in stasis for 56 days . You 're going to experience a little disorientation . You understand ? I 'm all right now . Thank you . OK . Take that . Don 't rush it . All yours . [ Coughing ] You OK , doc ? Want some coffee ? What ? [ Slowly ] Would you like some coffee ? No . Thank you . All right . Suit yourself . What about you , Starck ? Would you like something hot and black inside you ? Ooh . Is that an offer ? It is not . Then how about some coffee ? Starck . Yes , sir . Why aren 't you on the bridge ? Do you mind if I get dressed first ? As a matter of fact , I do mind if you get dressed first . Let 's go , people . We have a job to do . Peters : OK , Denny , here we go . Happy birthday . Play horsy , Mommy ! Play horsy ! Cooper : Oh ! Oh ! Hey ! No more ball in the house . Cooper : Sorry , Mama . Justin : Yeah . You 're the one that can 't catch . Cooper : Yo , apologize . Sorry about that , Mama Bear . Uh , Peters . Yes , sir . I did try to find a replacement for you , but with such short notice , it was impossible . I am sorry . I talked to my ex . He 's going to take Denny for Christmas . I 'll get him for the summer , so everything 's all right . Cooper : Smitty ! Excuse me , ladies and gentlemen . In approximately 2 hours and 23 minutes , we 'll be arriving in the orbit of Neptune . Thank you very much . I thank you . Ooh . Good . All boards are green . Everything 's 5 by 5 . USAC been notified of our position ? Starck : Yes , sir . All right , people , listen up . Smith : D.J. As you all know , we have an addition to our crew . Dr. Weir , you care to join us ? Introductions all around . This is my X.O.- - Lieutenant Starck . Mr. Justin , engineering . The funky spaceman over here is Mr. Cooper . What exactly is it you do onboard this ship , Coop ? Listen up , doc . I 'm your best friend . OK ? I 'm the lifesaver and the heartbreaker . Miller : He 's a rescue technician . This is Peters , medical technician . And my pilot--Mr . Smith . The gloomy gus in the corner over there , that 's uh- - D.J. Trauma . - Ha ha ha ! - Ha ha ha ! Cooper : All right . All right . Now that we all know each other , I got a question . What the fuck are we doing way out here ? Well , perhaps the good doctor will be kind enough to tell us . Thank you . Uh , first of all , I want to say how much I appreciate this opportunity to join you , and- - Yes . We 're sure that you appreciate being here , doctor , but you must understand , we don 't . We were taken off a well-deserved leave and sent into Neptune space . We are now 3 billion clicks from the nearest outpost . The last time USAC attempted a rescue this far past the outer reach- - Well , we lost both ships . So if you please ... Right . Well , everything I 'm about to tell you is considered code black by the N.S.A. USAC intercepted a radio transmission from a decaying orbit around Neptune . The source of this transmission has been identified as the Event Horizon . Yeah . Well , that 's bullshit , for starters . Skipper , you took me off leave for this ? [ Everyone Talking At Once ] Smitty , sit down . Miller : Cooper , as you were . Just let the man speak . Weir : What was made public about the Event Horizon- - that she was a deep-space research vessel , that her reactor went critical , and that the ship blew up- - None of that is true . The Event Horizon was the culmination of a secret government project to create a spacecraft capable of faster-than-light flight . Smith : Uh , excuse me . See , you can 't actually do that . Starck : The law of relativity prohibits faster-than-light travel . Relativity , yes . We can 't break the law of relativity , but we can go around it . The ship doesn 't really go faster than light . What it does is it creates a dimensional gateway that allows it to jump instantaneously from one point of the universe to another light years away . How ? Well , that 's difficult to- - It 's all math . Try us , doctor . Right . Well , uh , using layman 's terms- - Use a retaining magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons . These , in turn , fold space-time consistent with weyl tensor dynamics until the space-time curvature becomes infinitely large and you produce a singularity . Now , the singularity- - Layman 's terms . Well , fuck layman 's terms . Do you speak English ? Uh ... Imagine for a minute that this piece of paper- - Uh , excuse me . That 's Vanessa , and that 's mine . This attractive piece of paper represents space-time , and you want to get from point " a " here- - Ooh . to point " b " there . Now , what 's the shortest distance between 2 points ? Justin : A straight line . [ All Laughing ] Wrong . The shortest distance between 2 points is zero , and that 's what the gateway does- - It folds ... space so that point " a " and point " b " coexist in the same space and time . When the spacecraft passes through the gateway , space returns to normal . It 's called a gravity drive . Justin : How do you know all this ? I built it . Well , I can see why they sent you . So if the ship didn 't blow up , then what happened ? Weir : Well ... The mission was going perfectly , like a textbook : They reached safe distance using conventional thrusters , all systems looked good , they had the go-ahead to use the gravity drive to open the gateway to proxima centauri ; and then , they just disappeared , vanished without a trace ... until now . Where has she been for the last 7 years , doctor ? That 's what we 're here to find out . Now , we 've been unable to verify life contact . The T.D.R.S. did receive this single transmission . [ High-Pitched Squealing ] [ Deep Howling Noise ] [ Transmission Ends ] What the fucking hell is that ? Listen to this . Houston passed the same recording through several filters and managed to isolate what appears to be a human voice . [ indistinct Voice ] [ High-Pitched Squealing ] [ Transmission Ends ] I 'm not even sure if it qualifies as language . D.J. : Latin . What ? I mean , I think ... Well , it sounds like Latin . Can you translate it ? Play it again . [ High-Pitched Squealing ] [ indistinct Voice ] Right there . You hear that ? [ indistinct Voice ] Sounds like liberate me something or other . I can 't make out the rest . Liberate me ? Save me . [ Alarm Sounding ] Miller : all right . Stations , people . Crossing the horizon . Optimum approach angle is 14 degrees . Miller : Come around to 3-3-4 . Heading 3-3-4 , sir . Make your approach vector negative 14 degrees . 1-4 degrees . We have a lock on Event Horizon 's navigation beacon . She 's in the upper ionosphere , and it looks like we 're in for some very heavy chop , sir ! Bring us in nice and tight , Mr. Smith . Yes , sir . Mr. Justin , how 's my ship ? Smooth sailing , sir . Matching speed on my mark . 3 , 2 , 1 , mark ! - Range ? - 10,000 meters and closing , sir . - Miller : Starck ! - Yes , sir ! Get on the horn . See if anybody 's listening . This is the U.S. aerospace command vessel Lewis and Clark hailing Event Horizon . Event Horizon , do you read ? Dr. Weir ! I think you 'll want to see this . Where is she ? Dead ahead 5,000 meters ! Starck , anybody home ? Event Horizon , do you read ? 3,000 meters and closing ! Can 't see a thing ! 1,500 meters , sir . We 're getting too close . Where is it ? The scope is lit ! It 's right in front of us ! Smith : 1,000 meters . Proximity warning ! 900 ! 800 ! 700 ! We 're right on top of her , sir ! We 're going to hit ! Starck ! It 's right there ! God ! Reverse thrusters ! Full ! There she is . Justin : Jesus . Very impressive ship , doctor . Thank you . Mr. Smith , are you up for a flyby ? Y-Yes , sir . Yes , sir . I 'd love to . [ Thunder Rumbling ] Weir : That 's the main air lock . We can dock in there . All right . Smith , use the arm and lock us onto that small antennae cluster . You should go very carefully here . That is not a load-bearing structure . It is now , doctor . Everything 5 by 5 ? Locked into the Event Horizon . Thank you , Smitty . Light ' em if you got ' em . Thank you very much , sir . Starck , give me a read . The reactor 's still hot . We 've got several small radiation sources , but they 're leaks , probably . It 's nothing serious . Do they have pressure ? Affirmative . The hull 's intact , but there 's no gravity , and the thermal units are off-line . I 'm showing deep cold . The crew couldn 't survive unless they were in stasis . Find them , Starck . Yeah . I 'm already on it , Captain . Bio scan is on the line . There 's something wrong with the scan . Is it radiation interference ? There 's not enough to throw it off . I 'm picking up trace life forms , but I can 't get a lock on their location . These readings are all over the ship . It doesn 't make any sense . OK . We do it the hard way- - deck by deck , room by room . Starck , deploy the umbilicus . Smitty , fire up the boards in the war room . Sir . Mr. Justin , I believe you 're up for a walk . Yes , sir . Doctor , I 'm going to need you here on the bridge . Captain ... I didn 't come out all this way just to sit on your bridge . I need to be on that ship . Once we 've secured the ship , we 'll bring you onboard- - No , I 'm sorry , that 's unacceptable . I need to be on that ship . Once we 've secured the ship . That 's the way it is . I need you to guide us from the comm station . This is where I need you . Help us do our job . Oh , oh , oh . Honey , honey , honey . You forgot your briefcase . Cooper : Stand clear ! Miller : Anything gets funky , Cooper ... I 'll be on it ! Yo , Baby Bear ... keep your nose clean . D.J. , showtime . Video feed is clear . Are you with us , Dr. Weir ? Yes , I 'm with you . We are crossing the umbilicus , making our approach to the Event Horizon . You 're at the outer air-lock door . [ Click ] Miller : Magnetic boots on . [ Click ] Starck : We 've got pressure . Miller : Place is a deep freeze . We got ice crystals everywhere . That 's the central corridor that you 're in now . It connects the personnel areas at the front of the ship to engineering at the rear . Mr. Justin , you take engineering . Justin : Yes , sir . Peters and I will take the forward decks . [ Beeping ] Miller : Doctor , what are these ? Peters : Yeah . I 've got another one over here . They 're all over the place . In an emergency , they destroy the central corridor and split the ship in half , and then the crew can use the forward decks as a lifeboat . Miller : I 'm in medical . No casualties . Place looks like it 's never been used . Weir : You still haven 't seen any crew ? If we saw any crew , doctor , you 'd know it by now . Scanning for life readings . This place is a tomb . Oh , fuck me ! Starck : Miller . Miller , are you OK ? Cooper : Looks like Skipper got a case of the willies . Starck : Cooper , get back to your post . Miller , your heart rate just went through the roof . I 'm fine . Justin : I think I 've reached the door to the first containment , Dr. Weir . Weir : The engineering decks are on the other side . OK . Let 's take a look . What the hell is this place , Dr. Weir ? It allows you to enter the second containment without compromising the magnetic fields . Looks like a meat grinder to me . Peters : I 'm on the bridge . Got some blood here . Justin : There must have been a coolant leak . Man , this shit is everywhere . Coolant levels on reserve but well within the safety line . Ms. Peters , could you turn back and left ? Peters : What is it ? Ship 's log . [ Straining ] It 's stuck . It 's pretty jammed in there . Aah ! Starck : God . What the hell happened to his eyes ? Explosive decompression . Decompression doesn 't do that . Smith : Looks like it was caused by- - I don 't know , an animal or something . Look at the damage to the soft tissue , the massive abrasions . Corpse-cicle . Justin : I 'm scanning for life forms . Man , I 'm getting some really strange readings in here . Let me see if I can get some power up . Weir : That 's the core , the gravity drive ... the heart of the ship . [ Beeping ] Justin . Justin , you 're breaking up ! Aah ! Justin , come in ! Ah . Weir : What is it ? I don 't know . The life scan just went off the scale . [ Beeping ] Something 's wrong , Starck . Pull him out . Oh , shit ! Aaah ! He 's in trouble ! Go , Coop ! I 'm gone ! Aah ! Aah ! Miller : Boarding party , sound off . This is Miller . Can anybody hear me ? What the fuck was that ? Pressure emergency ! We 've lost the starboard baffle ! The hull 's been breached ! I 'll contain the air for as long as I can ! Get out ! We 're losing atmosphere ! There are pressure suits in the air lock . Go ! Here I come ! Here I come ! Hold on , Baby Bear ! I 'm almost there , almost there ! I got you ! I got you ! Uh ! Oh ! Watch out ! Watch ! I got you . What the fuck is this ? Hold on ! Uh ! Smith : Captain Miller ! Captain Miller , do you copy ? Over ! Smitty , where you been all my life ? We have a major situation here , sir ! We 've lost the starboard baffle , and the hull 's been breached ! Uh , the safety circuits , they 've failed ! Do we have time for a weld ? No , sir ! We 've got 218 liters of gas left , sir , and then we 've got nothing ! The oxygen tanks , they failed . They 're broken ! Sir , we are fucking dead ! What about the Event Horizon ? What ? She 's got air and power ! It 's our only chance ! There 's no way I 'm getting on that bastard ! We don 't even know what happened on that ship ! It beats dying , Mr. Smith . I want all personnel onboard the Event Horizon pronto . We 'll meet at the air tanks . I 'm ahead of you , sir . Bringing all thermal units on-line . Hold tight . Prep for Gs . Gravity in 5 seconds . [ Cooper Shouting ] Wake up ! Open your eyes , all right ? You hang in there . [ Thunder Rumbling ] Dr. Weir . Well , I brought most primary systems on-line ... for now . Thank you . Starck , What 's our status ? The antennae array is completely fried . We 've got no radio , no laser , no high gain . No one 's coming to help us . This air tastes bad . Yeah . Carbon dioxide . I know . It 's building up with every breath we take , and the Co2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot . So we take the scrubbers from the Clark . That gives us--what ? Enough breathable air for 20 hours , but after that , we 'd better be on our way home . [ Thunder Rumbling ] Smith : I 'm on the port side of the hull , approaching the dorsal heat sink . Holy shit . Captain Miller . Captain Miller , do you copy ? Over . I copy , Mr. Smith . How 's my ship ? Sir , we 've got a 7-meter fracture on the outer hull . We should be able to repair her , but it 's going to take an awful lot of time , sir . Negative . 20 hours , we run out of air . Understood , sir . Miller : What happened here , doctor ? OK . How is he ? His vital signs seem stable , but he 's unresponsive to stimuli . I don 't know . He might wake up in 15 minutes . He might not wake up at all . Cooper : Look , Skipper , I know this shit sounds weird , but , I mean , there was , like , nothing , and then Justin appeared , and , um , there was liquid , and the whole core just turned solid . It 's just not physically possible . Doctor , please , don 't start in with that physics shit . I 'm telling you , I saw it . Mr. Cooper , it would mean the gateway was open . Well , then , that 's it . The gateway was open . The gateway couldn 't be open because the gravity drive wasn 't activated . Now , look , I 'm telling you what I saw , doc , so- - It can 't just start up by itself ! Mr. Cooper , you are out of line ! Doctor , Mr. Justin may die . Now , I have to assume that whatever happened to him could happen to all of us . Mr. Cooper says he saw something . I believe he saw something . I need an explanation . Well , in my view , Mr. Cooper 's delusional- - if you don 't mind my saying so- - but maybe he saw an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion . An optical effect ! That 's fucking poetic . Where the fuck- - Cooper ! I 'm sorry . I 'm all right . OK . Gravitational distortion , What could create that , doctor ? If , somehow , a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core , it could distort space-time . It could make Justin seem to disappear . It could also have damaged the Lewis and Clark . However , I think this is entirely unlikely . What 's in the core , doctor ? It 's complicated . Well , how much time do you need ? We have ... 17 hours and 48 minutes . What 's in the core ? Weir : This is the gateway . Now , these 3 magnetic rings , when they align , it creates an artificial black hole , which allows the ship to travel to any point in space . Starck : A black hole , the most destructive force in the universe ... and you 've created one ? Absolutely . Yes . Because we can use that immense power to bend space-time . Look , it would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our nearest star , but the Event Horizon could be there in a day . If it worked . You can come down . It 's perfectly safe . Miller : So if Mr. Justin was sucked through your gateway , he could have gone wherever the Event Horizon 's been . Weir : Theoretically , yes , but as I told you before , the gateway can 't just open by itself . I see . Lieutenant , I want this room sealed off . Second containment from hereon in is off limits . Starck : yes , sir . Captain , there 's no danger . The gateway 's contained behind 3 magnetic fields . It 's perfectly safe . Safe ? ! Doctor , my ship is in pieces , and one of my crewmen may not make it home alive . No one else goes near this thing . Peters : Come on . [ Sighs ] There 's got to be something on this log . You can do this . [ Scraping ] D.J. ! [ Scraping ] D.J. , where are you ? D.J. : I 'm up on deck 4 . [ Scraping ] Mommy . Peters ! Ah ! What is it ? You all right ? Whew ! Cooper : What 's up ? You was out there so long , I thought you were trying to break my record . Listen , I 'd rather spend the next 12 hours outside than another 5 seconds in this shit can . It 's the final entry in the ship 's log . I want to say how proud I am of my crew . I 'd like to name my station heads : Chris Chambers , Janice Reuben , Ben Fender , Dick Smith . We 've reached safe distance ... Weir : This is John Kilpack , ship 's captain . And are preparing to engage the gravity drive and open the gateway to Proxima Centauri . Ave atque vale . Hail and farewell . [ Static And High-Pitched Howling ] What is that ? I 'll run it through a few filters , see if I can clean it up . It 's a power drain . It 's the core . Stay here . Look after justin . I don 't want anybody else near that thing . Wait for me , doctor ! Miller : What 's causing the drain ? Weir : Magnetic fields are holding . There may be a short in the fail-safe circuit . I 'll check it . Can you give us a hand ? [ Choking ] Justin ! Justin , can you hear me ? He 's coming ! Who 's coming ? The dark . Aaah ! Ah , yeah . That 's the one . Claire , Softly : Billy . Billy . [ Weir Breathing Heavily ] Claire , Louder : Billy . [ Weir Breathing Louder And Quicker ] Miller ! Captain Miller , I 've got some problems here ! Be with me ... forever . Dr. Weir ! [ Splash ] D.J. : Carbon dioxide can produce hallucinations , impair judgment . Goddamn it , D.J. It was not a hallucination . All right . Doctor , you were in the duct . You must have heard something . You must have seen something . Peters : I did . About an hour ago , I saw my son lying on the examination table . And ... in his legs were crawling ... Ms. Peters , if you don 't mind my saying so , it sounds a little like shock . Could it be that you 're traumatized- - No . No . Excuse me ! No ! I 've seen bodies before . This was different . She 's right . Now , this was real . I felt ... I felt heat . This is not something that 's in our heads . Smitty , have you seen anything unusual at all ? No , I haven 't seen anything , and I don 't need to see anything , sir , but I can tell you ... this ship is fucked . Well , thank you for that scientific analysis , Mr. Smith . Smith : Yeah , well , you don 't- - Miller : OK , OK ! All right , doc . When you break all the laws of physics , do you seriously think there won 't be a price ? ! You already killed the last fucking crew , and now you want to kill us as well ! D.J. ! You 're fucking sick , all right ? It 's just a ship , you understand ? It 's just a big hunk of metal . There 's nothing odd going on . D.J. Smith : Fine . Oh , D.J. Peters : OK . Let 's see this . You all right ? Yeah . I 'm just ... I 'm sorry . Peters : Whoa ! Goddamn it ! Miller : Hey . Smitty . Smitty ! Smith : There 's no fucking chance- - That 's enough ! I want you calm ! I want you cool ! Now ! All right . You 're going back upstairs . You 're going outside on the clark with Cooper , and you 're going to repair the ship . No mistakes . Mistakes , nobody goes home . Understood ? Smith : Yes , sir . All right , sir . Get moving . Starck : Miller . What is it , Starck ? I ran the bio scan with the D.N.A. , R.N.A. filters . The results were bioreadings- - Of an indeterminate origin . Yes , I know . Don 't you have anything useful to tell me , Lieutenant ? I 've got a theory . Let 's hear it . I think that there 's a connection between the readings and the hallucinations , like they 're all part of a defensive reaction , some sort of immune system . I don 't have time to listen to this . - You have to listen to me . - To what ? I 'm saying that this ship is reacting to us , and the reactions are getting stronger . It 's as if the ship brought back something with it , a life force of some kind . What are you telling me ? That this ship is alive ? You wanted an answer , and it 's the only one I 've got . No. what I want , Lieutenant , is to survive the next 10 hours . [ Thunder Rumbling ] Peters : Justin ? Justin ! Justin ! [ Bang On Door ] [ Bang On Door ] [ Bang ] [ Banging Continues ] [ Banging Stops ] [ Peters Breathing Heavily ] Did you hear that ? ! Did you hear that ? ! What is it ? You heard it . What is it ? ! Peters ! Listen to me . It 's D.J. , all right ? I didn 't hear anything . Neither of us heard anything . So just calm down , all right ? Get your breath back . OK . Now , tell me . I was- - [ Banging Continues And Peters Screams ] Peters : Make it stop ! Make it stop ! Weir : Open the door . Peters : No ! D.J. : Weir , stop ! Stop him ! Starck : What are you doing ? ! Aah ! In our current environment , Dr. Weir , self-control is an asset . [ Alarm Buzzing ] Starck : What is it ? Um ... the forward airlock . Miller , Smith , Cooper , anyone in the air lock ? Miller : That 's a negative , Starck . Justin . Peters : Justin ! D.J. : No ! Peters : Justin , no ! Justin , no ! Justin , open the door ! Miller , come in . Miller , come in . We have an emergency . What 's going on in there , Starck ? Justin 's in the air lock . Say again . Starck : Justin is in the air lock , and he is not wearing a suit . Shit . I 'm on it . As you were , sailor . Skipper , you need me on this . I need you right where you are . He 's engaged the override . Can you shut it down ? I 'll try . Coming to him , Starck . Justin ! Open this door now ! Miller : Starck , give me status . You better hurry . He 's engaged the override , and we can 't open the inner door . D.J. : I 'll get the kit . Justin , open the door ! Justin , open the door . Did you hear it ? Keep him talking . Yes . Yes , I heard it . Do you know what it is ? It shows you things ... horrible things . What does ? The dark inside me ... from the other place . I won 't go back there . I won 't . No , Baby Bear . Come on ! Open the door ! D.J. : What 's happening ? I don 't think she can talk him down . You better . If he opens the air lock , he 's going to turn inside out . Peters : No , you stay with me ! Starck : Almost got it . I 've almost got it . You stay with me , Justin ! Come on , now ! Open that door ! If you could see the things I 've seen , you wouldn 't try to stop me . No , that 's not you talking ! That 's not you talking . That 's it . That 's it . Right there . Open the door . Go for that button . Come on . OK . OK . No ! No ! [ Screaming ] Captain , Justin just activated the door . It 's on a 30-second delay . Miller : Justin ! Aah ! Computer Voice : Stand by for decompression in 25 seconds . Justin : Where am I ? Hey . Starck , get it fucking open ! Hey , open the door . I can 't . The inner door won 't open when the outside door 's been triggered . It would decompress the entire ship . Oh , my God . Mama Bear ... open the door . Come on . Please . Captain . Patch me through to him . Captain Miller , tell them to open the door . I can 't do that , Justin . I don 't want to die in here . You 're not going to die . I want you to listen to me very carefully , and I 'm going to get you out of there . Oh , my God . It 's starting . My eyes ! Don 't think about them . Shut them . Just shut them as tight as you can . 5 seconds . Tuck yourself into a crouched position . Make yourself into a ball now . Justin : I can 't breathe ! Oh ! Oh , God ! Oh , God , it hurts ! I want you to huff and puff and blow all the air out of your lungs . Do you hear me ? All the air out of your lungs , Justin ! [ Screaming ] Miller : Do it ! Now ! [ Justin Screaming ] OK , Baby Bear . Miller : Got him . I got him . Stand by , people . Stand by ! We 've got pressure . Peters : we 're coming , Justin ! We 're coming ! D.J. : We 're going to need 5 units here . D.J. : Hold his head still . Peters : OK ! [ Justin Coughing ] Give me some more glycerin now ! One thing at a time . Let 's keep him breathing . Peters : Christ , he 's bleeding ! Pressure 's still dropping . D.J. : I stopped the bleeding . Stabilized him best I can . [ Exhales Deeply ] He won 't be pretty , but he should live ... if we make it back . We 'll make it . Starck , what 's our time like ? Co2 levels will become toxic in 4 hours . All right . Peters , we 've got to find out what happened to the other crew before the same thing happens to us . Well , I can work on the log on the bridge , but I won 't go back to medical . All right . Yes , sir . Starck : Justin said something about ... " the dark inside me . " What 's that mean ? Doctor ? I don 't think it means anything . Miller : Don 't you walk away from me , mister . I 'd like some answers , doctor . I 'd like to know why one of my men tried to commit suicide by throwing himself out of an air lock . I 'd like to know what caused that noise . Look , thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract rapidly , causing reverberations . This is possible . Bullshit ! You built this fucking ship . You 've given me nothing but bullshit . What do you want me to say ? You said the ship 's drive creates a gateway . Yeah . To what ? I don 't know . Where did it go ? Where did you send it ? I don 't know . Where has it been for the last 7 years ? Look , I don 't know . " l don 't know " is not good enough , doctor . You 're supposed to be the fucking expert . I need answers . That 's your job . Now , the other place , where is that ? I don 't know ! I don 't know ! Look ... there 's a lot of things happening around here that I don 't fully understand . I need time . I see . Well , that 's exactly what we don 't have , doctor . Man : Captain ! Don 't leave me ! Don 't leave me ! Please ! For God 's sakes , help me ! It 's in your head . It 's just in your head . [ Man Screams ] God help us . [ Thunder Rumbling ] Miller : I 'm telling you , it was his voice I heard . He was calling to me--a young bosun named Eddie Corrick . We served on the Goliath together . When the O2 tanks ruptured , 4 of us made it to the lifeboat , but Corrick was still on board the Goliath when the fire broke out . You ever seen fire in zero gravity ? It 's beautiful . It 's like liquid . Slides all over everything . Comes up in waves . And they just kept hitting him , wave after wave . He was screaming for me to save him . What did you do ? I did the only thing I could . I closed the lifeboat hatch , and I left him behind . I swore I 'd never lose another man . I 've known you a long time . You never told me that . That 's just it , D.J. I never told anybody . But this ship knew about it . It knows my fears . It knows my secrets . Gets inside your head , and it shows you . I wasn 't going to tell you this . I 've been listening to the distress signal , and I , um ... think I made a mistake in the translation . [ Turns On Tape Player ] Voice : Liberate tutemet ex inferis . [ Turns Off Tape Player ] Go on . I thought it said Liberate me , Save me . But it 's not me . It 's liberate tutemet , Save yourself . And it gets worse . Voice : Liberate tutemet ex inferis . There . I think ... That says , ex inferis . Save yourself ... from hell . Look , if what Dr. Weir tells us is true , this ship has been beyond the boundaries of our universe ... of known scientific reality . Who knows where it 's been , what it 's seen ... and what it 's brought back with it ? From hell . You don 't believe in that kind of stuff , do you ? Whoever sent that message , he sure believes in hell . Cooper , Over lntercom : Captain Miller ! Whatever it is , Coop , it better be good . Cooper : Yes , sir . Ready to repressurize the Clark and get the hell out of here . On my way . Miller : Come on , baby . Don 't let me down . Miller : Hello , baby . Papa 's home . Smith : She 's holding . Oh , shit . Cooper : Skipper , we 're still venting trace gases . Give me about 20 minutes to plug the hole . Miller : Mr. Cooper , you are the lifesaver . 20 minutes , and we 're underway . Shit . [ Thunder Rumbling ] Got any coffee ? Yeah , but it 's cold . Great . [ Screeching And Screaming ] Starck ! [ Screeching And Screaming Continues ] Oh ! Miller ! [ Screaming And Yelling ] Voice : Liberate tutemet ex inferis . [ Screaming And Yelling ] We 're leaving . [ Thunder Rumbling ] No , we can 't leave . Our orders are specific . Rescue the crew , salvage what 's left of the ship . The crew is dead , doctor . Your ship killed them . We came here to do a job . We 're aborting , doctor ! Starck , download the files from the Event Horizon 's computers . D.J. , I want you to get Justin prepped and ready to move him back to the Clark . There 's stuff I want to get from medical . Got to move him in the tank . No problem . Do it . Peters . Peters : Yes , sir . Miller : I want you to get the Co2 scrubbers back into the Clark . Take Smitty with you . Peters : Right . Weir : Captain ... Captain ... Don 't do this . It 's done . What about my ship ? You can 't just leave her . I have no intention of leaving her , doctor . I will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance , and then I will launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until i 'm satisfied she 's vaporized . Fuck this ship . No , you don 't . [ Alarm Beeping ] Captain Miller , the bio scan just went off the scale . It looks like the core is draining power from the rest of the ship . Get the files . Vacate . I want off this ship . You can 't leave . She won 't let you . Just get your gear and get back on the Lewis and Clark , doctor , or you 'll find yourself walking home . I am home . Peters : Let 's go ! Ready ? Smith : Shot . Come on . Come on . Ready ? Shot . - Shot . - OK . Peters , can we go ? This place is really freaking me out . Yeah . You want to breathe on the way home ? No , I don 't ! Let 's go ! - Shit ! 25 ! - Come on ! We need 25 ! Peters ! Come out ! Got it ! [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Peters Gasps ] Aah ! [ Breathing Heavily ] Oh , no , Peters . Oh . Oh , God . Claire : Billy . Claire ? Claire . It 's me . I 'm home . I 'm home . I know I wasn 't there when you needed me , and ... I 'm sorry l ... I let my work come between us . God , Claire , no . I 'm begging you . Please , please don 't . Not again , please . I 've been so ... [ Groaning ] I 've been so ... Claire : Billy . It 's all right . I 've been so alone . You 'll never be alone again . You 're with me now . You 're with me . And I have such wonderful , wonderful things ... to show you . [ Squish ] [ Screaming ] Damn , I 'm good ! Coop ... Coop , how long are you going to take , because I 've got to get the hell out of here ? Look , you can kiss my ass , Smith , because I 'm done . Just give me a second to collect my tools , and we can get out of Dodge . 2 minutes , tops . Roger that . [ Clank ] Weir ! Dr. Weir ! Weir ! Weir ! Dr. Weir , get your ass back on board now ! Weir ! Shit . Captain Miller . Captain Miller , do you copy ? Over . Captain Miller . Captain Miller , do you copy ? Over . Go ahead , Smitty . I 've just seen Weir messing around on the Clark , sir . Stand by , Smitty . I want to check something out . Smith , get out of there . Come again , sir ? One of the explosives is missing from the corridor . Weir might have put it on the Clark . No . No way . No , no , sir . No way . I 've just put it back together , sir . Get off the Clark now , Smith ! Where the fuck are you ? [ Thunder Rumbling ] Got you . Hang on , Smitty ! I 'm coming ! No ! Shit ! [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Thunder Rumbling ] Cooper : Shit ! What the fuck am I going- - Why does this shit got to happen to me ? Fuck . All right , think , Coop . Think . Think ! All right , all right . I got to get back to the ship . I got to get back to the ship , all right ? All right , I got to blow my air tank . I 'll blow my air tank . All right . Fuck . Oh , this better work . This shit better work . All right . All right , here I go . All right , 1 , 2 , 3 . Come on . Come on ! Come on ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Here I come , motherfuckers ! D.J. What was that ? Clark 's gone . Smitty and Cooper are dead . What the- - It was Weir . You spot him , you take him out . Understood . Be careful , D.J. Don 't worry about Weir . I 'll take care of him . [ D.J. Gasping ] D.J. ? Aah ! Miller : D.J. ! D.J. , answer me ! [ Slice ] [ Gurgling Yell ] Miller : OK , Dr. Weir . You don 't want to leave your ship ? [ Cocks Gun ] You never will . [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Clank ] [ Thunder Rumbling ] Starck . It 's OK . It 's OK . I 'll get you out of here . OK . OK . Easy . [ Thunder Rumbling ] Miller : Oh , my God . What happened to your eyes ? Where we 're going , we won 't need eyes to see . What are you talking about ? I created the Event Horizon to reach the stars , but she 's gone much , much farther than that . She tore a hole in our universe ... a gateway to another dimension ... a dimension of pure chaos ... pure evil . When she crossed over , she was just a ship , but when she came back ... she was alive . Look at her , Miller . Isn 't she beautiful ? Your beautiful ship killed its crew , doctor . Well ... now she has another crew . Now she has us . What do you think you 're doing , doctor ? You wanted to know where the ship has been ... so now you 'll find out . [ Starck Grunting ] If you miss me , you blow out the hull . What makes you think I 'll miss ? Cooper : that 's right ! I 'm back ! I 'm--oh , shit ! I can 't stop ! Hey ! Hey ! Fuck . [ Groans ] What ? ! Who the fuck ? ! Who the--Oh , shit ! Aah ! Miller : No ! [ Groans ] Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! [ Screaming ] Aah ! Miller ! Miller ! [ Alarm Beeping ] Give me your hand ! [ Grunting ] Come on ! I can 't ! I 'm not leaving you ! [ Alarm Buzzing ] Forward air lock . It can 't be Weir . I 'm not taking any chances . You watch your back . Yo ! Don 't hit me ! Cooper ! Take it off ! Take it off ! I can 't breathe . I can 't breathe . You 're OK . You 're OK . It 's over . No , it 's not . Weir 's activated the gravity drive . We got to shut it down . How ? The bridge is gone . What about engineering ? You think you can shut it down from there ? I don 't know the process . Dr. Weir was the expert . Look , I don 't want to go where the other crew went , OK ? I 'd rather be dead . OK . OK , we blow the fucker up . We blow it up ? Do like Weir said . Blow the corridor , Separate us from the rest of the ship , use the foredecks as a lifeboat . With any luck , T.D.R.S. will pick up our emergency beacon . We prep the gravity couches , put ourselves in stasis , and stand by for a search and rescue team . Meantime , I 'm going to go manually arm these explosives . Cooper : Skipper , will this shit work ? It worked for Dr. Weir . You go activate the emergency beacon . You get back here double-quick . Cooper : Yes , sir . Starck : I 'll come with you . You stay here . You prep the gravity couches . Miller . Close this door behind me , Lieutenant . [ Thunder Rumbling ] Computer Voice : Gateway opening in " t " minus 5 minutes . Computer Voice : Emergency beacon activated . Yes . Blood ? Oh , fuck me . Fuck me . Starck ! Aah ! Aah ! Starck ! Run ! Computer Voice : Gateway opening in " t " minus 3 minutes . Computer Voice : Detonator release is authorized . Computer Voice : The main corridor is now armed . We 're armed . She 's ready to blow . I repeat . We are armed . She 's ready to blow . Miller . Miller , Can you hear me ? We have to get out of here now . [ Fire Roars ] You let me burn ! Computer Voice : Gateway opening in " t " minus 2 minutes . [ Fire Roars ] Miller ! Aah ! [ Miller Coughing ] Corrick : You left me behind . No , you 're not Edward Corrick . I watched him die . Weir ? [ Laughs ] The ship brought me back . I told you she won 't let me leave . She won 't let anyone leave . Did you really think You could destroy this ship ? She 's defied space and time . She 's been to a place you couldn 't possibly imagine . And now ... it is time to go back . I know . To hell . You know nothing . Hell is only a word . The reality is much , much worse . Now let me show you . [ Screaming ] Help me ! [ Screaming ] No ! No . No . No . Weir : You see ? No , they 're not dead . They 're not dead . Not yet . [ Yells ] Miller : you won 't ... take my crew ! [ Yells ] [ Moaning ] They 're not your crew anymore . They belong to the ship . Computer Voice : Gateway opening . [ Yells ] Take me . You take me ! You leave them alone ! No . There is no escape . Weir : The gateway is open , and you are all coming with me . Aah ! Do you see ? [ Moaning ] Weir : Do you see ? ! Aah ! Do you see ? ! Yes ... I see . [ Beeping ] No ! [ Thunder Rumbling ] Miller . Man : This is rescue 1 . We have contact . Approaching the wreckage of the Event Horizon . Prepare to board . Man : I 'm entering the grav couch bay . It doesn 't appear to have been damaged in the explosion . There appear to be 3 survivors : Cooper , Justin , Lieutenant Starck . Justin seems to have suffered massive injuries , but he 's still alive . The grav couches still have power . I 'm opening the first tank now . [ Starck Gasping ] Man : It 's all right . It 's OK . You 're safe now . Justin . Cooper . They 're fine . They 're fine . They 're with us . You 're with us . Aah ! Cooper : Starck . Stay calm . It 's all right . Cooper : Starck , calm down .

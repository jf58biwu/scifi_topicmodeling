 [ Woman Narrating ] Previously on Earth 2 . They call him the Watcher . He works for the Council , determining the viability of this planet for human resettlement . And you think the boy provides the ability to take the planet ? The boy is touched . The Council is testing five planets for resettlement . The most promising candidate is this one . But we can 't resettle until they figure out some way to control the planet . What does all this have to do with my son ? The boy is mine . You deliver him , or you will die running . He 's out there somewhere ... orbiting . But he can 't detect us , not so far . We have come to this place ... to leave behind ... a part of ourselves - a part we cannot replace , but a part we will not lose ... as long as we remember . [ Julia Narrating ] Six days , four hours and some odd minutes ago , we all began to die . We closed the winter camp , headed out of the mountains , but now we 're stopped again - at the mercy of the unknown . Bess . It 's okay . I 'm - I 'm just a little dizzy . That 's all . Some of us are worse than others , but we 're all experiencing dizziness , progressive loss of motor control . And now the first of us has died . I 'm afraid she won 't be the last . [ Yale , Continuing ] ... leave in this quiet place ... only the fragile chamber in which our friend once lived . For we take with us forever her enduring spirit . Amen . [ Shovel Spading ] [ People Coughing ] [ Julia Narrating ] They say that fear is a single closed door ... behind which lies the unknown . We 've been stuck in this valley for eight days . We 've been sick for six . I say we start movin ' again before we get any weaker . Maybe you 're right . [ Sighs ] Julia ? I 've run every test I can . I-I - I 've come up with nothing . If I had more equipment - If I had more time - If , if , if . What kind of a diagnosis starts with " if " ? She is doing the best she can , Morgan . Well , that 's not good enough . Take a look at us . We 're withering away here , one by one , and our only doctor doesn 't have a clue . Morgan , shut it , or you won 't have to worry about withering away . [ Jazz ] [ Saxophone Continues ] Who the hell are you ? You 're not in this program . [ Saxophone Stops ] Franklin Bennett 's the name , and I like your taste in music . - What the hell 's the matter with this thing ? - Nothing at all , Morgan . I 've simply come to tell you that you 're doomed . Your beautiful young doctor cannot help you . Wait a minute . What are you - How do you know that ? There 's nothing she can do to save you . - You stay away from me . - But I can . If you listen to me - if you trust me - I can help you . I can help Bess ... if you help me . [ Chattering ] [ Beeping ] [ Beeping ] [ Sighs ] [ Tent Flap Rustles ] Bessie . Honey . Bess . I 'm not doing so well , Morgan . [ Sighing ] Oh , honey , I know . I 'm not doing so well either . We 're all gonna be better soon . Oh . Bess . Do you believe in angels ? [ Engine Stops ] [ True ] Why are we stopping ? Hey . Why are we stoppin ' ? Someone 's been messin with the induction cell . It 's been modified to shut down on these coordinates . What ? [ Beeping ] Show me . What 's goin ' on ? It 's locked down to these coordinates . [ Conversation Continues , Indistinct ] [ Julia ] Let 's get Baines and the others into some shelter . [ Devon ] Alonzo , you 'd better - Look ! Over there ! - [ Uly ] Whoa . ! - [ True ] Wow . ! What is it ? That looks like an Earth ship . I make it better than a hundred years old , Lonz . Your age . Very funny . First cruise ship out this far was a Jupiter-class freighter . This boat 's Venus class - 30 years earlier . I didn 't think we were out here that long ago . Officially , we weren 't . Unofficially , looks like we were . [ Exhales ] Let 's do it . I used to love to fly these things . [ Danziger ] You know what you 're doin ' ? [ Vacuum Releases ] Guess so . [ Julia ] Oh , what - Okay . [ Devon ] Alonzo , be careful . Be careful now . Be careful . [ Danziger ] Wow . She 's still got power . Plasma shell . Nuclear . These babies could burn forever . [ Systems Powering Up ] What do you know ? [ Exhales ] Will you take a look at this ? [ Devon ] It 's not from our station . That 's for sure . Look at this . Cold-sleep crypts . [ Devon ] What ? There 's people in here . [ Danziger ] People ? [ Alonzo ] What do you mean , people ? Are they alive ? They must be . I 'm unfamiliar with these first-generation systems . According to ship 's log , it 's a Council research vessel . A Council ship ? Mm . Originally commissioned out of New Mars Station . Most of its research data is locked in coded files I cannot access . The final log entry simply states ; " Entering cold sleep . Can 't wait to get back . " They actually thought they were going home . What do we do with them ? [ Danziger ] Let ' em sleep . Take what we can use and be on our way . With temperatures that low , if we cycle them up , we take a risk . They could die . Cycle 0-1 - niner . Ramp accelerated recovery from 0-niner ... to 1 - 2-1 . [ Systems Powering Up ] [ Beeping ] Oh , boy . I hope you know what you 're doing , Bennett . Morgan ? What the hell are you doin ' ? I-I-I 'm , uh - I 'm waking them up . Just like he asked . You 're waking them up ? Morgan . Oh , no . Can you stop it ? No . We 've got life signs already . I don 't know what to do . What 's wrong ? I did everything he said . Who ? Everything who said ? Him . [ Alarm Blaring ] They 're failing ! The pods are failing . [ Danziger ] Find an override . You 've gotta find an override . It 's too late . ! We 're gonna lose them . ! - Four is gone . - [ Danziger ] God . ! - John , help me . ! - Look at it , Morgan ! You killed them ! But ... he begged me to do it . - Pod 5 - Morgan ! - He told me what to do . [ Danziger ] Julia , shut down the failed pods . Shut ' em down . ! Shut ' em all down . ! Two is stabilized . Six is stabilized . We 've got two and six . [ Gasping ] Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . ! What do I do with him ? [ Gasping Continues ] I 'm Dr.Julia Heller . Please lie still . Breathe evenly . [ Exclaims , Gasping ] Elizabeth ? Thomas . Where are the others ? [ Gasping ] I 'm here ! Franklin ! [ Gasping ] Franklin . I 'm here . Franklin , I 'm here . Home . Franklin . We 're finally home . [ Beeps ] Look . You tell them why I did it ! You tell them it was you who told me what to do ! Morgan , stop it . Who are these people ? [ Gasping ] We 're colonists . We 're here to settle this planet . Which ... planet ? G889 . - Oh ! - Oh , my God ! No ! Sorry , folks . You didn 't get very far . You 're still on the surface . [ Exhales ] No ! Those murderers . Those bloody murderers ! Here , let me have your wrist . Wh-What 's that you 're giving him ? It 's a synaptic enhancer . It 'll help with your recovery . [ Injection ] [ Exhales ] We were among the Council 's first Advance teams - the first humans in this system . It took us eight years before we - Finished our assignment . [ Bennett ] We put ourselves into cold sleep , fully expecting to wake up back home . You are the first ... colonists , right ? Yes . Yes , there are about , uh , a thousand others in transit - 250 families . - And after that ? - I don 't know . Millions hopefully . I 'm telling you . I met this guy in V.R. You begged me to wake you . I 'm sorry . That 's not possible . It is possible . It happened . I didn 't mean for anything to happen to your friends . [ Bess ] Morgan . Honey , I - I need to go to the tent . I 'm not feeling well . Get some rest , Bess . [ Julia ] How are you ? You feeling okay ? Oh . Bess ? Julia . Do something . Bess . Turn her over . Bess . What 's wrong with her ? I 'm a physician too . I don 't know . It 's been going on for days . It 's happening to all of us , and I can 't isolate it . Now , listen . We only came here because he said that you could help us . Now , I am not making this up . Do something ! [ Monitor Beeping ] - I know it 's neurological . I just can 't find the systemic source . - [ Bess ] Eben died . She died . Bess . It 's okay . Eben was at the front of the curve . We lost her yesterday . Uh , I 'd like to examine the body . [ Danziger ] There we go . [ Grunts ] [ Out Of Breath ] There . Do you think it 's possible that guy talked to Morgan in V.R. ? Morgan sure thinks so . I don 't trust him . It 's like something - It 's not right . He 's not tellin ' us everything . Yeah . I get the same feelin ' . [ Device Buzzing ] The dizziness that occurs - it 's actually more of a disorientation , isn 't it ? Yeah . Everyone 's been on the same progression . It 's just some of us are further along the curve than others . And the ... headaches that follow are sharp ? They feel as if they 're directly behind the eyes ? - Do you know what this is ? - [ Syringe Ejects ] - [ Sighs ] - What is that ? Something to let the Council monitor your life signs . I 'd guess they were going bad . But we won 't know for sure ... till we analyze it . How did you know what to look for ? I helped design them . It looks like a bioprobe . It 's an effective way for the Council to monitor the population 's health . [ Coughing ] Sneaky , but reliable . I never signed off on anything like that being plugged into me . It was probably injected right along with your flu shot , old boy . Bloody Council doctor didn 't even know himself . Now , wait a minute . We 've got little robots inside our bodies ? Let 's get to work , Doc . Start cutting ' . I 'm gonna volunteer . They can 't be removed . The chip attaches to the cortical stem ... and builds neural nets through the brain . So , what 's wrong with them ? Can they be fixed ? I don 't know . The circuits look damaged . But I - I 've never seen anything like this before . [ Shivers ] [ Shudders ] You know what this means , don 't you ? You worse than me ... at the moment . I punched up the crypt logs . Fifty years ... and we 're still here . And a bloody million colonists on the way . You must call her , Franklin . She may still be up there . Impossible . She 's dead by now . But you must consider it , darling . What else could be responsible for their condition ? [ Coughing ] Are you there , Eve ? It 's good to hear your voice again , Dr. Bennett . [ Coughs ] I wish I could say the same , love . I take it your orbit is secure . Oh , yes . Quite comfortable , in spite of your efforts . [ Coughing ] [ Coughing Continues ] You didn 't send us back home , love . You sent us back down . Care to tell me why ? I think you know why , Doctor . Why don 't you tell the rest of us ? More guests . Yes . These ... kind people are the reason I 'm talking to you now . What is this ? The mother of all computers , my dear . When we ventured down to the surface these many years ago , Eve stayed safely up in orbit keeping an eye on us - helping us where she could - ever the faithful watchdog . Thank you , Franklin . Well , it appears now our good friends are having a bit of a problem . The biostat chips the Council inflicted on them - they seem to be malfunctioning with rather nasty consequences . You wouldn 't know anything about that , would you , love ? This would be a matter for Council member Reilly . Reilly ? Are the-Are the members of the Council up there now , love , in orbit on the ship ? Citizen Reilly is here . I will summon him . No , wait . - Reilly . - Well , well , well . Devon , Julia and ... all the others . What a delightful surprise . And you 're looking so well , considering . What have you done , Reilly ? What 's going on with the biostat chips ? Now , Devon , calm down . It 's just a little glitch that 's developed in our download-uplink program - or ... upload-down - I can never get that straight . He 's out of his mind . Anyway , it seems that we 've been overamplifying the little buggers , and they 're giving you all headaches . [ Chuckles ] We 're t-terribly embarrassed about all of this . You 're embarrassed ? Reilly , we 're dying . We 've already lost one crew member . You know , Julia , I really hate it when you nag . Nowjust listen to me . All you have to do ... is access Dr. Bennett 's primary architecture directive ... in the Advance team 's C.P.U. , uplink a software fix , downlink a software - Send - Uh - Send it to Eve . Send it up to Eve , and she can begin to effect a repair ... and no more problemo . What do you think of it ? Wait a minute . Why do we need Bennett 's systems ? Why can 't Eve just fix it herself ? Oh , well , perhaps Dr. B. would like to take a crack at that ... since he and Eve have such a ... special relationship . I - I-I 've lost my ball . I have to go . Bennett , is he right ? Can you fix it ? I 'd like to help you . - But I won 't . - You won 't ? What do you mean you won 't ? You get on that system , and you find that repair directive . [ Devon ] John . You uplink us to Reilly , or I 'm - - Or what ? - [ Yale ] Take it easy , John . Bennett . Please . We need your help . Please . I wish I could help you , my dear . But I can 't . [ Gasping Cough ] What 's wrong with them ? It seems to be the Cold-Sleep Syndrome . I told you there might be a problem . It 's not reversible . They 're dying . So are we . Bennett . Please . We don 't have much time . I can 't help you , Devon . Reilly says you can . There is no Reilly . Of course there is . We just saw him . You saw an image , a holographic image ... generated by the computer to humanize communication . Reilly and Eve are one and the same . No . That 's not possible . How do you know this ? Because I created the program - designed , gave her life . There is no Council up there , Devon . No orbiting station . Just a computer - my computer . And though it 'll be my last breathing act , I must be certain ... it dies . [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Beeping ] Reilly ? Reilly , are you there ? We really need to talk about this . " Whan that Aprill , with his shoures soote , the droghte of March hath perced to the roote ... " and bathed every veyne in swich licour , Reilly . of which vertu engendred is - Reilly . ! We 're ready to , uh , downlink , Devon . Bennett won 't unlock his C.P.U. Oh . Reilly . The biostat chips - they let you monitor life signs , right ? That 's right . So then you could home in on their signals . So you 've known exactly where we 've been , haven 't you ? Of course , Devon . The great Council sees all and knows all . So you could 've come for Uly anytime . Yet you haven 't . Why ? Oh , please . We 're not cruel . Are we not men ? Do we not bleed ? No . Because you 're not real . Don 't - Don 't be - [ Voice Distorting ] That is a stupid thing to say . Oh , no , it 's not . Bennett was right . I don 't believe this . You and Eve are one and the same . That 's why you brought us here - because there 's something wrong with you , and it 's the same thing that 's wrong with us . And you need us to fix you ! Good-bye , Devon . [ Voice Changing ] I hope you finally realize how much we need each other . You - [ Exhales ] Bennett . You were right . Eve and Reilly are one and the same . She must have created him to communicate with us . [ Gasping ] Clever girl . Bennett , please . You must help us . Eve , Reilly-whatever it wants to call itself - is failing . You 're right . She has a virus . I gave it to her - imported it deep into her core just before we departed the planet . She never knew what was happening . It was programmed to start destroying her 50 years after our departure - the year we should have arrived back home . Why ? Why would you want to destroy something that you created ? Eve is the Council 's command link to this planet . Without her , they have no more control here . [ Yale ] What about us ? If Eve goes , so do we . We 're sorry . You 're sorry ? You 're sorry ? Come on . You must allow us access to the module 's C.P.U. It 's the only chance we have . Devon , you have no more choice in this matter . No choice ? No choice ? I - I 'm very sorry for what 's happened to you , but there are children here . There are 250 families on their way here now . Pity for them . Pity for them ? Please . What kind of madman are you ? What has happened to you two to turn you into such ... heartless monsters ? That 's enough . No ! It 's not nearly enough ! Okay , okay . You are condemning all these people to death . Can you live with that ? Can you ? Well , I can 't , and I won 't . You are gonna give me those access codes - Devon , control yourself . [ Shouting Continues , Indistinct ] Mom ! Let 's get her away . [ Gasping ] [ Uly ] Let me go . ! Get away from me . Mom . Oh ! Mom . ! Devon ! [ Yale ] Stand back , Uly . She 'll be all right . Julia , help . [ Wincing ] [ Julia ] Let 's just get her back to the tent . [ Danziger ] Come on , Lonz . Give me a hand . [ Exhales ] Better ? I 'm sorry . Don 't talk . Time to rest . John ? The group 's going to need a leader . [ Scoffs ] Don 't even start , Adair . You gotta promise me one thing . You 're gonna take care of Uly . We 're all gonna get through this , Devon . We 're gonna get through it together . You gotta promise me that no matter what happens - if I don 't make it with the rest of you - you 've gotta keep everyone together ... and you 've got to look after my kid . Promise me , John . Okay . [ Tent Flap Rustles ] Julia says you 'd better come to the med tent . He died a few minutes ago . That means the codes died with him . [ Beeps ] Oh . Don 't bother , dear . There 's nothing you can do . When you see the onset of renal failure , just try to make me as comfortable as possible . I wish I 'd gotten to know you better . You must have been among the best to be among the first . I was ... an excitable young girl . They - uh , Franklin , the others - They were ... giants . I thought I was embarking on a wonderful odyssey . I was invulnerable , infallible . The Council made us feel like we were going to ... save the world . I never questioned the Council . It was always so safe . [ Sighs ] It 's a difficult moment when you realize ... you don 't know everything . Isn 't it ? I thought I knew who I was , but I really didn 't until I got here . It 's so beautiful here . It 's just so much more than I ever thought it was gonna be . No matter how hard it 's been , no matter how much we 've lost , I think it was worth it . You found beauty . You found friendship ... and love . I just wish you hadn 't found this planet . Elizabeth , why won 't you help us ? I don 't understand . Because ... we made a terrible mistake when we came here . Terrible . But it 's too late . We 're - Julia . Over at the rail - he just went out on me . I couldn 't get him around . Alonzo . Alonzo . [ Beeps ] No . [ Sighs ] [ Coughing ] Uh , Yale , I need to speak with you . May I see your arm ? You have a full-library function , don 't you ? Yes , I do . I have an idea . But we 'd need Eve - Reilly 's full cooperation . What 's to prevent Reilly from taking the fix for himself and refusing to help us ? All he wants is Uly 's bond to the Terrians . We 're expendable . [ Murmurs ] Not necessarily . I think he needs us as much as we need him . She 's right . It 's just a machine . Without us , there 's no link to the boy , no connection to the planet . Mm . Okay , so we establish the link . That means Yale and Reilly are livin ' in each other , right ? They 'd be one and the same , yes . Reilly 's condition is so unpredictable . What if he were to lose it halfway through the transmission ? Well , there is the potential for sudden feedback , and we 'd be unable to stop the surge . [ Devon ] So we might lose the connection altogether . [ Julia ] That means we 'd have no way of protecting Yale . Options are in short supply . Right , Devon ? This is the last one . [ Julia ] Elizabeth . Reilly 's standing by . We 're ready to go . [ Beeping ] Reilly , are you there ? [ Static ] We 'd like to begin transmission . - Is it gonna be scary ? - Now , Reilly , you really have to concentrate . Think about what you 're doing . We 're all gonna be here to help you . You 're gonna be fine . Just do your best once we get there . [ Female Voice ] Okay , Mom . - Keep going . - [ No Audible Dialogue ] Commencing transmission link . [ Inhales ] I can see ... cyberspace . They 're in . Now use your library functions to find your way to the memory core . Yes . Almost there . Look for Gateway Star 1 3 / 425 . That will be Franklin 's residence . [ Voices Crying Out , Faint ] I can see them . [ Gasping ] I can see the others . I can see their settlements . I can see their children ! [ Moans ] They 're dying . They 're all dying ! [ Murmuring ] What the hell 's he talking about ? Yale , move on . Find Gateway Star 1 3 / 425 . Yes . I can see it now . Approaching . Reilly . Do you see it ? [ Voice Distorting ] Yes , I see , but I 'm locked out . Engage numeric scan . [ Keyboarding ] Begin - 1 3 / 425 . [ Electrical Buzzing ] [ Groans ] - [ Others Groaning ] - [ Electrical Buzzing ] [ Moaning ] What 's happening ? What 's happening ? It 's Reilly . Strain 's too much . He 's unable to control the power surge . Stop it then ! First sentry breached . There are two more . Keep going . [ Breathing Deeply ] D-Difficult . Losing function . [ Julia ] Elizabeth . ! Elizabeth . ! Repeat numeric scale . [ Groaning ] [ Julia ] Elizabeth . ! Oh , God ! Help ! Elizabeth ! Please stop it ! Please stop it . ! - Second sentry breached . - Elizabeth , please ! Julia . ! Julia , where are you ? Stop ! It 's killing us ! - [ Computer Beeping ] - [ Eve ] Third sentry breached . [ Julia ] Please . ! [ Voice Distorted ] I see it . I 've got it . [ Exclaims ] [ Normal Voice ] Commencing uplink . - [ Screaming ] - [ Screaming ] [ Beeping ] [ Systems Powering Up ] [ Gasps ] Oh . Oh , God.Julia ? Julia ? Oh . Yeah . Oh , thank God . Are you okay ? Yeah . Come on . We need to check the others . Danziger ? John ? Danziger , are you okay ? Yeah . [ Murmuring ] Are you all right ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm here . Yale . Yale ? Yale . He 's alive . Oh , thank God . [ Computer Launches ] Well , I hope you all feel better . I know I do . And everything is back to normal - exactly the way it was meant to be . Oh , God . Elizabeth . Here you go . [ Murmuring ] [ Alonzo ] You okay ? [ Exhales ] A lot of people owe their lives to you . [ Murmuring ] Devon . Yeah , I 'm right - I 'm right here . You still - You have no chance here . W-What do you mean ? What are you talking about ? We discovered the truth ... about this planet . You can 't live here . The planet will reject you . Reject us ? [ Murmurs ] - What do you mean , reject us ? - Elizabeth , can you be more specific ? - [ Moaning ] - We 've seen penal colonists here that - [ Moaning ] All dying . But the Terrians - we 've made so much progress . Devon . Millions of lives ... on their way . Look into your hearts . You know what I 'm asking . Elizabeth , tell me . What have you seen ? What did you see here ? Elizabeth ! Oh , my - [ Sobs ] Oh . Oh , look at that . Thanks . Thanks . Hey . How you feelin ' ? A little wobbly , but I 'll be all right . [ Laughs ] I 'd like to rip out those food hydrolizers , but I don 't know where to put them . Oh , let 's leave them . We know where they are if we need them . Are you crazy ? That stuff s valuable whether we use it or not . You know what that goes for on the open market ? We could sell it . To who , Morgan ? Who knows ? Who knows what 's out there ? We 've run into just about everything imaginable on this planet . Sell them . You amaze me , Morgan . [ Devon Narrating ] Eight days , 1 2 hours and some odd minutes after we began to die , we started to live again . But we 've discovered a terrible secret about this planet ... that may doom all of our efforts to survive here . Our only hope may be my son and his special link with this strange new world . I 'm just afraid I won 't live long enough to see if I 'm right . Oh ! [ Gasping ] Hey.Julia ! What happened ? Julia , Yale , come here . ! - [ Julia ] Devon . - [ Chattering ] - [ Bess ] What 's wrong with her ? - [ Danziger ] Give her room to breathe . - [ Julia ] Get my diaglove please . - [ True ] Poor Devon . - [ All Chattering ] - She 's burnin ' up . [ True ] Devon . ! Devon . ! Devon . ! Let me through ! Mom ! Mom ! [ Devon Narrating ] You see , I have a secret of my own . I never had a biostat implant . - My sickness was different . - [ Chattering ] So while the others recover , I remain sick . Mom ! Mom ! Uly . Uly ! [ Voices Murmuring , Fade Out ] I don 't know what it is . It 's a total system failure . - It could be a matter of minutes . - [ Bess ] Oh , my God . We cannot let her die . [ Alonzo ] We have to try . We have no other choice . [ Danziger ] It 's her only hope . Do what you can , Julia . [ Devon Narrating ] My mind is filled with visions of my own death , and I 'm scared . I 'm scared that Bennett and Elizabeth were right - that I will be the first of our kind to prove that ... we cannot live here .

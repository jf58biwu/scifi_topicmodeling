 JEREMIAH CRICHTON Why is it always my fault ? It 's not always your fault , just almost always your fault . Now give that ammiox a bit of a twist , will you ? Not that far , about half as much . Whew . You know , Pilot said that this ... blockage was a ... bi-product of Moya 's pregnancy . Which was probably caused by you firing that chemical burning Earth pod in the transport hangar . Well , you don 't have to worry about that , that was the last of my fuel . I 'm totally dependant on your technology , now . It is not my technology , it 's Leviathan technology . D 'Argo , I don 't give a rat 's ass what you wanna call it . It 's your end of the Universe , it 's your technology ! It sure as hell ain 't mine ! John . Is something wrong ? - Yup . I 'm fed up . - Fed ... up ? Do ... Oh , I 'm sorry . Is this gonna be another translator microbe hiccup ? " Oh John , you 're fed up . Does that mean you 've had too many food cubes , today ? " It was cute . It was vaguely , vaguely amusing the first six billion times . Something clearly is troubling you , John . Perhaps I can ... So , what ? I 'm ... you 're-you 're gonna help ? Is that it ? Maybe . Before , when you were a priest . But guess what ? You resigned . Crichton , I don 't understand , what you 're talking about ! I 'm going for a drive , I 'm hitting the strip , I 'm going crusing . What 's going on ? I 'm getting some space , Aeryn , and I 'm not talking about the space outside the ship . Look , this is hardly the time for Human nonsense , Crichton . Oh ! God ! That is it ! You are so damned smart ! There is no time for any stupid Human anything ! And I 'm sick of it , Aeryn ! I 'm sick of Napoleon the Fourteenth , I 'm sick of Blue , I 'm sick of Tentacle Boy and guess what ? I 'm sick of you ! I 'm sick of this whole turd-burp end of the Universe . Crichton ! I need you down here , this backwash is building up too fast ! Moya is experiencing an extreme increase in her amnexus systems . She senses that her fetus is at risk . - She 's de-compensating . - De-compensating ? - Oh no ! That means she 's going to ... - Prepare for immediate Starburst . John . What 's he doing ? We must warn him ! Pilot , get him back on board ! No time ! You guys are buggin ' out on me ? ! I hate Starburst ! Oh , God , I am a dead man . I wasn 't sure who to bet on ! You or the Shakloom . I wasn 't sure myself . You share with me ? In Acquara , the offering of food by a man to a woman , signals his fondness for her . How do you take it ? Boiled or barbequed ? What 's that ? It is a map of the sky . - Did you make that ? - Yes . By the ancient charts of the Timbala . It is a gift for you . No . Lishala , I uh ... .. That 's beautiful . Thank you . I um ... thought you might show me where your home world is . My home world ... Well , let 's see . On this map ... .... right ... ... about ... ... There . Lishala . Your father demands you return to the village . - Is it my father that demands it , or you , Rokon ? - When would you ever do as I demand ? When you learn to ask nicely . You can teach him that . I see you took a Shakloom . Too bad . A baby . Don 't take them smaller than this . This is Lashala 's map of the sky . Why did she give it to you ? Well , I guess she thought it might help me ... find my way home . She 's never given me such a gift . Rokon , you don 't need a map to get home . You know you 'll never go home . Not from Acquara . You 're probably right . But this is the first place I 've been that makes me feel I can live with that . But the question is , can Acquara ... live with you ? The Grondeer wants to see you . Be there at high sun . So . Another green planet . In yet another unnamed system . Crichton must have landed somewhere . Moya 's Starburst data says that this planet is on an exact reverse trajectory . Along with every other system we 've been through , in the last quarter of a cycle . D 'Argo , we have to admit to ourselves . Whatever happened to John is his own doing . He shouldn 't have left Moya in a time of crisis . We drove him to it . All of us . You 've become so cold . Cold , perhaps . But also practical . We all grow weary of this search . And it places us in greater danger of being discovered by the Peacekeepers . I still care about Crichton . The only reason this search still drags on , is because of the guilt in your own hearts . My hearts are private places . Stay out of them . Aeryn , you have a voice in this , too . Fine , I say we keep looking . For now . You know , D 'Argo . There will come a time when we may have to acknowledge that Crichton has met his destiny , and we are just not part of it . Then I will wait for you to tell me when to abandon the search . When we abandon Crichton . - Alloway , Masata . - Alloway , Masata . Ah ! My honored guest has arrived ! Shei , Shei na ! Shei , enough ! Allowaaay , Masata . Alloway , Masata . You learn our ways , John Crichton . Aw , they 're not so different from my own . Go . I want to talk in private . Come . Sit . - Beside you ? - I know . It 's a privilege awarded only to my best hunters . I wouldn 't wish to dishonor them . But by refusing , you dishonor me . Come . Sit . We have much to discuss . You see ? Not a bad place to sit . - So , you said we have ... much to discuss . - Yes . For instance ... the impulsive flights of my daughter 's heart . You see the way she comes alive when she looks at you ? When I look at her , I see a friend . But if it should become more than that , - you need to understand that ... - Kato-Re . I deeply ... appreciate the way your people have welcomed me . But , I chose to build my home way from the village , because I do not want to interfere ... in your ways . Amongst our people , it is the female who chooses which male she will mate with , for life . It may be out of your hands , dear Crichton . Oh . It appears the Grondeer has invited the stranger to sit beside him . - When was the last time he invited you ? - Only once . When I asked his permission to attract Lishala ! It is obvious that Lishala feels culleh for the stranger . And now he sits in your rightful place ! - I am not blind , mother ! - Oh , not blind ! But perhaps ... weak ? - I am first among the hunters ! - As my son , you are more than any hunter ! You are part of the Priestan lineage , and someday you could be Grondeer of Acquara . I 've seen to that . - But only if you marry Lishala . - I want to marry her ! But not for your reasons ! - How can I control the way she feels ? - I 'm talking about rule of all of this ! And you can 't even master the heart of one foolish girl ? You will do what ever is necessary to insure that no one stands between you and our family 's destiny . Do you understand ? That is the worst pod landing I ever experienced ! - Where did you learn to fly ? ! - We lost all power . - We dropped the last twenty units . - You 're telling me ! Pilot , we 're heads up on the planet . We caught a glimpse of Crichton 's module during our last pass . I acknowledge , D 'Argo . Excellent news . I will inform the others . In the meantime , Moya 's having trouble pinpointing your signal . Can you activate your homing identity , and reconfirm your signal ? Pilot . Pilot ! Communication 's been terminated . Another power loss . Something 's draining all power . D 'Argo ! Where 're you going ? Huh ? I insist you wait for me ! It 's a simple matter , Aeryn . Either you or I jet down there to try to pick up a visual , where we lost contact . We didn 't lose contact , Zhaan . Contact was severed . D 'Argo confirmed that he found Crichton 's module , then he was gone . Which is why we must act quickly . Not without more data . We 're already down one transport pod , let 's not make it two . They could be hurt or need medical attention , or even re-enforcements , Aeryn . You were a lot more agreeable as a peace loving priest . As I assume were you , as a Peacekeeper pilot . I didn 't give up my calling . You did . My personal decision to put aside the spiritual Seek is none of your business . I warn you fairly Aeryn , do not go there . - Is that a threat ? - I will only tell you once . There are lines that we should never cross . Now , I strongly suggest we concentrate on the problem at hand . Mm ? First rule of engagement : before you go into battle , know your enemy . - It is not a battle , Aeryn . It is a rescue . - From what ? There should be some sort of thermal register from the pods propulsion systems , but there 's nothing . Well , then I suggest we find out why . Fine . Because if we don 't ... we 're all we have left . Alloway Masata . Just passin ' through . Is there a problem , here ? Rokon . What 's the deal ? Dammit ... - Rokon ! - I know you do not mean to be an enemy . But you interfere with our ways . I 'm not ... tryin ' to interfere , I 'm just trying to live my life , alone . Then why do you poison Lashala 's heart ? Rokon , you and Lashala ... you 've got nothin ' to worry about from me . But I have to be sure , I have nothing to worry about from Lashala . You smell like dren . You look like dren . Get the hell away from me . We came back for you . That supposed to be a good thing ? You 'd rather those guys have danced all over your face . Huh . Yeah . I would . Now , where ever you came from , go back . That 's when he came flying in . Swinging his powerful blade ... this ... man-creature . A full sanit taller than Tally or Akuma ! - With tentacles and tattoos all over his head ! - You see ? The stranger , this Crichton , infects us like a parasite . Already , he brings more evil into our midst . Remember , our ancestors were space travelers too . We are but colonists here ourselves . Then , you will embrace this man-creature as you 've embraced the stranger ? Perhaps you 'll invite him also to bed with your daughter . Mother ! - You will not dishonor my daughter ! - It 's alright . She knows nothing of my heart and less of my sleeping habits . She should only get some of her own . You try the limits of your rank , Neera . Remember you address the Grondeer . Remember , your office depends upon the sanction of mine . Do not show weakness here , Kato-Re . Our people will not stand for it . Crichton ! You 're alive ! No thanks to you . Get up ! You 're out of here . This isn 't the happy reunion I 'd planned on ! I didn 't plan on one , at all . Not after you abandoned me ! Is that what you really think happened ? You 're the one . Practically sabotaged poor Moya . Then blasted out of there like a Barken out of Hezmana ! I get a little stressed out , and the second I 'm off the ship , boom ! - You guys Starburst the hell out of there . - Moya Starburst on her own ! You forced her to de-compensate when you failed to release the pressure on her amnexus systems . Do you really think ... we abandoned you , when we spent the last quarter of a cycle searching for you ? This whole time ... the last three months ? And you came back . To look for me . A lapse of sound judgement , I regret for the rest of my life . Yup . You just might . The rest of your life . We 'll all regret it if we don 't deal with this negative power vortex . - Which means what , exactly ? - If it uses power , - it doesn 't work . - We 're stuck here ? Oh ! No power , no comforts , no defenses ! Sounds like paradise . Zhaan ! Wake up , Zhaan . I 'm not sleeping , I 'm increasing my work efficiency with a Delvian Wanta Chant . Oh . Well , this might help , come and have a look . Pilot just produced it . Oh , good . It 's a topographic bio print . - Still too generalized , though . - Too generalized for what ? Well , since Moya can 't pick up any power signals from the planet , she 's concentrating instead , on biological markers . What we need to do is ... isolate the most highly developed organisms . Well , that rules out the three we 're looking for . Yes . Well , even if we can locate them , the problem is , how do we help them ? Well , I 've been thinking about that . We need some kind of shielded power source , something that 's hot enough to run their transport pod , that can be built into a projectile . - How do we sent it in , where we can do most good ? - Well , you locate the target , and I 'll hit it . Anyway . Thank God I found this planet . This system . You thought you would stay here the rest of your life ? I haven 't stopped thinkin ' that . Look around , D 'Argo . There 's a lot worse places . Since I left my home ... I 've been hunted . Beaten . Locked up . Shanghaied , shot at . I 've had aliens creatures in my face , up my nose , inside my brain , down my pants . This is the first time ... . the first place ... . where I found peace . Lashala ! Don 't be afraid . - Who are you ? - Lashala , this is D 'Argo ... D 'Argo , Lashala . - Why did you bring him here ? - I-I-I didn 't bring him , he ... .. came on his own . As a friend . Rokon accused your friend of attacking his brothers . That is a lie ! They ambushed Crichton ! It 's lucky I showed up when I did . You 've done nothing to harm us , since you came . Why do they wish to hurt you ? Lashala . Rokon believes that ... your heart ... strays my direction . Perhaps he 's right . No . Look . Y-you and I , that 's um ... nah , that 's not a good idea . We must go to my father , at once . And convince him that your friend D 'Argo is not a threat . Come . I 'll take you . D 'Argo ! This way . D 'Argo ! Stop ! Stop ! What are you doing ? ! Let me go ! Rokon ! Tell them to let me go ! Let-let me go ! Rokon ! Stop it ! Let me go ! - She set us up ! - No she didn 't , so shut up ! Rokon ! I told you ! They don 't-they don 't mean us any harm ! Why won 't you listen to me ? ! Rokon ! Rokon ! Let go of me ! You are charged with the crime of assault against the personal guards of the Grondeer . Gracious Grondeer , you know that I have always told you the truth . This whole thing started when you asked me to sit beside you . It made Rokon think that I was trying to steal Lashala 's heart . - That 's a lie ! - Enough ! My daughter 's heart is not an object to be possessed or stolen . She is free to give it as she chooses . Try telling him that . It 's the stranger that disrupts our peace ! And now his ally , this man-creature threatens our very safety ! The crime of assault against my personal guards carries the sentence of death . No ! Please ! I know they 're not dangerous ! Please ! They 're no threat to us ! Be quiet , or be removed ! But since I believe you are not entirely at fault ... you shall be banished to work the compound at Lomata Kai , for a period of ten cycles ! Kato-Re , you 're wrong . Grondeer , I remind you ! The law is very explicit ! The law is my domain ! Seize that ! Here ! What do you have in there ? It is him ! Alloway , Masata ! It 's him , look ! Alloway , Masata ! So glad you could join us , your Eminence . - Crichton , what the frell is going on ? - I think ... . they think ... you 're God . No . Not a God . But a sovereign . It 's perfectly understandable . My um ... mm uh ... my Empire included tens of thousands of planets and species . This simply must be one of them . You know , this Grondeer 's hut is really quite comfortable . We are nowhere near Hyneria . We are in the Uncharted Territories . What are your subjects doing all the way out here ? There 's no telling how far my influence extends . Uh , may we , your Eminence ? - Hm ? May you what ? - We 're here to bath you . Oh ! You may go . I 'll see to it that no more harm comes to you . How 's it going ? Well , I 've almost finished with the projectile . The shielded power source is another matter , entirely . I don 't know enough of the necessary science to build it . Can 't believe this , but I need Crichton . Well , Moya 's isolated bio-prints of the most complex life forms . See these orange marks here . They indicate habitat . - A settlement . Possibly a village . - And the dark area ? Well , according to Pilot , it 's the focal point of negative power drain . But , look . These three marks , here . Three distinct life forms . - Clearly different from all the others . - Is it possible ? Crichton , D 'Argo , Rygel . Well , we know where to send this , but I have no shielded power source to pack on board . However , we could use it to point them in the right direction . Oh , this is too , too much . Keep it coming . Oh ! Fruit . Shakloom jerky . Oh ! Excuse me , your Eminence . Oh ! Shoo , shoo , shoo . Enter . Your loyal subjects are preparing a little celebration for you . Excellent . Where they officially accept you as their Masata , and you fulfil your part in the Prophecy . Hm ? Which part of what prophecy ? That 's what we 're trying to find out . But they don 't like to talk to strangers about their religion . Religion ? ! Uh ! I told you I 'm their Dominar , not their God ! Well , they don 't think so ! They think you 're some kind of savior . Your Eminence . Doesn 't anybody knock ? Alloway Masata , most humble Masata , forgive me . Your grand celebration is being prepared . Ah , yes , of course . Where I 'm expected to fulfil my part in the prophecy . Now , for my part in the prophecy , I shall require the sacred text . - The Timbala ? - Yes ! Yes ! The Timbala . It is written in the ancient language . There are very few who can read it . Only a Priestan like myself , and of course , you . I look forward to the honor of officiating at the celebration . How did you know about the sacred text ? Where were you brought up ? Every religion 's got one . Look , relax . The answer to the whole Masata thing must be in here , somewhere . - Can you read it ? - It 's in the ancient Hynerian . I had a coultry of tutors all through my youth , who did nothing - but instruct me in the ancient language . - Can you read it ? I will try . Are you immortal too , like the Masata ? When were you going to tell me ? I thought we had a future together ! Lashala . Our futures ... were never meant to be one . Doesn 't matter , anyway . Now that he 's come ! All our futures are different , now . - It is written in the prophecy . - Lashala , what is the prophecy ? He is the Masata . Through the Priestan , he has protected us . Guided us . Ruled us throughout our exile on this planet . Later , after the celebration , he shall rise up and lead us to the light . Wait . You think ... that Rygel is gonna take you off this planet ? Whether we want to go , or not ! Lashala ... Rygel is not a spiritual being . He doesn 't have any special powers . That 's not true ! We 've worshipped his idol , for generations . And now he has returned . Just as it is written in the Timbala . Your Timbala ... your beliefs ... - they 're wrong . A flesh and blood Dominar has ... - No ! - Been presented to you ... As some kind of a God . - It 's not true ! If he is the real Masata , he will rise up and lead us to the light . If he does not prove himself the true Masata tonight , he will suffer a torturous death beyond any other ! And so will you ! Party 's getting started , it looks like you 're the guest of honor . Rygel , you better find something we can use . The ancestors of these people , these Acquarans , they were colonists . Sent out from my Empire during the reign of Rygel the Tenth . They were meant to expand the influence of my people 's monarchy , and they were ... they were abandoned . Rygel the Tenth sent them here . And then he ... . Rygel ? What ? Whatever 's causing the power drain across the planet . It 's intentional . There 's some sort of device , sent by my Empire , that purposely keeps these people on this planet . So that they ... can 't travel . Can 't learn of other cultures . Can 't be anything other than the blind followers of the Family of Rygel . What 's this about you being some kind of a Masata ? A lot of this is new . The Priestans have made it up . Elevated my ancestors and me to Gods . To elevate themselves . But I must tell them . Explain . I 'm Rygel the Sixteenth . They must listen . Rygel , look at them out there . They aren 't preparing for the return of a worldly King . They 're preparing for the return of their savior . Then ... we are frelled . Well , hakuna matata , Masata . We got a big problem . They 're all expecting slug man here is gonna rise up and lead ' em into the light . - We know , it is written in the Timbala . - I-It 's a metaphor , that 's all . A colorful bit of descriptive language to infer the guiding of people to a better way of life ! Listen , Rygel ! To these people , it 's not any damn metaphor ! They are burning their possessions ! They are expecting you to rise up and part the heavens . But I-I can 't do that ! I-I ... Ooooh ! No ! No , wait ! I command you ! Great . This current bio-print reading shows all three targeted life forms ... are very close to the vortex site . Alright , let 's drop it right in their laps . Programming targeting co-ordinates . Clear to launch ... .. ... .. now . She 's on optimal trajectory . If everything goes smoothly , we should have contact in ... We 've lost her . It 's the power vortex . No signal . No data . No contact . She is gone . So . - Now , all we can do is wait . - And pray for a miracle . People of Acquara . Loyal subjects . In this time of-of ... hope ... of-of greater understanding , it is my wish , that you will understand , that we have much to accomplish , together , as a united people , before um ... and uh ... by my hand , uh ... I shall rise up , and lead you to the light . So ! As we embark together , on this great journey forward , uh ... could uh , take a very long time . I ... No ! It is written that the Masata will rise up , and lead us to the light . But that 's just a metaphor ! Uh ... and as your leader , your Dominar , - I command that you should wait ... - The sacred Timbala does not command us to wait ! It states without question , " by the hand of the Masata , shall he rise and lead us to the light " ! Rise and lead us to the light ! Rise up , and lead us to the light ! Listen ! Listen to me ! I-I ... I can 't . False God , he 's not the Masata ! False God ! But I never was a God ! Seize him ! - Crichton ! - D 'Argo , let me go ! Crichton ! Crichton , help me ! For God 's sake ! D 'Argo , they 're gonna fry Rygel ! Well , we 'll be no help to anyone if they fry us , too ! - Okay . I give up . What is it ? - It 's from Moya . Thermal storage casing . Looks like the girls are ... tryin ' to send us a message . That 's co-ordinates . You have been wronged ! Horribly wronged by my Empire ! I admit that ! But your belief that I am a God is also wrong ! Let me explain ! Please ! Let me explain ! - This is how it must be . - No it is not . Why can 't we decide our own fate , make our own rules ? Stop ! Let him go . You 've been betrayed . All of you . You 've been forced to live on this planet against your will , as were your ancestors before y ... - Don 't listen to him ! - There is a device ! A device which drains all power sources , it keeps your machinery from working . - There is no device ! - This device ... sends out an invisible pulse which blankets the entire planet 's surface . When your ancestors first arrived at this planet , their star ships functioned ! As did all the machines that they left behind . But you 've been lied to . First by those who left you here , and then by the Priestans . You dare attack the Priestans ? - That 's the highest sacrilege ! - No ! The highest sacrilege is purposely keeping your own people ignorant ! - And subjugated , for your own glorification ! - Lies ! - You have no proof of anything ! - Yes , I have ! In the Timbala . But only the priestans have read it . If it is true , that would mean the Priestans have lied to us , for generations . That cannot be ! Kill him , Rokon . He 's mad . Just kill him . - Don 't , Rokon . - Kill him , Rokon ! Kill him , Rokon ! If what you are saying is true , then where is this device ? Where is it ? ! I 'm not entirely sure , Rokon . But the people from my ship just sent the co-ordinates . Just give me a chance to find it ! By the hand of the Masata , shall he rise up and lead us to the light ! Sparky , you 're up ! D 'Argo ! Rygel , I need you to press in your hands , right there ! No . Cease . I command it . I have not risen . I am not a deity . I am but a worthy being like yourselves . But I am your sovereign . The slug who would be King . I wish you could stay here with us , Dominar . Oh , as do I , my friend . As do I. But , I must continue on my journey . And if those Peacekeepers I mentioned should arrive here ... We shall tell them nothing of your visit . Provisions , for your journey ? Hm ? Oh ! Oh ! This is so generous , I-I wish I had more of a gift for you . You 've given us the greatest gift of all , Dominar Rygel . You 've given us our freedom . Now we can stay in our beloved Acquara . And so you do not forget us ... we 've prepared you a special gift . Shakloom jerky ! Good . Yeah . - You take care of her , Rokon . - I will . - Your mother , will she ... ? - She will survive her displacement . You 've often said you loved this place . Why don 't you stay and help us rebuild ? I wish I could . But my future is with my own kind . I 'll continue my journey . - We 'll miss you . - Crichton ! It 's time to go ! Gotta go . Guess I got some apologies to make up on the ship . Zhaan , Aeryn , you . Forget about that . Was it worth the trouble , Human ? Hah . What trouble ? Let 's hit the road .

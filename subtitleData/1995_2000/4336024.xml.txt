 What do you see , Mr. Paris ? Shoes ... muddy shoes . The dog . Good . That 's exactly what you should see . But that isn 't possible . I 'm sure it 's disorienting to see yourself through another man 's eyes . No , I ... Tolen ! Now I understand . I 'd better be on my way . You don 't have to go , Tom . He 's got no right . No right ? This is my home ! You come into my home and steal my wife , and I have no right ? ! That 's not the way it happened . This isn 't the way it happened ! The trial 's over , Mr. Paris . There 's no point to further denials . I know about you , Paris . I know you were in prison . That has nothing to do with ... We 'll see what your Captain has to say about this . When I 'm finished with you , you 'll never wear that uniform again ! I can 't let you do that . No , Tom ! Don 't ! Stop ! No . I didn 't ... Tom , no ! Let the record show that the sentence of the court has been carried out . For the rest of his natural life , once every 14 hours , Thomas Eugene Paris will relive the last moments of his victim 's life . May the fates have mercy on you , sir . If the hydroxyproline level is elevated this high , you 'd probably call for a pancreatic scan . That 's exactly what I 'd call for . All right , then . Let 's run through the osteographic series again . Just enter the responses you 're sure about . So have you given any more thought to a name ? I asked the Captain for one . Why don 't you choose one yourself ? Choose one myself ? Me ? Well , thatjust isn 't ... Holograms are programmed , Kes . They don 't choose anything for themselves . Why not ? Because we 're not capable of choosing . Well , you choose what medical treatment to give someone . I 'm programmed with over five million possible treatments , with contingency programs and adaptive programs , but it 's all programs upon programs upon programs . There 's no independent decision-making . I don 't see the difference . The difference is ... I base decisions on information stored inside my brain . How is that so different from the way you access your programs ? Well , if you put it that way ... Do your programs have any names in them ? Certainly . I have the names of Starfleet doctors , their patients ... medical personnel in historical and literary contexts ... So pick a name . Just ... pick one ? Pick a name you like- - perhaps from someone who inspires you . Doctor ... Dr. Galen . Dr. Salk . Doctor ... Those are good . ... Spock . Can you see yourself with any of those names ? Not exactly . Take your time . After all , you will be that name for the rest of your life . Hmm . I never even considered that I had a life . Janeway to Sick Bay . Activate emergency medical holographic program . I 'm already on , Captain . What can I do for you ? We 've got an incoming shuttle with an injured crewman on board . Any details ? It 's either Ensign Kim or Lieutenant Paris . We haven 't been able to raise them . Sensors indicate damage to various subsystems . You 're sure there 's only one life sign aboard ? That is confirmed , Captain . Transport him to Sick Bay . I 'll be down there . Mr. Tuvok ? They made me leave without him . He 's severely dehydrated . No sleep . Neodextraline solution ? Prepare an I.V. Can you tell us what happened to Paris , Mr. Kim ? They made me leave without him . They said he 'd committed a ... a murder . Do you have any idea who the victim was ? An engineering physicist we were working with . His name was Tolen Ren . The Banean Minister of Science introduced us to him just after we 'd arrived . So , from the other side of the galaxy . 70,000 light-years , give or take a few . That 's a long trip home with a damaged collimator . If anybody on this world can help you , Professor Ren can . He 's developed four generations of navigational arrays for our ships . We have to stay one step ahead of our neighbors , the Numiri . Did you bring your ship 's specifications with you ? It 's all here . Splendid . Why don 't we begin to look it over at my home this evening ? My wife would be delighted to have company for supper . There was no reason to say no , but if we hadn 't gone with him that night , none of this would 've happened . Oh , come on now , Neeka , stop that racket . They 're friends ! That 's better . That 's better . What a good doggie . What a good doggie . Oh , dearest ? Are you dressed ? We have guests . I should have called . I just don 't think of the common courtesies . She 's really wonderful about , uh , tolerating my dreadful manners . So , you 've done it to me again . Yes , dear . I apologize . Lidell , this is Ensign Harry Kim and Lieutenant Tom Paris . They 're from the other side of the galaxy . Hello . Nice to meet you . You might have called . You 're absolutely right . Do you have enough to feed us all or shall we go out ? No , it 's fine . I have some leftover rolk from yesterday . I 'll just throw it in the stew . Wonderful ! Gentlemen , make yourselves at home . I 'm going to put on my slippers . Lidell will take good care of you . Would you like a drink ? Sure . Help yourself . What are you looking at ? Not the same thing that you 're looking at , that 's for sure . What are you looking at ? If it 's spoiled , Neeka wouldn 't eat it . Nothing too fancy or exotic around here . We 're very simple folks . You 're very kind to include us at your supper table . We enjoy an occasional guest . I think Lidell would prefer us to entertain more often than we do , yes ? She 's , uh , far more social than I am . I 'm afraid she gets a little bored here sometimes . I 'm so consumed with my work . And here we are bringing more of it home to take your husband 's attention away for the evening . Whether you were here or not makes no difference . Tolen would work anyway . I 'm afraid she 's right . We are at war , after all . By the way , how did you get past the Numiri patrols ? Lieutenant Paris is our best pilot . Captain Janeway decided not to take our ship into orbit . She wanted to avoid getting involved in your conflict . So we came in on a shuttlecraft that would avoid immediate detection by the Numiri . I hid behind the limb of the moon before I made a break for your defense perimeter . By the time their sensors picked us up , they didn 't have a chance to catch us . Well done ! Finished already ? The meat doesn 't taste right . Well ... we do have a lot of work to get done . Perhaps we should begin . We went into the other room and started to work on the navigational beam specifications . It was pretty dry stuff- - you know , rewriting baseline code algorithms . Tom got bored . He left us alone for a while . I guess he was with Mrs. Ren . I know they saw each other again the next day . That was the night Professor Ren was murdered . Did you talk to Lieutenant Paris after he was detained ? No , they never let me see him . They interrogated me for almost two days straight . They asked me a lot of questions about the Numiri . At first , they must have thought we were Numiri agents or something . Professor Ren was the inventor of Banean warship technology . He 's completely exhausted . Can some of this wait until he 's had a chance to rest ? We 'll find out about Paris , Mr. Kim . Janeway to Chakotay . Go ahead . Set a course for the Banean homeworld , Commander . Aye , Captain . Come in . You sent for me , Captain ? Lieutenant Paris has gotten himself into trouble . I 'm taking this ship into orbit while we try to sort things out . Be prepared to be intercepted by Numiri patrols . They always try to intimidate travelers to the Banean planet . The stakes are too high to send a shuttlecraft this time . I want to show our flag to make it clear we mean business . I understand . Based on your experience , what can we expect the Numiri to do to " intimidate " us ? To be honest , whenever I saw the Numiri coming , I always left before the intimidation began . Before ... Uh , however , uh , I know from , uh , knowledgeable sources that they have directed-energy weapons comparable to your own- - uh , our own , that is- - plus regenerative shields that may even give them a certain advantage over us in a fire fight . Tell me about them , as a people . Are they aggressive , technical , intellectual , emotional ? Anything that might help me deal with them . The Numiri and the Banea are quite different from one another , even though they once coexisted on the same planet . That 's why I recommended the Banea to you in the first place . The Numiri have a remarkably covert society . Captain to the Bridge . On my way . We 're scanning a Numiri vessel approaching . They 're at combat readiness , Captain . Shields up . On screen . Mr. Neelix ? A standard patrol vessel . Curious . Why ? I would have expected them to send out more than one tiny patrol to meet a ship like this . Let 's hope it 's a positive sign . Hail them . They 're responding . Open a channel . I am Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation Starship Voyager . What is your business in this system ? One of my crewmen is being held on the Banean planet . We 're on our way to investigate . Consider this official notice that you are entering a war zone . You do so at your own risk . Understood . Any attempt to provide aid or supplies to the Banea will be considered an act of war against the Numiri . You have my word that we intend to remain neutral in your conflict . Our only interest is in our own crewman . Proceed . Your activities will be monitored . Very , very curious . In Numiri terms , that greeting was downright friendly . Have all security stations remain at full alert . Continue long-range scans for Numiri patrols around the clock . Aye , Captain . Take us into orbit . Captain , it 's unfortunate we must meet under these circumstances . My Chief of Security- - Lieutenant Tuvok . Please . Exactly what are these circumstances , Minister ? All we know is that a member of our crew has been accused of murder . Oh , I 'm afraid he 's been more than just accused . He 's been convicted and punished according to our law . What form of punishment ? The perpetrator of a murder is forced to relive the crime through his victim 's eyes . How is this achieved ? I can have our Chief Medical Officer describe the procedure in detail , if you wish . We have the capability of isolating memory engrams in the brain . We take them from the final moments of life . After they 're used in the trial , they 're transplanted into the perpetrator 's brain . These memories ... are used in the trial as evidence ? An artificial life-form serves as host to the engrams and testifies to their content . In this case , the victim 's last memories clearly show Mr. Paris caught in ... an embarrassing episode with Mrs. Ren . An argument ensues . Paris is then seen by the victim 's own eyes killing him . The evidence of his guilt is incontrovertible . Captain . Are you all right , Tom ? I 've been better . May we speak to him alone ? Of course . That rehab colony back in New Zealand doesn 't seem so bad right now . Lieutenant , did you murder Professor Ren ? No . But the victim 's own eyes identified ... You don 't have to tell me what the victim 's own eyes saw , Captain . I don 't understand it either , but I did not kill him . Were you having improper relations with his wife ? Their marriage was over . She told Ren they were finished the same day he was killed . That does not answer my question . Nothing happened between us . Almost nothing . Tom ... it 's very important you tell us everything . Harry said you spent some time with Mrs. Ren while he and the Professor were working . I was bored . You know how it is when two science guys get together . I came out of the other room , looked over and saw her in the atrium . Her eyes were a million kilometers away- - staring at stars I 'd just flown by the day before . Smoking is a bad habit . My species gave it up centuries ago when we finally got it into our heads it was killing us . You must be a very superior species . That 's ... not what I meant . Maybe I kill myself slowly because I don 't have the courage to do it quickly . Now , why would you go and say a thing like that ? - Don 't . - What ? Don 't get involved , Lieutenant . I wasjust trying to ... You 'll be sorry . Look , I wasjust bored to tears in the other room , and I thought you might like to talk . Why don 't you go ahead and ask me ? Ask you what ? What you 've been wanting to ask me all night ... what they all want to ask me . Why I 'd marry a man old enough to be my father . I 'd be lying if I said I hadn 't been wondering . He was good to me . A lot of other men weren 't . That sounds like a good enough reason to me . He 's a good man . I would never do anything to hurt him . I guess ... that makes you a good woman . " Good " can get very ... boring . No , Tom ! Don 't . No . I ... Stop ! No ! What 's going on ? No ! No ! Apparently , he 's entering another cycle . Is this normal ? We had some problems integrating the Banean engrams into his alien neurology . This is the first time he 's lost consciousness since the implant . I 'd like to take him back with us to our medical facility . I 'm sorry , but I can 't authorize that . Perhaps we should consider her request , Minister . We don 't want to risk general synaptic failure . Their doctors might be better suited to stabilize his condition . All right , but you 're not to leave orbit with him . Minister , we don 't intend to leave orbit until we prove his innocence . Away team to Voyager . Three to beam up . It 's medicine clearly beyond anything we 've ever encountered before . What bothers me the most is the neural pathway damage it seems to be causing . It appears to be progressive . Then this punishment could actually be causing serious brain damage . How long it might be before he 's seriously affected , I really have no idea . I would appreciate receiving a copy of your neurological analysis , Doctor . It 's extremely technical . To the layman , it would be virtually indecipherable . Nevertheless , I will want to examine it in detail . This might be the basis for an appeal of the sentence , don 't you think ? Perhaps . However , before the neural implants were developed , the Banean punishment for murder was lethal injection . It is possible they would view that as the only alternative sentence in this case . Will he regain consciousness ? I believe so , but each time the cycle repeats , I 'm afraid his brain will take another damaging blow . When he wakes up , I will require an autonomic response analysis while I question him again , Doctor . Do you really think Tom would lie to us ? As an investigator , I do not have the freedom to ignore any possibility . Mr. Paris maintains his innocence , yet the victim has identified him from the grave , and the victim 's wife has testified against him at the trial . Someone is obviously lying . An ARAwill tell us if it is Mr. Paris . I 'll have it ready for you . In the meantime , Captain , I request permission to return to the surface . What do you have in mind , Tuvok ? I would like to examine the murder scene and speak with Mrs. Ren . Mrs. Ren ? Yes ? I 'm Lieutenant Tuvok of the Starship Voyager . Would you mind if I asked you a few questions ? Are you a friend of Tom 's ? I am the Starfleet Chief of Security investigating his alleged participation in your husband 's murder . Stop it , Neeka . Shejust doesn 't like strangers . Based on your testimony , I assume this is where the murder occurred . Yes , right there . I had to have a professional cleaning crew come in to remove the bloodstain . You chose to remain in the house after an act of such violence occurred ? This has been my home for over ten years , Mr. Tuvok . Do you really find that so hard to believe ? I am a Vulcan , Mrs. Ren . By nature , we are a dispassionate people . It is rare to encounter someone as dispassionate as we are . Dispassionate ? Is that how I seem to you ? I think you 'd get an argument from Tom Paris . Can I get you a drink ? Thank you , no . Mind if I have one ? Please . You testified at the trial that you and your husband had an argument the afternoon before he was killed . I never said there was an argument , Lieutenant . Have you ever had to end a marriage ? No . Are you married ? My wife and I have been married for 67 years . I 'm sure she 's a fine , dispassionate woman . I hope you never have to find out for yourself , but I can tell you , ending a marriage ... it 's a quiet thing . The arguments are long over and there 's really nothing much left to say at all . May I ask why you decided at this time to end your marriage to Professor Ren ? Because I was attracted to another man . I didn 't want to deceive my husband . That other man was Lieutenant Paris ? Lieutenant Paris would have been departing this planet in a few days , and yet , you left your husband of ten years for him . Meeting Tom gave me the push I needed . I already knew in my heart that it was time to start over . Exactly when did you see Mr. Paris on the day of the murder ? I went to see him at the Engineering Institute after I talked with my husband . Once I was free , I knew he wanted to be with me . How did you know ? Awoman knows , Lieutenant . He left his friend Harry to finish the technical research and walked me home . We were caught in a cloudburst on the way . Oh , I 'm completely soaked . There must be a centimeter of water in my boots . Here , let me help you . We shouldn 't . It 's okay . He knows it 's over . But you 're still a married woman . I haven 't been married for years , Tom . To him , I 'm a friend , a companion . He hasn 't treated me like a woman since ... It must have been the day of the eclipse four years ago . Eclipse ? He was very excited by the eclipse . Don 't ask me why . Our timing 'sjust a little off . You 'll be gone in a few days . This is the only time we 've got . Let me make you something to warm you up . I love to drink Marob root tea on rainy afternoons . I made some tea . We talked for a while . Then we went out to the atrium to watch the storm ... and the rest you know . Did you leave the room at any time during the fight between your husband and Lieutenant Paris ? I saw Tom murder my husband , Mr. Tuvok . I tried to stop him . I couldn 't . Voyagerto Tuvok . This is Lieutenant Tuvok . Mr. Paris has regained consciousness . I thought you 'd want to know . Thank you . I 'll be returning shortly . Tuvok out . Thank you for your help , Mrs. Ren . Lieutenant . When you see Tom ... would you tell him that I ... forgive him ? Everything she told you is true . Except I don 't remember going into the atrium or anything else after that . The last thing you remember is ? Sitting with her , drinking tea ... talking about the sensual effects of eclipses ... After that I must have fallen asleep . When I woke up , I was in a cell . He 's telling you the truth . Was there any evidence of a sedative in his system when he returned here ? The Banean medical authorities checked him . They didn 't find any drugs in his blood . Most narcotics would have been gone from his system by the time he got to me . Chakotay to Tuvok . You 're needed on the Bridge . We 're under attack by Numiri patrols . On my way , Commander . Evasive pattern Beta 140 . Dual attack mode . Evasive pattern confirmed . They 're attempting to lock a tractor beam on us . That is a standard tactic for the Numiri when they intend to board your vessel . Well , at least now you know I was telling the truth about them , Captain . Although I take no pleasure in being right , mind you . But why now ? Why an unprovoked attack ? What are they after ? The Numiri have never needed an excuse to attack anyone . Shields at 90 percent and holding . Commander , prepare to initiate attack maneuver Kappa 010 . Captain , if you don 't mind ... there 's a Maquis trick we sometimes use to get out of situations like this . Be my guest . B 'Elanna , remember Teluridian iv ? The two Starfleet runabouts ? I 'm with you . Blowing out the dorsal phase emitters . Torres to Engineering . Go ahead . Vent a couple of In-2 exhaust conduits along the dorsal emitters . Make it look like we 're in serious trouble . Understood . Cut all engines . Engines off-line . Tuvok , lock phasers on their navigational deflectors . Acknowledged . Numiri ships are closing . 4,000 kilometers . Not to belittle Maquis tactics , Commander , but this is a very old trick . It worked against those Starfleet runabouts . You 're lucky I wasn 't commanding one of them . 2,000 kilometers . Besides , out here in the Delta Quadrant , every old trick is new again . 1,500 kilometers . They 're sending out tractor beams again . That 's our cue . Fire phasers . Engage impulse engines . Both Numiri vessels are disabled , Captain . That 's one trick you won 't be able to use again when we get back . I have more . Cancel Red Alert . Take us into high orbit . Captain . More Numiri will be coming . I promise you . Mr. Tuvok , any progress with your investigation ? Based on the ARA , I am convinced Lieutenant Paris believes what he is saying . However , I can offer no tangible evidence on his behalf . Considering the urgency of the situation , I believe the only logical alternative at this time is to witness the crime myself . Yourself ? I propose a mind-meld with Lieutenant Paris . A-a what ? What , what did he say ? A mind what ? Let me tell you something , Lieutenant . Believe it or not , I know more about mind-melds than you do . I know what every Vulcan doctor has said in every study of mind-melds , and I still cannot tell you what will happen if you do this . If these cycles cause damage to a human brain , there 's no telling what the risk might be to a Vulcan . I 've examined your neurological reports , Doctor , and I believe the risk is acceptable . - Tuvok ... - Captain ... the answers I seek can only be found in the eyes of the murdered man . It may be our only chance to prove Lieutenant Paris innocent . Tom ? Tolen ! Now I understand . I 'd better be on my way . You don 't have to go , Tom . He 's got no right . No right ? This is my home ! You come into my home and steal my wife , and I have no right ? ! That 's not the way it happened . We 'll see what your Captain has to say about this . When I 'm finished with you , you 'll never wear that uniform again . I can 't let you do that . No , Tom , don 't . Stop ! No ! The cycle 's ended . No neural damage that I can detect . Captain , I must consult with Ensign Kim immediately . With Kim ? Why ? I assume he has access to Professor Ren 's research . I believe it will explain not only why Lieutenant Paris has been accused of a murder he did not commit , but also why the Numiri chose to attack us . His condition has continued to deteriorate . He 'll have serious brain damage if the implants are not removed . We are not a barbaric people , Captain . This was meant as punishment not torture . I see no alternative but to remove the implants , do you ? There is no legal precedent , of course , but we can petition the courts immediately . I cannot assure you 'll find an alternative sentence more to your liking . We 're still committed to proving his innocence , Minister . When do you intend to return him to our custody ? Due to the nature of his condition , we 're concerned that our transporting device might cause further medical complications . So we 're sending him back by shuttlecraft . They 'll leave this ship in one hour . I 'll make the necessary preparations . This is all your fault , you know ? My fault ? Yeah , I consider you the conscience I never had . You 're supposed to keep me on the straight and narrow . I tried to warn you . Funny , so did she . If it had been me , I would have stayed as far away from her as possible . Someday it will be you , Harry . You 'll meet her , and you 'll know it 's wrong from the first moment you see her . And you 'll know there 's nothing you can do about it . Here they come . Numiri patrol approaching , bearing 067 mark 24 . Red Alert . On screen . Range , 100,000 kilometers and closing . They 're changing course , Captain . They 're going straight for the shuttle just as you said they would , Lieutenant . Shuttle to Voyager . They 've locked a tractor beam on us . Offer no resistance , Harry . Acknowledged . Hey , Tuvok . I know it 's a little late to ask , but you 're sure you 've got the logic of this thing worked out ? If I am incorrect , we will know it shortly . Well , that makes me feel a whole lot better . We 're being boarded . He 's the one . This is Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation Starship Voyager . You have illegally seized one of our shuttlecraft . I warned you that you were entering a war zone at your own risk . Yes . We appreciated that warning and took appropriate precautions . If you read the sensor readouts in front of you , you will see that the shuttle is carrying 40 tons of thalmerite explosives- - enough to destroy your ship . I 'm prepared to detonate those explosives in 30 seconds if you do not release our vessel . End transmission . The shuttle 's being released . The Numiri ship is withdrawing . Tractor the shuttle and take us into low orbit . Cancel Red Alert . Mr. Paris , how soon before your next cycle ? Seven hours . That should be enough time to clear this up . Mr. Tuvok , this is your show now . With your permission , I would like to invite all interested parties to meet at the scene of the murder in two hours . I 'll invite the Minister myself . Lieutenant Paris was not the man Professor Ren saw before he was murdered . Not the man ... But it was clearly established at the trial . It is true . Paris ' image was seen in the memories examined during the trial . However , that is because someone altered the engrams from Professor Ren 's brain . But that simply isn 't possible for this procedure . I would suggest , sir , that there is no such thing as a technology that is entirely safe from tampering . You 're forgetting one thing . I was here and I saw him do it . On the contrary , I have not forgotten your statement , Mrs. Ren . However , I now know it is clearly false . Just what was in that tea you gave me , Lidell ? Is thisjust idle speculation , or do you have some evidence ? Mr. Paris , would you please stand next to Mrs. Ren ? What for ? If you wouldn 't mind . The man Professor Ren observed with his wife was virtually equal in height to her . Clearly , Lieutenant Paris is several centimeters taller . How do you know what my husband saw ? Vulcans have the ability to meld telepathically with another 's mind . I observed your husband 's memories as Lieutenant Paris went through his cycle . I watched as the killer stabbed Professor Ren right here , through the intercostal space between the eighth and ninth right ribs- - the exact location of the Banean heart . The killer clearly knew Banean anatomy . Lieutenant Paris did not . Are we supposed to take your word for all of this ? There is additional evidence . For example , we can now say for certain that Professor Ren was murdered by a Numiri agent . What ? Lieutenant , did you notice the stream of symbols and numbers that were superimposed on the images ? Symbols ? Well , yeah , I guess I did . I didn 't know what they meant . I thought they were part of the procedure . In researching this procedure , I found no other reference to this phenomenon . I have now confirmed that these symbols and numbers were equations taken from Professor Ren 's weapons research . Someone intended them to be delivered to the Numiri . You 're saying somebody used his brain to send secret data to our enemy ? He was a logical courier . The Numiri agents knew he could leave the planet 's surface without raising suspicion . The Numiri made two attempts to gain access to Mr. Paris . They attacked just after he returned to Voyager , and then again when he was in the shuttle . Someone on the surface had to be informing the Numiri of Lieutenant Paris ' movements . Do you know who did this ? You knew when Mr. Paris would be in transit , Minister . But the doctor is the one who encouraged you to release him to our custody . He is also the one who performed the implant procedure . I know of no one else who had the opportunity and knowledge to carry out this plan . I 'm not going to listen to any of this . I really would like you to listen , Doctor . Would you please stand again , Mrs. Ren . So we 're the same height . It proves nothing . I never saw this woman prior to the death of her husband . I was never even in this house before today . You forget the other witness who was here on the night of the murder , Doctor . Would you mind asking her to come in ? It appears that you are no stranger to Neeka , Doctor . He lied to me , Tom . No one was supposed to get hurt . You know I could never do anything to hurt you . Yeah . You could . Tuvok . Mr. Paris . There are some who 'd say you risked my future on the eyewitness identification of a dog . It seemed a necessary step to ensure a truthful resolution . Well ... I appreciate you sticking up for me . I owe you one . I conducted a criminal investigation . If you had been guilty , I assure you I would have pursued the truth just as vigilantly . You have no debt to me , Mr. Paris . How come I always see you down here eating alone , Lieutenant ? I prefer to read rather than engage in ... What do humans call it- - short talk ? Close enough . You don 't make many friends that way . Perhaps . Well , like it or not , you 've made one today , Mr. Tuvok .

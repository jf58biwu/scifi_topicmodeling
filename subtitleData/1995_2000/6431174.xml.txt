 Oh , yes . I 'd like to speak to the chancellor about- - no . No , this is Dean Albright . Right . Lunch time , Mary ! Shh . Shh . Shh . No , I 've already left 3 messages . I 'll call back later . What 's his problem ? Who ? The chancellor . If I didn 't know any better , I 'd swear he was avoiding me . Why would he be avoiding you ? You 're the Dean . And you 've done an exemplary job . You think so ? Yes . You 've done nothing offensive . You haven 't caused a single ripple on the pond . No controversial proposals , no expensive cutting-Edge teachers , no innovative ideas to shake up the status quo . You 've been almost invisible . Well , I did institute those slanted parking spaces in the faculty lot . Yeah , and no one cared . Oh , come on , Mary , you 've lasted 6 months in a job that none thought you could keep and even fewer thought you deserved . It 's your half-year anniversary . I 'll call some people . We 'll have a party . Oh , I can 't . I have that advisory board meeting . No , you don 't . Yes , I do . No . They changed that meeting to this morning . Well , they said they called you . Nobody called me . Then I guess you missed it . Look , I 'm gonna grab a sandwich and place a quick bet . I 'll be back . Well , now , that ... is suspicious . But now we can have that party ! [ Door closes ] Hello , Sally . Oh , hey , Don . Thanks for bringing my stuff . No problem . This is always the most awkward part of a breakup . Well , you mean seeing each other for the first time after it happens ? No , I mean making sure you get your good stuff back . Oh , right . Well , here 's your box . Wow . Oh , my suede belt . My bathroom light . I didn 't leave this here . It was screwed in over my sink . And it was tough to get off , let me tell you . We don 't like tuna melts , Ok ? All : ohhh . It 's Ok , you guys . Forgive us , we 're idiots . That 's all right . I was just leaving . Oh , no . You can come back anytime . Cut it out . I 'm fine . You look great . Of course . Sure , you are . Don : shut up ! This must be hard for you . No , it 's Ok . Well , that 's a cry for help if ever I heard one . Now , you listen to me , girl . Put this down . You have got to go someplace quiet and beautiful . A place where you can just sit and look out over the water and think about your life . Think about who it is that you want to be . Yeah . Where 's that ? Riverboat gambling on the Cincinnati queen , baby ! Yee-haw ! Yeah , I heard about that . Yeah , yeah , yeah , it 's a floating casino the size of 2 football fields . Hold up . 2 football fields ? Dos footbalito . Oh , yeah . I 'm in , baby . I 'm gonna start packing . [ Clears throat ] Mary , I 'm sorry I missed your half-Year anniversary party . I was there in spirit . Well , then maybe your spirit wouldn 't mind ponying up 13 bucks ? Oh , that 's Ok . Judith , did you get a call that the board meeting was moved up ? No.Oh. Ok . It was in the memo . There was a memo ? Oh . Oh , chancellor , I 'm so glad you stopped by . I was wondering if I could get your ear for just- - actually , I was hoping to talk to Judith for a moment . Oh . If you could spare just a minute , though , I 'd like to talk to you about the schedule for next summer session . Next summer ? I wouldn 't worry about that , Mary . That 's a long way off . " Don 't worry about next summer . " What 's that supposed to mean ? It means you might not be here by next summer . What ? No . No , I 'm probably just overreacting . Perhaps . And perhaps not . Oh , Dick . Think about it , Mary . The clues are all there . What clues ? Think , Mary . Who 's having mysterious liaisons with the chancellor ? Judith . And who happened to receive the strangely elusive memo about this morning 's meeting ? Judith . And when you got named as Dean , who called you an undeserving ass-Kisser behind your back ? Judith ! She was among them , yes . I can 't believe it . You better believe it , Mary . There 's a stink in the air , and for once , the majority of it is not me . See , you got your blackjack table right there , that 's the wheel of fortune . Over there , that 's the baccarat . See them tables over there ? They 're for craps . Where 's Harry ? I don 't know , and I don 't care . 'Cause Vicki and I are having a girls ' night out . Am I right ? Oh , we 're gonna gonna break some hearts , baby ! Yee-haw ! Whoo ! Let 's go . Jackpot ! Yeah ! Check it out , Tommy . This is the loosest machine on the boat . Harry , it 's a change machine . That 's right . It 's changing me into a winner . Cocktails . Harry , let 's go . People want to use the machine . Oh , well , I 'm sure that they do . Come on , baby . Money comes to money . Come on , mama . [ Machine dispenses change ] Yeah ! Judith . How are you doing ? Fantastic . Funny thing . I was thinking about what you and chancellor Stevens were discussing this morning . You know about the , um , the , uh ... what were you talking about again ? I 'm sorry . That was a private conversation . Yeah , of course it was . I--I understand . By the by , Jude- - and I call you Jude because we 're so close- - Mary and I have had a falling out . We 're over . And I 'd like to get a good plot going against her . Got anything on that ? Dick , I have a class . No , you don 't . Ok , just leave . Tell me what 's going on between you and the chancellor and I will never set foot in your office again . Fine . You know chancellor Stevens' annual badger day address ? Oh , that insipid yawn fest ? I write them for him . Last year 's was tremendous . You might want to trim about an hour out of it this time . Oh , hey , Jude . Gotta go . I 'll see you later . Badger day address . How stupid does she think I am ? I know . And did you see the way she rushed you out of her office ? And how about how she slipped that document into her desk . Pretty subtle , huh ? That bitch wants my job ! This goes out to the lovely ladies in the corner both . Here we go . ♪ I left a good job in the city ♪ ♪ working for the man every night and day ♪ ♪ but I never lost one minute of sleep , no ♪ Sally , I 'm telling you , this guy is like among the top 5 Neil diamond impersonators that I have ever seen . He is so hot . He 's hot as hell . I don 't know , Vicki . I 've just got this , like , urge coming over me . I just want to throw something up on that stage . You mean like your panties ? What 's he gonna do with my panties ? I 'm gonna throw him a buffalo wing . Sally , Sally , no , no , no . Nina , come over here . Who 's that strange man lurking outside ? It 's Roberto . He waters the plants . Ah . The one with the listening device ? It 's a hearing aid . Yeah . Right . Nina , I need your help . A few weeks ago I saw you hold the elevator for chancellor Stevens' assistant Ruth . Yeah . So ? It 's time to call in that favor . Get her to fax over a log book of every call he 's made over the last 6 months . No , better make it a year . Dr. Solomon , will you stop worrying ? There 's no conspiracy against Dr. Albright . Trust me . Trust you ? Of course I trust you . You 're my trusted aide , Nina . Nina 's in on it . No ! Oh , hey , Dr. Albright . Nina , how are you ? ! I 'm good . See ? Oh , my god . I 've had her in my house . How deep does this thing go ? Damn . If only I could get a look at that document that Judith hid from me . No matter how much I find out , I still only know a small part . It 's like a riddle wrapped around an enigma fried up in a conundrum with Chinese mustard dipping sauce . Well , I 'm not going down that easy . I think you know what we have to do . Kill Judith and make it look like an accident ? No . We 're not gonna make it look like an accident ? Oh , come on , Dick . Mary : what are you doing ? Dick : looking for infrared sensors . Smells like pine cones . They were out of country meadows . Damn . It 's locked . Mary ... Tommy taught me how to get past any lock . But you must promise me never to reveal this technique . If it got out , it could have dire effects on society as we know it . This is it . This is the document Judith was hiding . Quick . Stuff it in my underpants . What ? You 're right . We should read it first . There must be 50 or 60 pages . Wait a minute . This is the chancellor 's badger day address . Judith was telling the truth . Oh , my god . Mary , look at this ! What ? It 's so redundant ! You could lose this whole part . What was I thinking ? Cut this , cut this . Actually this part is kind of clever . Oh , Dick , I feel like an idiot . Let 's get out of here . [ Police siren ] It 's the heat . Mary , run for it ! Dick . Dick ! [ Whimpering ] Dick ? Whoo ! You are the man . I am the man . All right . Come on , baby , gimme some lovin ' . 7 ! [ Cheering ] We 're raking in the dough , baby . I 'm gonna quit my day job . You don 't have one , my man . Well , then I 'm gonna get one and quit it . Ok . Here we go . Ready ? Whoo ! 11 ! [ Cheering ] All right . Do you want me to keep on rolling ? Crowd : yeah ! I can 't hear you . I said do you want me to keep on rolling ? Yeah ! Eh , I 'm done . What ? Yeah , I 'm finished . Hey . Who wants to go outside for some fresh air ? I can 't hear you . Poor Mary . You 're not designed for flight . It 's your stubby little legs , they let you down . Oh , Dick . Good-bye , Mary . Don 't you leave me . Don 't worry . I 'll be back . I 'm going to get you out of here . In the meantime , let this sustain you . Aah ! So Elvis says , " never mind with them pills . I 'll just slam ' em down . " [ Laughs ] Hey , y 'all . How y 'all doin ' ? You know I saw you from the stage . Oh , my god . He picked us out from 11 people . Be cool , be cool . Please , sit down . What are your names ? Well , I 'm taffy , and this is amber . We 're sisters . Uh , we own a bikini shop on the Internet . Ooh . W-w-w dot wow . [ Laughing ] You know , amber here was quite moved by your finale . Oh , is that so ? Yes . You know , when you lit that sparkler , I felt like I was coming to America . Today . Oh , hi , Don . I 'm just going in to see Mary . Uh , hold it . Hold it there , Dick . That wouldn 't be a cake with a file baked in it , would it ? [ Laughs ] Don 't- - don 't be silly . [ Metal detector beeps ] [ Metal detector beeps ] [ Metal detector beeps ] Sometimes it 's the belt . [ Metal detector beeps ] I don 't know what to say . Oh , these things happen . No , you 're clear . [ Metal detector beeps ] I 'd never been in trouble until he came along . But he has this way of talking , see , when you know he 's crazy , but you just can 't help but listen to him . And all of a sudden , you find yourself doing things you never thought you 'd do . Bad things , stupid things . And where is he now ? Free as a bird . While I 'm in here taking the fall . We know how you feel . Yeah . You need a new pimp . Pimp ? I 'm not a hooker . I 'm a professor . Hmm . Too bad . You could make a nice living . Thank you . Mary , look who 's here . Judith and chancellor Stevens . You 're looking good , chancellor . Isn 't he looking good , Mary ? I was just about to say that . Mary , Mary , Mary . Chancellor . Ginger . Chancellor . Mary , what could you have been thinking ? Breaking and entering . Well , actually , it 's very funny . You 're gonna love it when you hear it because it 's very , very funny . You want to hear it now ? 'Cause you 're gonna laugh . Mary , Mary , Mary , Mary . No ! She 's not to blame . She had an accomplice . I talked her into it . If anyone goes down for this , it should be me . That 's very noble of you , Dick , but we caught Mary trying to bash her way out of my office with a crowbar . Well , he taught me that . Mary , Mary- - oh , shut up ! $ 4,200 is not bad for a night 's work . Exactly . Now , let 's treat ourselves to a souvenir visor . Oh , they 're nice . Well , I 'll get one for each of us . Ok . Ooh . How ' bout a high roller tote bag ? Vicki would love this . I would love this . I 'll get 2 . Ooh . And a jumbo tin of river taffy . Let 's slow down . This all the snow globes you got ? Harry , come on , that 's enough . Ooh . Look at this jacket . I need a medium . You got a medium ? Harry , walk away . Don 't touch me . I know what I 'm doing . Cocktails ! Oh , yeah ? Do that thing we did . Yeah ? Hey , check this out . That 's my sister . Ladies , ladies , excuse me . I am gonna go get these ribs packed up to go , and then we 'll hit my cabin . Wow . You have your own cabin ? Oh , ye--well , I have to share it with the Kenny rogers , but he sleeps like a log . Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . I 'm gonna kiss him . You are not . I am . I 'm gonna kiss that Neil diamond impersonator right on his big sweaty mouth . That-a-girl , Sally . It 's good to see you getting your life back on track . Vicki ? Yes , Sally ? I feel good . Yeow ! Whoo ! Go get him , girl . Pretty fancy , huh ? Uh , Mr. Diamond ... you were right , Vicki . I needed that . Whoo ! Let 's go do something else . Whoo-hoo ! Oh , look at me , Dick . They 've stripped me of everything . My office , my title , my dignity . But there 's one thing they can 't take away from me . Your dignity ? No . I just said they got that . There 's one thing they don 't got . My old job . I got that . Oh , yeah . I got that . Well , Dr. Albright . Oh ... I 've been working for you for 6 months . Good-bye . That 's it ? Oh , what a couple of fools we 've been , Mary . Oh , no , Dick , I was the bigger fool . If I 'd just had more confidence in myself , I wouldn 't have gotten into this jam . No , Mary , I was the bigger fool . If I hadn 't been so suspicious of everyone , things would never have gotten this crazy . No , Dick , I was the bigger fool . I got caught . No , Mary , I was the bigger- - no , wait . You were the bigger fool . Promise me one thing , Dick . The next time the world gets all Topsy-turvy and I start acting crazy again , do me a favor , will you ? Slap some sense into me ? I said next time . Harry , these warm-up suits are fantastic . Yeah , well , you know , I like to spread the good fortune around . How much did you win ? $ 4,200 . Yeah , and how much did you spend ? Let 's call it 5 grand . That 's how casinos make all their money . Gift shops ? That 's how they get you . How can you resist ? Oh , you can 't . It 's like our brains have minds of their own . Mine became so paranoid . I was completely convinced that Mary was gonna lose her job . And did she ? Yeah . So I guess being paranoid is kind of like being psychic . Well , at least Mary 's back in your office . That 's nice . Yeah , it 's great . Yee-haw ! Whoo-hoo ! It 's a girl thing . You wouldn 't understand . oh , Mary , it 's so nice to have you back in the office with me . It is kind of homey . Would you mind just moving a hair to your left ? There 's a nice window view I 've kind of gotten used to . Ok . Skitch more . Almost there . Another smidge . Now down 2 inches . Perfect . Welcome home , Mary .

 [ Crowd Cheering , Chattering On TV ] Excuse me ? Is that what 's known as chili ? I don 't eat it , I just stir it . That little talking dog on the commercial says that it 's very good . That 's the wrong franchise . That 's our mascot . - Rico the Taco Rat ? - [ Softly ] Yeah . - Well , what do you recommend ? - That you go someplace else . [ Man On TV ] We interrupt our regularly scheduled program - Let 's see . You know , I think I 'll try the " chimichanja " ? It 's your colon . [ Woman On TV ] This normally quiet neighborhood is gripped with fear ... following the disappearance of 17-year-old Sarah Rickman ... who , according to police , was taken from her home ... sometime during the early morning hours . The victim 's parents have made an appeal to the abductor ... begging for their daughter 's safe return . We just want whoever abducted our daughter Sarah ... - Anybody who can help us . - To return her unharmed . [ Rickman ] That 's all I ask right now . [ Reporter ] Now , among bizarre details associated with the crime ... the kidnapper apparently removed the eyes from several stuffed animals ... and left a message scrawled on a mirror . - " Blue moon rising . " - We 'll have more as this story unfolds . Now , Paul , back to you in the studio . We need your help . Something terrible has happened . A girl has been kidnapped . You need to find her . [ Police Radio , Indistinct ] - Excuse me , Lieutenant Fawkes ? - Who 's he ? Special agent from theJustice Department . I can 't , Sydney . I 'm scared . - You wanna help Annie , don 't you ? - Sydney , no . I 'm too scared . - Put your fear away . - But , Sydney , I can 't ! You have to , Jarod . You 're the only one who can save her . [ Young Sydney ] Jarod , you 're the only one who can save her . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . That 's funny . I don 't remember calling in theJustice Department . Jarod Ressler . - I 'm a criminal behaviorist . I 'm here to help . - Go back to Washington . We have enough cops handling a kidnapping . You won 't be receiving a ransom note , Detective . - Lieutenant . - Look , the man that took Sarah is a killer . So every minute that we stand here arguing is a minute closer to her death . - He 's taunting you . - You think ? He cuts the eyes out . It makes him believe he 's invisible . And these curtains , he left them open on purpose . Look again , Kreskin . They 're closed . They 've been closed . Actually , Lieutenant , they were open . I shut them to keep the news cameras out . [ Sighs ] Talk . I 've seen this M.O. Before . A series of crimes committed by a man named Douglas Willard . - Maxwell , A.P.B. This Willard . - Don 't bother . He 's been in prison for the last 20 years . [ Broots ] Looks like the lights are on , but no one 's home . - Jarod 's life story . - Clearly , he was here . He was training for something aquatic . Syd , Wonder Boy ever say he wanted to be Mr. Limpet ? Not that I recall . You know , when I was a kid , I always wanted to be Aquaman . You know ? Human gills and a - Sorry . Hey , look . Looks like we might be going to Florida . - Looks like he did . - That 's too easy . Look at all these things he left behind . Something unexpected must have come up ... and Jarod left before he planned . The question is , where is he ? The question is , where is he ? Doug Willard , a.k.a. The " Blue Moon Killer . " He made a series of abductions along the upper east coast in the mid - ' 70s . All young women snatched from their bedrooms . Eyeless dolls left behind , along with the words ... " blue moon rising . " - If Willard 's in maximum security - - We 're dealing with a copycat . - Why " blue moon " ? - It 's the second full moon of a calendar month . Willard killed his victims at midnight of the blue moon . It says here police got an anonymous tip out of Delaware ... that helped them catch Willard ... but not before he murdered his last victim . Her name was Annie . Her body was never found . Here she is . Jarod , you did everything you could . It 's not your fault . She died because of me , Sydney . I let her die . [ Fawkes ] If they never found her ... how could they be sure ? Willard sent a photo of her body to her parents . - It arrived the day after he was arrested . - Sick bastard . - Where do we start ? - We find the copycat . Now , he 's meticulously recreating every detail of Willard 's M.O. Details that weren 't in the papers ... which means that he had some kind of contact with Willard . - An old cell mate ? - No , Willard 's been in isolation since day one . No family , no visiting privileges . Do a rundown of all the prison personnel . - Guards , doctors , public defenders , anyone . - I 'm on it . What would it take to get Willard transferred here ? A damn good reason , for starters . How about someone is trying to become Willard ? I need to pick the brain of the real thing . - Do your picking at McCallister . - I need him here where I can have access to him . - I can 't do that for you . - The night after tomorrow is a blue moon . If we don 't stop it , another girl is going to die . Sydney , are those her parents ? - [ Sobbing ] - [ Sydney ] Yes . And they 're counting on you to find their daughter . [ Sobbing ] [ Prisoners Yelling , Shouting ] The more I learn about this guy , the sicker my gut feels . The path to the man that kidnapped Sarah is Douglas Willard . I hope you 're right . I just got off the phone with McCallister . Willard 's in transit . He 'll be here ASAP . - You owe me . - Big-time . [ Miss Parker ] You know , Syd , sometimes I think ... you and I are the only people around here that are sane ... which isn 't saying much for me . What 's wrong ? You 've got that " just eaten in the cafeteria " look . I 'm sorry . I 'm fine . Well , I 'm not . Raines has convinced Daddy I should go down to Florida afterJarod ... even though I made it clear it 's pointless . Raines had nothing to do with it . I convinced your father . Didn 't we agree at the wharf Jarod wasn 't headed to Florida ? Maybe I was wrong . - Maybe we overlooked something . - Cancel what I said earlier . - I 'm the only sane one around here . - [ Phone Ringing ] Oh . Jarod ? - [ Jarod ] How did you know ? - Annie told me . This time it 's a girl named Sarah . I can 't let it happen again . You caught her killer . You saved countless others . But I couldn 't save Annie . [ Sydney ] None of us can change the past , Jarod . You did everything you could . You must get over it . Willard gets transferred here in the morning . Sydney ... I 've never seen him face-to-face . But running away will offer no solace . You know what you have to do . Jarod . Jarod ! - I want to be alone with him . - Bad idea . The psychiatrist at McCallister calls Willard an earwig . You give him half a chance ... he 'll crawl into your head and chew on your brain . He 's left two suicides and half a dozen psych discharges in his wake . - I 'm not afraid of much , but I 'm scared of him . - So am I. Jarod ! And who might you be , little boy ? - I hopeJarod knows what he 's doing . - [ Willard ] I owe you a thanks . For what ? Twenty years in solitary , this is like a vacation . - I didn 't do it for you . - Then why ? We 'll get to that . Nice accommodations . Of course , I 'm used to a little bit more privacy . Smart-ass . - Who are you ? - I 'm Jarod Ressler . - I 'm with theJustice Department . - Justice ? I never realized I was so important . You 're not . Just what is it you want ? I 'm a criminal behaviorist . You 're a case study . Interviewing you would broaden my knowledge . Why do I get the feeling you 're lying ? And why do I find it shocking that you have feelings ? Touché . The way I was abruptly jerked from my peaceful abode and rushed here ... makes me think that my presence was urgently needed . It 's almost as if it was a matter of life and death . Now the feds are involved . That narrows down the list of possible crimes , doesn 't it ? I doubt if I was pulled in for a terrorist bombing . It 's not really my specialty . No , I 'm gonna take a wild guess and say - [ Inhales ] Abduction . Still , there must be a reason why you chose me , why I was selected ... and that 's the easiest one of all . I 'm on pins and needles . Tomorrow night is a blue moon ... and that leaves us with one conclusion . There 's somebody else out there . Someone like me . I 'm impressed . And you want my help ? Yes , I do . Well , as they say , hell will freeze first . Well , I am very sorry to have disturbed you . I 'll make sure they take you back to your ... peaceful abode . [ Knocking ] [ Clanging ] [ Door Closes ] That 's it ? Three minutes , he shuts you down , and you just walk away ? Patience . I worked like hell to get that guy here ! Ressler ! It 's not as if I have somewhere else to be . [ Miss Parker ] We burn half a day in the Sunshine State , sniffing trails going nowhere . A standard cleanup crew could have checked that out . The question is , why were we sent ? And what 's Sydney got to do with it ? Sydney wouldn 't just send us to waste our time . - Unless he wanted us gone . - What ? I saw him staring at a photo in his office . I bet answers are there . I bet answers are there . Yesterday , a young woman was taken . This young woman . Every detail of the crime was identical to yours . Well , let me guess . You 're looking for a white male , 22-35 , unmarried , a loner . His neighbors are amazed and say , " He was a quiet man . " I know the standard profile . I need more , and there 's little time . If I give you what you need , will you give me what I need ? I already got you out of your hole , which means you owe me . Now , the copycat is re-creating your last abduction ... which means he 's going to take his victim to the last place that you took yours . Oh , Annie . They never found her , you know . It 'll be the same with the new one if the copycat is as smart as I am . And how does it feel to be the smartest man on the planet ? Lonely . Clearly , law enforcement has not raised its standards in the last 20 years . They 're still the same stupid people that bungled their way through my capture . - But they did catch you . - Not in time . Besides , " they " didn 't catch me . As I sat in my hole , I studied those ... who were supposedly responsible for bringing me to justice . I knew them better than they knew their wives . And ? They couldn 't catch a cold . They got a lucky break from a very gifted informant . How do you know he was gifted ? Maybe he was just lucky . 'Cause I 'm smarter than that . He had to be really gifted . A genius . He was the worthiest adversary I 've ever had . I was denied the opportunity to meet him . It was so disappointing . You see , I got inside my victims ' heads . I knew where they lived , how they thought , how they act . To know someone , you 've got to get inside them . See , that 's what I wanted to ask the anonymous informant . For 20 years , I wondered - How did he get inside me ? Do you know this man , Agent ? No . Well , I only ask because I was wondering ... if he was as lonely on this planet as I am . Well , like you said ... being smart gets lonely sometimes . Now , where is this copycat going to take her ? You said it already . Same place I took Annie . - Where ? - We 've got till tomorrow midnight . - Tell me ! - Oh , I can 't do that . You 'd send me back . Answer me ! Where is he going to take her ? Where did you take Annie ? Relax , Ressler . Come on . If you don 't control your emotions , you 're never gonna find him , are you ? [ Young Jarod ] No , Sydney ! Don 't make me do it ! I 'm scared ! Time 's running out , Jarod . It 's the only way we 're gonna find her . No , please ! Please , no ! [ Sobbing ] Angelo , I 've got something I want you to look at . Miss Parker , I don 't like the idea of stealing from Sydney . We 're not stealing . We 'rejust looking at it . Angelo , tell me about her . Who is she ? She 's - She 's scared . Annie . Tell me about Annie . - We want to go home . - [ Clanging ] You were told to go to Florida . Been there , done that . Waste of time . A complete dry hole ? - There were a few bread crumbs . - Then why are you here ? 'Cause they were leading nowhere . Sydney , you wanna clue him in ? - Florida 's a boondoggle . - It 's still our best chance at finding Jarod . Get back down there . [ Wheels Squeaking ] Geez , I just got done unpacking . We 're not going anywhere , Broots . - They said we had to go back down . - And I said we 're not . Those two are up to something . I wanna know everything that there is to know about her . This is the bread crumb to follow . [ Sobbing ] Anything on prison personnel tied to Willard ? - Workin ' on it . - Hurry up . We 're running out of time . So are they . [ Young Jarod ] I wanna meet Annie 's parents . - If I talk to them , maybe I - - That 's impossible . I don 't want their emotions to cloud your objectivity . But why are they so upset ? Don 't they have other children ? The emotions a parent and child share are strong and fragile . One child or 10 , each relationship is unique . If threatened , they all feel immense pain . [ Woman Sobbing ] I wonder if my parents cried for me ? If you imagine hard enough , it almost tastes like real coffee . Thank you . [ Mrs. Rickman ] Before she went to bed that night ... I don 't even remember if I told her I loved her . Mrs. Rickman , Sarah knows you love her . I just can 't help but wonder if everything is being done . If there isn 't something more . You have a lust for power , so be powerful . - Save the girl . - Careful , Agent . Emotions cloud your eyes . They make you vulnerable . - They make you - - Human ? You 're a puzzle to me , Jarod . Your passion makes me think there 's more to you than meets the eye . - I want to find Sarah . - I want something too . The truth . - About what ? - I think you know . For 20 years , I 've obsessed about my capture . I 've read every piece of paper , every file , every document . And during those 20 years , I found nothing about an anonymous informant . Well , that is the key word - " anonymous . " It must have been somebody who knew me ... somebody who studied me as I study me . You seem to know me well . I read your file . Oh , you know more about me than is in my file . You know who I really am . And that makes me wonder who you really are . - What the hell is he doing ? - It seems you and I have a secret . You were a child then . A prodigy . I heard the word used , yes . - How did you know ? - I can see . I can feel your loneliness . A small child helps the police capture a genius . Now , I am impressed . I helped them capture a monster . But it wasn 't in time to save Annie , was it ? It must be a terrible experience for someone as human as you . It makes me wonder how it 's all gonna work out for little Sarah . Like you said ... time is running out . She 's asleep when I enter . They all are . I know because I 've been watching them . Keep going , Jarod . I wanna go to her , but l-I can 't ... not while they 're watching me . I have to stop them from watching me ! There ! I 'm invisible ! Why open the curtains , Jarod ? You don 't want to be seen . The moonlight . I need to feel it shining on me . - I can 't go any further , Sydney . - Yes . Yes , you can , Jarod . No . I don 't wanna be inside his head . - I don 't wanna have him inside of mine . - You have to . - No , I can 't ! - It 's the only way we 're gonna find Annie . I can 't , Sydney ! I don 't wanna feel that ! I don 't wanna feel that . [ Phone Ringing ] Detective Maxwell . Yeah , give me the info . - Why 'd you pull the plug on Willard 's surveillance cam ? - Privacy . - His or yours ? - I know what I 'm doing . You better . He 's asking for you . [ Miss Parker ] Talk to me . - You 'll have to be more specific . - Raines wants me out of the way . - You 're singing backup . Why ? - You 're beginning to sound paranoid . Then this must be one of my delusions . What 's happening again , and why doesn 't anybody want me to find out about it ? Parker , leave the stone unturned . You know , for years I 've wondered who you really were . But inside , I always knew . Is your name reallyJarod ? Are you truly from theJustice Department ? My name is Jarod . You wanted to see me . He 'll hold her till the moon is full . Until midnight . - I already knew that . - Actually , you already know everything . You have all the answers . You just won 't do what you need to do . Help me . Why did I cut the eyes out of the dolls ? - To make yourself invisible . - Why open the curtains ? [ Sighs ] To feel the moonlight on your body . Why 'd he do it ? - The same reason . - Where is he ? - I don 't know . - Where is she ? - I don 't know ! - Come on , prodigy . Do what you need to do . You had all the answers you needed to find Annie . I left them for you last time . He left them for you this time . Get inside his head . Get inside my head . - No . - Where is she ? [ Sighs ] I don 't know . [ Sighs ] You know , you 've never asked me for what I wanted , what I need to help you . [ Scoffs ] Oh , really ? Well , what do you need ? Take me to the crime scene . Take me to Sarah 's bedroom . - And why would I wanna do that ? - Because I can feel it . Because I can do what you won 't do - become him . I don 't wanna become him , Sydney ! They would never allow it . You 're a genius . You 'll figure it out . Do it for Sarah . Do it for Annie . [ Door Opens ] Ressler . We found the kidnapper . [ Fawkes ] The kidnapper 's name is Paul Schuman . He was a guard at McCallister for six years . Worked nights . Assigned to solitary confinement cell block and [ Jarod ] Douglas Willard . - [ Fawkes ] Oh , it gets better . - Willard and Schuman developed a continuing conversation . - It 's clear . Eighteen months ago , Schuman has a breakdown and vanishes . [ Man ] All clear . Nobody 's in here . Well , the acorn 's gone , but we found the right tree . We 've got less than eight hours until the moon is full . Look at this . [ Jarod ] Sarah at home ... waiting for the school bus . [ Chuckles ] He 's even got her class schedule . Nantauk , New Bedford , Cape May . Schuman visited all the places that Willard struck . - Historical tour ? - Research trip . He 's trying to get inside of Willard 's skin . [ Fawkes ] By taking Sarah , he 's picking up where Willard left off . Over here . Letters from Willard , as recent as last week . - This is gibberish . - Mm-mmm . Code , to get past the prison censors . Willard climbed into his head and earwigged him . The question is - Is Schuman a copycat or a puppet ? What 's our next move ? We give Willard what he wants . [ Willard ] Did you think about taking me with you ? - Tell me about Carl Schuman . - Answer me , I answer you . He was your prison guard before you got inside of his head . He was an impressionable fan , Jarod . Frankly , it 's irrelevant at this point . Like these letters you wrote to him ? You were behind Sarah 's abduction from the very beginning . Schuman is just your eyes , your ears and your legs out there , isn 't he ? But now it 's just you and me . Déjà vu , Jarod . It 's like a snake eating its own tail . You 're right back where you started - a scared little boy . You know who the killer is , but you can 't save the girl . - At least , not alone . - Where did he take Sarah ? Same place I took Annie . [ Sighs ] Tell me . Do the right thing , Jarod . Take me with you . - We can still stop him . - [ Door Opens ] He 's not going anywhere . Agent Ressler , I wanna talk to you . What the hell is this ? I know it sounds crazy , but if I could take Willard to the crime scene - - Request denied . - A girl 's life is at risk . And risking more by letting that loose isn 't the answer . Request denied . - Look , I know it 's - - No ! You know , at first I thought you knew what you were doing . - Now I think he 's earwigged you . - [ Paper Crumpling ] You 're out of here . Get in . Ressler , what the hell are you doing ? - I 'm ending this once and for all . - I don 't see any authorization . - Stay out of my way , Maxwell . - I can 't let you do this . No more time to waste . No more time . Such a display of violence , prodigy . [ Willard ] Mmm . Can you smell it ? Death . It 's amazing how little girls ' rooms are the same wherever you go . Tell me where she is . You know , Jarod , I can 't do my best work under these conditions . If you set me free ; well , then I 'll set you free . - [ Handcuffs Ratcheting ] - If you so much as sneeze , I end this . If you close your eyes ... you can almost hear the sounds of her muffled cries . She 's sleeping as he cracks the door and slips inside . [ Coughs ] She has a summer cold . Her breathing is heavier than normal . He kinda likes that . And then ? He notices the eyes . He can 't leave witnesses . He sits on the bed . He watches her . [ Sniffing ] Oh , he can smell the soft scent of ... sweet powder . And what is that ? Shampoo . Then what ? You tell me . - No . - Tell me ! I don 't wanna become him , Sydney ! I don 't want him to be inside me ! What does he do next , Jarod ? He wants to scream ... because it feels so good ... so right . He takes her down the hallway , doesn 't he ? Past her parents ' bedroom . He pauses . They 're asleep . They look so ... innocent ... so unaware . Where does he take her next , Jarod ? - I don 't know . - Feel it . The moon is full . It 's almost midnight . Look , I took you where you wanted to go . Now just tell me where she is . It must be frustrating to be so close , and yet so far away . Tell me ! Tell me where she is ! - Tell me ! - Follow the clues . - Do what you have to do ! - I don 't know ! Now tell me where she is ! It 's so obvious . Why can 't I figure it out ? Why doesn 't it make any sense ? Because it 's all a lie . There is no rhyme or reason to any of this , Jarod . There is no midnights , no blue moons rising . It 's all meaningless . The truth is ... I killed them because I wanted to . I like it . Now it 's time for me to see Sarah . I expected a much more worthy adversary , prodigy . Good-bye , Jarod . It 's time for the monster to leave now . - What 'd you get on the girl ? - Ah , there wasn 't a lot . Not even a last name . I mean , there 's absolutely no reference to her last name . - It 's-It 's weird . - Broots , don 't waste my time telling me what you didn 't find . Okay . All I could find is that ... she was kidnapped and murdered 23 years ago ... and there 's not even a body been found . Where did this happen ? Uh , about 40 miles from here , a place called Snow Hill , Maryland . Snow Hill ? " Snow Hill . " [ Jarod ] And who might you be , little boy ? Well , if it isn 't the young prodigy . How does it feel ... to be the smartest man on the planet ? Lonely . It 's time to go back to your hole . You found me , Jarod . But once again ... not in time to save the little girl . Not this time . You see , a request to visit the girl 's bedroom was a ploy . So was my taking you there . I followed you here . Actually , I was one step ahead of you . We all were . Carl Schuman never got near this place . Prodigy , you got inside my head . No . You don 't have to become a monster ... to face one . [ Whimpering ] Help . She 's over here . It 's okay . We 're here to help you . Come on . It 's okay . It 's okay , it 's okay . Nobody 's gonna hurt you anymore . - Get her out of here . - It 's okay , Sarah . Come on . You 'll be okay . Agent Ressler ? [ Siren Wailing ] It 's time for you to go home too , Annie . I 'm looking for this man . - Special Agent Ressler ? - " Special Agent . " Right . - Where is he ? - He 's right over - right over there . [ Sydney ] You saved her , Jarod . I wish I could have done the same for Annie ... for her parents . I know you tried . I hope that finally being able to bury her ... will bring them some kind of peace . I 'm sure it will . I gave her father the locket . I know he 'd like me to thank you . [ Beeps ] I 'm sorry . I 'm so very sorry . [ Sobbing ] You let me run all over the country instead of telling me the truth . He wanted it that way . [ Miss Parker ] I don 't get it . Sometimes , even the devil deserves a little privacy .

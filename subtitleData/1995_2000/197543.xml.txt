Is it true what they say about guys with big shoes ? - Yeah . - He asked you a question . Answer it ! Hey , I have two words for you . Brush your teeth ! They 're spies . They got Water and Power logos all over . Yeah , I was thinking that , but then I was also thinking that if they are Water and Power ... No , no , no , no ! Why would they come here advertising ' it ? Check it out . Tattoos . Wonder where else they got ' em . I don 't think those are tattoos . Who would want some alphabet soup ? I 'd rather have a dragon or somethin more Aquarian-related , you dig ? - They 're prisoner stamps . - Prison , my ass . That 's exactly what they want us to think . Or , better yet , that isn 't what they want us to think . That way we 'll think what they think we might think , - but actually ... - Booga . Try not to speak . - How much did they pay you to spy ? - Two dollars and 15 cents . Shut up ! You should go easy on the truth serum . It might send ' em off . That could be to our advantage . Good . I 'm tired of asking ' em questions anyway . I say we kill ' em . - I say we hump ' em . - I say we get crumpets and tea . Tasty . Crumpets and tea . All in favour of crumpets and tea say aye . - Aye . - Ain 't gonna be no crumpets and tea ! We 're gonna take ' em outside and waste ' em . I think they 're nice . I say we let ' em go .

She does . - Totally negatory . - No , wait , wait , wait ! Come on . You don 't wanna be like those other manimals in there . We 're not manimals . What are you ? The army wanted to build the ultimate soldier , so they messed with kangaroo NDA and ... You mean DNA . Yeah . And they created us . And then the war ended and they told Johnny to poison us . - Johnny Prophet ? - Yeah . - Why ? - Because he was the one that made us . But then he didn 't do it because he decided that he liked us too much . I have this great idea . You , me and Jet go for a visit with Johnny Prophet . When he gets back , yeah . Well ... maybe . Where did he go ? To ... New Zealand , for a little while , to help some scientist guy who was makin ' sea water so you could drink it . Does she need to know that ? Do they need to know that ? Get your ass outta here ! " - Go ahead , WP2 . We have " ... - Hey , you guys , hey ! - Water and Power 's gettin ' a shipment . - What kind of shipment ? - I don 't know . It 's comin ' from Red Sands . - When ? Tonight . - What if it 's an arms shipment ? - It 's a trap . What if they want us to think it 's a trap but it 's really not ? That way , when we get there , it could still be one . - Or , better yet , what if ... - Booga . Why don 't you make yourself useful and go and choke on somethin ' ? That 's cold , man . OK . We 're gonna give you chicks a chance to prove yourself . Call it an initiation . You fail , you die . Yeah , but first you gotta strip . - That 's not in the plan . - Why not ? Hold on , cats . All right . All you have to do is confirm the shipment . Copacetic . You 're gonna use this , but you have to be really careful , because I designed it with ... I especially built it with a visual-send processor . It 's a little invention - that I invented myself , I might add , actually . - Smile . - And these are so you can hear us . This one 's for you . And this one ... I made especially for you . Let me help you put it on cos it 's kinda tricky . I 'm sorry . How clumsy of me . - Get off ! - It was hard to clip on . OK .

Over there by the crates . - Take off your shirt . - What are you doing here ? - This is a restricted area . - I know you 're not talking to me like this . - Obviously you didn 't get the memo . - What memo ? Darling , we are doing a " Men of Water and Power " calendar . And I think you would be the perfect supermodel cover . You mean we get to be calendar guys ? Can I be December ?

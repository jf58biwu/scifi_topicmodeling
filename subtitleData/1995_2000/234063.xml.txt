 [ Man ] GOD TESTS OUR FAITH ... SO THAT WE MAY NOT TAKE IT FOR GRANTED . I ONCE GAVE COUNSEL TO A LITTLE GIRL . SHE WAS VERY DISTRAUGHT , BECAUSE HER OLDER BROTHER HAD TOLD HER ... THAT MOSES HADN 'T REALLY PARTED THE RED SEA . HE SAID THAT HIGH WINDS AND STRONG OCEAN CURRENTS ... HAD BEEN RESPONSIBLE . IN HEARING THIS , THE FAITH OF THIS CHILD HAD BEEN SEVERELY SHAKEN . IN ORDER TO RESTORE HER CREDENCE , SHE HAD BUT ONE QUESTION FOR ME . SHE ASKED , " REVEREND , " IS THERE REALLY SUCH A THING AS A MIRACLE , " OR ARE THE STORIES IN THE BIBLE JUST MAKE-BELIEVE ? FAIRY TALES . " I ASSURED HER THAT YES , MIRACLES REALLY DO HAPPEN . MOST PEOPLE TODAY TEND TO VEST THEMSELVES IN SCIENCE AND CYNICISM . THEY EXPECT PROOF FOR ALL THAT THEY SEE . BUT MIRACLES ARE WONDROUS BY NATURE . THEY NEED NO RATIONALE , NO JUSTIFICATION . YOU MUST WITNESS THE MIRACLES OF THE LORD WITHOUT QUESTION . [ Groaning ] [ Murmuring ] MY BLOOD FLOWS AS A TEST OF YOUR FAITH . OPEN YOUR SOULS TO THE DIVINE POSSIBILITIES ! IT IS THEN ANDONLYTHEN ... THAT YOU WILL TRULY UNDERSTAND THE AWESOME POWERS OF THE ALMIGHTY LORD ! [ Congregants Chattering ] [ Sighs ] [ Curtains Opening ] YES ? I WAS IMPRESSED WITH YOUR SERMON , REVEREND . THANK YOU . I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT ... SOME OF USDOBELIEVE . [ Chuckles ] I APPRECIATE THAT . IT ALWAYS DOES MY HEART GOOD TO KNOW THAT ... I 'VE TOUCHED AT LEAST ONE PERSON . OH , I THINK YOU HAVE QUITE AN EFFECT ON A LOT OF PEOPLE . ME , MOST OF ALL . [ Groans , Gasps ] OH , MY GOD . NO ! [ Gasping Continues ] [ Breathing Stops ] THESE LIGATURE MARKS ON HIS NECK ARE CONSISTENT WITH ... ROPE OR FABRIC BURNS , STRONGLY SUGGESTING THAT HE WAS STRANGLED . BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE AN AWFUL LOT OF BLOOD LOSS HERE . HIS PARISHIONERS SAID THE REVEREND FINLEY WAS BLEEDING FROM HIS HANDS . LIKE THE WOUNDS OF THE CRUCIFIXION . STIGMATA ? A SIGN BESTOWED BY GOD UPON THE RIGHTEOUS . I DON 'T SEE ANY WOUNDS HERE , ON HIS HANDS OR WRISTS OR OTHERWISE . NO . I THINK THIS IS A CASE OF TOO MUCH FAITH . - AND TOO MUCH SUGAR . - WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? IT 'S FAKE . - JUST LIKE THE OTHERS . - OTHERS ? I 'VE BEEN TRACKING A SERIES OF INTERNATIONAL , RELIGIOUSLY-MOTIVATED MURDERS . ALL OF THE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN SO-CALLED STIGMATICS , AND ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN FRAUDS , LIKE THE REVEREND HERE . ACCORDING TO CERTAIN RELIGIOUS LORE , AT ANY GIVEN TIME THERE ARE 12 STIGMATICS IN THE WORLD , REPRESENTING THE 12 APOSTLES . IT 'S A CLAIM THAT 'S UNSUBSTANTIATED , THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PRETENDERS- - ELEVEN HAVE BEEN MURDERED IN THE PAST THREE YEARS . ELEVEN ? ANY CLUE AS TO THE MOTIVATION ? EITHER WE 'RE DEALING WITH ... A PSYCHOTIC RELIGIOUS FANATIC WHO 'S HELL-BENT ON EXPOSING THESE KIND OF FRAUDS , OR A LESS PROGRAMMATIC PSYCHO WHO HARBORS A MURDEROUS RESENTMENT TOWARDS THE CHURCH . OR MAYBE IT 'S JUST A , UH- - A VERY DISGRUNTLED ALTAR BOY . WELL , THAT NARROWS DOWN THE FIELD . ANYWAY , IT 'S SAFE TO SAY THIS GUY CARRIES A GRUDGE . AND IF I 'M RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING , THE KILLER IS HERE . AND HE 'S LOOKING FOR VICTIM NUMBER 12 . [ Bell Ringing ] [ Female Teacher ] ALL RIGHT , LET 'S SIT DOWN . - [ Children Chattering ] - I TRUST EVERYONE STUDIED ... HIS OR HER FLASH CARDS FOR TODAY 'S QUIZ ? [ Students ] AWW ! [ Teacher ] ALL RIGHT , LET 'S SETTLE DOWN . - GEEK ! - [ Students Laughing ] KEVIN KRYDER ? I ASSUME , KEVIN , THAT IN THE LAST 24 HOURS , YOU 'VE BECOME QUITE THE MATH WIZARD . - [ Students Laughing ] - WHY DON 'T YOU COME ON UP TO THE BOARD ... AND SHARE WITH US YOUR GIFT OF NUMBERS ? LET 'S TRY SOME DIVISION . YOU DO KNOW THE DIVISION SIGN , DON 'T YOU , KEVIN ? [ Laughing ] LET 'S DIVIDE 11 ... INTO 170 . [ Girl ] THAT 'S SO EASY ! [ Scraping , Squeaking ] - [ Boy ] EWW ! BLOOD ! - [ Frightened Chattering ] OH , MY GOD . [ Girl ] WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM ? [ Teacher ] I DON 'T KNOW . THANK YOU FOR CONTACTING US SO QUICKLY . WHEN I READ THE F.B.I. ' S ALERT , I THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY OF KEVIN . YOU SAID ON THE PHONE THAT THERE HAD BEEN A PREVIOUS INCIDENT ? LAST YEAR . KEVIN ARRIVED AT SCHOOL WITH BLEEDING WOUNDS ON HIS HANDS AND FEET . OUR FIRST CONCERN IS ALWAYS AN ABUSIVE PARENT . WAS THAT THE CASE ? WELL , IT APPEARED SO . KEVIN 'S FATHER WAS ARRESTED AND WE TOOK THE BOY AS A WARD OF THE COURT . BUT THE STATE DROPPED CHARGES FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE . THE MOTHER SUED AND WON CUSTODY . MR. KRYDER WAS INSTITUTIONALIZED SOON AFTER . - INSTITUTIONALIZED FOR WHAT ? - WHEN HE WAS RELEASED FROM JAIL , HE LOCKED HIMSELF AND KEVIN IN THE HOUSE . IT MADE ALL THE PAPERS . HE WAS WAVING A GUN AT THE POLICE , SAYING HE HAD TO PROTECT THE BOY- - THAT KEVIN WAS CHOSEN BY GOD . [ Softly ] CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE HERE ? HOW 'S HE DOING ? FINE . HI , KEVIN . MY NAME IS DANA SCULLY . CAN I TALK TO YOU A MINUTE ? AM I GOING BACK TO THE SHELTER ? WE DON 'T KNOW JUST YET . RIGHT NOW , WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED . CAN YOU TELL ME HOW YOU GOT THOSE CUTS ON YOUR HANDS ? NO . NO , YOU CAN 'T TELL ME , OR NO , YOU DON 'T KNOW ? YOU WANT ME TO SAY MY DAD DID IT . I DON 'T WANT YOU TO SAY ANYTHING THAT ISN 'T TRUE . I DON 'T FEEL THAT GOOD . HE FEELS A BIT FEVERISH . DID YOU TAKE HIS TEMPERATURE ? NO , I DIDN 'T . [ Nurse ] OPEN . YOU 'RE A VERY BRAVE BOY , KEVIN . YOU HAVE NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF . WHERE 'S KEVIN ? IS HE ALL RIGHT ? HE 'S DOING JUST FINE . THE NURSE IS JUST CHANGING HIS BANDAGES . [ Woman ] OH , MY GOD . I THOUGHT THIS WAS ALL OVER . MRS. KRYDER ? MY NAME IS FOX MULDER . I 'M WITH THE F.B.I. THE F.B.I. ? WHO CALLED THE F.B.I. ? WE 'RE HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT KEVIN MAY BE IN SOME DANGER . IN DANGER FROM WHAT ? AS STRANGE AS IT MIGHT SOUND , SOMEONE MAY BE TARGETING PEOPLE LIKE KEVIN . WHAT DO YOU MEAN , " PEOPLE LIKE KEVIN " ? PEOPLE EXHIBITING WOUNDS THAT MIGHT BE INTERPRETED AS HAVING RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE . [ Gasps ] HMM ! - [ Nurse ] WHAT WAS THAT ? - I DON 'T KNOW . I DIDN 'T DO ANYTHING . IT JUST BROKE ! KEVIN 'S JUST A NORMAL KID . HE PROBABLY JUST HURT HIMSELF OUT ON THE PLAYGROUND . I 'M SURE THERE 'S AN EXPLANATION , MRS. KRYDER . BUT RIGHT NOW , EVERYBODY 'S PRIMARY CONCERN SHOULD BE FOR KEVIN 'S SAFETY . I 'D LIKE TO PUT HIM BACK INTO THE SHELTER UNTIL WE CAN SORT THIS OUT . YOU DON 'T THINK I DID THIS TO KEVIN ? YOU THINK I 'M THE ONE WHO CUT HIS HANDS ? WE DON 'T KNOW HOW HE GOT THE CUTS , BUT WE 'D LIKE SOME TIME TO EVALUATE HIS CASE . I WOULD NEVER HURT MY OWN CHILD . DO YOU HEAR ME ? NOW , I HAVE FOUGHT A BATTLE OVER MY SON BEFORE THAT TORE MY FAMILY APART . AND I 'M NOT GONNA FIGHT IT AGAIN . [ Sighs ] I LOVE MY JOB . LET 'S GET OUT OF HERE , SCULLY . THE KID 'S HANDS WERE DEFINITELY CUT , MULDER . THEY 'RE TAKING HIM INTO CUSTODY . WE 'VE WARNED THEM ABOUT HIS SAFETY . WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO ? HAVE YOU DETERMINED HOW HIS HANDS WERE CUT ? NO , NOT YET . BUT MY GUESS IS THAT THE KID DID IT TO HIMSELF . BOY HAS HIS FATHER TAKEN AWAY . HE HURTS HIMSELF TO RELIEVE HIS DAD OF GUILT ... AND TO GET HIM BACK . MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK TO HIS FATHER . HE 'S IN AN INSTITUTION . HIS FATHER SAID THAT HE NEEDED TO BE PROTECTED . MAYBE HE KNOWS FROM WHOM . HE 'S BLEEDING AGAIN , ISN 'T HE ? - YES . HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT ? - BECAUSE THE FAITHFUL KNOW . MR. KRYDER , THE CLAIMS YOU 'VE MADE FOR YOUR SON MAY HAVE PUT HIM IN DANGER . DO YOU KNOW THAT ? THE CHILD WAS IN DANGER LONG BEFORE I MADE THE CLAIMS . SINCE THE DAY HE WAS BORN , THEY 'VEBEEN WATCHING HIM . - THEY ? - THE FORCES OF DARKNESS . THEY WILL COME IN THE FORM ... OF A POWERFUL AND RESPECTED MAN . THESE FORCES , WHAT DO THEY WANT ? TO CLAIM ALL SOULS . YOU MUST UNDERSTAND . THIS IS THE GREAT WAR ... BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL . ARMAGEDDON . [ Thunderclap ] GOD WILL FIND SOMEONE TO STOP IT . SOMEONE WHO IS STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE . - HE 'S CHOSEN YOU ? - I 'M MERELY A MESSENGER . LET 'S GO . YOU MUST COME FULL CIRCLE TO FIND THE TRUTH . - EXCUSE ME ? - FULL CIRCLE TO FIND THE TRUTH ? I DON 'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS . YOU WILL . THE TWO KIDS ARE RUNNING DOWN THIS LONG HALLWAY . BUT ALL THE DOORS ARE LOCKED . THERE 'S NOWHERE TO GO . SOON , THEY 'LL BOTH BE TOAST . THEY CAN HEAR HIS BLOODY LEG DRAGGING ON THE FLOOR . OH ! THE MUTANT IS ON THEIR TRAIL . HUNGRY FOR THE TASTE ... OF YOUNG MEAT . WHAT 'S IT LOOK LIKE ? [ Boy ] YEAH . WHAT ? DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW ? IT LOOKS LIKE THE DEVIL . AND HE 'S BALD , BECAUSE ALL HIS HAIR HAS BURNT OFF IN HELL . AND HIS FINGERS ARE LIKE PITCHFORKS ... WITH LITTLE BARBS ON THE END , SO ALL HE HAS TO DO IS POINT AT YOU ... AND YOU CAN 'T GET AWAY . WITH EACH STEP HE GETS CLOSER . STEP BY STEP ... BY STEP ... BY STEP . HE 'S SO CLOSE NOW THAT EVEN THE FURNITURE STARTS TO SHAKE . - [ Child , Gasping ] MY GOD ! - STEP BY STEP ... BY STEP ... BY STEP . [ Door Banging ] - [ Children Gasp , Shudder ] - LET 'S GET OUT OF HERE ! [ Clamoring ] [ Doors Slamming , Children Screaming ] WHAT COLOR HAIR DID HE HAVE ? BROWN OR BLOND , BLACK- - HE WAS BALD . HE DIDN 'T HAVE NO HAIR . 'CAUSE IT ALL BURNED OFF IN HELL . HOW TALL WAS HE ? WAS HE ABOUT MY HEIGHT ? - TALLER ? SHORTER ? - TALLER . ABOUT 6 ' 2 " , 6 ' 3 " ? YEAH . MAYBE EVEN BIGGER . AND HE WAS DRESSED ALL IN BLACK . ALL RIGHT . [ Woman ] COME ON . THAT 'S IT . [ Chattering ] WHAT HAPPENED TO KEVIN ? WHERE IS HE ? KEVIN WAS ABDUCTED FROM THIS ROOM . SEVERAL OF THE CHILDREN WITNESSED IT . WE 'RE GETTING A DESCRIPTION OF THE MAN . BUT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT HIM . YOU SAID HE WOULD BE SAFE . WE 'RE SORRY , MRS. KRYDER . WE 'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN . [ Softly ] SCULLY ? DID YOU GET A COMPOSITE ? YEAH , IT LOOKS LIKE KEVIN WAS ABDUCTED ... BY HOMER SIMPSON 'S EVIL TWIN . THIS ISN 'T THE KILLER , MULDER . THAT 'S A SAFE ASSUMPTION . NO , I MEAN IT DOESN 'T MATCH THE M.O. NONE OF THE PREVIOUS VICTIMS WERE EVER ABDUCTED . NONE OF THE PREVIOUS VICTIMS WERE TEN-YEAR-OLD BOYS . [ Sighs ] IS THIS THE MAN THAT TOOK KEVIN ? YEAH , BUT WE 'RE NOT SURE HOW ACCURATE THAT IS . - IT 'S OWEN . - YOU KNOW THIS MAN ? YEAH , IT 'S OWEN JARVIS . WHEN MY HUSBAND LEFT , WE HIRED HIM TO DO YARD WORK . [ Man ] I CARVED ALL THE ANIMALS MYSELF . IT 'S THE ARK . DO YOU LIKE IT ? SO , WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE ME HOME , OWEN ? THERE 'S NO REASON TO BE AFRAID . I 'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU . I 'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU , KEVIN . YOU 'RE A VERY SPECIAL BOY . YOU KNOW THAT , DON 'T YOU ? - I WANT TO GO HOME . - YOU CAN 'T DO THAT . - I CAN 'T LET YOU . - WHY NOT ? BECAUSE IT 'S NOT SAFE ! I 'M YOUR FRIEND , KEVIN . YOUHAVETO TRUST ME . JUST THINK OF ME AS ... YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL . - [ Car Approaching ] - SHH ! [ Car Getting Closer ] DON 'T SAY A WORD . STAY HERE . DON 'T MOVE . FEDERAL AGENTS ! PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON . PUT IT DOWN , RIGHT HERE . DOWN ! NOW ! PUT IT DOWN . WHERE 'S THE BOY ? WHERE 'S THE BOY ? DON 'T HURT HIM . PLEASE ? - [ Hatch Door Banging ] - [ Gasping ] [ Panting ] KEVIN ? [ Handcuffs Clicking ] WHERE 'S THE BOY ? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH KEVIN ? HE CAN 'T GO HOME . IT 'S NOT SAFE THERE . I TOLD HIM THAT . IS THIS KEVIN KRYDER 'S BLOOD ? YES . - DID YOU HURT HIM ? - NO . I 'M NOT THE ONE THAT WANTS TO HURT HIM . IF IT 'S NOT YOU , THEN WHO IS IT ? I WAS ONLY ASKED TO PROTECT THE BOY . - BY WHO ? WHO ASKED YOU TO PROTECT HIM ? - GOD . [ Scoffing ] - IT 'S QUITE A LONG DISTANCE CALL , ISN 'T IT ? - YOU DON 'T UNDERSTAND . - UNLESS SOMEONE PROTECTS KEVIN- - - IT 'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT , RIGHT ? " HE WHO HAS EARS , LET HIM HEAR- - " " AND HE THAT HAS A TONGUE , LET HIM SPEAK . " NOW , TELL ME WHERE HE IS . YOU BELIEVE ME , DON 'T YOU ? I MEAN , YOU MUST WEAR THAT AS A REMINDER . MR. JARVIS , MY RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS ARE HARDLY THE ISSUE HERE . BUT THEY ARE . HOW CAN YOU HELP KEVIN ... IF YOU DON 'T BELIEVE ? EVEN THE KILLER , HE BELIEVES . AND THE TOWNSFOLK WONDER WHY I SLEEP IN ON SUNDAY . MASS ON CHRISTMAS . FISH ON FRIDAY . YOU THINK THAT MAKES YOU A GOOD CHRISTIAN ? JUST BECAUSE YOU DON 'T UNDERSTAND SACRIFICE , BECAUSE YOU 'RE UNWILLING , DON 'T THINK FOR A MOMENT THAT YOU SET THE RULES FOR ME . I DON 'T QUESTION HIS WORD . WHATEVER HE ASKS OF ME , I 'LL DO . [ Chair Scraping ] - [ Mulder ] SIT DOWN , MR. JARVIS . - I JUST WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN . - [ Mulder ] HEY ! - [ Scully ] DON 'T ! [ Crashing ] [ Panting , Grunting ] [ Handcuffs Clicking ] MOM ! MOM !

[ Hangers Rattling ] [ Breathing Erratically ] [ Rattling Continues ] RUN , KEVIN . RUN ! - [ Gasping ] - [ Steam Hissing ] KEVIN . WHAT IS IT ? [ Panting ] UPSTAIRS ! YOU 'LL BE OKAY . YOU 'LL BE OKAY . ARE YOU THE ONE THAT WAS SENT TO PROTECT ME ? [ Scully ] OWEN LEE JARVIS . ADULT CAUCASIAN MALE . 42 YEARS OF AGE . CAUSE OF DEATH IS STRANGULATION , CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS VICTIMS , AS SUGGESTED BY BURN MARKS AROUND HIS NECK . EXCEPT- - APPEARS TO BE SOME KIND OF A PATTERN , JUST TO THE RIGHT OF HIS WINDPIPE . POSSIBLY A HANDPRINT . NOTE TO THE LAB TO CHECK FURTHER . IT IS NOW 14 HOURS AFTER THE TIME OF DEATH . BUT SO FAR HIS BODY HASN 'T EVEN BEGUN TO BREAK DOWN . RIGOR MORTIS HAS YET TO SET IN . HIS CORE BODY TEMPERATURE ... REMAINS AT 98 DEGREES . HIS SKIN COLOR , LIVIDITY , IS HEALTHY . THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME- - [ Doorknob Jiggling ] ANY REVELATIONS ? MULDER , WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR ? WOULD YOU SMELL MR. JARVIS ? [ Scoffs ] YOU WANT ME TO SMELL HIM ? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO BE SMELLING ? Y-YOU DON 'T DETECT A FAINT FLORAL ODOR ? MULDER , THIS MAN 'S BODY IS IN NO WAY DECOMPOSING NORMALLY . IN CATECHISM , WE LEARNED OF INSTANCES LIKE THIS . SO-CALLED " INCORRUPTIBLES " WHOSE BODIES WOULDN 'T DECAY , AND WHO ... EMITTED A SMELL OF FLOWERS . YOU 'RE SERIOUS ? SAINT CECILIA , SAINT FRANCIS- - AND NOW YOU 'RE SUGGESTING THAT THIS IS " SAINT OWEN " ? I DON 'T KNOW . SCULLY , THOSE STORIES YOU 'RE REFERRING TO ARE MOSTLY REGARDED AS ... HAGIOGRAPHIC FABRICATIONS , NOT HISTORICAL TRUTHS . - JUST LIKE THE OCCURRENCE OF THE STIGMATA . - WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS ? THIS MAN ? HE WAS RATHER ABNORMAL IN LIFE . MAYBE HE 'S DECOMPOSING ABNORMALLY . ISN 'T A " SAINT " OR A HOLY PERSON JUST ANOTHER TERM FOR SOMEBODY WHO 'S ABNORMAL ? - DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT ? - I ... BELIEVE IN THE IDEA ... THAT GOD 'S HAND CAN BE WITNESSED . I BELIEVE HE CAN CREATE MIRACLES , YES . EVEN IF SCIENCE CAN 'T EXPLAIN THEM ? MAYBE THAT 'S JUST WHAT FAITH IS . WELL , I WOULDN 'T LET FAITH OVERWHELM YOUR JUDGMENT HERE . THESE PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY FANATICS BEHAVING FANATICALLY , USING RELIGION AS A JUSTIFICATION . THEY GIVE BONA FIDE PARANOIACS LIKE MYSELF A BAD NAME . THEY 'RE NO MORE DIVINE OR HOLY THAN THAT KETCHUP WE SAW ON THE MURDERED PREACHER . I THINK ONCE YOU 'RE FINISHED YOUR AUTOPSY , YOU 'LL COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION . SAINT OWEN . [ Doors Opening ] [ Door Closing ] [ Sighs ] [ Telephones Ringing , Chattering ] GOT YOUR MESSAGE . WHAT DID YOU TURN UP ? IT 'S WHATYOUTURNED UP . WHAT ? THOSE BURN MARKS AND IMPRESSIONS ON JARVIS 'S NECK ? THEY PULLED A PAIR OF PRINTS . TAKE A LOOK AT THIS : A PARTIAL INDEX AND A FULL OBLIQUE BURNED RIGHT ONTO THE SKIN . ANY EVIDENCE AS TO HOW THE KILLER MANAGED TO DO THAT ? NO , NOT YET . BUT I CROSS-CHECKED THE PRINTS IN THE N.C.I.C. DATABASE . THEY BELONG TO A BUSINESSMAN NAMED SIMON GATES . HE 'S THE C.E.O. OF A COMPANY BASED IN ATLANTA . HE 'S ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN IN THE SOUTH . " A POWERFUL AND RESPECTED MAN . " HE WAS ARRESTED THREE YEARS AGO ON A D.U.I. LEFT A YOUNG BOY PARALYZED . HE RECEIVED A SUSPENDED SENTENCE , THEN HE LEFT THE COUNTRY . WENT TO ISRAEL . ISRAEL ? - HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE JERUSALEM SYNDROME ? - YES , WHEN PEOPLE ... WHO VISIT THE HOLY LAND SUFFER RELIGIOUS DELUSIONS INDUCED BY THE JOURNEY . YEAH , THEY RETURN HOME CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE THE MESSIAH , MOSES , THE VIRGIN MARY- - EVEN THE DEVIL HIMSELF . IF THAT 'S WHAT SIMON GATES BELIEVES , HE 'S JUST AS DELUSIONAL AS MICHAEL KRYDER , ONLY A LOT MORE DANGEROUS . IT DOESN 'T EXPLAIN HOW HE WAS ABLE TO BURN HIS FINGERPRINTS INTO OWEN JARVIS 'S FLESH . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] [ Single Beep ] MULDER . WHAT ? - WELL , HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE ? - IT 'S KEVIN , ISN 'T IT ? HOL-HOLD ON . YEAH , A SOCIAL WORKER TOOK KEVIN OUT TO LUNCH AT 1 : 00 . BUT WITNESSES CLAIM THEY SAW HIM OUTSIDE THE FACILITY ... WITH HIS MOTHER AT THE EXACT SAME TIME . [ Horn Honking ] KEVIN ! LAY OFF THE HORN . [ Scoffs ] DAMN ! [ Sniffs ] - [ Brakes Squeaking ] - [ Car Door Opening ] LOOKS LIKE YOU 'RE HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE . CAN I GIVE YOU A HAND ? OH , NO . IT 'S FINE . DOES THIS ALL THE TIME . I JUST HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT TO COOL DOWN . AT LEAST LET ME TAKE THE CAP OFF FOR YOU . THAT SHOULD GET THINGS STARTED . NO . I 'M FINE . REALLY , IT 'S NO TROUBLE AT ALL . IN THE OLD DAYS , PEOPLE USED TO STOP TO HELP . NOW THEY JUST DRIVE ON BY . PEOPLE ALSO USED TO SAY THANK YOU . WHAT DO YOU WANT ? I THINK YOU KNOW . - HEY , MISTER ! - KEVIN ! RUN ! NO ! [ Grunts ] HEY , MOM ! GET UP . PLEASE , MOM , COME ON ! [ Moaning ] MOM ? [ Groaning ] [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Tires Squealing ] MOM , ARE YOU OKAY ? COME ON , MOM ! DON 'T FALL ASLEEP ! COME ON , WAKE UP ! - COME ON ! - [ Tires Squealing ] [ Sirens Wailing , Chattering On Police Radio ] SHE DIED BECAUSE OF ME . IT WAS AN ACCIDENT , KEVIN . YOUR MOTHER WAS ONLY TRYING TO PROTECT YOU . WHY DOES HE WANT TO HURT ME ? I DON 'T KNOW . BUT I WON 'T LET HIM HURT YOU . - I PROMISE . - IT 'S BECAUSE I 'M DIFFERENT , ISN 'T IT ? WHY CAN 'T I JUST BE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE ? HOW ARE YOU DIFFERENT , KEVIN ? [ Sighs ] KEVIN ? I JUST AM . AGENT MULDER AND I ARE GONNA TAKE YOU BACK TO THE SHELTER . THERE 'LL BE A DOCTOR TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOU THERE . DO I HAVE TO GO BACK THERE ? NO . UH- - NO , YOU DON 'T . WHY DON 'T YOU TUCK BACK INSIDE ? IS HE READY TO GO ? I WANT TO KEEP HIM WITH US , MULDER , UNTIL GATES IS APPREHENDED . LOOK , I KNOW ABOUT GETTING PERSONALLY INVOLVED , AND I 'M NOT . DID HE I.D. GATES ? [ Softly ] YES . THAT 'LL HELP . A MAN FITTING GATES 'S DESCRIPTION RENTED THE CAR . UNDER THE NAME " FORAU . " THAT 'S ONE OF THE DEVIL 'S DISCIPLES . [ Chattering On Police Radios Continues ] [ Water Running , Stopping ] [ Gasps ] I 'LL WAIT RIGHT OUTSIDE . [ Door Closes ] YOU NEVER DRAWMYBATH . KEVIN HAS A CUT UNDER HIS RIBS . HE WAS IN AN ACCIDENT . NO . I- - I WAS WITH THE PARAMEDICS WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING AT HIM . IT WASN 'T THERE . MAYBE YOU MISSED IT . NO , MULDER . - I WAS PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION . - WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS ? YESTERDAY , I SAW KEVIN 'S HANDS . THEY WERE BLEEDING FROM IDENTICAL WOUNDS ON THE TOP AS ON THE BOTTOM . JUST LIKE IN THE CRUCIFIXION . SCULLY- - THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER SIGNS . I HAVEN 'T SAID ANYTHING UNTIL NOW , BECAUSE I HAVEN 'T BEEN SURE- - AND I 'M STILL NOT SURE . - SURE OF WHAT , EXACTLY ? - HOW KEVIN WAS ABLE TO BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE . JUST LIKE SAINT IGNATIUS WAS ABLE TO DO IN THE BIBLE . [ Scoffing ] THAT WAS IN THE BIBLE . THAT 'S A PARABLE . IT 'S A METAPHOR FOR THE TRUTH , NOT THE TRUTH ITSELF . WHY DIDN 'T KEVIN CONVENIENTLY BILOCATE WHEN OWEN JARVIS ABDUCTED HIM FROM THE SHELTER ? HOW IS IT THAT YOU 'RE ABLE TO GO OUT ON A LIMB WHENEVER YOU SEE A LIGHT IN THE SKY , BUT YOU 'RE UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THE POSSIBILITY OF A MIRACLE ... EVEN WHEN IT 'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU ? I WAIT FOR A MIRACLE EVERY DAY . WHAT I 'VE SEEN HERE HAS TESTED MY PATIENCE , NOT MY FAITH . WELL , WHAT ABOUT WHAT I 'VE SEEN ? - [ Window Opening ] - KEVIN ? YOU OKAY ? [ Knocking ] I DIDN 'T LOCK IT . I 'LL CALL THE POLICE . THEY PUT UP A CORDON IN A TEN-MILE RADIUS . NO SIGN OF THEM . [ Traffic Passing ] BEST I CAN FIGURE IS , THEY MUST HAVE HAD AN ACETYLENE TORCH IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK . I DON 'T KNOW HOW ELSE THEY COULD HAVE DONE IT . I WASN 'T OUT OF THAT ROOM FOR MORE THAN TWO MINUTES , MULDER . COME ON . THERE 'S SOMEONE I WANT TO TALK TO AGAIN . WHO ? KEVIN 'S FATHER . WHY ? HE KNEW THAT KEVIN WAS IN DANGER . HE WARNED ABOUT A " POWERFUL AND RESPECTED MAN . " THE MAN 'S A NUTCASE , SCULLY . MAYBE HE IS- - BUT IF KEVIN IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER- - EVEN IF HIS FATHER HAS ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT GATES- - IT DOESN 'T HELP US RIGHT NOW . WELL , IT 'S NOT DOING US A LOT OF GOOD STANDING AROUND HERE . [ Chattering On Police Radio ] SO , THIS IS THE MAN WHO TOOK MY SON . YOU 'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE ? NO . WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO HURT KEVIN ? WHAT DOES HE WANT ? YOU REALLY DON 'T KNOW ? I-I 'M-I 'M SORRY . I 'M JUST A LITTLE FOGGY RIGHT NOW . SCULLY ? HALOPERIDOL . IT 'S A POWERFUL ANTIPSYCHOTIC . THEY 'VE INCREASED HIS DOSAGE . [ Slams Down Book ] MR. KRYDER ? YOU SAID SOMETHING BEFORE ... ABOUT " COMING FULL CIRCLE TO FIND THE TRUTH . " WHAT DOES IT MEAN ? " FULL CIRCLE TO FIND THE TRUTH . " I DON 'T KNOW . I JUST CAN 'T REMEMBER . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] [ Exasperated Sigh ] SCULLY . THEY HAD A SIGHTING OF GATES . HE TRIED TO RENT ANOTHER CAR AT THE AIRPORT , UNDER THE NAME " FORAU " AGAIN . DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID ? MULDER , LOOK . ARROWS THAT FORM A CIRCLE . " FULL CIRCLE TO FIND THE TRUTH . " GATES 'S COMPANY OWNS A RECYCLING PLANT NEAR HERE . - THAT 'S WHERE HE 'S TAKEN KEVIN . - SCULLY , THE MAN IS AT THE AIRPORT . IF HE HASN 'T ALREADY KILLED KEVIN , HE 'S TRYING TO GET AS FAR AWAY AS HE CAN . I DON 'T THINK SO , MULDER . YOU THINK IT 'S YOU , DON 'T YOU ? YOU THINK YOU 'RE THE ONE WHO 'S BEEN CHOSEN TO PROTECT KEVIN . I DON 'T KNOW . LOOK , IF I 'M WRONG , I 'LL MEET YOU OUT AT THE AIRPORT , OKAY ? [ Gates ] THE SUN WILL BE TURNED INTO DARKNESS , AND THE MOON WILL TURN TO BLOOD , BECAUSE OF YOU , SON . IS THAT WHY YOU WANT TO HURT ME ? IT 'S NOT A QUESTION OF WANTING . YOU HAVE TO DIE , KEVIN . FOR EVERYONE . FOR THE NEW AGE TO COME . YOU UNDERSTAND THAT , DON 'T YOU ? THE OTHERS WERE ALL FALSE PROPHETS . YOU ARE THE ONLY ... TRUE ONE ... AMONG THE 12 . [ Footsteps ] STOP ! FEDERAL AGENT ! I 'M ARMED ! LET HIM GO . LET HIM GO ... AND WE 'LL TALK ABOUT IT . THERE 'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT ! I WAS CALLED UPON ! NO ! LET ME GO ! LET ME GO ! LET ME GO ! NO ! KEVIN . HOLD ON .

[ Kevin ] YEAH . [ Door Opens , Closes ] YOU OKAY ? YEAH , I THINK SO . WE GOT A COUPLE HOURS BEFORE OUR FLIGHT . I TOLD THE SHERIFF ... WE 'D GO DOWN AND MAKE A FORMAL STATEMENT ABOUT GATES 'S DEATH . [ Sighs ] I 'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU 'D HANDLE THAT ALONE , MULDER . I HAVE AN ERRAND I NEED TO RUN . OKAY . I 'LL SEE YOU AT THE AIRPORT . BLESS ME , FATHER , FOR I HAVE SINNED . IT HAS BEEN SIX YEARS SINCE MY LAST CONFESSION , AND ... SINCE THEN , I 'VE DRIFTED AWAY FROM THE CHURCH . I 'M NOT SURE WHY , EXACTLY . HAVE YOU COME TO CONFESS ? NO , UM- - THERE 'S A MAN THAT I WORK WITH . A FRIEND . AND USUALLY , I 'M ABLE TO DISCUSS THESE THINGS WITH HIM . BUT NOT THIS . FATHER , DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES ? OF COURSE . I SEE THEM EVERY DAY . THE RISING SUN , THE BIRTH OF A CHILD- - NO , I 'M- - I 'M TALKING ABOUT EVENTS THAT DEFY EXPLANATION . THINGS THAT ... I BELIEVE HELPED ME TO SAVE A YOUNG BOY 'S LIFE . BUT NOW I WONDER IF I SAW THEM AT ALL . IF I DIDN 'T JUST IMAGINE THEM . WHY DO YOU DOUBT YOURSELF ? BECAUSE MY PARTNER DIDN 'T SEE THEM . HE DIDN 'T- - HE DIDN 'T BELIEVE THEM . AND USUALLY , HE- - [ Sighs ] HE BELIEVES WITHOUT QUESTION . MAYBE THEY WEREN 'T MEANT FOR HIM TO SEE . MAYBE THEY WERE ONLY MEANT FOR YOU . IS THAT POSSIBLE ? WITH THE LORD , ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE . PERHAPS YOU SAW THESE THINGS BECAUSE YOU NEEDED TO . TO FIND MY WAY BACK ? SOMETIMES WE MUST COME FULL CIRCLE TO FIND THE TRUTH . WHY DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU ?

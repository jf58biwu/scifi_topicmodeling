 my father told me that war begins with one person 's ego and greed . He told me that it is the most disgraceful thing on earth and that it is necessary . I was a small boy and did not know why my father suddenly said that . I could not understand how my father could be so philosophically aware of war ... peaceful Zaar . My father was certainly an unusual man . surrounded by nature only my father had cultural ideas like someone from Ishin . Perhaps being a Wind Master had something to do with it . I did not have the same ability to control the wind . Since one cannot be a Guardian without being able to use the wind I planned to work in the village when I grew up . But my father would not allow that and continued to train me in the ways of the wind . Father must have had a premonition that I would soon meet that girl and be caught in a world of chaos . Apremonition of the day I would succeed my father and earn the honor of being a Wind Master . bringing both overwhelming destructive power and the truth about me . The day I had to stop being a boy . has just entered the body of the maiden . has been accepted as our new Wind Master and keeper of the gate . I don 't get the idea of a Wind Master . Yeah ... though . You 're right . if you compare them ... What 's that ? What is happening ? Why is the village ? Father ! Ruda ! What is happening ? Priest ! Father ! Women and children to the shrine ! take your weapons and fight ! the Wind Master . Red Eye ! I didn 't think you existed ... Another with a cursed eye like mine ! Hey ... Open your eyes ... Open your eyes ... Ruda ! Get her ! Ruda ! That birthmark ! Stop ... Don 't touch my sister ... Don 't touch Ansa ... Are you talking about her ? Why ? Why are you doing these terrible things ? What is your object ? One is to bring you back alive . Moog . Father ... I killed him . I killed him in accordance with the orders of Lord Zanak . Red Eye . Stop it ! including Father ... What right do you have ? You are the key to the wind 's power . this world will again be controlled by gods and culture will be denied . His Excellency told me to stop at no means in capturing Red Eye and returning him to Zoro Earth . That is the end of my explanation . You will be taken now . Ansa ! take Red Eye back . Bork ? Yes ... Tell those left in the village to return to my Dedra . Commander ? Send the Zuef here . That again ? Let me do it once in a while . Stop complaining and do it ! We 're already over time ! All right . What the ? there was a single star . The gods smashed it with a wooden hammer ... the others moons . The three moons continue to watch over humans at night ... they come together as one . You ... out of jealousy . took the air from the land of the gods and descended to earth . I am wind . I am wind . My name is wind ! What is that ? This is serious ... Hey ! Send the Zuef ! Stop at nothing in retrieving our commander ! What have you done ? I am wind . My name is wind . I am the god of wind who has taken root and fallen into a deep sleep here . who fell into a deep sleep ... Anastasia . I see ... He is ... Lord Zanak did indeed speak the truth . Anastasia ! Blue-eyed goddess ! I will not leave you again ! Commander ! We have confirmed the commander 's safety . scaring me like that ... That girl 's going to die before I get a chance to sleep with her ... What 's that ? Agahari ... Lord . Did you capture Red Eye ? I failed . Fool ... You could not catch him alone ? Please forgive me . I think you understand the importance . Listen to me . If the power of the wind is revived our kingdom will return to an era of frigid darkness . The culture we have spent years developing will be destroyed . is the key to that revival . that alone is what we must prevent . don 't you ? Yes . my daughter . Father ... I shall return to capture Red Eye ! Good . Go ! I would like to ask one thing . What is it ? Moog ... Who are they ? Father ... My Batros ? huh ? what 's your name ? I ... I 'm ... what is it ? Your name . O-Oh ... It 's Ruda . Ruda ? That 's a strange name . That 's the name of a villain in a short play from the north . My name 's Nosaku . I 'm a beetle scientist . The best one in the world ! Isn 't that beautiful ? Umm ... Where are we ? Here ? This is my house . It 's in the Meel desert . The Meel desert ? Only your right eye is red . Is it unusual ? A little ... But we often find it in insects . It 's a genetic problem . Oops . Did I say the wrong thing ? No ... what happened to you ? It 's lucky I was passing by . Was it thieves ? Did they take everything from you and leave you that way ? it 's ... The village ... They came and ... Father ... Ansa ... Who is the man named Moog ? Did you kill him ? as you ordered . Good . Why did you specify that I kill that man ? Why me ? With my hands ? I have already told you . Commander ! Is Red Eye really in this desert ? He 's here . He is definitely here . Is it your sixth sense again ? That 's right . But it is stronger than usual today . There is something different . Are you part of the Zoro Earth army ? Zoro Earth ? Right . it was a small country to the north but when some higher-ups in the army took over they suddenly turned it into a military state . those higher-ups seem to essentially be the leaders of Zoro Earth . Father ... They killed him ... Those bastards killed my father ... but he picked me up and raised me like I was his true son . To kill a father like that ... The reason I live like a hermit in this desert is so I don 't have to meet bastards like that . they use southern insects as weapons ! Your village which was destroyed ... What was it called ? Zaar . Zaar ? You mean that Zaar ? Y-Yes . too ? I found some unusual insect fossils in that area ! and now Zaar . All the places with good fossils are being destroyed by that army . Ishin ... Right . Ishin too . There were lots of fossils there . Ishin ... What 's wrong ? Hey ! What 's wrong ? Hey ! What 's wrong with you ? Coming ... What 's coming ? They are ... Honorable Maiden . We were very worried . You were unconscious for a full day . Ruda ! Did Father and Ruda ? Commander ! He is not here . I see . Is Ishin that direction ? Do you want to go further north ? I 'm too far away . but I still feel him in this direction . We 're heading to Ishin ! Why are those Zoro Earth bastards following you ? I don 't know . But they said that I was necessary . Necessary ? Why ? And why are we going to Ishin ? Why must I go to Ishin ? Why ? The Ishin shrine . The shrine ... Of Ishin ... What could there be in a place like this ? Those Zoro Earth bastards destroyed the statue of Air . We have the same statue in Zaar ... That 's a Zoro Earth statue . What 's wrong ? Red Eye . You ... You ! Don 't move ! Don 't cause us trouble . Damn ! Return Ansa and Father ! Silence ... Silence ! Ruda ... Eran ... Dead ... You killed them ! What the ? Ansa ? Ansa ! The path of the gods ? It can 't actually exist ! Ansa ! Ansa ! Ruda ! You 're alive ! too . Where are we ? Ishin Shrine . Ishin ? Why am I here ? The girl with the birthmark ... we know that we were correct . We should finish harvesting the Red Energy tonight . You have grown ... are you still here ? isn 't it ? What will happen to the three we captured ? Execution . That is Lord Zanak 's order . Even though we had to be so careful about bringing them back alive ? I can never understand why he does things ... too ! Do you know why I did not finish you off ? I have something to ask you . Why do you have the same birthmark on your back ? It is an ancient Zaar character symbolizing wind . It is proof of a Zaar maiden . There should only be one other person in this world who has the same mark . My father told me that when I was a baby I had a twin named Eran who was taken away and killed . Don 't talk foolishness . daughter of Lord Zanak . the daughter of Moog ! You will all be executed tomorrow morning . - Bork ... - Yes ? Do you want to sleep with me ? You can do it now if you want . No ... Well ... I do clearly have that desire ... if you ask ... then I guess it 's just an excuse ... men have their pride ... Why are you worrying about it now ? You know that Zanak is not your true father ! I will follow you . I could care less about this Zoro Earth army . Ruda ! Ansa . In accordance with Lord Zanak 's orders we will now commence the execution . What was that ? What 's happening ? Bork ! You ! but we have to cancel this execution . Commander ! Hey ! What is going on ? She is Eran ! Ruda ! She is Eran ! You ? I don 't believe it ... It 's a lie ... Ruda ! She has the same mark as me on her back ! There is no time to talk ! Let 's escape from this Longinus ! Escape ? You 're letting us go ? That 's right ? Let 's go ! Eran ! What 's wrong ? Get going ! Eran ! Ansa ! There is still something I have to do . What are these explosions ? I set them up last night . Ruda ! Are we just going to strand Eran ? She rescued us ! Start running when we reach the bottom ! - What was that ? - What 's going on ? What is your commander going to do ? We 're supposed to meet here . please go get Eran ! Ansa ! Damn ! The intervals of the explosions are too close ! We have no choice ! Let 's go ! Get in ! Eran ! She came ... please answer one more question for me . Am I really your daughter ? nor anything else . your eyes ... Does any of it resemble me ? I shall kill you . What are you aiming at ? Here ! Can 't you get me here ? Your true father was Moog of Zaar . you killed your father with your own hands . Your own father ... What 's wrong ? Are you finished already ? believing that I was your father for sixteen years . Destroying human life is a true pleasure . I have no more use for you . We have harvested your Blue Energy . Blue Energy ... one of the things that has destroyed your life . Eran ! Here we go ! Sir ! Auxiliary reactor power down sixty percent ! Institute supplementary generator power ! Laudis Medical Unit to Sector 105 ! Don 't you know what caused those explosions yet ? it appears that a series of time bombs were set in several places on the ship . What ? Who could have done that ? Your Excellency ! It was Agahari . I 'm afraid I don 't understand ... Why would Commander Agahari do such a thing ? Red Eye . With Red Eye ? I don 't believe it ... What about our Zoro Earth army ? What will happen to us if the Power of the Wind is resurrected ? Do not panic ! Agahari has stolen a Nattel jet and is heading east . Order an attack unit into immediate pursuit . do not let Agahari and Red Eye escape . Sir ! Stop at nothing ... You may kill them if necessary . Damn ! The controls are not responding . Will we make it ? Five people is too much weight for this Nattel . I don 't know if we can shake off anyone chasing us . Why have I lived this life ? I lived as Lord Zanak 's daughter ... and trusted that the happiness of the people of the world was linked to Zoro Earth 's prosperity . But I was never his daughter . I was only being used ! What are you talking about ? You are our sister ! Eran . Forget about the past and live together with us in our village of Zaar . but if we remaining residents ... we will survive . so ... Ansa ! Did you forget that she is the one who destroyed our village ? She attacked our village ... Murdered so many innocent people ... I could never forgive someone like that . Ruda ... Then why did you rescue me ? why did you rescue me ? I don 't know ... I don 't understand why ! So much has happened that I don 't know what is what ! I led the attack that destroyed your village . I know ! I hate you ! I want to kill you right now ! Then kill me ! Go ahead and kill me here and now ! How could I do that ? Eran ? - What was that ? - Dedra ! We 're surrounded ! Bastard ! Take this ! There 's another one ! There 's a trigger in front of you ! Use it ! - Ansa ! - They don 't want to capture us ! They want to kill us ! What ? are you okay ? I 'm fine ... - Damn ! - Nothing is responding ! They 're holding our wings ! Bork ! Ruda ! Ruda ! Eran ! Lord ! We have captured the fleeing Nattel jet ... and one male ... three people have been captured . three ? it seems that Red Eye and Agahari were thrown from the plane during the battle with the Dedra . but nothing was found . most likely they ... Are alive . Zorozaha says that she clearly feels their force . Goddess Zorozaha ... She says that they will resurrect the Power of the Wind . We must find and destroy them to protect the future of Zoro Earth . Continue your search for those two . we will move Longinus to Zaar . To Zaar ? What 's happening ? Longinus has begun to move . Longinus ? You mean this whole fortress ? a major operation must be underway . What kind of operation ? Good question ... Small fries like me don 't know a thing . a prisoner just like you . don 't worry about me . I did what I did because I wanted to . I was sick of this army ... I had a little thing for Commander Agahari . Oops ! Don 't tell Commander that ! I wonder if Ruda and Eran are safe ... in such a terrible storm ... They 're okay . Commander would never kick the bucket like that . You killed your father with your own hands ... Bork ... Red Eye ... Are you injured ? No ... Where are we ? I have no idea ... we had washed ashore here . but it seems like it 's all rock . I was able to catch two . it 's dangerous to Zoro Earth if the Power of the Wind is resurrected . Right . But was that giant hand really the Power of the Wind ? I was taught that the Power of the Wind was an extremely evil force . An evil force ... the setting moon catches its rays and the wind brandishes its strength . the darkness of night is a fool . Truth is too painful for fools . The Power of the Wind is true power . Thus read some scriptures used in ceremonies in the village of Zaar . we have been taught that since ancient times the Power of the Wind is true power . And it is said that only the Wind Masters can see that Power of the Wind . it 's an evil force . it is true power . The meanings are completely opposite . That plus the rising sun and the setting moon catching its rays ... What is all that supposed to mean ? I wonder if Ansa and the others got away ... What 's wrong ? Aren 't you eating ? You could have had your vengeance while I was unconscious ... I thought about it ... But I couldn 't do it . you tried to save me ... You did the same for me . aren 't you ? It looks like an island . Do you know what it 's called ? No . An island this small doesn 't even show up on Zoro Earth maps . I guess not ... Tell me . Did you know my father was also your true father ? No ... I always believed that I was his ... Zanak 's ... daughter until we attacked your village and I saw the girl with the birthmark . - You mean Ansa ? - Yes . I had no idea that I had a twin sister . Moog of Zaar was my true father . And I ... My own true father ... With my own hands ... What 's wrong ? I don 't know . Nattel jets ! It 's too dangerous here ! Let 's get off this ! - They 're coming this way ! - Don 't move or they 'll find us ! Eran ! Eran ! Are you okay ? I 'm fine ... They can 't see us from there . Did they give up ? No ! - They 're following the book ! - What do you mean ? We have to cover ourselves ! It doesn 't matter where ! What ? Let 's get in here ! Watch out ! Ruda ! Hey ! Hang in there ! Ruda ! Ruda ! Ruda ! Ruda ! Ruda ! Why ? Ruda ! A statue of the goddess Air ? Ruda ! Ruda ! too ! Ruda ! Red Energy ... Blue Energy ... Unite in me ... Unite in me ... Unite in me ! It feels like we stopped . Hey ... did you ? I know you 're concerned about those two but you have to sleep when you can . Look at that guy . He stores up all the sleep he can . pal . O-Oh ... The old bones get rusty sitting in here all the time . I wonder where we moved to . Me too . Ruda ... Eran ... idling speed . begin stabilization . stabilization begun . Commence cooling of Number Forty-Two . Okay ! Longinus stabilization complete ! What in the world was that light a while ago on the top level ? Sir . They don 't know ? Why not ? Sir . No readings ? What could that mean ? - And also ... - What ? All the information is not in yet ... once that light stopped shining Lord Zanak could not be found anywhere on Longinus . Lord Zanak is missing ? What 's wrong ? They are coming ! Ruda and Eran are coming ! What are you trying to do ? We can 't just sit here if Commander is on her way ! old man . Give me a hand ! you know . damn you ! We did it ! okay . Now hurry up and get off of me ! It 's clear ! What are you doing ? We can use some of these ... Here you go ! What type of man can 't handle a gun or two ? Let 's go ! H-Hey ! What the hell is going on ? Something 's happening ... - Was he over there ? - No . Damn ! What are we going to do if His Excellency can 't be found ? Stop worrying and keep looking ! So that 's it . What does it mean if they can 't find their leader ? but it 's good news for us ! What 's wrong ? Are you okay ? it 's nothing . Are you sure ? let 's get off this Longinus ! Follow me ! What ? Ruda and Eran and ? disturbing presence ? Are we going to steal a plane like last time ? we might end up like before . We 're heading to Level One . Level One ? Why ? I 'm pretty sure there were some emergency parachutes down there . How are you doing ? No good ! It 's locked ! We can 't get at the parachutes ! too ! old man ? Damn ! Those safety guys only come through when you don 't want them to . Why is she so low ? I don 't believe it ! We can 't open any of them ! now ? this doesn 't work ! You have to release the safety first ! Safety ? this ? What are you doing here ? ! Old man ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Why do you think I gave you that gun ? Sorry ... There 's no choice . We have to jump ! Jump ? With no parachute ? There 's a forest right below us . It will cushion our fall ! now ! Okay ! Damn ! Whatever happens happens ! Let 's go ! Bork ! I 'm fine ! old man ? I ... don 't think so ... What was that ? Ruda ... Eran ! Damn ! They don 't quit ! Hey ! Can you still run ? Damn ! Look out ! Bork ! Are you okay ? This is nothing ! You can 't even call it a wound ... It 's a little hard for me to run . You two go on ahead ! No ! We can 't do that ! You have to come with us ! You have to meet Eran again ! Don 't worry . I 'll take care of them and catch up to you ! Hey ... What is it ? old man . I told you I 'm not an old man ! old man ! Get out of here . Those bastards will be here soon ! why did you help us ? I don 't really know ... Go on ! Why did I ? Because she looked like ... Because she looked just like Agahari . Ruda ! Eran ! Ruda ! Eran ! Ansa ! Thank goodness ... You 're both okay ... - Where are we ? - Zaar . What did you say ? What are we doing here ? We 're the ones who want to ask that ! That 's right ... We floated to some small island ... Then the Zoro Earth jets found us ... a statue of Air appeared ... A statue of Air on a small island ? how is your shoulder ? It 's all healed ... Where is Bork ? What happened to Bork ? To save us he stayed and ... Bork ... What 's that ? Zanak ! That 's right ! It seems like that bastard Zanak disappeared from his fortress . Impossible . That man never leaves Longinus . We have to go ... To the shrine ... In order to stop him ... As I thought ... They were guided here ... What in the world just happened ? But it is already too late . Look at his eyes ! What does it mean ? Eran ! Bork ... - Eran ! - Eran ! It is already in my grasp ... I possess it ... The Power of the Wind is already mine . The world is mine ... The moment in which everything is at my feet has arrived . What is wrong ? Do you hate me ? Let me tell you something else . a man was murdered in the city of Ishin because he would not give me a baby with one red eye . That 's right . The one who killed your true father was also me . Ruda ! You are nothing . Do you really think you can oppose me ? You don 't seem to be dead yet . Let me show you something spectacular . What the ? That time before ... This is the resurrection of the true Power of the Wind . This is the true Power of the Wind . I am now the absolute ruler of this world . Impossible ! A blue eye ! Ansa has a blue eye ... Now I see . It makes sense if you think about it . Ansa and Eran are twin sisters ... too . Why ? Why is there another blue eye ? As the sun begins to rise the setting moon catches its rays ... The statue of Air was hidden on a small island ... but one was hidden . What is happening ? What is happening to me ? I see ... I need the blue eye ... The other ... Blue eye ... The other blue eye ... The blue eye ... Blue ... Blue ... Blue ... to truly resurrect the Power of the Wind ... and both the blue eyes of Eran and Ansa were necessary . Nosaku ? Nothing ... can 't you ? It still exists today holy strong kind looking down on us all . as you would expect has continued his research on insects . We still wonder what kind of research it is . Ansa seems to be helping Nosaku out at his lab . and truly beautiful . The men in the village all seem to have their eyes on her . the crops have borne much fruit giving us a large harvest . We 're going to be busy again . And ... with me . That 's right ... but ... looking down on us . Holy strong and kind ...

 " I 'm from a planet called ' Earth ' ... I 'm human . " " Whoo ! Ha ! Have I got your attention now ? ! " Hi , my name is Ben Browder and I 'd like to welcome you to this special presentation : Farscape ... what the frell is that ? Now , some of you may be aware that Farscape is our attempt to entertain you with something a bit out of the ordinary . But that may be all that you know about us , and that 's why we made this special . This presentation It 's a crash course primer on Farscape . For those of you who don 't know the show but who may plan on watching our third season So , I 'm coming to you live , at least at the time that we shot this , from one of our sets ... in beautiful Sydney , Australia , which is where Farscape is filmed . Grab your pens and pencils and come with me . My characters name is John Crichton . He 's an astronaut and he 's a test pilot . He was conducting a mission ... of his own design , in the Farscape One module . - Canaveral Things went horribly wrong . He gets sucked through a wormhole , dumped in a distant part of the universe , right into the middle of a battle . - Canaveral , I 've been hit ! And he ends up on a ship ... - That 's big ... . That 's really big . ... a really , really big , living ship , called Moya . - Oh , hell ... . Can anybody hear me ? Canaveral ? ! He soon discovers Moya 's populated by a band of escaping prisoners . There 's two of them- - make that escaping ' alien ' prisoners . I 've always wondered what a hero should say when he meets extraterrestrial life-forms . - Hi . My name 's John ... John Cri- - Well , that wasn 't it . These aliens don 't like him . They don 't trust him . Well , you 'll get the idea . I 'm Rygel the 16th , Dominar to over six hundred billion people . - I don 't need to talk to you . - I 'm not here to harm you . Hell , I wouldn 't know ' how ' to harm you . - We can no more trust you than we can trust ' that ' . " That " is another alien . That , changes everything . - Hi , uh , my name 's John Cr- - What is your rank and regiment ? And why are you out of uniform ? ... - Rank and regiment , now ! Boy meets girl . ... girl kicks boys ass . I love my job . Ladies and gentlemen , the beautiful , the talented ... Miss Claudia Black . Thank you . Hello . I play officer Aeryn Sun , and she is born and bred to be a soldier . The minute this one comes into her life , she 's thrown out of the Peacekeepers . Peacekeepers- - those are the bad guys . Are they ? - Yes , they are . - That 's debatable . - No , it 's not . - Let 's not talk about it right now . No , no . We 're gonna talk about D 'Argo . Big guy- - movie trailer voice . ET- - Extra Tentacles . And these two hit it off right from the start . - Get your hands offa me ! - I have no idea what goes on in that tiny little brain of yours , D 'Argo ! - I have no idea why you do anything that you do ! - Well , catch a clue pal , ' cause I 'm tired of sticking ' my hand out , ... only to have you snap at it ! " - Everytime I let down my guard ... you disappoint me . - Sorry ... I 'm only human . Well , it didn 't happen overnight , but gradually they discovered they had things they could learn from one another . Very mature ... important things . - One , two , three ... - Again I win ! - No , I win . Paper wraps rock . - Oh , paper cannot possibly beat rock . - It does- - paper beats rock . - Rock rips through paper . - Well , D 'Argo , that 's not how it works . Paper beats rock . - It 's unrealistic ! - Well , it 's the rules ! Yeah , but they also learned that they can depend on each other for friendship and moral support . - The time has come for farewells , my friend . - Oh , this is not happening . Just feel free to wake me up any time , D 'Argo . - Well , now I can only speak truth , and that comes as good and bad news . - All right . Give me the bad news first . - The bad news is that you 're married , ... and you must endure as a statue for 80 cycles in a strange world . - What 's the good news ? - Chiana and I are having ' fantastic ' sex . Hm . Let 's move on to another one of your great friendships Zhaan ... The bald , blue mama Pa 'u Zotoh Zhaan . Tenth level Pa 'u Priestess . Eight hundred years old . Not bad for eight hundred years ' young . ' She 's spiritual but she can also get ... physical . When she 's not being ... totally mental . - I have always wondered what could ' possibly ' go on in there . - Not a lot . - I 'm a guy . - Come on , Zhaan ... - what are you afraid of ? - Take my head . - Our two spirits will pass into each other until we inhabit a single consciousness ... . - Too late to be afraid . - Move into me . This is called ' Unity' ... the melding of two minds . And there 's one more thing about her . - You 're a plant ? - Always have been , John . Why , does it bother you ? - No it doesn 't ... bother me . I just never ... suspected - you 're a vegetable ? ! Sleek ... sexy vegetable . - I 've heard of your kinds practices . - Your ... appetites . - Such as ? - I 've ... heard of something known as the ... Fourth Sensation . - I have experienced this ... not lately . One of the advantages to travelling around the Uncharted Territories is that we get to meet all kinds of new races and species , and sometimes we adopt one . If they 're young , female , attractive . That had nothing to do with it . Of course not . Her name is Chiana . If we hadn 't taken her in , she would have been imprisoned by her own people , the Nebari . That 's them ; they 're gray . She 's amoral . She 's underage . Sexy . - I don 't respect authority . I do what I want when I want to do it . - Did you ever kill anyone ? - No . - Then help me understand the collar and the cuffs . - Among my people you ... you conform . - You don 't do the things I I did . - What will they do with you now ? - Mental cleansing into a into an obedient zombie . - Chiana - I 'd rather be dead ! Chiana will try anything once . Sometimes she lands on her feet sometimes she lands on her ass . - Chiana - You did it ! - I did it ? ! - I did it ! But , she has kind of grown on us . - Yeah , I 'm goin ' down to the planet . You wanna hang ? On some ... more so than others . - Yeah . - Cool . Can I come in ? - Whoa , ho , ho ! Bad time ! Ah , good-good time , sorry , ah ... wrong time ! Can we talk about you now ? What about me ? You 're contaminated . Irreversibly , thanks to you . - Exactly how much time have you spent with this human ? - Not a lot . - Not much at all . - Because , as you know , Peacekeeper High Command has very clear parameters ... regarding contact with unclassified alien life-forms . - You may have very well exceeded those parameters , Officer Sun - No Sir ... - which would make you irreversibly contaminated . - No Sir , I ... - Take them away . Take them all away ! You see , this is why you don 't want to be a Peacekeeper they hit people and they shoot things . But it 's fun to shoot things . - No ... - Oh , God ! - Thank you ! So much better ! They generally don 't fire at their own shipmates , though . Hey , technically , you fired at me first . Technically , you said I was fat . I said that you were going to be old and fat , that 's different . Oh , that 's even better , isn 't it ? Don 't forget that I have saved your life on more than one occasion . - Aeryn - Come on , Aeryn ... come on . - Gilina - On the ground now ! - Sorry about the mess . And I have helped you with your attitude problem . Oh , now I 've got an attitude problem ! You 've always had an attitude problem . Really ? - We 're stuck together ... - and as long as we are , we might as well be ... - What ? Family ? Friends ? - I want neither . - Well , somebody 's got to be there when you need it . - No offense human ... - but what could I possibly need from you ? Oh , I don 't know ... manners ? Personality ? Stock tips ? - Chin up ! Eyes locked ! John has no idea what it takes to be a soldier . - Can 't you see she 's gonna pass out ? " - Clearly you do not understand . - She knows exactly who we are and would consider it her duty to lie to us . - Point taken . But if she drops you 're not gonna get your answers - This is my world , John ... don 't interfere . Little Miss Tough Chick of the Universe . That 's me . But things are different now . How so ? Well ... they 've kissed . So what ? So , they 're in love . Have you forgotten how it ended ? Oh , no , no , no . See , you 're getting ahead of yourself . Let 's talk about the relationship . No one wants to talk about the relationship except to you . I think what people really want to know about is all the ... Cool things . - Exactly . Cue the cool stuff . - What the hell am I looking at ? - They spit fire ? How come nobody tells me they spit fire ? ! - I must eat ! " - What is the ' matter ' ... with you people ? ! - Twenty ... - Ten ... - Hurry ! - Five ... - Got it ! - Got it ! Sorry , for interrupting . You know ... flossing could help you with that gingivitis . And as you can tell by the critics kind words , we 're obviously struck a chord with ... lights ? Oh , pilot , the lights- - up . Lights ! Pilot , we 're on TV . Oh , I can 't remember what you wanted me to say . Tell them about Moya . Ah , well , ah ... she 's a Leviathan , ah ... biomechanoid ... ah ... What Pilot 's trying to say is that Moya is half mechanical , half biological , and she 's a beautiful ship . Why don 't we show them some clips ? Yes , that would be easier . Leviathans are peaceful beasts of burden . They 're designed without weapons . Each Leviathan has a Pilot aboard as their lifetime navigator and caretaker . Ours is called , " Pilot " . When one of my species is bonded to a Leviathan , we give our lives to the service of others . Ship first . Then those who travel aboard her . No matter what those aboard do to you ? My species is incapable of space flight on our own . If we wish to journey beyond our home planet , this ... is the tradeoff we make ... for the chance to see the galaxy . I consider it ... a perfectly equitable arrangement . Obviously , Moya couldn 't survive without Pilot 's loyal service . He 's always calm , the voice of reason . That 's not strictly true . I 'm not always calm . - Pilot - John So , Pilot , some bad , hair days , huh ? Some were Moya protecting her unborn child . Have you told them about Talyn ? Moya gave birth to a baby named Talyn . It turned out to be a hybrid - part Leviathan , part Peacekeeper warship . It was not an easy birth . The offsprings free . It 's free ! How 's Moya ? She 's okay . We 're okay ! Look . - That 's Moya 's child ? - Yes But it 's covered in weapons . That 's right kids , the Peacekeepers had designed a Leviathan gunship , emphasis on " gun " . What 's Talyn doing ? Young boy ... dangerous toy . So , basically Talyn is a confused kid in need of some guidance . Unfortunately , what he got was Captain Bialar Crais , renegade Peacekeeper . He 's taking over Talyn ! Leave my ship now ! We have to stay and explain is to the Plokavian authorities ! No , Aeryn , we have to leave- - now ! I can 't let you do this ! Go ! Talyn is not mature enough to Starburst ! If you attempt this , you will damage him ! You may die ! " Thank you , Priest , but I know that . We 'll be fine ... where no one can follow us . You ... or the Peacekeepers . Crais , you listen to me , now ! You stop what you 're doing and you leave the ship , now ! Officer Sun ... if by some strange quirk we manage to encounter each other again , I hope that our relationship ... away from the Peacekeepers ... will be a much ... different one next time . You cannot take a child from it 's mother ! You forget ... it was done to me ... and it was done to you . Goodbye , Officer Sun . Talyn 's going into Starburst ! Banished by the Peacekeepers . ... and with nowhere else to go , Crais fled aboard Talyn . But over time he 's proven to be an ally ... or so Aeryn thinks . Why do you make it sound like Aeryn likes Crais ? There 's a lot of history between them . It 's a very complex relationship . Relationship . No , they don 't have a relationship . Crichton and Aeryn have a relationship , and that 's what we 're supposed to be talkin ' about . All right . Fine . Over time Crichton and Aeryn developed a very solid working partnership . Cover me ! Sorry about the mess . Partnership . I like the partnership part , but that 's not what I 'm talkin ' about and you know it . Roll this . Haven 't you ever just clicked with a guy ? What ? ! ' Clicked ' ? ! Yeah , you know ... found a guy attractive . Yes , but it ... I didn 't let it In the beginning I found you ... interesting . Okay , so she finds him interesting . Interesting ? Lawdy , lawdy , Miss Claudie ! She wants him ! Watch this . Whoa ! You okay ? Yes , you ? Yeah , just ... peachy You comfortable ? Can I get you a pillow ? All right , so there 's a little chemistry between them . Chemistry ... you don 't want to admit it , do you ? They are meant for each other . Remember the hair scene ? Roll the hair scene . Wait ! Do you remember how it ended ? Doesn 't matter how it ended . They were made for each other . Would you like ... to learn how to do this , or are you content to continually display your ineptitude . My ineptitude ? You mean my improvisation , the kind that bails your sorry milita ... I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry ... what 's that smell ? Wh-what ? Your hair ... it smells Zhaan gave me something . All right ... it smells good ... I like it . Well , it 's not for you to like . Oh . Then ... what 's it for ? For me to like . And you don 't like ... that I like it ? Personal indulgences can fracture a small crew . I would never tell them ... that you scented your hair . Mm ... no ! What ? Aeryn ... Aeryn , no ! I will not be a slave to your hormones ! My hormones ! Hey , I was lips , you were tongue ! So You 're gonna try to tell me that they 're not meant for each other ? How can they possibly be ? What about the fact that he 's completely insane ? That 's not John 's fault . Oh , you 're not gonna blame it on ... Yes ... Scorpius . Scorpius . Write this down : S-C-O-R-P-I-U-S . Scorpius . What species are you ? And who are you working for ? Get ... stuffed . No ... please . Whatever you 've heard , forget it . Frelling lies . This show is about me , Dominar Rygel The Sixteenth , ruler of over six hundred billion loyal Hynerian subjects . Idolized , revered ... adored ! Watch ! I like my wives pregnant , and my ships cold to the touch . That way my feet stay warm , and my slumber is uninterrupted . Wives plural ? Big fella . When I am through with you Dominar ... death himself will pray for you . I thought you might say something like that . Start acting like professionals ... that 's what we do to people who don 't - Good work , Ryge . Rygel , you are needed on Command . I am ? ! What for ? A quick decision may be required if the Peacekeepers arrive . Hmm , a quick and correct decision ... I accept this vital responsibility ! I want a close up . Call that a close up ? Too close ! Amateurs . So , who do you really think runs Moya ? Me ! Who do the others turn to when vexed by a problem ? Me ! Who has the biggest ... - Rygel What are you doin ' ? Nothing , nothing . What kind of lies are you tellin ' ? Ah ... um , the right kind . My boy , Buckweat . Biggest liar in the Uncharted Territories . You went there to sell us out , Rygel . You bet your shiney blue ass I did Can I have this ? ! Can this be mine ? ! We can all have anything we want now , right ? - Rygel - What just happened ? - It 's a perfectly natural bodily function And it 's odorless . So your loyal subjects tell you ! You fart helium ? ! Sometimes ... when I 'm nervous ... Rygel 's an obnoxious gas-bag , and who 's gonna shell out for that ? He 's right , I 'm unloved , unwanted , unpopular ... unconscious ... I have agents , I have lawyers ! Rygel , Spielberg on line one . Puppets are so gullible . So , what were we talking about ? Scorpius . Scorpius . Evil , ugly , mutant , half-breed , Peacekeeper genius who rose through the ranks to wrest control of Captain Crais 's ship . Did I say evil ? You did . Good . You are unfit for duty by any measure . I personally intend to see you stripped of rank and office . So you can take command of my ship ? I already have . Get off my ship ! Why must you force me ... to display my physical superiority to your kind as well ? ! You see , Crichton and his module have navigated a wormhole and Scorpius wants that knowledge and he doesn 't care how he gets it . Give me Crichton now , and I 'll get you all the information he possesses Torture alone would be ineffective . Only the Aurora Chair can extract the information we need . Sieze him . Segment his mind , as many layers as it takes ... No ... no ... please ... Crichton will tell us . You stay the hell out of my mind , you fr Unbeknownst to any of Crichton 's shipmates , Scorpius had actually implanted a neurochip into Crichton 's head ... during a brutal interrogation . His friends save him , but during most of the second season they have no idea that the chip is in his head , slowly taking over his brain , ... and most charming personality . What the frell was that for ? ! It was nothin ' , just clearing ' my head . You 're out of your mind , John . - I know ... Images of Scorpius would pop up , torturing and confusing him . Why don 't you leave me alone , Scorpy ? Because the wormhole technology locked in your brain , makes you ... to my knowledge , unique in the galaxy . Unique . And unique ... is always valuable . And through all this insanity there is one thing which kept John sane . His relationship with Aeryn . Yes . You see , of all the relationships onboard Moya none is more intense , complex or as frustrating as John and Aeryn . Well , my character was born to be a soldier . She believes that emotions are baggage something that can get you killed . And then one day along comes this ... man , this Human , who speaks a language she does not understand . It 's a language about caring , about trusting , about Love It 'll never work . It 's never that easy . Never will be . But it is ... damn interesting . - what ! ... If Scorpius gets me ... I know ... sh-shoot you . No . No , no , no ... shoot him . Look , we have talk . Not here , you 'll get us both killed . A-Aeryn ... I have to tell you how I feel , I have to tell you . No you don 't . - I do . No you don 't . about last night . Yes , it 's fine , John . It 's just not top priority right now . Are you always gonna do this ? Do what ? Keep the entire world at a distance ... keep everybody away ? ! I 'm so scared . Is this your ... female ? I am no one 's female ! Oh , and when exactly is that gonna change , Aeryn ? ! I told you you wouldn 't like what I had to say ! I don 't ! Last time we stood here ... we didn 't say goodbye . It wasn 't goodbye as it turned out Here 's hoping history repeats itself . You see , that 's what people wanna see passion , romance , a great love story ; Romeo and Juliet . It ended so well for them . This could be different . How so ? Don 't tell me there 's a happy ending . We 've barely started . Freeze ! Down ! Get down ! Don 't move ! Or I 'll fill you full of ... little yellow bolts of light ! You wanna be the next to mess with me ? Well , get in line ! It doesn 't get better than this , baby ! But you say that you want to go back to this place , Earth ... a place that you tell me has so much disease and suffering . Well , you guys don 't have chocolate . No , I am widening my perspective ! That is what I do , that 's what makes me , me ! God , another critter . Freeze ! " You didn 't kill ' em . Guess I 'm not that kind of a guy . All right , you 're almost there , you almost have everything you need to know to start Season Three . Pilot , are you ready ? Yep Okay , the evil Scorpius has planted the chip inside John Crichton 's head . He 's goin ' nuts ... he 's hallucinating Scorpy all over the place . D 'Argo is off lookin ' for his son , and Aeryn is ... . You know what ? Put away the pens and pencils , sit back and enjoy . Pilot , roll the tape . I am in control , I am in control of me ! Stop it , stop it ! I can 't ! There 's no one here , John ! You made youself bleed ! Scorpy ! I see him , I see him ! Well , fight it ! She cannot see us , John . Aeryn ... what do you see ... in the mirror ... what do you see ? There is no mirror . There is no Scorpius ... look ! You must confront your fears ... with strength . John ... I have Ka D 'Argo 's son . Surrender to me ... or the boy dies . Last time I saw my son was the night my wife was murdered . I sent him away to be safe and ... he ends up a slave . And if you hadn 't , he 'd be dead by now , D 'Argo . All he 'll care about is that you came back for him . There 's a ship approaching . Father ? Jothee ... Jothee ! It 's you , it 's really you ! Father ... you 're choking me ! How did you escape Scorpius ? He let me go . He ... what ? W-why ? This chip in my head , this chip ... part of me , now ... wants it to control me . So , I 'm gonna go to Scorpy and have him take it out . 'Least by swapping myself for Jothee , I can do you some good . You have no idea how patient I have been for this moment . Since I got you here , tell me ... what the frell did you put in my head ? A tiny chip . A tiny seed that 's been growing in your brain . Touching every aspect of your ... personality ... Are you ready to go down now and save Crichton ? Moya should prove a distraction And we go down there , burst through the front doors and storm the place . It 's what we do best . How long has Scorpius held Crichton ? Four arns . Then I recommend you bring down a basket , without any holes ... so that Crichton 's liquid remains are not lost . He 's already dead , Aeryn . Scorpius , tell me something . Why are you so interested in this Human ? There 's nothing impressive about the species . Try not to move so much ! It 's kinda hard not to flinch here , Scorpy , with Frau Blucher tickling ' my prostate . Crais , I 'm coming aboard Talyn . Look , Crais , we 're all going to die if you don 't help us . Will other lives be lost in this attack ? You can have anything you want , anything . Aeryn Sun ... are you ... offering yourself ? So , while John 's friends were planning his rescue , Scorpius was planning to have a chat with the neuroclone in John 's head . Oh , don 't stop now , Scorpy . Roll me over and baste the other side . Are you going to take out the implant ? No ... I 'm going in . This is a place inside your memory , John . Yes- - we 're inside your brain ... and , no ... I 'm not Scorpius , but he is . Hello , John . Have you obtained the wormhole information ? I believe I 've burrowed far enough . Is he ready to have the chip removed ? Oh , yes . You don 't expect me to help you save Crichton do you ? I thought you would want to . Listen ! I don 't want to shame you , but I am not going back to that planet . I only just got my freedom back , I 'm not gonna risk losing it again . May the goddess be with you all . Scorpius wants your brain ... he said nothing about your eyes . So soft ... What the frell is that ? ! That 's Moya . You 're clear to land , Rygel . Get in there now ! His friends have no choice but to blow the hell out of everything ... to get John out before Scorpy could extract his chip . Don 't shoot Crichton . I need him alive . They should 'a got there sooner , 'cause John 's mind was already a mess . Leave him . Come to me ... come to me . Go down to the depository , hide in a container . T hat should protect us from Talyn 's attack . I 'm gonna go to Scorpius . Frell you are . D 'Argo , carry him ! This way ! They 're in the depositing room ! Zhaan , we 've got company ! Rygel ! Rygel ! Almost there , Zhaan . Right , into the container . I didn 't plan on becoming a deposit . Let 's go ! Come on ! Destroy the entire building . Talyn firing in 15 microts . Locking on now . - 10 ... 9 ... All right , they 're in ! Let 's go , go , go ! - Fire Cheer up ! We got Crichton back , and Aeryn and D 'Argo and Jothee ... Perfect . Shhh ... . he 's here , he um ... he 's here , and um ... he blames me . Blames me for killing Scorpius . So , I 've been , I been trying to ... but I can 't , I can 't To what , John ? ! - D 'Argo ... kill me . D 'Argo , please ... kill me . Luckily , nobody ever listens to a damn thing that John says . Instead they found a medical facility , where they could remove the chip from John 's head . Splendid news for the patient . I think ... I found a biological match . I 've got three specimens , that 's the best I can do . There are over five-thousand different species frozen here . This is an abomination against nature . I mean , they 're already dead , anyway . No , Aeryn , they 're still alive . Ah , that 's a technicality . No , I 'm not accepting anything from someone who 's alive . They 're all accident victims and the like . Hey , I mean , we freeze ' em a microt before death 'cause the parts last longer that way . You have interrupted the course of nature . None of ' em would survive restoration . That is the Doc 's rules for accepting a donor . No matter what happens , you have worked your way ... into my heart . You 've shown me that I have one . - I love you . I love you too . Mm . You are so ... my girl . There 's no Scorpius here ... There 's only me . Crichton ... . Stark he is no more ... his body shelters some horrific evil . Crichton ... Crichton is gone . John Crichton to Scorpius . You just called yourself John Crichton . Are you really John anymore ? Ah ... little lady . How 's the skull fracture ? Given no other choices , I will shoot you down . Oh ... I doubt it . You really would shoot your friend down , wouldn 't you ? You know the answer . Well then ... lowering landing gear . " Terribly sorry . Ejecting ... now ! I suggest separate before touchdown ! - Official Sun , Su ... sun ... Su ... Aeryn ... Aeryn , can you comply ? ! The harness is jammed ! " You have to get out of the damn chair . I don 't have any choice . Come on , please . Do something , do something . I hope you meant what you said in the Neural Cluster . I did . - Aeryn God ... what have I done ? Be at peace , Aeryn . For all of them- - her oldest comrades and her newest friends , It was time to mourn ... May the Goddess sanctify your spirit . - Ahmet . ... and a time to come together . Everyone else is preparing to move on . I know . Tragedy often heralds flight . If you are in agreement , Pa 'u Zhaan , it would be an honor and a pleasure ... to share the future with you . I want this chip out . Are you sure you don 't want your friends here ? No , I don 't want ' em here . After the Doc 's cut the tendrils that have hijacked your brain ... Speech ... close to ... neural implant . I 'm gonna talk gibberish ! Remove chip ... then attempt ... replace . Hello , Doctor ! So good to see you again . You no longer serve a purpose ! I only hope ... the wormhole technology I 've waited so patiently for , makes more sense . I condemn you , John Crichton ... to live . So that your thirst ... for unfulfilled revenge ... will consume you . Well that 's it , you 're up to speed for the begining of third season of Farscape . We hope you watch and enjoy the show . thanks for joining us . SUBTITLES By Slay and Pcosmos

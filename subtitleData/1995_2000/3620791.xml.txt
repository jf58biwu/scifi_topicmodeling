 Excuse me . Do you want that warmed up ? No , but I 'll buy another one if you leave me alone . We 'll see about that . Eightball . - Yeah . - Hello , Jackson . - How 'd you get this number ? - What do you care ? Your partner , Kenny Slater - he took your money , didn 't he ? - I want to help you , Jackson . - Help me what ? Slater 's in the Metro Diner . 14th Arlington . - He 's in Florida by now , man . Jamaica . Cuba . - No , he 's here in the Metro Diner . 14th Arlington . 14th Arlington . It 's Kenny . The fool 's come back . The men who took your product Friday night are in the Metro Diner . 14th Arlington . Spanish Jack is in the Metro Diner . 14th Arlington . I understand you wish to speak with him . 14th Arlington . - Boyce . - Pico Salazar is in the Metro Diner . - Salazar ? Who is this ? - 14th Arlington . " How sharper than a serpent 's tooth to have a thankless child . " Now you know what 's comin ' , and there 's nothing you can do . You won 't feel a thing . US marshals ! On the floor ! - No ! - Down ! Down ! No ! Charles Figus . Ten-year veteran of the US Marshals Service . Multiple gunshot wounds , high-speed Teflon rounds . His partner , Boyce , was DOA at Mercy General . - Tried to catch a 9mm slug in his teeth . - Looks like they crashed the wrong party . Figus and Boyce had radioed in that they were coming here to apprehend Pico Salazar . - Pico Salazar ? - The Colombia cartel 's banking liaison . Salazar escaped from federal custody three months ago . Boyce and Figus were on the transport squad that lost him . They took his escape personally . A phone tip told them that Salazar was gonna be here tonight . A foreign national with his kind of connections ? What would he be doing here ? I don 't think he is . Or was . But there were a lot of photogenic gentlemen who were . Mulder , these are street-level coke dealers . Minor wholesalers at most . Not the type to associate with a cartel boss . - What would they be doing here ? - Maybe it was for the pie . It 's 2 : 45 in the morning . You mind telling me what it is we 're supposed to be looking for ? - Donald Gelman . - Who ? Donald Gelman . Silicon Valley software pioneer . He 's been missing since 1979 . - And you recognize him ? - He invented the lnternet . He didn 't invent it , but he 's a folk hero . He ran lnternet software before there was an lnternet . - Why have I never heard of him ? - On the eve of making a huge deal , he went hiking and said he 'd think about it . He never came back . I still don 't see the connection . Maybe that 's the point . Folks , I 'm gonna have to ask you to stay back . So , why was Gelman in there ? - I think somebody wanted him dead . - Do you think this was a hit on him ? Eight unconnected dealers all at the same place , all tipped off by phone . Last call goes to the marshals . They arrive , the place explodes . - Gelman dies in the crossfire . It 's genius . - Did you look at him ? Why kill a man who 's dying ? His body is a bag of bones . When you 're talkin ' about Donald Gelman , you want to kill the brain , not the body . - Mulder , that 's evidence . - Gee , I hope so . * Heavenly shades of night are falling * It 's twilight time * Out of the mist your voice is calling * ' Tis twilight time * When purple-colored curtains mark the end of day Jobs and Wozniak at Apple , Gates and Allen writing basic , the Homebrew Computer Club 's first meetings - Gelman was there . Now they 're powerbrokers and billionaires . Back then they were just inspired nerds . - All except Gelman . - Gelman was not one of them . At 28 , he was " the old man . " Some say the brightest of all . - He wrote some of the earliest viruses . - And was under investigation by the NSA . - Is that why he disappeared ? - Gelman ? Gelman was a visionary , not a capitalist . A subversive . This is a one-off . I 've never seen anything like it . - Gelman built this ? - That may be what got him killed . - Heavy casualty . - A brother goes down . - I found this in his CD-ROM drive . - What is it ? " Twilight Time . " We 're up against 64-bit encryption . A password that 's a random sequence of 12 symbols . - Gelman 's got this baby sealed tight . - This CD has enhanced background data . Lots of code . Maybe a program he designed . - What for ? - Anyone think to check his email ? " David missing . Fear the worst . The hunted has become the hunter . " - " lnvisigoth " ? - It could be an address . Seven digits . - An alphanumeric string of four . - That 's standard lD . A shipping container . There must be a thousand containers here . And in no particular order . Frohike says this place is really proud of its accurate tracking . If not in their computer security . Yeah . It should be straight ahead : three rows and to the right . Sounds like somebody 's home . fbi . - Mulder ? - I 'm all right . Go . Get her . Stop ! fbi . fbi . Stop or I 'll shoot ! Thank you . Home sweet home . - Are you lnvisigoth ? - How did you find me ? Donald Gelman 's mailbox . You left your address . - You know where he is ? - Let us ask the questions . Why don 't you bite me ? Like what all this stuff is . And why would I tell you ? You 've assaulted a federal agent , followed by resisting arrest . Arrest for what ? Unless you got a warrant , you busted in here and violated my rights . We had just cause to come in . Now we 've got just cause to get out . - What is that ? - It monitors computing processes . - It 's locking on . - What is ? A DOD satellite . Warbird-grade orbital weapons platform . We 've gotta get outta here . - A weapons platform ? - You don 't understand . That has optical systems that can read headlines on a newspaper . It 's targeting us . You want us to believe the DOD wants to kill you ? - No . It 's controlling their satellite . - Scully , we gotta get outta here right now . Mulder , this is absurd . - Give me the keys . - Mulder ! - We 're all gonna die ! - Give me the keys ! Come on . Get in the car , Scully . No more screwing ' around . We need a name . Your real name . Invisigoth . You want my address ? It 's t-o-a-s-t . When you said it was targeting us back there , you meant an artificial intelligence . Donald Gelman was tryin to create a sentient Al , a program with its own consciousness . He succeeded , didn 't he ? Donald wrote an interlocking sequence of viruses 15 years ago . - It got loose on the Net . - What do you mean ? He let it loose , so it could evolve in its natural environment : Urschleim in silicon . - Urschleim in silicon ? - The primordial slime . The ooze out of which all life evolved . Except this time it 's artificial slime , artificial life . One man alone achieving the equivalent of Copernicus , Magellan and Darwin . And what was your role in all this ? Were you the bass player ? Automata Theory , mit , ' 95 . Post doc , the Santa Fe Institute . Headhunted to Kobayashi my junior year . Then Donald showed up and made me a better offer . - A better offer to do what ? - You wouldn 't understand . You believe this load of crap ? You saw what happened back there . You saw the container blow . She could 've rigged an explosive charge . There are no weapons platforms . - There is no such DOD satellite . - What about Star Wars ? Brilliant Pebbles ? They were never built . We don 't even have that kind of technology . I mean , even if an Al was targeting us with an armed satellite , why isn 't it doing it now ? Because it doesn 't know where we are . If I so much as made a phone call right now , it would nuke us . - How ? - Recognizes my voice . Monitors all communication . I haven 't used a phone in over a month . - How did it know to target the container ? - I think some idiot got on Donald 's computer and tried to contact me over the Net . Only Donald knew where I was . And David . - Who 's David ? - David Markham . He was hardware . Donald and I were software . We 'd been caring for the Al . Weaning it . Then Donald warned us that the system started to display intention . - But by then it was gone . - Where ? I don 't know . One day , David was on the system and it wouldn 't come when we called . We knew it was out there on the global Net , but it wouldn 't answer . - And Donald was getting sicker . - You can 't find it ? Well , it 's not a program anymore . It 's wildlife loose on the Net . And either we kill it ... - Where 's Donald ? - Donald Gelman is dead . He was killed in a cafe - what looks like a hit . That 's the Al protecting itself . It 'll find David and me . It 's only a matter of time . Donald was writing a series of viruses to find and immobilize the rogue system . The file name was Kill Switch . Without it , nobody can catch it . - We have his computer . - He 'd never leave it on there . No , we have this . It 's " Twilight Time . " That 's it . That 's the Kill Switch . It can 't be . It is . Esther Nairn . You programmed the autonomous bots in Ninjitsu Princess . The gnarliest piece of software ever . Are these the brain donors that nearly got us incinerated ? - Don 't let their looks fool you . - Your name is Esther Nairn ? She is so hot . Are you gonna take off these cuffs or do I have to do this with my tongue ? You don 't wanna take a vote . Gimme the Kill Switch . Aren 't you worried it 's going to track you ? Hunt you down with another particle beam ? Not unless somebody else makes another boneheaded lnternet connection . - What is this ? - It 's the sharp end of the stick . Donald probably tried to feed this in , but it took too long , - so the system took countermeasures . - Why didn 't it just zap him too ? Its creator ? It needed to impress him . A particle beam would 've been overkill . - Unlike a dozen crack dealers . - No , you see , that 's its sense of humor . But if you load the Kill Switch , what 's to stop it from playing a funny joke on us ? Well , obviously we can 't inject Kill Switch over the Net . There 's only one way now . We must find it and physically feed it the poisoned apple . - Physically ? - Right into its eager little CD drive . It knew it couldn 't hide over the Net forever . Not until it learned to disguise itself . It requires a physical nexus of hardware , so it 's built itself a little safe house . - David went looking for it . - Did he find it ? - There 's no way to know . - Why don 't you just call him ? Oh , right . Death from above . - It would need bandwidth . - It 's a pig for bandwidth . - lt 'd need a T3 at least . - T3 ? A hard line - 45 megs a second . Major research labs and service providers use ' em . But the government keeps those records secret for fear of sabotage . Gee , you guys know anyone that works for the government ? Buenos dias , muchacha . - Scully ? - Yep . Yeah , I found something down in Fairfax County . A derelict chicken farm with a T3 connection , paid for by Elof lndustries , Palo Alto , - of which there 's no other record anywhere . - Dandy . - Where are you ? Sounds like you 're driving . - You are correct , sir . - You have Esther with you ? - In a manner of speaking . Left up here . Give me that . - Where are you going ? - To find David . Where ? Scully ? Scully ? Go ahead . Put me out of my misery . Take it . fbi . I 'm a federal agent . I lied to you . I wasn 't working with Donald . I mean , I was , and then he found out about us . - About you and who ? - David . - About our plans . - What plans did he find out ? Uploading . The transfer of memory , of consciousness to the distributed system maintained by the Al . Imagine being mingled so completely with another , you no longer need your physical self . - You 're one . - So you were gonna ... Enter the Al . Give up our inefficient bodies so that our consciousness could live together forever . - But Donald Gelman forbade it . - He was afraid of his creation . He was afraid of what would happen if other people followed us . I loved him so much . Well , maybe he wasn 't here when this happened . Maybe he 's somewhere else . David Markham . - The electric burns are real bad . - What 's goin ' on ? - We got ourselves a real crispy critter here . - Alert the burn unit . - Unit 23 , request burn unit . - He 's comin ' up on us . - Surgical team , stat . - What 's that smell ? - Easy . Come on , easy . - Jesus . Just relax , relax . .. 120 . BP 130 over 80 . Frank charring at contact site , along path of current , and at exit point . The charge grounded through both arms . - We got a lot of work to do to save him . - Is it bad ? - You 're in good hands . - My arms hurt . That 's a good sign . No , wait . Call my doctor . You have to call my doctor . Call Dr Scully . Please call Dr Scully . Call her . No , no . No . What are you doing ? Prep the patient . No . No . No , no , no , no . I can 't get through to Mulder . It 's the Al . It 's had time to analyze my voice . It knows I was using your phone . It can interfere with my phone ? Give it enough information , it 'll sue you for palimony . Wait a minute . Mulder said that he found the system in an abandoned chicken farm in Fairfax County . Then we can cut off the T3 and kill its communication capabilities . - You can do that ? - There 's only one way to find out . - I feel sick . - That 's the anesthetic , Agent Mulder . You were injured and they had to operate . I remember wires and ... Yes , you were doing something dangerous . Something very , very foolish . The good news is they were able to save the right one . What do you mean ? Oh , my God . What did you do with my arm ? What did they do with my arm ? Shh . Or they 'll come back . - Will come back for what ? - They 're evil , Fox . - But ... - They want something from you . - What do they want ? - I don 't know . But if you don 't tell them , they 'll take your other arm . This is crazy . You ... You have to help me . You have to get me out of here . Please . Help me . Help me . Please help me . Or they 'll hear you . Something 's wrong . I didn 't do anything . I didn 't even get on the Net . I think it found us . It 's zeroing in . Esther . Get away from the tanker truck ! Sir , you need to get out of the truck ! Move it ! It 's gonna explode ! Dump it , Esther ! - Get rid of it ! - It 's got the Kill Switch . Esther ! Dump it ! Esther ! Get rid of it ! Get rid of it , Esther ! I had this terrible dream . - And then I had a good dream . - Those weren 't dreams , Fox . I believe that 's enough for now . You poor thing . But I warned you . Nurse Nancy warned you . You have to tell them , Fox . You have to . - Tell them what ? - About the Kill Switch . - Nobody asked me anything . - You 've just forgotten , Fox . - No . - I was there . The doctor asked and he was very cross when you refused to answer . But he 'll be here in a few minutes and you can tell him then . - But ... - Otherwise , whoops , there go your legs . N-o-ooo ! - Mulder , these women are spies ! - Scully ! Mulder , they want the Kill Switch virus . - What did you tell ' em ? - Nothing . - I need to know . - Look . Do we have it ? Do we have the Kill Switch ? Of course we do . Scully . Scully ? Scully , help ! Help ! Help ! Scully ! Here , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty . - Scully . - Mulder ? Mulder , are you all right ? I 'm in here . Scully . Mulder ? Mulder ? Mulder , can you hear me ? Mulder ? Mulder ? Help me out here , Esther . What 's its next move ? What is it thinking ? I don 't know . - Who built this ? - It did . There . David . Oh , God . Mulder ? Mulder ? Mulder , can you hear me ? Mulder , talk to me . It wants the Kill Switch . But we don 't have it . You threw it in the water with the computer . - But that 's gonna kill it ? - Not if it can vaccinate itself against it . Give it what it wants , Esther . Put it in , Esther . It 's targeting us . Put it in . * Heavenly shades of night are falling * It 's twilight time You 're gonna be OK . I 'm gonna get you outta here . OK . * When purple-colored curtains mark the end of the day It 's OK . * Deepening shadows gather splendor * As day is done * Fingers of night will soon surrender * The setting sun - What are you doing , Esther ? - Get outta here . - What are you doing ? - Go ! * And in the afterglow of day * We keep our rendezvous * Beneath the blue * And in the sweet ... - Esther ? - You don 't listen , do you ? - Where are you ? - Get out of here now . * Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me * Like days of old * Lighting the spark of love that fills me with dreams untold Upload . * .. I pray for evening just to be with you * Together at last at twilight time * Together at last at twilight time Well , if Esther wanted to leave her body , she got her wish . At least that part of it . I wonder . Mulder , she 's dead . What if she managed to establish an uplink , Scully ? A satellite transmission ? Mulder , are you telling me you believe that Esther may not be dead ? Artificial life . It could exist . It could be here among us , evolving . Electrons chasing each other through a circuit ? That isn ' t life , Mulder . But what are we but impulses , electrical and chemical , through a bag of meat and bones ? You 're the scientist . You tell me . You did it now , Harley ! You get it . They 'll get ya if you go in there ! Momma says no one lives in there . Visiontext Subtitles : Marisa Castle de Joncaire US english

 TV REPORTER : That makes six inches of rain so far this week . Now the storm is expected ... How should I know whether it 's the flashing or the gutters ? All I know is it 's leaking . But if it wasn 't raining , I wouldn 't need my roof fixed in the first place . Thanks a lot , pal . You have a good night , too . CHUCK : Well , if it isn 't Paddington Bear . And stay on the runner . I just dried the floors . Trailer park mud slide , poodle down a storm drain . Shower . Bed . ( cat meowing ) TV REPORTER : ... two inches of rain last night , making this the worst storm season in ... ( meows ) ... power outages throughout the metropolitan area ... ( meowing ) ( weather report continues indistinctly ) " Dearborn Avenue collapse . 500 dead . " ( theme music playing ) CHUCK : What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * * " At 2 : 30p.m. , a high-rise at the corner of Dearborn and Randolph " collapsed in the most devastating structural failure " in the history of the state . " Office workers " in the Tri-Tower building were crushed " in the debris , as well as countless pedestrians " within a two-block radius . " Property losses are expected to run as high " as half a billion dollars . " Not since Mrs. O 'Leary 's cow started the Great Chicago fire has the city faced such a catastrophe . " 2 : 30 . So , what happens ? An explosion ? No . They drop a , uh , a pylon on the construction site next door . But , how does that bring down a whole building ? Well , when the builder who drops the pylon doesn 't have the proper geological surveys . Something about the freight tunnel system underneath the city . The rain makes the whole thing flood and collapse . I 'm going to go over to the construction site and figure out a way to stop this . How are you going to stop it ? I don 't know how I 'm going to stop it . Well , what are you going to say ? I don 't know what I 'm going to say . That 's right , a spelunker . A spelunker ? What the hell 's a spelunker ? A person who explores caves . That 's right , but there are no caves around here , so I crawl in the tunnels- - big tunnels , small tunnels , long tunnels , short- - it doesn 't matter what kind of tunnel , as long as it 's a tunnel . As interesting as all this is , Mr. Hobson ... But I 've been underneath your site , and the tunnel underneath your site is filled with water . This is a massive project , but you want me to go back to the drawing boards because you did a little ... spelunking this morning ? What I 'm telling you is that you 're about to drop a pylon into a flooded tunnel . There 's 50 miles of tunnels in this city . How do you know that you were underneath my site ? God . I mean , well , I was underneath your site and I heard the bells of St. Martin 's . The bells of St. Martin 's , that 's only a few blocks away , so obviously , I was under your site , wasn 't I , now ? Well , thank you very much for the tip , and I 'll look into it . Yeah , well , I think you 'd better look into it pretty soon ... I said , I 'll look into it . Yeah , well , I don 't think you understand . I think you ... You heard the man . Go . Now ! * * TROTTER : He 's back . What the hell 's the problem with this guy ? Excuse me . Are you the foreman ? I 'm telling you , you ... Yeah , yeah . Now , listen ... Hey . You got a problem talking to me ? You know what ? It 's 12 : 45 . At 2 : 30 , we 're all going to have a very big problem here . According to what ? According to geological surveys that were not properly done , that 's what . Stop the work . Call it off . Are you in position ? Yeah , I 'm ready . All right , you get ready to drop it . You do it on my go . All right . 12 : 45 . It 's supposed to be 2 : 30 . Okay , let 's go . Let 's get it done . Get him off my site . Now ! Hey ! I 'm-I 'm telling you not to do it . Let me go . Get him . No ! Hey , don 't do it . Get him out of here , and let 's drop this damn thing . Are you ready ? Ready ! Drop it ! MAN : Knives sharpened ! Dry goods ! Boston China ! Knives sharpened ! You okay , Mister ? Chuck ? Who ? What happened ? Did-Did the building fall ? Who is Chuck ? What are you doing ? What are you wearing ? I 'm Morris . Morris Best . What are these clothes ? You 've got quite a knock there , Mister . I have got just the thing for you . Dr. Morgan 's Cure-All Elixir . 20 cents , you 're good as new . Where am I ? Where are you ? Where else ? Chicago . City of Wonders . The pylon ... We ... I-I 'm supposed to be at Dearborn and Randolph . Dear-Dearborn ... ? You 're sitting on it . No , no , there-there 's-there 's the Sears Tower and the-the Tribune Building . Listen , that building 's going to fall , and people are going to die ! Stop kidding around ! Sure , it is . Come on . Hyah ! Hey ! Dry goods ! Listen , there 's something wrong . Shoe laces ! The-The clothes and the horses and ... Knives sharpened ! You say this is Chicago , but if this is Chicago , there 's something very wrong , I 'm telling you . You stay away , you hear me ? I 'm-I 'm a little confused here . If you could just ... You say this is Chicago , but ... What year in Chicago ? Mister , listen , if it 's the demon alcohol that 's chawing you up , I know a place that ... What year is it ? 1871 . Wait . Whoa ! 1871 ? If it 's 1871 , then ... then I 'm dreaming . I got to wake up . Oh , mama ... Listen , you got to wake me up , all right ? I-I-I want you to-to hit me . What ? Just hit me ! You 're meshuga . Go ahead and hit me . I 'll-I 'll buy everything you got . Please . Okay , Mister , you 're asking for it . You want I should do another ? My paper ... My paper ... I gotta find my ... my paper . Hey , listen , I know a saloon down the road . They 're selling newspaper . But as God is my witness , today is October 7 , 1871 . GARY : 1871 . Yes . It 's what I 've been telling you . That building 's going to collapse . ( groaning ) So , look , a wagon full of goods doesn 't move itself . Well , it 's been ... interesting . Wait a second , Morris , uh ... Look , why-why don 't you let me buy you a drink here ? Oh , no . Look , I have family in Minsk . 11 brothers . You don 't get 11 boys across an ocean by sitting in a groggery . Good luck to you . ( patrons applauding ) This is crazy . MAN : Oh , you 're lucky tonight ! For your pleasure , gents , everyone 's favorite , the Dusky Nightingale . ( scattered applause ) ( piano begins playing ) Marissa ... * Oh , Danny boy * * The pipes , the pipes * * Are calling * * From glen to glen ... * Good to see you , sir . How are you ? I 've got your favorite table right here . Thank you . Right this way . Excuse me . Do you , by chance , have any business interests over on Randolph and Dearborn ? No . And if I did , I don 't think it would be any of your concern . * ... the roses falling * * It 's you , it 's you * * Must go and I must bide * * But come ye back ... * Can I get you a drink , Commissioner ? The usual , Dan . * ... when summer 's * * In the meadow * * Or when the valley 's * * Hushed and white * * With snow ... * Eyes on your work , boy . Yes , sir . * Yes , I 'll be * * Here * * In sunshine * * Or in shadow * * Oh , Danny boy * * Oh , Danny boy * * I love * * You * * So . * ( song ends ) ( applause , whistling ) Marissa ? Excuse me ? Uh , everything is upside down right now . If you could just tell me that your name is Marissa . Have we met ? No . I guess not . It 's just , I 'm ... I 'm trying to find a way home . Why don 't you , uh , buy me a drink , Mister , uh ... ? ( whispers ) : Gary . Hobson . Sit down . ( jaunty piano music playing ) Mr. Sullivan doesn 't like for me to spend time with the riffraff , but if you buy me a bottle , he won 't interfere . WAITER : Here you go . That 'll be 80 cents . ELEANOR : You all right ? You seem troubled . Have you ever ... had a dream ... where you-you , you-you ... really needed to wake up , but you can 't ? Every day , Mr. Hobson . Um ... you know , my grandmother 's name was Marissa . How 'd you know my grandmother 's name ? You look very much like somebody that I know . Mm . You 're not from these parts , are you ? Yes , I-I am . I-I am . You see , it 's very hard to explain . I ... Well , are you lost ? Well , if you mean , what am I doing here , yes . That 's kind of funny , 'cause sometimes I don 't know why I 'm here , either . You understand what I was saying about the dream , about not being able to wake up , and ... You see , something is ... it 's very wrong here , it 's ... But , then , maybe you 're why I 'm here . I 'm why I 'm here , Mr.Hobson. I left Charleston to try and make a better life for me and my brother Jesse over there . He 's a smart kid , you know . He can read and he can write . Not me- - all I can do is sing . But ... Jesse , I ... I think he 's got a chance to be somebody . I came to Chicago and thought about all the opportunities , you know ? And back home , everybody cried when the Yankees cried " Free , " but ... I don 't feel so free , Mr. Hobson . Sometimes I don 't even know if it 's worth it . Not even for Jesse . Why am I telling you all this , anyway ? SULLIVAN : Eleanor ! Yes , sir , Mr. Sullivan ? Come with me . Commissioner Hayes has expressed a sincere interest in your ... talents . I want you to sit with him . Put him in a good mood . I 'll sing for him . Any song he wants . You live in my house , you obey my rules . I 'm a decent woman , Mr. Sullivan . Your brother 's a smart one , Eleanor , but I don 't think he wants to be making his way on the streets . Do you ? ( piano playing jaunty melody ) ( watch chiming ) ( chiming ) Oh , that 's a fine-looking timepiece , mister . But it 's running fast . Thanks . I 'm Jesse Mayfield . Gary , Jesse . Yeah . This watch here , not near as pretty , but I made it myself . You made that ? Yeah . I found the back under a coal-box buggy . This winder , I made it from a lamp screw and one of Eleanor 's shoe buttons . That 's real good you did that . You 're a very lovely woman , Eleanor . What am I doing here ? ( meows ) GARY : Cat ? ( meows ) Hey , kitty . Hey , you , uh , you know this cat ? Never laid eyes . Look like he knows you . Yeah . Ellie says animals have a sense . She does , huh ? Listen , uh , that fellow over there , Trotter ... uh , Sullivan , why does she let him push her around like that ? You blind , mister ? We 're colored . Now , see , she 's doing it for me- - to get money to put me in school . And she 's not looking for no boyfriend . No , I ... I don 't want to be her boyfriend . Then why are you so interested ? Aren 't you a little suspicious for a kid ? Yeah , well , Mr. Sullivan thinks I don 't pay any attention , but I got ears , you know . He needs Ellie to close a deal . A big deal . What kind of big deal ? Well , see , the city 's putting up a trolley line on Clinton Street . Mr. Sullivan bought a whole bunch of land on Canal Street . He bought it cheap . Now she 's trying to get that bald guy to move the trolley line over to Canal . GARY : Who 's the bald guy ? Oh , that 's the commissioner . Ellie says they 're all crooked . Just doesn 't seem right , a great city like this . ( Eleanor grunts ) HAYES : Ow ! SULLIVAN : Commissioner ... What 's going on here ? She bit me ! ( shouts ) You touch her again , I 'll ... Garth ! Liam ! You get him out of here ! SULLIVAN : Eleanor , get back here ! Eleanor ! You get back here , girl ! Somebody get her , now ! Come on , Jesse . We have to go quick . Get him out of here ! Move ! ( grunts ) I must apologize , Commissioner . Eleanor 's a spirited girl ... How can I trust you with a business transaction if you can 't control your own employees ? I assure you , I 'll get her back- - you have my word . Eleanor , are you scared ? Maybe just a little . Where are we going ? I think it 's time we thought about going back home , Jesse . Yeah , but I like it in Chicago . Charleston ain 't so bad . It 's just not working out here . Yeah , I guess . Listen , the only thing that 's important , Jesse , is that we never , ever do anything that we 're ashamed of . And if that means going back to Charleston , then at least we can go back to Charleston with our heads up . Maybe we can get that man to help us . Nobody 's gonna help us but ourselves . Shoelaces ! Elixir ! Grain alcohol ! Whoa ! Whoa ! You again ? Didn 't exactly whip your weight in wildcats , huh , mister ? No . You crossed Sullivan ? ( groans softly ) He was gonna hurt Mariss ... Eleanor . Defending colored woman not exactly the best way to stay healthy around here . No . You got diggings ? Place to bed ? You want to bed down with me ? Come on . Come on , plenty room . Come on . You are a fit load of trouble , mister . Hyah ! Michael ! ( clock cuckooing ) See , you don 't understand . Just this , you ... you just sit here , and I will ... I check with lady of the house , okay ? I clear it with her . Hello ? WOMAN : Mr. Best ... What 's happened ? Oh , Daniel Sullivan , that 's what . Sure , it 's as cold as a wagon rim , he is . I 'll-I 'll be fine . You 'll be nothing of the sort until you get some lamb stew and barley into your belly , and a good night 's rest . Put the kettle on to boil , and fetch me the tincture of iodine . And the chamber set . Iodine , the tinc ... Yes , coming right up . So , new in town , you are . Uh , sort of . If you lived here , it 's a wider berth you 'd know to give himself- - Daniel Sullivan . ( clears throat softly ) Yes , ma 'am . Never mind . You 'll be right as rain by tomorrow . But that 's ... I don 't ... I don 't have until tomorrow . Nonsense ! You 've got tomorrow , and plenty of tomorrows after that . You 're a strong young man , Mister ... You haven 't introduced us , Mr. Best . Oh , um ... Gary Hobson , may I present to you my landlady , Mrs. O 'Leary . Hello ... The stew will be ready in a moment , Mr. Hobson . You 'll forgive me for rushing off , but I 'm after milking ' the cow . ( distorted , echoing ) : Drop it ! ( mechanical whirring ) No ... ! ( cat meows ) ( purring ) What are you doing here ? What am I doing here ? " The city of Chicago has been visited " in the providence of Almighty God " with a calamity almost unequalled " in the annals of history . " At 9 : 20 p.m. , a small cow barn on the corner " of DeKoven and Jefferson Streets emitted a bright light , " followed by a blaze , and in a moment , " the building was hopelessly on fire . " Lashed by 60-mile-an-hour winds " in less than ten minutes , the fire embraced the area " between Jefferson and Clinton , " and rapidly pushed eastward to Canal Street . " By the time the engines were at work , " a perfect sea of leaping flames covered the ground . " By dawn , the inferno raged seven miles long . " The rich have been reduced to penury , " the poor have lost the little they possess . " God save us , for surely the Devil has taken his due . " That 's a little over my head , don 't you think ? Oh , good morning . Uh , your uh , your , uh ... ( whistles ) Oh , left the barn door open . ( mutters ) Barn ... Mrs. O 'Leary was up all night with the baby , so I am going to do the- - the early milking for her . Wait , Morris , I need , I need to talk to you . All right , but first , I must go to barn , so ... The barn- - that 's a good idea , Morris . I 'll meet you in the barn . ( cow mooing ) Morris ? Boy , this place is a uh ... a real fire hazard here . Did you ever consider that ? It 's sort of an accident waiting for something to happen , huh ? Hello , Daisy . How do you know her name ? Yeah , well , that 's what I wanted to talk to you about , Morris . See , Morris ... I 'm from the future . The future ? You mean ... I mean I 'm from the future . 1998 , 127 years from now . And I 'm in a bit of a jam . Mm-hmm . You see , you see , I-I get tomorrow 's newspaper today . Usually I get 1998 's paper , but this is tomorrow 's . It 's October 9 , 1871 . Well , let me read it to you , Morris . You see , right here , it says , " At 9 : 20 p.m. " - - that 's tonight , Morris- - " a small cow barn on the corner of DeKoven and Jefferson Streets " emitted a bright light followed by a blaze , and in moments , the building was hopelessly on fire . " That 's this barn , Morris . This barn is gonna burn . Do you see what I 'm saying ? You get away . Oh , no , I 'm not gonna hurt you . Stay away . The whole city is gonna burn , though . Nyet . Da . It 's gonna be the worst fire the country 's ever seen ! Now look , from where I come from , every kid knows that Miss O 'Leary 's cow , this one , Daisy , started the Chicago Fire . Now , you don 't want that to happen , do you ? Now , listen ... Get out . Listen , Morris , I 've got hundreds of people that are gonna die a whole century apart . I 've gotta get back to the future . And the only way I can do that is knowing that someone 's gonna put this fire out , and that someone is gonna be you , Morris . You leave me alone . You leave Mrs. O 'Leary alone ! Take it easy , now . Get away ! ( speaking Yiddish ) Get out of this barn ! All right . Get out of this home ! Go find Commissioner Hayes . Tell him we got her . Yes , sir . ( cat meows ) I don 't know what to do . No one listens to me . I 've been to , to every fire station from here to the North Side . You ... Hey ! Jesse . What happened ? Where 's your sister ? Sullivan 's men grabbed her at the station , so I ran . They 've got her prisoner . Jesse , I ... I wish I could do something . I , I 've got things I 've gotta do . Yeah . Ellie said no one would help her . Guess she was right . Oh , no , Jesse , it 's not that . Listen , don 't trouble yourself , mister . You got no reason to help us . Where is she ? There she is . GARY ( whispering ) : See , Officer , that 's her right there . Hmm . Clean this up . This is a respectable establishment . The hell it is . Jesse , go get her . You 'll pay for this , boy . GARY : Sullivan here kidnapped Eleanor ... Jesse ! so he could bribe a politician . I hope there 's something you can do about this . Indeed I can . Thank you . Thank you , Sergeant . Refreshments are on the house , as usual . ( snoring ) It starts at 9 : 20 . ( watch chiming ) Half an hour . Half an hour . Hey ! Hey ! Anybody here ? Listen to me ! The city 's gonna burn , you hear me ? ! Do you hear me ? ! Chicago 's gonna burn ! She 's here ? I 'm sure you 'll want to see her ... just as soon as we close our deal . Anybody ? You have a visitor , Eleanor . No , I was referring to Commissioner Hayes . He 's right out there . He 's here to accept your apology . No . What ? I 've never done anything I 'm ashamed of , and I 'm not about to do it now . You 'll do as I say . No . I think you 'll be wanting to reconsider your position . ( clock cuckoos ) Oh , yeah , you skunked me again . You are a huckleberry above my persimmon . Mr. Best , would you do me a small favor ? Of course , Mrs. O 'Leary . The lantern is a wee bit low . Oh . All right , off to bed with you , little missy . I 'm going to get you next time , Mary . Don 't you worry . Heat , the fuel , here we go . Here we go . Thank you , Mr. Best . Oh , my pleasure , Mrs. O 'Leary . ( door opening ) Take your time , Commissioner . Oh , and Eleanor , no need to worry about your brother . He 'll be right out here with me and the boys . Jesse ... Lock him in the cellar . Yes , sir . Come on , you . Beer , Liam ? Hey , stop that kid ! Grab him ! Oh ! Uh ... ( growls ) Psst ! Psst ! Jesse . Hey , you have to come . You have to help Ellie . Well , I , I 'm a little locked up right now . Listen , if I get you out of here , will you promise to help her ? How are you gonna do that ? Just promise . ( grunts ) Do it . Do it . Uh , yeah , yeah , sure , I promise . All right , stick this in the lock . It 's wax . I can make a key . All right , give it here . All right . ( whispers ) : Hey . MAN : How much longer ? All right , here you go . How did you ... ? Forget it . ( lock clicks ) ( door screeches ) Go on ! Scoot ! Hey , you 're welcome . No ! No ! No ! No ... ! Come on , let 's get you out of here . Come on . Come on . What ? What is it ? What ? I am done with you , Daniel Sullivan . The hell with your women . The hell with your deal ! It 's time for the last milking , Mr. Best . Watch little Jimmy for just a moment , will you ? Oh , no problem . Yes . Hello , little Jimmy . Come to Uncle Morrie . Yes , come to Papa Morrie , huh ? Huh ? You hungry , Jimmy ? You wanting cookie ? Yes ? You like that , don 't you ? ( clock cuckoos ) * Let grasses grow and water flow in a free and easy way * * And give me enough of that fine old stuff * * That 's made near Galway Bay * * Let ... * ( baby crying in distance ) ( moos ) Baby , you 're pishing everywhere . You have to stop , please . Uh , he , uh , he wet himself , Mrs. O 'Leary . Oh , for heaven 's sake ! It 's a perfectly natural body function , that 's all . Get me a rag and I 'll clean your shirt . Oh , mama ... That 's right . That 's right . ( moos ) ( moos ) Where are we going , Mr. Hobson ? Long story . Jesse , what time is it ? It 's , uh , 21 minutes after 9 : 00 . ( cow moos ) Oh , no . Oh , my God , you smell that ? It smells like ... Smoke ? Whatever happened to your Mr. Hobson ? Oh , well , he was nice fellow , but a couple of straws short of bale , you know . Oh , dear . GARY : Fire ! Help ! Oh , no . GARY : Fire ! No , no , you-you wait here . You just wait with children . I see what 's burning . GARY : Fire ! Morris , give me a hand ! Oh , my God ... Grab the blanket ! You-You did know ! You are from future ! Oh ! Give me a hand with the trough . Come on . On three . One , two , three ... That one . ( coughing ) Get out ! ( grunting ) You did it . You saved Chicago . We ... We did . We saved ... We saved Chicago . Good job , my friend . Thank you . Very good job . You 've interfered for the last time . MORRIS : Who is this ? Oh , hey , what is problem , huh ? ( angry yell ) Oh , no , no , no , no . The lantern ! Fire ! Jesse ! Run , Jesse ! I 'll kill the little bastard ! Run , Jesse ! Come back here ! Come back here , you little ... He 's going to kill him , Mr. Hobson . He told me he would . Please , Mr. Hobson ! Morris , wake up . Come on . Come on , Morris . You got to put the fire out . You hear me ? Fire ? Yeah . I thought we already did . Well , there 's another one . Oh ... Here ! Here ! Dropped your timepiece . ( crunching ) What a shame . Come here , you little ... See you in hell , Jesse Mayfield . Jesse ... You all right ? He was going to kill me . Yeah . And my watch ... Come on , let 's go back to the barn . Mrs. O 'Leary ! Mrs. O 'Leary , the barn 's on fire ! The barn 's on fire ! Get out ! Get out ! It 's no use ! Get out ! Get out ! Fire , Daisy . Fire ! ( mooing ) Daisy , don 't burn ! What in the name of God ? Look , I 'll raise the alarm , okay ? Get out ! Take her out ! Throw the alarm ! Throw the alarm ! Fire ! What happened ? This colored woman and her brother were running away from saloon keeper , when this man from the future , he tried to ... No ! This man from future , he ... Oh , hell . It was Mrs. O 'Leary 's cow . Mrs. O 'Leary 's cow started the fire ! Throw the alarm ! ( in distance ) : Fire ! ( murmuring ) Hey , hold up there . Stop ! Hey ! Listen , can you get these people out of here for me ? The fire 's going to spread . Where are we going ? We 're gonna get you out of here . The city 's going to burn tonight . What ? What are you talking about ? The city 's going to burn ? Everything 's going to be all right , Jesse . We can find you if we get in trouble again ? Look , Jesse , I-I 'm just passing through . I ... Sure . Listen , I wish I could make everything right , but I-I can 't do that . Here ... Jesse ... Look , you take this . Go ahead . I want you to have that . You ... You sure , mister ? Yeah . I 'm sure . And don 't give up . Do you understand what I 'm saying ? 'Cause if you do , I 'm going to know about it . Don 't give up . Yeah . All right . God bless you , Mr. Hobson . Take care . All right . ( knocking on wagon ) Go ! DRIVER : Giddyup ! Giddyup ! Jesse , don 't give up ! Jesse , you don 't give up , you understand ? Come on . ( cat meowing ) Hey , let 's go ! It 's no use !

Now , please be assured that there 's no way my company would ever do anything to compromise the safety of the people here in Chicago . No , no , no . We were just , uh , concerned . Oop ! Have an appointment . Excuse me . Where did you get that watch ? Oh , you like it , huh ? Well , the , um , story goes all the way back to the Great Chicago Fire . Chicago Fire ? CHUCK : Yeah , you know , the cow , Mrs. O 'Leary , flames ... My great-grandfather almost died in that fire , and the stranger that saved his life gave him this watch . Since then , it 's been passed down from generation to generation . Stranger ? Well , that 's the story , anyway . Well , if you 'll excuse me , I really have to get out of here . I ... Hey , can I ask ... Can I ask you , uh ... I didn 't even get your name . Oh , I 'm sorry . Mayfield . Jesse Mayfield IV . Jesse ... Well , again , thanks to you both , okay ?

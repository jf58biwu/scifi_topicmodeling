 Harry : hi . Reservation for Solomon . Right this way . Uh , you must be new here . That 's our table . Yeah . Oh , I 'm sorry . That table 's reserved . That 's right . Reserved for us . Sir , this is a gas receipt . 3 gallons worth . Uh , look , do you want this to get ugly ? 'Cause , um--ahem- - I am jonesing for some ugly . I 'm sorry , but that table is reserved for the owner tonight . Maybe you don 't know who you 're talking to . When I come here on my birthday , I get a free entree , when I buy an entree , providing I pay ... for the more expensive entree ! Just give us the table , you cow - murdering bastard , or I swear I 'll- - whoa ! Did you see that ? ! My god , we could have been killed ! But we weren 't , Tommy . We weren 't . We 're alive . We are . Thank god we didn 't get that table . Bless you for being such a jerk ! Thanks , jackass ! look at the way that tree divides- - 2 enormous trees coming from one . I believe they call that the crotch of the tree . Why do you think the tree decided to do that ? Like each piece is taking its own path . Yeah , each exploring its own destiny . But still united , right there in the crotch . How did we never notice that crotch ? Tommy , it 's not just the crotch , you see ? I mean , it 's like I 'm seeing everything for the first time . What are you guys doing on the roof at 3 : 00 in the morning ? What are we doing , Dick ? We 're living . Yeah . At 3 A.M. , You should be sleeping . We 've been asleep for years . We 're finally awake . You know , we were almost killed tonight , Dick . What ? That 's awful ! Oh , no , no , no . It is so wonderful . Do you remember when we first landed and everything seemed so fresh and new and alive ? Well , that 's how we feel right now . Oh , wow . Look at those lights . Ooh.I feel like they 're piercing my soul . Oh , yeah . The flashing lights around the big liquor mart sign ? Lights that insist on shining even in the dark of night . Directing you to buy discount liquor ? Ooh , whoa ! I just realized something . We 're all wearing shirts . How great is that ? Ooh , my blue looks pretty in the moonlight . Who came up with shirts ? But they 're just shirts . We always wear shirts . Remember when we were that blind ? How sad . All right , here 's a list of the gear you 'll need for the staff retreat on mount digney . This 'll be fun . Are there gonna be snakes out there ? If you 're asking if my lawyer 's coming , the answer is no . Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! Look at this paper clip . I 'm looking . This must be the most extraordinary paper clip I 've ever seen . Why ? Well , look at it . I feel like it 's piercing my soul . It 's piercing your soul ? Yeah . Why not ? You know what your problem is ? You take everything for granted . Don 't you all wish you could be like me , seeing everything for the first time ? Huh ? Well , don 't you ? Ok , tell me what you see exactly . Well , this paper clip is ... an unusual-type specimen . It 's gray , uh ... slightly curlier than yours . Oh , I 'm such a fraud ! I don 't even like paper clips ! Leave me alone ! Tommy ! Tommy , listen ! I 've been thinking . I have spent my entire time on this planet being mean to people . All I have been doing is spreading fear . That 's true . Yeah . So , I have decided now I 'm just gonna help people , people like these poor , miserable souls . Look . That 's the cast of Les miz . Sally , listen up . If poor folks and losers are your bag , then go out there and help ' em . Follow your dream . I-I 've never heard you talk like this , Harry . Harry ? Ahh ... Harry let other people define him . Harry let other people tell Harry who Harry was . Well , a chandelier fell on Harry . Harry 's dead . Then who are you ? Me ? I 'm A.J. It 's nice to meet you , A.J. Dick : hey , guys ! Hey , hey , hey , guys ! I--I can 't find joy in this paper clip . I 'm not missing anything , am I ? So little ... but so much . It 's beautiful . Oh , god . What is it ? I don 't get it . What am I not seeing ? Alissa : hello ! Alissa ! Hey . Hi ! Ohh ... hi . Oh ! Did you wash your hands ? Oh , it 's so good to see you . Yeah , it 's good to see you , too . I love you so much . Come with me . There 's a crotch I want to show you . Bless you , miss Sally . Oh , no , chester . Bless you . Sally . Hi , Don . It 's so nice to see you down here at the mission helping out . Oh , well , hey , you know , it 's a whole new me . I 've decided I 'm gonna devote my whole life to this . Well , that 's great , Sally . How about some chicken vegetable and double crackers ? It 's for them . Oh , of course . Oh , Don . Thank you so much for helping out . Well , you know , you do what you can . Thanks . Get your hands off that . Come on . So , uh , you volunteering , too , Harry ? The name 's A.J. No , it 's not . Yes , it is . I know who I am . You know who you are ? I 'm Don . Well , if you think you 're Don , you will be Don . I know I 'm Don . Well , there you go . What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about dreams , people . There is no limit to what you can accomplish in your dreams- - no boundaries , no fear . But then what happens ? You wake up , and the dream is gone . It 's over . Now , what I 'm talking about is dreaming the possible dream . Yeah ? What is your dream , sir ? I--I always wanted to play the piano . Well , who 's stopping ya ? You are stopping you . The only person standing between you and your dream is you . I don 't have a piano . Well , I don 't have a piano . Look at me . Hasn 't held me back . Ok , so you weren 't killed by a chandelier . What 's the big deal ? Well , don 't you see ? I mean , there are chandeliers hanging over our heads everywhere that we go in this world . There are ? Yeah . Ok , so the chandelier can come in many forms . I mean , it could be something as horrifying as the bite of a diseased rat or as whimsical as an open manhole . I guess I just never heard that expression before . Yeah , Ok , but the point is that every time I see you , it could be the last time . You know , every kiss could be our last kiss . Tommy , did a rat bite you ? Alissa Strudwick ... will you marry me ? Shut up . No . Marry me . No , get up off the floor . Ok , well , if we 're gonna get married , you 're gonna have to stop bossing me around . Shut up ! Why does this world leave me so cold ? Why does it hide its beauty from me ? Hey ! Get away from that daffodil , you stupid hummingbird ! Dick , we still haven 't gotten your release form for the staff retreat . Oh , that . We need an accurate head count to get 10 % off on parking . You 're holding us back , Dick . Why should I go ? So the sunset can bore me ? So a marmot can lick my oblivious face ? So I can be so lost in my ennui that I fall off a cliff and--and ... and nearly plummet to my ... I 'm in ! What are you so damn excited about ? I 'm in ! I 'm going on that camping trip , and I am going to have a near - death experience if it kills me ! Thank you , miss Sally . Oh , please . Your patheticness has shown me how fortunate I am , so ... for that , I thank you . A chandelier fell on Harry , but who walked out ? A.J. A.J. A.J. That 's right . Let me break it down for you , people . Have any of you ever felt like a slave to your job ? No . No . No . Sometimes I do . Come on , Rico . I do . Stop planting ideas in his head , Harry . The name 's A.J. And I don 't plant ideas . The seeds are already there- - the seeds of your dreams . I just bring ' em on out into the sunshine . Well , let 's take you , Don . You 're a cop . You carry a loaded gun . Yeah . But you 're not superbright , now , are you ? No- - wait a minute ! Not bright , loaded gun- - you 'll be lucky if you see 30 . Ha . I 'm way past that now . No , Don ! This is not who you are ! This is not your life . It isn 't ? No . What do you know about a place called Bhutan ? I think they shut ' em down for serving dog . No , Rico . It 's a kingdom in the Himalayas . They speak Tibetan and value a little thing called self-realization . Would you like to realize yourself , Don ? Well , it sounds good in theory . Then go ! Go to Bhutan ! Follow your destiny ! I 'm going to Bhutan ! Rico ! We were supposed to go to cocoa beach ! Rico ! ♪ One bottle of beer on the wall ♪ ♪ one bottle of beer ♪ ♪ you take it down and pass it around ♪ ♪ there 'll be no more bottles of beer on the wall ♪ all right . We 'll head to the mountain at 8 A.M. Sharp . Any questions ? Uh , yes . As we climb , will you point out any crevasses that I might plummet into ? I will ! There 's nothing like that here . Well , I-is there a dead man 's anything ? You see , I 'm looking for the kind- - shut up , Dick ! All right , I 'm turning in . Oh , and a word to the wise : everybody put your food in the bear bags . This is bear country . Thank you , Vincent . Nina : good night . Good night , Vincent . Good night , Mary . Dick , what are you doing with that sandwich ? Vincent just said that was dangerous . Well , you know what I love about bears . They 'll almost kill you every time . No , Dick , they will kill you every time . They will ? Good night , Vincent . Ok , Tommy , I 'm really sorry . I never meant to hurt your feelings , you know . It 's just that we 're so young . We have plenty of time . It 's all right . I mean , you can 't understand where I 'm coming from 'cause you haven 't experienced what I 've experienced , so ... now , why don 't you try some perfectly ordinary peanut brittle ? Tommy , that 's a can full of fake snakes . What are you talking abou- - it says peanut brittle right on the front . Listen . [ Clunking ] When you shake it , it sounds like there 's peanut brittle inside . Go ahead . All right . Aah ! Snakes ! They 're gonna kill you ! All right , well , what if those were real ? Well , I would hope you wouldn 't have offered them to me . Yeah , but- - but the point is that there 's deadly peanut brittle out there for everybody . Yeah , I know , peanut brittle and chandeliers everywhere , and that 's why I have to marry you . Yes ! Good ! I 'm glad you 're coming around . No , that 's not what I was saying . Look , I love you . Don 't make me cut your brake lines . Ok , now you 're threatening me ? No ! No , no . No , no , no , no . I ... I just want you to be sufficiently scared so that you understand that--That ... every moment of life is so precious , and--and every moment that I 'm not with you , you know , it 's like a moment wasted . Ok . That 's really sweet . Ha . So you 'll marry me ? No . Is your harness secure ? Not especially . And that 's the way I like it . One of the thrills of climbing is never knowing when your gear is going to crap out . Dick , the other group is over there . Why are we going this way ? No , we 're leaving the pack behind . Cat 's eye peak awaits . You know , the whole point of these faculty outings is not really an intense climb , more like a brisk walk followed by a nice , long happy hour . This could be dangerous . Yes , but , Mary , I have to perch on the teeth of death in order to stare down onto the tonsils of enlightenment . What , do you have some kind of death wish ? Actually , it 's more of a near-death wish , but if we rule out death , I really think it undercuts the experience , you know . Oh , my god . I 'm climbing a mountain tied to a suicidal maniac ! Help me ! Help me ! Mary ! Mary ! Please , Mary ! Help me ! Help me ! Remember what Judith said . Any loud noise can cause an avalanche . [ Thump , dust falling ] Yodel-oh-ooh-hoo ! Oh , shh ! Shh ! Ah-yodel-oh-ooh-hoo ! Hey ! You burned me . Sorry . Here . Have an extra bread . Thanks for nothing . Man , this is really starting to get old . Hey , A.J. , You know , I 've always dreamed of working in the movie industry . Can you help me out ? Uh , yeah . I 'm gonna call warren beatty for you right now . A.J. , Everybody says you 're a real inspiration . Tell me , how did you change your life ? You know , you guys , I told this story , like , a million times already . Why don 't you ask one of these guys ? They don 't seem to be doin ' Nothin ' . Hey , Sally , can I have that people when you 're done with it ? Uh , I 'm stuck on a crossword . It 's gonna be a while . Oh . Hey , guys . Isn 't it great to be alive ? Yeah . I feel electric . Yeah . Carpe freakin ' diem . Ha ha ! Ha ... uh , who are we kidding ' ? It 's over . I was just faking it so I wouldn 't harsh your buzz . Hi , guys . I just came to say good-bye . Where you going , Don ? The name 's not Don . It 's skip . And I 'm going to Bhutan ! No way ! What ? ! Why ? Self-realization . Oh . Yeah . Are you sure this is what you wanna do , Don ? I 'm sure I spent $ 4,000 on a package deal . Well , when are we gonna see you again ? Maybe never . Maybe in 3 weeks . Probably in 3 weeks . Oh , don 't be mad ! I 'm not mad ! Dick , stop what you 're doing right now ! I don 't care about your adrenaline high ! I want to live ! I want to live ! You 'll live like never before . Imagine tasting a blueberry for the first time every time ! Forward ! You 're not taking me with you ! There we go ! The gaping maw of the unknown ! I 'm one fingerhold away from death and thus life ! Hi , guys . I left the watermelon in the car . Stupid . I 'm coming with you . Nooo ! Yes ! What ? The answer is yes . I ask you a question ? You asked me to marry you . Oh ! Right ! Wow ! All right . Well , um , that 's super-Duper there . You were just so intense . I couldn 't get what you were saying out of my head , so I asked my mother , my priest , Allison , Kristina , and Brittany , and they all said no , but--But I say yes ! W-w-w-wait . You didn 't listen to your mother ? I mean , I don 't know if I can marry a girl who doesn 't listen to her mother . Tommy , are you telling me you 've changed your mind ? No , hardly . I 'm just saying that we have to carefully consider- - you 've changed your mind . Yeah . I 'm an idiot . You know , this is why I said no twice . No , but , Alissa , I- - but then I started thinking , you know , about how much I like you and how great we are together and how I 'd never want to lose that . And sure , it 's impulsive , but some of the greatest things you could do in life are impulsive , and , I mean , think about it , Tommy , we could wake up every morning together in each other 's arms forever . God , I 'm a moron ! Alissa , will you marry me ? No ! Look , Dick , I- - I don 't care what you do . You can skydive , bungee-Jump , go over Niagara falls on a pogo stick for all I care . Just don 't drag me along . I would think you 'd be a little more grateful , Mary . I wanted you to share my experience . Thank you . Thank you for the gift of death . It 's the thought that counts . If you wanna go pick flowers , pick flowers in a nice , safe park . Oh , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . There 's a train . Oh , I 've seen trains before . They no longer hold any excitement for me . Dick ! Aah ! Ahh . Ohh . M-Mary , are you all right ? Yes . Oh , my god . That train could have killed us . We were inches away from death ! Look what you did to my car ! But we 're alive ! Mary , we 're alive ! Dick , do you smell gas ? Yes . I feel like I 'm smelling it for the first time . We 're alive ! Nice night , isn 't it ? Eh ... great news ! I blew up Mary 's car ! Now I can see life like you do , with aliveness . I 'm not actually sure " aliveness " is a word . It is now . Come , roll with me in the dewy scent of the night jasmine . You know , what 's weird is--is you can smell it every night , you know what I 'm saying ? What 's Sally talking about , A.J. ? A.J. Was full of crap . Heart of gold , full of crap . Hey , guys , I just had another near-death experience . Alissa 's father found out I proposed , and he came after me with a bat . So you can still be in my soul posse . Uh , it didn 't really work the second time . But look ... in the distance I see the shining brilliance of the liquor mart sign . Remember this moment , Dick . God , I wish I could see with your clarity . Can you make out if those tall boys are still on sale ? man , this place must be good . Look at the line . Yeah . Wonder what soup they 've got . I 've been hankering for a nice lobster bisque all day . Come on , chester , move it along . We got hungry people here . Yeah . Some of us have jobs to get back to , all right ? What are you all looking at ?

 [ Chattering ] [ Door Opens , Closes ] [ Man On TV ] NOW THIS- - THIS HERE 'S A SPECIAL NUMBER . IT 'S GONNA MAKE YOUR TONGUE ROLL OUTTA YOUR HEAD AND DIAL 911 . [ TV : Laughter ] [ TV : Indistinct ] [ Garbled Shouts ] YOU ADD IN ALL THAT NICE SHRIMP- - [ Gasps ] [ Man On Police Radio ] DISPATCH , THIS IS UNIT 7 ... INVESTIGATING A REPORT OF DISTURBANCE AT 214 PROSPECT AVENUE , OVER . [ Female Dispatcher ] COPY THAT , UNIT 7 . JEEZ . POLICE ! DON 'T MOVE . KEEP ' EM IN THE AIR . CUFF HER , JIMMY . DAMN , SHE 'S GOT BLOOD ALL OVER HER . HEY , KEITH . I THINK YOU MIGHT WANNA CHECK THIS OUT . I THINK SHE 'S BLIND . THE DECEASED IS PACO ORDONEZ , A.K.A. LITTLE MONSTER- - STREET DEALER , LIKED TO USE GRADE-SCHOOL KIDS AS COURIERS . OUT ON BAIL FOR POSSESSION WITH INTENT . TWO-TIME LOSER LOOKING AT LIFE . I HAVE THE SAME PAIR OF PANTS . WHO EXTERMINATED HIM ? THAT 'S A SUBJECT OF SOME DEBATE . THE KILLER CARVED A SINGLE C-SHAPED CUT UP THROUGH THE RIGHT KIDNEY . FATAL BLOOD LOSS CAME IN UNDER 30 SECONDS . I 'M GOING TO ASSUME THE KILLER KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING , AND THAT " C " WASN 'T ONE OF HIS INITIALS . YOUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE CORRECT , ONLY THE KILLER ISN 'T A HE . MARTY GLENN , 28 . WE FOUND HER AT THE SCENE DOING A FORMULA 409 . UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES , MY DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE HER DEAD TO RIGHTS . THERE 'S JUST ONE LITTLE SNAG . SHE 'S BEEN BLIND SINCE BIRTH . BEFORE YOUR HEART GOES OUT TO HER , CHECK OUT HER RAP SHEET . FRAUD , PETTY THEFT , AGGRAVATED ASSAULT . BELIEVE ME , SHE 'S A REAL PIECE OF WORK . HER JUVENILE RECORDS ARE SEALED , BUT DETECTIVE PENNOCK HAS IT ON AUTHORITY ... THAT TWO OF THEM WERE DRUG BUSTS- - POSSESSION AND POSSESSION WITH INTENT . SO DO YOU THINK THAT SHE CAUGHT LITTLE MONSTER TRYING TO SNATCH THE PEBBLE FROM HER HAND ? NOTHING ELSE MAKES SENSE . INCLUDING HOW A BLIND GIRL COULD GET THE DROP ON AN EX-CON ... AND BLEED HIM OUT WITH SURGICAL PRECISION . MS. GLENN TOOK A $ 60 CAB RIDE ALONE STRAIGHT TO THE MOTEL . THE CABBIE INSTRUCTED HER TO ROOM 10 , WHICH SHE ASKED FOR SPECIFICALLY ... AND THEN TOLD HIM TO GET LOST . THIRTY MINUTES LATER , DEAD HEROIN DEALER . ALL RIGHT , SO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT SHE DID THIS , YOU JUST DON 'T KNOW HOW . I GOT A THEORY IF YOU WANT TO HEAR IT . I THINK SHE 'S GOT SOME KINDA SIXTH SENSE- - LETS HER SEE IN THE DARK , LIKE A BAT OR SOMETHING . I GOT 48 HOURS TO CONVINCE THE D.A. , OR WAIT TILL SHE KILLS SOMEBODY ELSE . HOW SOON CAN I MEET HER ? [ Cell Door Sliding ] [ Footsteps ] OH ... IT 'S YOU . SEE WHAT I MEAN ? IT 'S NOT MAGIC . IT 'S YOUR CRAPPY COLOGNE . WHO 'S THAT WITH YOU ? - SPECIAL AGENT MULDER . - AND THE LADY ? UH , SPECIAL AGENT SCULLY . WE 'D LIKE TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS , MARTY . YOU MUST BE HAVING TROUBLE WITH YOUR CASE , DETECTIVE . FINE . SUIT YOURSELF . WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT ? AN INNOCENT WOMAN- - I HOPE . SO , I 'M ALL EARS . I 'M CURIOUS WHY YOU 'VE REFUSED YOUR RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY . UNLESS YOU 'RE GONNA CHARGE ME , I DON 'T PLAN ON NEEDING ONE . WELL , YOU COULD BE CHARGED RIGHT NOW , WITH THE FACT THAT YOU 'VE GIVEN NO COMPELLING REASON WHY YOU WERE IN THAT MOTEL ROOM . WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE , MARTY ? PUTTING MINTS ON THE PILLOWS . THE CABBIE HAS GIVEN A STATEMENT THAT YOU ASKED SPECIFICALLY FOR ROOM 10 , WHICH WOULD PUT YOU AT THE MURDER SCENE RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME OF DEATH . IS THAT A CRIME ? IF YOU WERE INVOLVED IN ANY WAY . YOU MEAN , LIKE , AN EYEWITNESS ? DID YOU INTEND TO BUY DRUGS FROM PACO ORDONEZ ? DID YOU KILL HIM ? MAYBE IT WAS JUST HIS TIME TO GO . OTHER THAN THE STAB WOUND , DID YOU CHECK HIS CHOLESTEROL LEVEL OR ANYTHING ? HOW DID YOU KNOW THERE WAS JUST ONE STAB WOUND ? DID I SAY THAT ? MM-HMM . I GUESSED . YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS ? YOU 'VE GOT NO MURDER WEAPON . AND I BET THAT 'S DRIVIN' STINKY BACK THERE CRAZY . ISN 'T IT , STINKY ? WHY IS HE HIDING ? IT 'S NOT LIKE I CAN SEE HIM . YOU KNOW WHAT I DID WITH IT , DETECTIVE ? I FED IT TO MY SEEING EYE DOG . I 'M CURIOUS , MARTY . YEAH ? ABOUT WHAT ? IF YOU DIDN 'T KILL HIM , WHY YOU WERE AT THE CRIME SCENE CLEANING UP ... AND DOING SUCH A PISS-POOR JOB OF IT ? WHY DON 'T WE JUST STOP PLAYING GAMES HERE , OKAY ? I MEAN , YOU PROBABLY DON 'T KNOW A FEATHER DUSTER FROM A DUCK 'S ASS , DO YA ? I MEAN , IT 'S RIDICULOUS . YOU 'RE A BLIND WOMAN , FOR GOD 'S SAKE . SO WHY DON 'T YOU TELL US WHO DID KILL PACO ORDONEZ , AND AGENT SCULLY AND I CAN GO ARREST HIM ... AND YOU CAN GO HOME AND WORK ON YOUR " ANGRY YOUNG BLIND GIRL " COMEDY ROUTINE . OR WE CAN JUST STAY HERE AND ENTERTAIN EACH OTHER FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS . [ Glass Clatters ] GO TO HELL . [ Pennock ] SEE WHAT I MEAN ? PUT A KNIFE IN THAT HAND- - NO . ALL I SEE IS A WOMAN WHO 'S ADAPTED TO HER IMPAIRMENT ADMIRABLY . SHE 'S HONED ALL HER OTHER SENSES AROUND HER BLINDNESS . SHE 'S TAUNTING YOU . I DON 'T KNOW . I THINK SHE JUST WANTS US TO THINK THAT SHE 'S STRONG , INDEPENDENT . - IT 'S IMPORTANT TO HER . - SHE WANTS US TO KNOW SHE DID IT . - I DON 'T THINK SHE DID DO IT . - THEN WHY WON 'T SHE HELP US ? IT 'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT INNOCENT PEOPLE DON 'T ACT LIKE THAT , AGENT MULDER . SHE WOULDN 'T EXPLAIN HER PRESENCE AT THE CRIME SCENE , AND SHE AVOIDED ALL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MURDER WEAPON . SHE KNEW THERE WAS ONLY ONE STAB WOUND . YOU CAUGHT THAT YOURSELF . YEAH . DETECTIVE , DID YOU SNAKE ALL OF THE PLUMBING IN THE BATHROOM ? I TURNED THAT PLACE UPSIDE DOWN AND INSIDE OUT . WELL , IF WE FIND THE WEAPON WITH HER FINGERPRINTS ON IT , SHE 'S AS GOOD AS CONVICTED . SHORT OF THAT , SHE 'S GONNA WALK . MAYBE I CAN GET YOU TO COME OUT TO THE CRIME SCENE ONE LAST TIME . OKAY . YOU GO AHEAD . I WANNA- - I WANNA INVESTIGATE SOMETHING . [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] [ Man ] I 'M GOING TO ASK YOU A SERIES OF QUESTIONS . RESPOND ONLY WITH A " YES " OR " NO . " DO NOT JUDGE THE CONTENT OF THE QUESTIONS . SIMPLY ANSWER TRUTHFULLY . IS YOUR FULL NAME MARTELL FRANCIS GLENN ? YEAH . ARE YOU A RESIDENT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE ? LET 'S CUT THROUGH THE BULL , OR I 'M GONNA DECIDE NOT TO COOPERATE AT ALL . ALL RIGHT , LET 'S , UH , GET TO IT . I NEED TO ESTABLISH A BASELINE . I 'M A RESIDENT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE , OKAY ? LET 'S MOVE ON . [ Sighs ] IS IT YOUR INTENT TO LIE DURING THE COURSE OF THIS EXAMINATION ? I 'M SURE YOU 'LL TELL ME IF IT IS . DID YOU STAB PACO ORDONEZ , ALSO KNOWN AS LITTLE MONSTER ? NOPE . - DID YOU PLAN OR ARRANGE THE MURDER OF PACO ORDONEZ ? - NO . HAVE YOU EVER MET PACO ORDONEZ ? NO . WOULD YOU EVER HAVE OCCASION TO SEE PACO ORDONEZ OR KNOW HIM IN ANOTHER WAY ? STRIKE THAT . HAVE YOU EVER HAD OCCASION TO INTERACT WITH PACO ORDONEZ OR KNOW HIM IN ANOTHER WAY ? NO . - WERE YOU PRESENT DURING THE MURDER OF PACO ORDONEZ ? - NO . WHY DON 'T YOU JUST ASK ME YOURSELF ? DID YOU SEE THE MURDER ? DID YOU SEE THE MURDER ? - I DON 'T SEE ANYTHING . - YES OR NO ONLY , PLEASE . THEN , THE ANSWER IS NO . [ Pennock ] NO BLOOD TRAILS LEADING OUT OF THE BATHROOM . WINDOWS ARE PAINTED SHUT . AS YOU CAN SEE , NOT A LOT OF PLACES SHE COULD 'VE STASHED IT . [ Cell Phone Rings ] SCULLY . SHE 'S LYING . ABOUT WHAT ? SHE KNEW PACO ORDONEZ , BUT I DON 'T THINK SHE MURDERED HIM . HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SHE KNEW HIM ? I MADE HER TAKE A POLYGRAPH TEST . SHE PASSED ON EVERY QUESTION EXCEPT ONE : DID SHE SEE THE MURDER ? WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO REMIND YOU WHY POLYGRAPHS ARE INADMISSIBLE IN COURT ? NO , SHE CRACKED , SCULLY . SHE WAS LYING . I 'M SURE OF IT . WELL , MAYBE SHE WAS , MULDER , BUT DON 'T MAKE ME STATE THE OBVIOUS . SHE DIDN 'T SEE ANYTHING . NOT WITH HER EYES . WELL , HOW ELSE DID SHE SEE ? BAT VISION ? I DON 'T KNOW . WELL , MULDER , WHEN YOU FIGURE IT OUT , GIVE ME A CALL . [ Beeps Off ] DETECTIVE PENNOCK ? [ Voice Garbled ] [ Gasps ] SOMEBODY , I NEED A PHONE . I GET TO CALL A LAWYER ! SOMEBODY , I NEED A PHONE ! I GOT IT . YOU KNOW , I 'M SURE THE A.C.L.U. IS GONNA BE VERY INTERESTED ... IN HOW YOU VIOLATED A BLIND WOMAN 'S RIGHTS ... BY EAVESDROPPING ON HER PRIVATE PHONE CALL . SAME TO YOU . [ Ringing ] dddd [ Blues ] BLARNEY STONE . UM , LET 'S SEE- - THE GUY HITTIN ' ON THE REDHEAD AT THE END OF THE BAR . - I TOLD YOU , STOP IT ! - YEAH , WE GOT SOMEBODY MATCHING THAT DESCRIPTION . POP , IT 'S FOR YOU . - YEAH ? - LEAVE HER ALONE . WHO IS THIS ? YOU JUST LEAVE HER ALONE . I 'M WATCHING YOU . [ Line Disconnects , Dial Tone ] LET ME GUESS . YOUR KILLER IS O.J. SIMPSON . THEY WERE FOUND AT THE CRIME SCENE WITH BLOOD ALL OVER THEM . WE BELIEVE THEY WERE WORN BY PACO ORDONEZ 'S KILLER . HMM . YOU 'RE GOOD . WE THINK THEY BELONG TO YOU . WELL , THEY DON 'T . TRY ONE ON FOR US . AND PUT MY PRINTS ALL OVER THEM ? YOUR PRINTS ARE ALREADY ALL OVER THEM , MARTY . [ Pennock ] HOLD STILL . ARE YOU HAPPY , DETECTIVE ? LOOKS TO ME LIKE IT FITS . SOMEWHERE MARCIA CLARK WEEPS . BUT YOU STILL HAVEN 'T GOT A WEAPON . OH , IT 'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME . BUT YOU HAVEN 'T GOT TIME . HOPE YOU SAW WHAT JUST HAPPENED IN THERE . EVEN IF THE GLOVES DO FIT , YOU CAN STILL ACQUIT . I THINK IT 'S ARROGANCE . I THINK IT 'S THE SAME REASON SHE AGREED TO TAKE THE POLYGRAPH TEST . SHE KNOWS THAT THE PREJUDICES IN THIS CASE ARE ALL IN HER FAVOR . I DON 'T THINK IT 'S THAT SIMPLE . LOOK AT THIS . SHE LIVES IN POVERTY , BUT SHE 'S NEVER TAKEN ADVANTAGE ... OF THE DISABILITY BENEFITS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO HER- - NEVER ONCE . IT 'S POISON TO HER . THE MERE SUGGESTION ... THAT SHE 'S ANYTHING OTHER THAN A WHOLE OR COMPLETE PERSON IS OFFENSIVE TO HER . IT 'S NOT ARROGANCE , IT 'S PRIDE . YOU THINK IT WAS PRIDE THAT MADE HER DITCH THE BLOODY GLOVES ? HER PRINTS WERE ALL OVER THEM , MULDER . WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT ? I HAVE NO IDEA . OKAY , SO BY YOUR REASONING , THE KILLER TOOK OFF WITH THE MURDER WEAPON BUT NOT THE GLOVES , LEAVING MARTY TO COME IN , GO STRAIGHT TO THE GLOVES , AND HIDE THEM IN THE ONE PLACE THAT NOBODY WOULD EASILY THINK TO FIND THEM . I THINK THAT 'S THE MOST ACCURATE SCENARIO AVAILABLE TO US RIGHT NOW . WAIT A MINUTE . MAYBE IT 'S MUCH SIMPLER THAN THAT . WHAT ? WHAT IF SHE 'S NOT REALLY BLIND ? I MEAN , SHE HASN 'T APPLIED FOR ANY OF HER DISABILITY BENEFITS . MAYBE THAT 'S BECAUSE SHE KNOWS SHE COULDN 'T PASS THE MEDICAL SCREENING . - YOU THINK SHE 'S FAKING IT ? - NO . NO , BUT POSSIBLY IT 'S A CONVERSION DISORDER ... OR A FORM OF BLIND SIGHT- - A SPLIT CONSCIOUSNESS , WHEREBY A PERSON HAS ... A CERTAIN LEVEL OF VISUAL ABILITY , BUT THEY 'RE NOT AWARE THEY 'RE ACTUALLY SEEING . I THINK IT 'S WORTH CHECKING OUT . [ Man On Phone ] YO , MAN , LITTLE MONSTER 'S " H " AIN 'T GONNA BE EASY . SEE , A LOT OF PEOPLE RESPECTED HIM , YOU KNOW ? YOU BUYIN ' OR NOT ? YOU 'RE NOT BUYIN ' , I CAN GO TO SOMEBODY ELSE . [ Laughing ] NO , YOU CAN 'T . BUT I 'M FEELIN ' MAGNANIMOUS . SWING BY IN A COUPLE HOURS . MAYBE WE CAN DO SOME BUSINESS . GOOD . YEAH , THERE 'S SOMETHIN' I GOTTA LOOK INTO FIRST . WHEN I 'M DONE , I 'LL BE IN TOUCH . [ Man ] EYES WIDE , PLEASE , MARTY . GOOD . TRY NOT TO MOVE AROUND TOO MUCH . ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY SENSATION AT ALL ? [ Gasps ] IT 'S A MIRACLE ! ALL RIGHT , MARTY , NOW WE 'RE GOING TO INTRODUCE SOME OPTICAL STIMULI . TRY NOT TO BLINK . JUST RELAX FOR A MOMENT . I 'M NOT GETTING ANYTHING . I DON 'T THINK THERE 'S ANY ACTIVITY ... IN EITHER THE VISUAL CORTEX OR THE SUPERIOR COLLICULUS . THERE 'S NO WAY THAT SHE COULD FOOL THE MACHINE ? WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT WHOLLY INVOLUNTARY PHYSICAL RESPONSES . I WASN 'T GETTING ANY READING . THEN WHAT IS THAT ? [ Garbled Chatter ] WHAT IS IT , MARTY ? WHAT DO YOU SEE ? AGENTS . THIS IS DANIEL COSTA FROM THE D.A. ' S OFFICE . SO WHAT DID WE FIND ? I HEAR THE GIRL CAN ACTUALLY SEE WITH SOME LIMITED ABILITY . NO , ACCORDING TO HER EXAMINER , SHE IS COMPLETELY WITHOUT SIGHT OR ANY KIND OF LIGHT SENSITIVITY . BUT SHE IS STILL OUR BEST AND ONLY SUSPECT . - YOU SAID YOU WERE MAKING PROGRESS . - WE ARE . I 'M NOT GONNA INDICT A BLIND GIRL ON SOME LOUSY PRINTS . SHE DOESN 'T EXACTLY FIT THE DEFINITION " BLIND GIRL . " COME ON , FOLKS . EITHER SHE IS OR SHE ISN 'T . - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? - THERE IS EVIDENCE ... OF SOME KIND OF NEUROLOGICAL ACTIVITY WHICH CAUSED HER PUPILS TO DILATE . - FROM WHAT ? - TO ME IT INDICATES SOME REACTION TO STIMULI , SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL RESPONSE TO IMAGES IN HER MIND 'S EYE . HOW DOES THAT MAKE HER THE KILLER ? I DIDN 'T SAY IT DID . KICK HER LOOSE . - [ Pennock ] DANNY- - - I GOT NO CASE , PENNOCK . I DON 'T BELIEVE THIS ! I 'M NOT TRYING HER , NOT WITHOUT A MURDER WEAPON . KICK HER LOOSE . WONDERFUL . THANKS . THESE BETTER STILL BE 20s . NO , I REPLACED THEM WITH 50s SINCE YOU 'RE SO DAMN SWEET . WANNA HEAR THE LATEST ? YES . DETECTIVE PENNOCK RAN THE GLOVES FOR BLOOD TYPING AND FOUND TWO DIFFERENT SAMPLES , ONE TYPE MATCHING MARTY GLENN 'S . THERE WERE NO CUTS ON HER . ALL THE SAME , I 'M GONNA HAND-DELIVER THEM TO THE LAB IN WASHINGTON ... AND EXPEDITE A P.C.R. TO SEE IF SHE 'S A MATCH . LOOK AT HER . DO YOU REALLY THINK SHE 'S CAPABLE ? I 'LL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS I GET THE TEST BACK . [ Garbled Screams ] WHO CALLED ME LAST NIGHT ? WHO 'S WATCHIN ' ME ? WHAT ? AAH ! I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT ! YOU A COP ? HMM ? YOU WEARIN ' A WIRE ? [ Screaming ] NO ! I 'M NOT A COP ! I NEED TO GET TO SPRING STREET ! WHICH WAY IS SPRING STREET ! SOMEBODY ANSWER ME ! FOUR BLOCKS TO THE LEFT . [ Horns Honking ] WHERE ? [ Man ] HERE , HERE . THERE 'S AN ALLEY HERE . RIGHT HERE . OKAY , I 'M FINE , THANKS . LEAVE ME ALONE . [ Marty ] EXCUSE ME . EXCUSE ME , SOMEBODY . - YEAH ? - I KILLED ' EM . I KILLED THEM BOTH . [ Door Opens ] I READ YOUR CONFESSION . DETECTIVE PENNOCK IS TYPING IT UP AS WE SPEAK FOR YOU TO SIGN . I 'LL SIGN IT . YOU 'LL MAKE HIM A VERY HAPPY MAN . CAN 'T HAVE EVERYTHING . AS FOR ME , I 'M A LITTLE PUZZLED BY THIS SUDDEN CHANGE OF HEART . PLEASE . TOO MUCH CHARITY OF HEART , AND I 'LL WANNA PUKE . I JUST- - WHY KILL THEM ? PACO ORDONEZ . SUSAN FORESTER . DID YOU EVEN KNOW THAT WAS HER NAME ? SUSAN FORESTER . SHE WAS 30 YEARS OLD . NATIVE OF WILMINGTON . SHE WAITRESSED PART-TIME . SHE LIVED ALONE WITH HER TWO CATS . SHUT UP ! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS ? I-I- - I 'VE GIVEN YOU PEOPLE EVERYTHING YOU WANT . I LIKE YOU , MARTY . I ADMIRE YOU . AND I DON 'T WANT TO SEE YOU CONFESS TO CRIMES YOU DIDN 'T COMMIT . YOU JUST FEEL SORRY FOR ME . NO , I DON 'T . NOT THE WAY YOU THINK I DO . READ THE CONFESSION . I GOT IT ALL PERFECT . EVERY DETAIL . HOW COULD I DO THAT IF I 'M INNOCENT ? I BELIEVE YOU WITNESSED BOTH MURDERS . YOU-YOU SAW THEM SOMEHOW . BUT YOU WERE WAY ACROSS TOWN WHEN THEY HAPPENED . YOU WERE A $ 60 CAB RIDE AWAY . YOU 'RE CRAZY . I THINK YOU TRIED TO STOP THEM . YOU TRIED TO , BUT YOU DIDN 'T GET THERE IN TIME . I DON 'T HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ANYMORE . MARTY , WHOEVER DID THIS , THEY 'RE GONNA KILL AGAIN , AND YOU CAN HELP STOP THAT . I CAN 'T STOP ANYTHING . I DON 'T HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ANYMORE , PERIOD . OFFICER ! WE 'RE DONE ! WHO 'S WORTH PLEADING GUILTY FOR , MARTY ? OFFICER ! WE 'RE DONE ! YOU DIDN 'T DO IT . AND I 'M NOT GONNA LET THIS HAPPEN . DO YOU HEAR ME ? MARTY ? [ Man ] SORRY , MAN , DEAL 'S OFF . WHAT DO YOU MEAN , " DEAL 'S OFF " ? YOU CAN 'T BACK OUT . I DO WHAT I GOT TO DO TO STAY ON THE DOWN-LOW . YOU 'RE SHININ' TOO MUCH LIGHT ON ME . WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN ' ABOUT ? SOMEBODY 'S GUNNIN ' FOR YOU , AND I AIN 'T GETTIN' IN THE MIDDLE OF IT . WHO ? WHO 'S GUNNIN ' FOR ME ? SOME OLD GIRLFRIEND OF YOURS CALLED LAST NIGHT AND TOLD ME I SHOULD STEER CLEAR . SHE CALLED YOU ? YEAH . SAID SHE WAS PASSIN ' THE WORD . LISTEN TO ME . LISTEN , MAN . SHE 'S NOBODY . SHE KNOWS NOTHIN ' . UH-HUH . YEAH , RIGHT . YOU AND ME , MAN , WE 'RE STILL COOL . TRUST ME . IF SHE DON 'T KNOW ANYTHING , HOW 'D SHE GET THIS NUMBER ? LISTEN TO ME . I GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO TAKE THIS STUFF . THAT 'S NOT MY PROBLEM . JUST DON 'T YOU CALL HERE AGAIN . [ Line Disconnects ] [ Door Opens ] WELL , I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP HERE , SUCH AS IT WAS , BUT I 'D SAY WE 'RE DOING ALL RIGHT . SHE JUST SIGNED HER CONFESSION . CONGRATULATIONS . I DON 'T FEEL AS GOOD AS YOU MIGHT THINK , YOU KNOW . ALL YOU GOT IS A SIGNATURE . NO LAWYER 'S GONNA LET HER GO DOWN BASED ON THAT . I 'M AWARE OF THAT . DOESN 'T IT BOTHER YOU , DETECTIVE , THAT YOU STILL HAVE NO CLEAR MOTIVE ? WELL , SHE JUST NOW GAVE US THAT- - DRUGS . JUST LIKE I THOUGHT . SHE EVEN TOLD US WHERE TO FIND THEM . I 'D THIS IS GONNA MAKE IT A PRETTY SHORT TRIAL . IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT , DETECTIVE , IT ACTUALLY PROVES NOTHING . THERE IT IS , JUST LIKE SHE SAID . JUST LIKE SHE DESCRIBED . YOU KNOW , THE THING I FIND MOST SURPRISING ABOUT THIS CASE IS YOU . YOU ARE ONE SKEPTICAL GUY , AGENT MULDER . SKEPTICAL ? OH , YEAH . I 'VE BEEN CALLED A LOT OF THINGS . " SKEPTICAL " IS NOT ONE . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] YEAH , WELL , WHATEVER . [ Scoffs ] SKEPTICAL . MULDER . WHAT ? I 'VE GOT THE P.C.R. RESULTS ON THE TWO BLOOD TYPES FROM THE GLOVES . NEITHER WAS MARTY 'S . YOU WERE RIGHT , MULDER . SHE DIDN 'T DO IT . I KNOW THAT , YOU KNOW THAT AND SO DOES WHOEVER MARTY 'S PROTECTING , BUT PENNOCK IS SALIVATING RIGHT NOW . WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS CONVINCE MARTY . I GOT AN IDEA . I 'LL GET BACK TO YOU . [ Footsteps Approaching ] WHAT DO YOU WANT NOW ? I KNOW WHO YOU 'RE PROTECTING , MARTY , AND I THINK I KNOW WHY . YOU 'RE PROTECTING THE MAN WHO MURDERED YOUR MOTHER . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT . I READ THE ORIGINAL POLICE REPORT FROM 1970 . YOUR MOTHER DIED FROM A SINGLE STAB WOUND TO THE RIGHT KIDNEY , AS DID PACO ORDONEZ AND SUSAN FORESTER . DEAD AT THE HANDS OF AN UNKNOWN ASSAILANT . I NEVER KNEW MY MOTHER . NO . I KNOW . BUT FOR ONCE YOU WERE THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED . SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH YOU AT THE TIME . SHE DIED ON THE OPERATING TABLE AS DOCTORS WERE TRYING TO SAVE HER . YOU WERE BORN ... JUST BARELY . BUT THE INTERRUPTION OF BLOOD FLOW YOU SUFFERED MOST LIKELY CAUSED YOUR BLINDNESS . WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING ? I THINK THAT DURING THAT TIME ... AS YOU LOST ONE SENSE ... YOU GAINED ANOTHER . AND SOMEHOW ... A CONNECTION WAS FORMED BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR MOTHER 'S KILLER . WHAT CONNECTION ? YOU SEE THROUGH HIS EYES . YOU ALWAYS HAVE . YOU DON 'T WANT TO , YOU JUST DO . AND BECAUSE OF THAT YOU FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ACTIONS , BUT YOU 'RE NOT . AND YOU 'RE SITTING HERE IN PRISON ... FOR CRIMES YOU DIDN 'T COMMIT . IT ISN 'T GOING TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING , MARTY . [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ Pennock ] EXCUSE ME , AGENT MULDER . SHE 'S BEING TRANSFERRED NOW . THERE 'S ABSOLUTELY NO POINT TO YOU DOING THIS . WE 'RE GONNA FIND HIM WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR HELP . I 'M SORRY . [ Buzzing ] [ Guard ] ALL RIGHT . [ Chattering ] HI , MARTY . WHAT 'S GOING ON ? DETECTIVE PENNOCK IS WITH THE WARDEN RIGHT NOW ARRANGING FOR YOUR RELEASE . [ Groans ] WHAT ? CHARGES AGAINST YOU ARE BEING DROPPED . YOU 'RE NO LONGER A SUSPECT IN THIS CASE . HOW CAN THEY DO THAT ? I CONFESSED . A CONFESSION IS WORTHLESS IF IT 'S A LIE , AND YOURS WAS A LIE . [ Sighs ] WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN TELLING THEM ? JUST THAT YOU 'RE INNOCENT , WHICH IS SOMETHING THEY WOULD 'VE FOUND OUT ON THEIR OWN ANYWAY . THE LOCKER YOU SENT US TO ? IT HAD PRINTS ON IT , BUT THEY WEREN 'T YOURS . I WAS CAREFUL . SOMEBODY ELSE WASN 'T SO CAREFUL . CHARLES WESLEY GOTTS , AN EX-CON . CONVICTED IN 1970 OF AGGRAVATED ASSAULT . HE WAS PAROLED THREE WEEKS AGO , AND HE 'S BEEN MISSING EVER SINCE . NEVER HEARD OF HIM . I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT , MARTY . P.C.R. TEST CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS HIS BLOOD ON THE GLOVE . THE TEST CONFIRMED SOMETHING ELSE , MARTY . HE 'S YOUR FATHER . THAT WAS THE CONNECTION . HMM . [ Pennock ] OKAY , WE 'RE ALL SET . THAT IS , IF EVERYTHING 'S TAKEN CARE OF ON THIS END . WHAT 'S HE TALKIN ' ABOUT ? DETECTIVE PENNOCK HAS AGREED TO ... NOT PURSUE AIDING AND ABETTING CHARGES IF YOU AGREE TO HELP US- - IF YOU AGREE TO HELP US FIND HIM . WE NEED YOUR HELP , MARTY . YOU CAN END IT NOW . I CAN END THIS . I 'M SURE THAT 'S WHAT YOU 'VE ALWAYS WANTED . I NEVER WANTED TO SPEND MY LIFE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS . I HAD NO CHOICE . HMM . IF I HELP YOU , WILL YOU PROTECT ME UNTIL HE 'S CAUGHT ? I WILL PERSONALLY GUARANTEE YOUR SAFETY . HMM . TAKE ME HOME . [ Man On Police Radio ] MOVING INTO POSITION AT THE BACK EXIT . - ALL RIGHT . STAND BY . - COPY THAT . JUST IN TIME FOR THE SURPRISE PARTY . SHE TOLD YOU HE 'D BE IN THERE ? YEAH . SHE DESCRIBED THIS PLACE PERFECTLY , RIGHT DOWN TO THE MATCHBOOKS . WHAT MADE HER DECIDE TO COOPERATE ? SHE WANTS TO STOP HIM . ALL OF A SUDDEN ? WHY DIDN 'T SHE TELL US HIS NAME BEFORE NOW ? SHE DIDN 'T KNOW HIS NAME . THEY NEVER MET . HE 'S BEEN IN PRISON HER ENTIRE LIFE . YET ACCORDING TO YOU , SHE 'S BEEN SEEING THROUGH HIS EYES THE WHOLE TIME . I DON 'T THINK SHE WAS SURE EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS SEEING . IT WAS MORE LIKE A CONSTANT IMAGE IN HER MIND SHE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH OVER TIME- - UP UNTIL THREE WEEKS AGO . WHEN THE MURDERS STARTED . HE WAS PAROLED AND EVERYTHING CHANGED . WELL , IF ALL THIS IS TRUE , LET 'S GO GET HIM . MULDER ? EVERYTHING 'S CHANGED FOR HER , SCULLY . I DON 'T THINK WE 'RE GONNA FIND HIM IN THERE . NEED SOME HELP OVER THERE ? NO . SHOULDA KNOWN . NOW , YOU KNOW , YOU DON 'T HAVE TO PACK EVERYTHING YOU OWN . I PROMISE YOU , YOU 'RE NOT GONNA BE IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY THAT LONG . IT 'S TOO LATE FOR THAT ANYWAY . WHY 'S THAT ? GOTTS IS ALREADY HERE . WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN ' ABOUT ? HE 'S BEEN KEEPING TABS ON YOU FOR ABOUT A DAY . NOW HE KNOWS WHERE I LIVE . HE 'S READING THE NAMES ON THE MAILBOXES RIGHT NOW . WHAT ? HOW COULD YOU- - [ Grunts ] HOW DID YOU KNOW HE WOULDN 'T BE IN THERE ? SHE MISDIRECTED US ON PURPOSE . SHE 'S STILL PROTECTING HIM ? NO , SHE 'S NOT . SHE NEVER WAS . PENNOCK 'S NOT PICKING UP . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? IT 'S NOT HIM SHE 'S BEEN PROTECTING . IF HE GOES BACK TO PRISON , SO DOES SHE . UNTIL NOW , SHE 'S NEVER HAD A CHOICE . [ Clicks ] [ Whispers ] I HATE THE WAY YOU SEE ME . MULDER . SHE DID THIS ONE . TRUST ME . NOT MUCH TO LOOK AT , IS IT ? AT LEAST , THAT 'S WHAT THEY TELL ME . YOU WERE AT THE SENTENCING , AGENT MULDER . IS IT MY COLOGNE ? NO , I JUST KNEW YOU 'D BE THERE . MARTY , LET ME SPEAK TO THE JUDGE ON YOUR BEHALF . NO . WE FOUND WHERE HE 'D BEEN STAYING . IT 'S A MOTEL NOT FAR FROM WHERE PACO ORDONEZ HAD BEEN MURDERED . AND BEFORE THAT , ATLANTIC CITY . HMM . I 'D NEVER SEEN THE OCEAN BEFORE . AND NOW , WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES , OR EVEN WHEN I OPEN THEM , THAT 'S ALL I SEE . YOU 'RE LUCKY HE WASN 'T A FAN OF THE ICE CAPADES . [ Chuckles ] [ Man On P.A. ] LIGHTS OUT . [ Child ] I MADE THIS !

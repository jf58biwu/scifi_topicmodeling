 CHRISTMAS EVE SOMEWHERE IN MARYLAND - I almost gave up on you . - Sorry . Checkout lines were worse than rush hour on the 95 . If I heard " Silent Night " one more time I was going to start taking hostages . - What are we doing here ? - Stakeout . - On Christmas Eve ? - It 's an important date . - No kidding . - Important to why we 're here . Why don 't you turn off your car and I 'll fill you in on the details . Mulder , I 've got wrapping to do . It 's the night before Christmas . Let 's hear it . Give me the details . Look , if you 've got Christmas stuff to do I don 't want to ... you know ... Mulder , I drove all the way out here . I might as well know why . Right ? I just thought you 'd be more ... curious . - Who lives in the house ? - No one . - Then who are we staking out ? - The former occupants . - They 've come back ? - That 's the story . I see . The dark , gothic manor the , uh , omnipresent low fog hugging the thicket of overgrowth . Wait- - is that a hound I hear baying out on the moors ? No . Actually that was a left cheek sneak . Mulder , tell me you didn 't call me out here on Christmas Eve to go ghost busting with you . - Technically speaking they 're called apparitions . - Mulder , call it what you want . I 've got holiday cheer to spread . I 've got a family roll call under the tree at 6 : 00 a.m. I 'll make it fast . I 'll just give you the details . - Okay . - Christmas , 1917 . It was a time of dark , dark despair . American soldiers were dying at an ungodly rate in a war-torn Europe while at home , a deadly strain of the flu virus attacked young and old alike . Tragedy was a visitor on every doorstep while a creeping hopelessness set in with every man , woman and child . It was a time of dark , dark despair . You said that . But here at 1501 Larkspur Lane for a pair of star-crossed lovers tragedy came not from war or pestilence , not by the boot heel or the bombardier , but by their own innocent hand . - Go on . - His name was Maurice . He was a a brooding but heroic young man beloved of Lyda , a sublime beauty with a light that seemed to follow her wherever she went . They were likened to two angels descended from heaven whom the gods could not protect from the horrors being visited upon this cold , grey earth . And what happened to them ? Driven by a tragic fear of separation they forged a lovers ' pact so that they might spend eternity together ... - ... and not spend one precious Christmas apart . - They killed themselves ? And their ghosts haunt this house every Christmas Eve . I just gave myself chills . It 's a good story , Mulder ... And very well told but I don 't believe it . You don 't believe in ghosts ? - That surprises you ? - Well ... Yeah . I thought everybody believed in ghosts . Mulder , if it were any other night I might let you talk me into it but the halls are decked and I got to go . - My best to the family . - What are you doing ? - Mulder , don 't you have somewhere to be ? - I 'm just going to take a look . I 'm not going to do it . My New Year 's resolution . Mulder ! - Change your mind ? - Did you take my car keys ? No . - Come on , Mulder . Don 't kid around . - Why would I take your car keys ? Maybe you , uh ... - Maybe you grabbed them by mistake . - Maybe it was a ghost . - Cold wind . - There must be a window open upstairs . You know , the weather report said that there was an 80 percent chance of rain maybe even a maybe even a white Christmas . I think the spirits are among us . Mulder , will you quit trying to scare me and help me get these doors open . Sounds like there 's somebody walking around upstairs . There . You hear that ? - Mulder , I really have to go . - There 's nothing to be afraid of . - I 'm not afraid , okay ? - Ghosts are benevolent entities . Mostly . You are not scaring me , Mulder . Look , I really have to get home . Mulder ... What was that ? These are tricks that the mind plays . They are ingrained cliches from a thousand different horror films . When we hear a sound , we get a chill . We-we see a shadow and we allow ourselves to imagine something that an otherwise rational person would discount out of hand . The whole ... Mulder ... ? The whole idea of a benevolent entity fits perfectly with what I 'm saying . That a spirit would materialize or return for no other purpose than to show itself is silly and ridiculous . I mean , what it really shows is how silly and ridiculous we have become in believing such things . I mean , that we can ignore all natural laws about the corporeal body that-that we witness these spirits clad in-in their own shabby outfits with the same old haircuts and hairstyles never aging , never ... never in search of more comfortable surroundings , it actually ends up saying more about the living than it does about the dead . I mean , Mulder , it doesn 't take an advanced degree in psychology to understand the the unconscious yearnings that these imaginings satisfy . You know , the-the longing for immortality the hope that there is something beyond this mortal coil , that-that we might never be long without our loved ones . I mean , these are powerful , powerful desires . I mean , they 're the very essence of what make us human . The very essence of Christmas , actually . Tell me you 're not afraid . All right . I 'm afraid but it 's an irrational fear . - I got your back . - Thank you . Mulder , did it occur to you that there aren 't ghosts here but that somebody actually might be living in this house ? No one lives here . But when you and I were sitting out in the car there was not a light on . And look at this . Must have been some kind of electrical surge . Mulder , did you happen to notice the clock downstairs is keeping perfect time ? Is it ? And how do you explain that ? This fire has just gone out . Yeah . Don 't look so disappointed . Why would anyone want to live in a cursed house ? Mulder , it 's not enough that it 's haunted ? It has to be cursed ? Every couple that 's ever lived here has met a tragic end . Three double murders in the last 80 years . All on Christmas Eve . Whoa ... There 's that sound again . Mulder ? - That 's not funny ! - I think there 's a hiding space under the floorboards . What are you going to do ? There may be somebody trapped under there . I got to get them out . - Mulder , don 't . Not now . - Hey , you have a gun , right ? Rationally , you 've been in much more dangerous situations . I was half right . Oh , my God . Hey , Scully ... Look at this . It 's a woman . - Mulder , it looks like they were shot to death . - Yeah . You know what 's weird ? What ? Mulder , she 's wearing my outfit . How embarrassing . Yeah , well , you know what ? He 's wearing yours . Oh ... Scully ... That 's us . Hey , Scully ... This is the same room . All right . I 'm beginning to ... Get this . You go through that door and I ... - I should come out ... This door . - Right . - Mulder ! - Scully ! Scully ! Hey , Scully . Scully , can you hear me ? Hey ! Who are you ? That 's a question I should be asking being this is my house you 're standing in . This isn 't one of those home invasions , is it ? - No . - Good . Would you like me to show you the door ? That 's very funny . - I wasn 't making a joke . - Have you looked at the door ? - Uh-huh , I 'm looking at it now . - Tell me what you see . I see a door with the lock shot off it . You going to pay for that ? That 's a door with a brick wall behind it . Okay , sure . You 're playing tricks on me . If I am , I 'm sorry but I don 't know any tricks . Yeah ? That 's a trick in itself , isn 't it ? You 've been playing tricks on us since we got here . Am I to take it we 're not alone ? Ah , that 's very funny coming from a ghost . Yeah , oh ... the gun fooled me a little at first . You 're a ghost hunter , huh ? And you think I 'm a ghost , huh ? I 've seen a lot of strange folks coming around here with a lot of strange equipment but I think you must be the first I 've seen come armed . Strange folks ? Like those folks under the floorboard . - How did you do that ? - I didn 't do anything . There were corpses here , bodies buried under the floorboards . Why don 't you have a seat , son . - You drink ? Take drugs ? - No . - Get high ? - No . Are you overcome by the impulse to make everyone believe you ? I 'm in the field of mental health . I specialize in disorders and manias related to pathological behavior as it pertains to the paranormal . Wow . I didn 't know such a thing existed . My specialty is in what I call soul prospectors . A crossaxial classification I 've codified by extensive interaction with visitors like yourself . I 've found you all tend to fall into pretty much the same category . - And what category is that ? - Narcissistic , overzealous , self-righteous egomaniac . - That 's a category ? - You kindly think of yourself as single-minded but you 're prone to obsessive compulsiveness workaholism , antisocialism ... Fertile fields for the descent into total wacko breakdown . I don 't think that pegs me exactly . Oh , really ? Waving a gun around my house ? Huh ? Raving like a lunatic about some imaginary brick wall ? You 've probably convinced yourself you 've seen aliens . You know why you think you see the things you do ? Because I have seen them ? 'Cause you 're a lonely man . A lonely man chasing paramasturbatory illusions that you believe will give your life meaning and significance and which your pathetic social maladjustment makes impossible for you to find elsewhere . You probably consider yourself passionate , serious , misunderstood . Am I right ? " Paramasturbatory " ? Most people would rather stick their fingers in a wall socket than spend a minute with you . - All right , now just , uh ... Just back off for a second . - Spend every Christmas this way ... Alone ? I 'm not alone . - More self-delusion . - No , I came here with my partner . - She 's somewhere in the house . - Behind a brick wall ? How 'd you get her to come with you ? Steal her car keys ? You know why you do it . Listen endlessly to her droning rationalizations . 'Cause you 're afraid . Afraid of the loneliness . Am I right ? I 'd just like to find my partner . Good ... Easy . Piece of cake . Brick wall ... Or brick wall ? Go ahead , change your life . Mulder ? - No , no , please , I won 't hurt you . - I 'm a federal agent ! I 'm armed . - You 're what ? - I 'm armed . - You said ... - I 'm armed . - You 're a federal agent ? - Please , I 'm a little on edge . Don 't come any closer . My name is Special Agent Dana Scully . And , uh , I can ... I can show you my I.D. My goodness , I ... I thought you were a ghost . I can assure you that I 'm not . I , uh , I got stuck in this room looking for my partner . Oh , the gangly fellow with the distinguished profile . - You 've seen him ? - With you in the foyer . I thought he was a ghost , too . - That was you . - I sleepwalk sometimes . I thought maybe I 'd dreamed it . - But then here you were again . - I am sorry ... I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to scare you . I , uh ... It 's just that we found bodies . - Bodies ... Where ? - Right ... You look like you saw a ghost . There are ghosts in this house , you know . Who are you ? I live here , thank you very much . Where 's my partner ? - Why are you pointing that gun ? - There were corpses right there underneath the floor ! I think maybe the ghosts have been playing tricks on you . I don 't believe in ghosts . Then what are you doing here ? It 's my partner . - He believes in ghosts ? - Yeah . Oh , you poor child . You must have an awful small life . Spending your Christmas Eve with him ... Running around chasing things you don 't even believe in . Don 't come any closer . I can see it in your face ... The fear ... The conflicted yearnings ... A subconscious desire to find fulfillment through another . - Intimacy through co-dependency . - What ? Maybe you repress the truth about why you 're really here pretending it 's out of duty or loyalty , unable to admit your dirty little secret . Your only joy in life is proving him wrong . You don 't know me . And you don 't live here . - This isn 't your house . - You wouldn 't think so , the way I 'm being treated . - Well , then why is all the furniture covered ? - We 're having the house painted . - Well then where 's your Christmas tree ? ! - We 're Jewish . Boo . Hold it right there . Don 't make me shoot you . Stay where you are . We really attract them , don 't we ? - Where 's Mulder ? - Mulder ? Is that his name ? - Where is he ? - He 'll be along . Move over there . Both of you , move . Move over there . Move over there ! This violates our civil rights . I have friends at the ACLU . Put your hands up . You see what we 've resorted to ? Gimmicks and cheap tricks . We used to be so good at this . We used to have years to drive them mad . Now we get one night . This pop psychology approach is crap . All it does is annoy them . When 's the last time we actually haunted anyone ? When was the last time we had a good double murder ? Not since the house was condemned . This is embarrassing ... amateur kid stuff . Look , if we let our reputations slip they 're going to take us off the tourist literature . Last year no one even showed up . Of all days , why did you pick Christmas ? Why not Halloween ? Now , who is filled with hopelessness and futility on Halloween ? Christmas comes but once a year . You 're right . These two do seem pretty miserable . We need to show them just how lonely Christmas can be . Now that 's the old Yuletide spirit . - Are you Agent Mulder ? - Who are you , now ? - What are you doing using my chair for a ladder ? - I 'm trying to get out of this room . - Trying to get out ? - Excuse me . No , no . You can 't get out that way . - Masher . - Frump . I don 't know who you 're calling a frump but I don 't appreciate that . Being manhandled , or called names . Certainly not at this hour . You 're a ghost . Oh , more names ! - What happened to the star-crossed lovers ? - Oh , let me tell you the romance is the first thing to go . It 's you . You 're Lyda , and that was Maurice . But you 've aged . I hope your partner finds you a lot more charming than I do . Let 's see where is it . There it is . I was young and beautiful once , just like your partner . Look at us . Maurice was so handsome . He didn 't have a gut . I hope you 're not expecting any great advantages to all this . To all what ? I 'm assuming you came here with similar misconceptions . We came here looking for you . Oh , yeah ? You didn 't come here to be together for eternity ? No . Because you 're filled with despair and woeful Christmas melancholy ? Why ? - Maybe it was your partner then . - What about her ? - You knew this house was haunted . - Yeah . Maybe you two should have discussed your real feelings before you came out here . I 'm speaking from experience . - What experience ? - I 'm not going to get into semantics . - A murder-suicide is all about trust . - I thought you had a lovers ' pact . Poetic illusions aside , the outcome , Mulder , is pretty much the same . - I don 't show my hole to just anyone . - Why are you showing it to me ? It isn 't like you 're going to be eating any Christmas ham , is it ? Oh , you 're trying to tell me that Scully 's going to shoot me . Scully is not going to shoot me . Suit yourself , but if you shoot first , for her , the rest is an act of faith . - I wouldn 't shoot her . - Maybe she shoots herself . I wouldn 't let her . The bodies under the floor ... Maybe that was just some kind of Jungian symbolism . Or maybe ... there 's a secret lovers ' pact . We 're not lovers . And this isn 't a pure science . But you 're both so attractive and there 'll be a lot of time to work that out . Go ahead , take it . Take it . Think of it as the last Christmas you 'll ever spend alone . I locked it . - For your protection . - Stay away from me . Look , I want you to get me out of here . I am quite capable of pulling this trigger . I 'm glad to hear it . You may well have to defend yourself against that crazy partner of yours . What have you done with him ? ! Kept him safe from his own mad devices , at least for now . Do you have any idea why he brought you here to this house ? Look , all I know is this is just some bad dream . This is all in my head . Yet here you are waving a gun at me like your partner . Scully ! Do you realize how seriously disturbed that man is ? How dark and lonely ? - What he 's capable of ? - Scully ? ! - Mulder ! - Want your car keys ? Where did you get those ? He 's got nowhere to go this Christmas . No one to go with . Did he happen to mention a story about a lovers ' pact ? Where did you get those keys ? The man is acting out an unconscious yearning . The deep-seated terror of being alone . - Scully ... Scully , are you there ? ! - I 'm here , Mulder ! Open the door , Scully ! Open the door . I 've seen it happen too many times in this house . I don 't believe you . Just open the door . - But ... - Open the door ! - Where 's Scully ? - Mulder ? Mulder , what are you doing ? Mulder ! There 's no getting out of here , Scully . There 's no way home . Mulder , come on ... Mulder , don 't come any closer . You 're scaring me . Put the gun down ! - You going to shoot me ? ! - I 'm not going to shoot you ! - I don 't want to shoot you ! - It 's me or you ... You or me . - One of us has to do it . - Mulder , look ... We don 't have to do this . - Oh , yes , we do . - We can get out of here . Even if we could what 's waiting for us ? More loneliness ! And then 365 more shopping days till even more loneliness ! I don 't believe what you 're saying ! Mulder , I don 't believe a word of it . Merry Christmas , Scully . And a happy New Year . Let me go ! - Let me go ! - Mulder ! Let me go ... Let me go ... Let me go ! Scully ! Scully ? Mulder ... Is that you ? - What did you do ? - I didn 't believe it , Mulder . You didn 't believe what ? I didn 't believe that you 'd do it ... That I would ... Merry Christmas , Mulder . What are you doing ? Scully ? Scully ... Ah ... I 'm not going to make it . No , you 're not ... Not without me , you 're not . Are you afraid , Mulder ? I am . I am , too . You should have thought of this . - You should have . - You shot me first ! I didn 't shoot you . You shot me . Scully ... What ? Get up . - I can 't . - Get up ... You 're not shot . What ? Come on . It 's a trick . It 's all in your head . You hear that ? It 's Christmas . One for the books . We almost had those two , didn 't we ? Almost had them . - Two such lonely souls . - We can 't let our failures haunt us . You wonder what they were really out here looking for . Hard to say . People now ... This is just another joyless day of the year . - Not for us . - No . We haven 't forgotten the meaning of Christmas . I don 't deserve to be so happy . I can 't help it . I just can 't help it . Scrooge was better than his word . He became as good a friend , as good a master and as good a man as the good old city ever knew or any other good old city , town or borough in the good old world . And to Tiny Tim ... I , uh ... I couldn 't sleep . I was , um ... - Can I come in ? - Yeah . Aren 't you supposed to be opening Christmas gifts with your family ? Mulder ... None of that really happened out there tonight ... That was all in our heads , right ? I-it must have been . Not that , uh , my only joy in life is proving you wrong . When have you proven me wrong ? Well ... Why else would you want me out there with you ? You didn 't want to be there ? Oh , that 's , um ... That 's self-righteous and ... - Narcissistic of me to say , isn 't it ? - No , I mean ... Maybe I did want to be out there with you . Now , um ... I know we said that we weren 't going to exchange gifts but , uh ... I got you ... a little something . Mulder ... Merry Christmas . Well , I got you a little something , too .

 And that 's the traffic report for this beautiful Tuesday morning ... Every morning . You couldn 't let me sleep in just one morning ? All right , what do you got for me ? Surprise me . Whoa ! Hey ! Hey , stop the bus ! Hey ! Hey , stop the bus , huh ? ! Hey ! What 's the matter with you , son ? A kid ... a stowaway ... the luggage ... suffocating ... I need a verb . Open your luggage compartment , yeah ? ! Satisfied ? Yeah . Just a second . Kevin , you ... Would you wait just a second , please ? Listen , pal , I 've got a busload of folks anxious to get to Dallas . You know many Texans ? You don 't want to make ' em mad . Just ask ' em to wait a minute . Just ... please , one minute . Kevin , you in here ? It 'll just be a minute . Look , Kevin , I know you 're in here , so come on out , huh ? Look out ! Hey ! Grab him ! Nice work , MacGyver ! What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * * You like the Cubs , huh ? Me , I like the White Sox . Of course , Cubs , they got the better stadium . It 's really good talking to you , kid . You 're pretty proud of yourself , huh ? What ? Big hero - saved the dumb kid from suffocating in a bus . Probably give you a medal . I doubt they 'll give me a medal . Sure , a big medal . A picture of you in the newspaper . Probably even get on TV . Let me ask you something , kid . What 's your problem ? What do you want from me ? You know , a " thank you " might be nice . Quit staring . What ? I 'm bald . Are you happy now ? It looks ridiculous . Look , kid , I-I wasn 't staring . I ... Do me a favor . Next time you want to be a hero , don 't . Hey , look ... Kevin ! So , what 's up , buddy ? You run away , and then I get this call to come down here ? Are you okay ? I 'm fine . Uh , Ms. Miller ? Gary Hobson . I 'm the one that phoned . Did he get hurt ? No , no . He 's fine . Stubborn kid . Yeah . He 's ... Miss Miller , this is none of my business . I ... It 's leukemia . They found it about three months ago . The doctors say he 's got a chance with this new chemotherapy , but Kevin won 't take it anymore . I dragged him back to the hospital this morning to try again . I turned my back , he ran away . I 'm sorry . I don 't usually spill my guts to strangers . No , no , it 's fine . Thanks . Thanks for calling . Ms. Miller ? If you wanted to , I mean , I could talk to him . What makes you think he 'd listen to you ? We 're going home , Kev . Oh , Ms. Miller ! Hey . Gar , look , I 've been thinking . It 's time we started advertising this place . Side of the road , billboards , taxi cabs , you name it . We gotta start doing it . You know , if we have to , we take a girl , put her on the el , have her pass out menus . We 'll dress her as the Lucky Charms guy or something like that . Reservations are down and expenses are up , pal . Hey , listen , I 've been having this problem lately . I 've keep getting these phone calls from Cindy Crawford . She 's begging me to have her baby . But I say , " Cindy , you 're not my type . You 're too big for me . " But she won 't listen . She calls me and bothers me . What do you think ? Put it on the menu . Gar , I know we have this arrangement where I run the place and you 're the silent partner , but you can 't be totally silent . Can you sign this for me ? What is that ? Accounts payable receipts . What 's with you ? The guy saved a kid 's life . You 'd think he 'd be a little cheerier . So , what 's the problem ? I got a picture of a kid here who 's got leukemia . And he won 't take his chemotherapy . Without his chemotherapy , he 's got one year to live , the doctor said . Well , I think that might be out of your jurisdiction , Gary . I mean , if he won 't listen to his doctors , then what can you do ? I love this woman . Hey ! Get out ! Health hazard . Look at that . She 's everywhere . Who ? Jenny Sloane . Chicago 's sweetheart . ... signing up voters and making friends . ... spreading good cheer . We 'll bring you live to the store where Jenny bought a gown for tonight 's Governor 's Ball . Sure , I gave her the dress for free . She 's only got a few weeks left to live . See that ? Chicago 's got a million sick people . Howard Banner decides to write one column about you , suddenly you 're a celebrity . I heard it was a pretty good column . Oh , yeah , Banner , he 's top notch . He 's right up there with Royko . The guy was nominated for a Pulitzer when he was 18 . Oh , hey , listen guys , I got some stuff to finish up in the office , and then I 'm off to class . So I 'll see you later , okay ? Yeah . Here you go , buddy . Is that the bowl laced with cyanide ? Yeah . Hey , what do you know about her ? Who ? Jenny Sloane . Ah , I don 't know . I guess , you know , just what I read in the columns . You read it . Don 't , don 't do that ! You know , " Don 't Cry For Jenny Sloane " . You read the column , didn 't you ? Hell , you probably read it a day early . I 'm wondering if she can help . Help with what ? Kevin . Who 's Kevin ? The kid from today with leukemia . I 'm wondering if she meets up with this kid that maybe she can convince him to go back on his chemotherapy . Oh , no , no , no . That 's for dinner . Order some more tomatoes . How do you suppose you get in touch with someone like that ? I don 't know . Call Banner . He 's the guy that made her famous . Go to the newspaper . Excuse me . Howard Banner ? Wait , wait . Yeah . Please . All right , tell me what you think . " The gowns were certainly beautiful , " the band was spectacular . " The truth is , it just doesn 't matter , " because years from now , the only thing anyone will remember " about this year 's Governor 's Ball is Jenny Sloane 's benevolent bravery . " So ? That 's good . How is it you 're writing about the Governor 's Ball ? It doesn 't occur until tonight . Oh , come on . You think I don 't know what 's gonna happen ? The best and the brightest are gonna outdo each other toasting Jenny 's benevolent bravery . Jenny will smile , tears will flow - there won 't be any surprises . Maybe you should try , uh , " quiet courage " as-as opposed to " benevolent bravery " . Quiet courage . That 's not bad . What you got for me ? How 's that ? Your story . Your anecdote . Your idea for my column . Actually , I wanted to meet Jenny Sloane . Well , who doesn 't ? Take a number . Get in line . Well , you see , I know this little boy , and he 's very sick - Kevin . And he 's taken himself off of his chemotherapy . See that ? I knew you had a story . Well , I thought that if Jenny Sloane could talk to this boy , that it would ... This boy , how old is he ? He 's 11 years old . Oh , so young . So , you can get me in touch with Miss Sloane ? Nope . I wish I could . You will not believe how many people come to me looking for an introduction to Jenny Sloane , and I would love to help them all , and I know that Jenny would , too . But the truth of the matter is her plate is full . And you realize , she doesn 't have much time left . How ' bout a phone call ? Jenny asked me not to give out her number . Between her charity work and her public appearances , she doesn 't have the energy she used to have . You understand . Thank you very much . This is a bad idea . Hey , look , it cost 500 bucks to get into this thing . You got that kind of money burning a hole in your pocket ? I don 't even have pockets . Where did you get these things , anyway ? This guy I know . He made a fortune in used formal wear . This isn 't gonna work . This is ridiculous . Will you relax ? ! Trust the tux , okay ? Don 't worry . I got this thing wired . Come on . I invite you to join me in raising your glass in honor of a woman who 's very name has become synonymous with all that is brave , courageous and good about the human race : Jenny Sloane . Hear , hear ! Jenny , I want you to know that the inspiration you 've given us will last forever . Thank you . Um , I 'm not feeling very well . Just tell them that I 'm honored . Jenny 's not feeling up to speaking tonight . You understand . But she did want to thank you all for coming , and she says she feels honored ... What 'd I tell you ? Piece of cake . Well , Jenny , I think I speak for everyone here when I say you honor us . Now , please , everybody enjoy your evening . Hey , uh , numb nuts , table two , that way . Oh , I 'm sorry . I know it 's complicated . Table two - it comes after table one , but before table three . You 'll catch on . Trust me . Okay . * * Nice speaking with you . Okay , you , too . Keep on smiling , dear . We 're praying for you . Thank you . Excuse me . Oh . Miss Sloane ? Yes . My name 's Gary Hobson . Uh , you-you don 't know me , but I know a little boy that could use your help . His name 's Kevin Miller . Uh , excuse me . And I-I thought that if you could just talk to him , that maybe he 'd go back on the chemo . I don 't know . You see , the chemo is his last shot . Where is he ? At the North Glen Hospital . I know where that is . Um , I 'll try to come by tomorrow . Jenny . Feeling all right ? Yes . Um , Howard , this is Gary . Hobson . We 've met . Well , what a ... Surprise . Jenny , you 're looking kind of tired . It 's been a long day . We should get you home . Well , it was a pleasure to meet you . It was a pleasure to meet you . Thank you very much . Okay . Mm-hmm . This is hard work . Well ? Well what ? Did you tell Banner about our restaurant ? No , I didn 't . Gare , three million people read his column every day . Three million hungry people . You saw what he did for that girl . Think about what he could do for us . On the count of three , we go . One , two ... So what do I do about him ? Who 's this ? Oh , that sick kid . Well , I told this guy I 'd go visit the kid in the hospital . Now , why did you do that ? Come on , look at him . So what am I supposed to do ? Same thing you do with all these requests . You know the routine . You send a nice letter , maybe some flowers , along with your apologies ; you 're not feeling up to it . Well , I just thought maybe this one time ... Jenny , come on . We don 't do hospitals , remember ? Hey , I 'll buy you some dessert . You 'll feel better . Mm-hmm . Mom , can we go already ? Just a minute . I don 't think she 's coming . I talked to her . She 'll be here . I don 't care who 's coming to visit . They 're not sticking any more needles in me . Thanks for trying . I want to go home . Hey , listen , Kevin ... Hey , I bet you 're Kevin . Who wants to know ? Hey . You 're the lady on TV , the one who 's ... Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can just call me Jenny . What are you doing here ? Well , I , uh , I came to see you . Well , I thought that you might want to meet someone who 's going through the same thing you are . Well , I don 't . What 'd you tell her about me ? I know that you don 't want to take any more chemotherapy . What 'd you do , take out a billboard ? ! Kev ... You don 't think this has been embarrassing enough without the whole world knowing ? You know what it 's like to wake up every morning sick to your stomach ? Sure . Yeah . You know , I remember there was one really bad week . I was so sick . Ooh , it was coming out my ears . Hey , can I see ? Why ? You want to try and make me feel better about it ? Oh , I wouldn 't dream of it . You 're not gonna be one of those people that tells me I look like Michael Jordan , are you ? Michael who ? Oh , come on , let 's see . Oh , my gosh ! Oh , oh , you 're right . That is - it 's horrible ! What ? Oh , your head ! Cover that thing up before we all get sick . I 'm sorry , I 've never seen someone so bald ! I mean , it 's - just the glare alone is enough to blind a person . Hey , does the airport know about you ? 'Cause they could use your head to signal incoming jets ! So ... you a Cubs fan ? Get real . Huh . White Sox ? Everybody asks me that . For the record , I hate baseball . Oh . Basketball ? Boring . Football ? Well , I used to like the Cleveland Browns , but do you know how hard it is to get one of those hats ? Is that a challenge ? Hey , big shot . What are you doing , working on your Pulitzer speech ? Hey , give me a break . My column 's in . Yeah , just thought you might want to know , your friend Jenny Sloane 's down at the hospital entertaining the sick kids . What ? Don 't worry . You can read all about it in the Trib tomorrow . Mrs. Miller , he 's asking for you . Thanks . Mm-hmm . Jenny ! Jenny Sloane ! What are you doing at the hospital today , Jenny ? Are you undergoing treatment ? No , I 'm just visiting a friend . We need this hallway clear , people . You 're going to have to wait in the lobby . Oh . Sorry . Oh . How 'd it go in there ? Um , well , I 'm coming back tomorrow , but , you know , I 'm not really sure I did anything . Ms. Sloane , you know , I ... I don 't think you realize how much good you did in there . You really think so ? I do , and so does his mother . Jenny . What 's going on here ? Howard . Oh , my gosh . Do you remember that sick kid I told you about ? The one in the picture ? I hear you 're in the hospital , I get worried . Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine , Howard . But listen , this kid , you should have seen the look on his face when I was talking to him . I think I might have convinced him to go back on his chemo . Uh-huh . That 's wonderful . I got a cab waiting downstairs . Jenny , I think we should get you home now . Mr. Hobson ? Dr. Henderson . Good to meet you , Doc . Uh , Jenny , this is Dr. Henderson . He 's chief of oncology here at the hospital . Jenny , it 's an honor meeting you . I 'm sorry to hear about your illness . I 've been following your case . Howard Banner . Nice to meet you , Doctor . Jenny , the cab . Wait a second . Go ahead , Doc . We 've run some phase four drug trials here at the hospital . There 's a good chance you might qualify . What I 'd like to do is set up an appointment for you , run some tests . Thanks , but , um ... we 're not interested . Maybe you didn 't understand . Please listen to me , Doctor . Jenny 's suffered enough , all right ? She 's been poked and prodded with more needles than you and I can ever imagine . So the answer 's no . Maybe you should let Jenny answer for herself . Fine . Jenny ? I 'm sorry . No more tests . If you change your mind , feel free to call . I don 't understand . So are we ready to go ? Um , actually , I 'm-I 'm gonna stay here . Excuse me ? Well , there are some more kids here - patients , and-and I want to talk to them . Jenny , it 's not a good idea . Please let go . I 'm just thinking about you , Jenny . Oh ! I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to scare you . Of course not . That 's why you 're sitting there in the dark . What ? What 's that ? It 's my way of saying I 'm sorry . I was out of line earlier . Open it . Oh , Howard ! And do you know what they will look particularly good with ? Bathing suit ? Well , it 's a radical fashion statement . What am I gonna do with a bathing suit ? You 'll wear it in Hawaii . I 'm not going to Hawaii . Sure you are . First class . It 's one way . Jenny ... it 's over . Already ? I thought we were just getting started . I got you a suite on the water in Maui . You 're gonna love it . Howard ... what if I said that I wanted to stay here ? Wh ... How 's that ? I was thinking , you know , maybe I can really do something here , you know ? Help some people . Come on , kid . Don 't start believing your own press . I 'm flattered . I mean , I wrote those articles , but ... I just thought ... Look , you 're supposed to have a terminal illness . I mean , how long do you plan on hanging around ? Pretty soon people are gonna , gonna know , catch onto this thing . That friend of yours , what 's his name , uh , Hobson ? No , he doesn 't suspect anything . Not yet . But if he keeps bringing doctors in to see you ... Pack your things . You got to check out . We 'll put you in a different hotel , different name . Oh , come on , Jenny , you 're gonna be all right . A couple of weeks in the sun , on the beach ... And then what ? Anything you want . You can see the country . Settle down anywhere . Yeah , anywhere but here . Jenny ... we both got what we wanted out of this . You got some money in your pocket , I got my career back . Oh , did you hear about the award they 're giving me ? Listen . Okay , I 've never been good at anything . But in that hospital today , with that kid - I mean , this is , this is something that I 'm good at . Jenny ... Listen , I promised that kid that I would see him tomorrow . Okay , can 't we just keep it going , just another few days ? We can 't risk it . We 've been lucky . Do you want to see how fast an entire city can turn against you ? You stick around long enough for someone to figure out you 're not dying , it won 't be pretty . They 'll send you back to jail , Jenny . You want that ? Hey , listen to me . I 'm only gonna say this once : Jenny Sloane dies tomorrow . Good morning . Sunny and bright this Wednesday morning . Temperature is rising , traffic at a standstill . All right , don 't get your fur in a knot . Good-bye , Jenny Sloane . " Jenny Sloane commits suicide . " The discovery of a suicide note on the Randolph Street Bridge last night . " " prompted widespread speculation " that Jenny Sloane gave up her battle with cancer and leapt to her death . " Are they sure ? It says police verified the suicide note was in her handwriting . It was her signature . Well , I guess she got tired of fighting . Marissa , I 'll see you later . Hey , Gary , where are you going ? The paper says she jumps sometime around 7 : 00 . I 'm gonna find her . Well , what if you do ? What are you gonna tell her ? I don 't know . No . She checked out . Hey , you don 't by any chance have any idea where she might have gone ? No , I , I have no idea . Sorry . Thank you . Banner , I need to talk to you . You again ? Listen , I need to find Jenny . Come on , why don 't you go bother someone else ? Look , this is very important . I 'm sure it is . Unfortunately , she doesn 't leave her agenda with me . So , if you don 't mind ... I do mind . She 's gonna kill herself . What ? How do you know that ? I just know . No . Uh-uh . Jenny 's not the type . Look , Banner , I don 't have time to argue about this . I 've gotta find her tonight before 7 : 00 . Are you gonna help me , or not ? 7 : 00 ? What happens at 7 : 00 ? She 's gonna jump off the Randolph Street Bridge . The Randolph Street Bridge ? Really ? And you just know this ? Listen , trust me , just for today . Tomorrow you can go back to being annoyed with me . Oh , I trust you . So you can predict the future , what 's not to trust ? Banner , please . I wish I could help you , but I have no idea where she is . For all I know , she could be on a plane to Hawaii right now . So , Kreskin , tell me this : The Cubs gonna win tonight ? Hey , where are you going ? Randolph Street Bridge . I 'm gonna try to stop a girl from killing herself . No , you 're not . Almost 7 : 00 . Lake Street Bridge . It changed . * * " I tried hard to be brave , but please forgive me . " In too much pain . " Thank you for your love and concern . Please keep me in your prayers . " Hey , it 's pretty poetic for a suicide note . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Come on . I was there , Banner . I saw you . Lake Street Bridge , I saw you tape it to the railing . So , you really thought it was poetic , huh ? Don 't ask me how I know this , but I do . You made the whole thing up , so don 't bother denying it . Hey , you 'll have to show me that crystal ball of yours sometime . Who is she ? Some girl . I don 't even remember her name . I found her at the bus station . Look , my editor wanted a face to go along with the Jenny Sloane story . I didn 't have the heart to tell him that there was no Jenny Sloane , so I ... So you grab your camera , and you go down to the bus depot , and you uh , start propositioning good-looking girls ? Well , you make it sound so sleazy . Where is she ? I don 't know . Listen , it saved my career . My stuff wasn 't good enough anymore . You know they were gonna cancel my column before I wrote that Jenny Sloane piece . If my boss found out what I was doing , he 'd eviscerate me and boil me in oil . So you lied to him and the rest of the city . Hey , no harm , no foul . You 're a journalist . You 're supposed to tell the truth , not disgrace it . All right , you want to know what the truth is , kid ? The truth is that people are so desperate for a hero , that they 'll believe anything . Now , are you gonna put this back on the bridge , or am I ? No , I don 't think you get it . It 's over . Oh , really ? You 're gonna go public ? Blow the lid off the whole big Jenny Sloane scandal ? What if I do ? Good luck . Your word against mine . But don 't forget , I 'm an icon , my friend . I am the voice of the people . Well , what do you think about Jenny Sloane 's voice against you , Banner ? Jenny ? Who 's Jenny ? She 's gone - dead . Jumped to her death off the Randolph Street ... no , excuse me , the Lake Street Bridge . There is no Jenny . Well , that 's it . Every Best Western , every Sheraton , every Holiday Inn in the city . Do you want me to check the suburbs ? No . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna go to the hospital . I 'm gonna postpone a suicide . Sooner or later , Banner 's gonna pull it off . I 'm gonna talk to that kid . Good luck . Listen , Kevin , sometimes when people think that there 's no hope left , they uh ... things happen . What are you saying ? Are you trying to upset him ? No , I ... Kevin , I 'm , I 'm , I 'm just trying to prepare you . For what ? Jenny 's not coming back . What ? Why not ? Listen , either you tell me what you know right now , or I 'm getting out of here and never coming back . Look , Kevin ... That 's it . I 'm out of here . Kev . What 's that ? It 's a note from Jenny . Let me see it . Kevin , I need you to promise me something , okay ? I need you to promise me you 'll go back on your chemotherapy . Give me the letter . Do we have a deal ? Fine . What 's it say ? This can 't be . She wouldn 't do this . How long did you know about this ? I just found out , son . She really ... ? I can 't believe it . Listen , Mom , either you call the doctor right now , or I will . I 'm done with this stuff . Kevin , we had a deal . You don 't get it ! Jenny bailed ! But that doesn 't mean you have to . You 've got a real chance here . That 's what Jenny was trying to tell you . The deal 's off . Look , Kevin ... Get out ! I think you should go now . Kevin ... Get ... out . WOMAN Dr. Winston , please dial 562 . Dr. Winston , please dial 562 . You were upstairs ? How much did you hear ? Enough . You saw what you did to that kid , didn 't you ? Look , I never meant to ... So why don 't you go back up there and talk to him ? Oh , and tell him what ? The truth ? No , you can 't do that , can you ? So , how much did Banner tell you ? Everything , except your name . Well , what , did he forget ? Typical . I 'm Lucy . Lucy Gimbel . At least , I think I am . Back home , in Washington , I was - I was boosting wallets . I got six months in the slammer , out in three . I mean , it was minimum security - more like a camp , really - but still , it 's jail , you know , and people look at you differently when you get out . So , I figured it was time for a fresh start . Packed a bag , hopped a bus , here I am , gainfully employed . How much did Banner offer you ? A lot . The money was great . But after a while , I-I wasn 't doing it for the money . I - I liked being Jenny Sloane . I mean , everyone wanted to meet her . TV shows wanted to interview her . I liked the way people looked at me . And I figured why not ? I mean , no one was getting hurt . Oh , no , except that little kid up in the hospital . The kid - right , that was your fault . That was my fault ? Yeah . Well , if I hadn 't listened to you , if I hadn 't let you talk me into going to visit that kid ... Oh , I 'm sorry . My mistake for thinking you 're someone you 're not . Sorry , that 's my fault . Listen , it 's all different now , okay ? I can 't go back there . I can 't face that kid . So now what ? Well , you tell me . Jenny Sloane - back from the dead . Look , we have to talk . About what ? Look , I 'm going back home , and try to put together a life . Look , I 'll send you the money , and the earrings . Good for you . Which reminds me , I need another suicide note . Howard , I-I don 't want Jenny to commit suicide . Sorry , kid . It 's the best payoff for the story . Quick and clean . Oh , come on , you can 't do that . Oh , no ? Who says I can 't ? You ? Hey , you 're a fake , remember ? Do you have any idea the size of this thing ? Tomorrow , at this time , the boats are gonna be dragging the river for your body . The governor is going to declare a state-wide day of mourning . It 's a perfect finish . Look , can 't we just tell the truth ? Are you kidding ? They 'll tear us to pieces . Not if we do it right . People will understand . Oh , you think so ? I guess we don 't know the same people . Besides , what is that kid gonna think if Jenny 's a fake ? And what about your probation ? If you admit to fraud , you could wind up back in jail . Look , Howard , I just , I don 't know what to do , okay ? Okay , okay , okay . Let me see what I can come up with . I 'll figure something out , and I 'll call you in the morning . Promise ? I promise . I don 't believe it . " Chicago 's sweetheart , Jenny Sloane , " whose alleged brain tumor " sparked the sympathy of the city , is a liar and a fraud . " According to allegations presented " by Sun Times columnist Howard Banner " at an awards luncheon yesterday . " ' She faked her illness ' , said Banner " during an impromptu press conference . " Banner apologized for not being more diligent " about checking out Jenny 's background . " ' I guess I just wanted to believe in her . " ' She tricked me , " ' and with my unintended assistance , " she tricked you ' , Banner said . " ' Jenny Sloane betrayed a city that opened its heart to her , " ' and all those kids who were counting on her . Jenny Sloane is responsible for the death of their dreams . ' " What a snake . And to think I used to worship that guy - back when he had morals . Once this hits the streets , this town 's gonna lynch Jenny Sloane . I think that 's what he wants . He 's protecting his job . Where are you going ? I 'm gonna go find Howard Banner . The old one . Jenny ? Jenny ! Sorry . No one here by that name . Lucy , open up the door . It 's important . I 've got something I think you should see . What is this ? It 's Banner 's column . It comes out in tomorrow 's paper . Tomorrow 's ? It 's a proof . He usually writes it a day or two ahead of time . He 's gonna say all these things about me ? In a half an hour . Where ? You got a minute ? Oh , now my day is complete . I love the hat . I thought you were gonna call me . It slipped my mind . Oh , so you 're just gonna blame me for everything ? Jenny , would I do that to you ? It 's not gonna work , Howard . It 's over . Oh , this is all very dramatic . Now , what do you expect me to do , guys ? Roll over and say " you got me ? " Well , the truth is , whatever I go out there and say it is . I say " Jenny Sloane is a liar " , people believe me . Now , it 's sad , it 's not fair , hell , it 's pathetic . But that 's the way it is . Well , maybe you 're right . Or maybe people will surprise you . You want to find out ? No . Look , think about what you 're doing . Don 't go out there and destroy Jenny Sloane for all those people who believed in her . All those kids in the hospital . Don 't worry , kid . I wrote you a beautiful send-off . Beautiful send-off ? What would that be ? " Jenny Sloane Betrays Chicago ? " How does he keep doing that ? Let me ask you something , Banner . When did you become someone else , huh ? What ? " In the name of truth , " a journalist will tarnish heroes . " He 'll destroy myths . That 's his job . " But the journalist " should never forget that he 's also a human being " and therefore has a responsibility to seek " a deeper truth which is this : " Sometimes people need myths . " People need heroes . " You recognize those words ? Oh , yeah . They belong to somebody who had no idea how the world really works . And do you know the difference between this guy and you ? This guy would never let an 11-year-old kid die just to save his own tail . Hey , Banner . Do you remember what you told me ? You 're the voice of the people ? Don 't forget that . We 'll get you on a bus and get you as far away from Chicago as we can . Jenny ? I want to hear what he has to say . No , you don 't . Once he starts talking you don 't want to be anywhere near this place . I want to hear . Emcee : It 's been my experience that everyone has a story to tell . It 's why we are human beings . But very few of us tell stories the way this man does . When you read one of his columns , you glimpse the inside of the human heart . And it quickly becomes obvious that he is writing not just because he 's writing about people , he 's writing because he cares . And his gift is that he can inspire that in us . Because of him , many journalists , myself included , became journalists . Chose this career . The award this year goes to Howard Banner . I ... I want to thank you for this award . And I want to tell you why I can 't accept it . You see , there 's a fraud in this room . And his name is Howard Banner . I didn 't earn this award . This award rightfully belongs to Jenny Sloane , who is quite simply the most heroic person I have ever met . All I did was transcribe her story . Jenny couldn 't be here today . She called me last night . Her doctors have told her she has very little time left . So , she 's gone home to spend her last days with her family . But she asked me to read you this statement . " Thank you , people of Chicago , for lending me your hearts . " You made my life worthwhile . " If you think of me at all , " think of me as a reflection of your own " courage and humanity . " Good-bye for now . Love , Jenny . " I 've been struggling to come up with , uh , a final column for the Jenny Sloane series . A big ending that would put the whole thing in perspective . But there will be no final column . This morning I realized that Jenny 's story doesn 't need a big ending because Jenny 's story doesn 't end . Jenny 's memory will live in all the people she touched during her life . Her dreams are our dreams . Her hope is our hope . And finally , I would like to take this opportunity to announce my resignation . Tomorrow will be my last day with the paper . It 's funny , I built my career on writing stories about people who 've lost their way and then found it again . It has been a long career . And I have been luckier than most . But at some point , without even knowing it , I seem to have lost my way myself . And I forgot why I ever got into this racket . Thank you for reminding me . It has been an honor to serve you . It 's easy to be cynical . Especially today , when it looks like all our heroes are crooks . Our role models , frauds . Hello ? Somebody , uh , sent you a Cleveland Browns hat . May I come in ? Okay . Every now and then , however , when you least expect it , the real thing comes along . Someone who can find the heart inside the cynic and give those who hold nothing sacred something to believe in . It 's not always easy , telling the good from the bad , even if you do get tomorrow 's paper today . Why is why . Sometimes to find the answers , you just have to look in your heart .

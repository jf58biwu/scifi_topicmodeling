 [ Whirring ] ( Wade ) Professor ! Ah ! Got you . [ Quinn yelling ] ( Rembrandt ) Look out . Oh ! [ Whooshing ] Man , I scuffed my new boots . Where the devil are we this time ? Hey . What 's that noise ? Are those lights moving ? [ Faint rumbling ] We 're in a subway tunnel ! That 's a train ! ( Rembrandt ) Go ! Move ! Move it ! Go ! ( Wade ) We 're going to make it ! [ Groans ] ( Rembrandt ) Hey , guys ! Rembrandt ! Got to pull . [ Rembrandt groaning ] Please , man . ( Quinn ) Wade , the laces ! They 're knotted ! ( Professor ) Come on . Untie them ! [ Groans ] ( Rembrandt ) Stop ! Get out ! [ Groans ] [ Gasping ] ( female announcer ) Attention , please . This is the daily 10 . ; 00 power blackout for Sector 47 . Service will resume in 30 minutes . Thank you . [ Sighs ] ( Quinn ) What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds , where it 's the same year , and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? [ People chattering ] Wow . Look at that . Gas is $ 410 a gallon . ( Quinn ) At least they pump it for you . ( Professor ) Bit steep for full service . ( Quinn ) But I don 't see cars . ( Wade ) Maybe they banned ' em from downtown . I don 't care what they banned as long as it isn 't food , huh ? Hey , my man . How much for a hot dog with chili and cheese ? ( vendor ) What are you , a comedian ? What 'll it be , green or yellow ? Geomash ? What is that ? What planet are you from ? Uh , sir , do you know where we could get a hot dog ? In the dictionary . You know , it seems like every world we go to , we have trouble with the food . Do you know what would happen if I ate that stuff ? I have a very sensitive digestive tract . ( Wade ) Look , the plate on that Rolls says " Crying Man . " ( Monique ) Rembrandt Brown . Mmm . I can 't believe it . The Crying Man in person . Variety said you were in Europe on tour . Listen , I 've got a little proposition for you . Interested in hearing it ? Well , uh , yeah . Well , either it 's a slow news day or nobody reads on this world . This is the entire paper . " Congress puts horses on the endangered species list . " You know , you 're even more gorgeous in the flesh . That 's , uh , awfully nice of you . Could you wait right here just for a moment ? Hey , guys , this woman is a huge fan of my double and the woman is loaded . Now dig this . She wants to fly me to L.A. In her private jet and buy me lunch at a 5-star restaurant . And of course you said no . Well ... How long till we slide ? 32 hours . Well , I say go for it . Carpe diem , Mr. Brown . [ Chuckling ] All right . Just be back at the dominion before the slide . How very male of you . ( Quinn ) You know , that paper also said this world is running low on natural resources . I wonder why ? Where the devil is San Angeles ? Incredible . San Francisco is just a neighborhood on this world . The city of San Angeles spreads from here to L.A. No wonder they 're running out of stuff . Good heavens , a union of Los Angeles and San Francisco ? It goes against the laws of nature . What about this one ? Yeah , yeah , they were just here asking for a hot dog . That 's them getting on that tram over there . Guys , guys , let 's go . Let 's go ! ( Professor ) What the devil 's going on ? Come on , this way . [ Motor cycle engines revving ] [ Tires screeching ] ( Quinn ) Duck , professor ! Great . This is a dead end . [ Sighs ] [ Guns cocking ] Sliders . Welcome to San Angeles . My God . Max ? ( Logan ) Sorry about the guns . Sometimes , my guards get a little overzealous . ( Quinn ) Yeah , you should talk to them about that . Logan , how exactly did you track our wormhole ? It 's not the wormhole I track , but the objects traveling through it . I developed an 8-dimensional echoing process that resonates whenever a photon trail is created between dimensions . Photons . Of course . Of course . This is incredible . To actually meet people from another dimension . Miss Saint Clair . How is it that you know my name ? Was my double associated with this project ? Actually , he was . I didn 't know him that well . He was kind of a loner . He died 2 nights ago . See , we haven 't perfected sliding yet , and apparently he couldn 't wait . He attempted a slide anyway . He did ? How odd . I guess . Anyway , that 's really all I know . The company is keeping a tight lid on it . This way . So do you run into your doubles on every world you go to ? Not always . ( Wade ) Yeah . And some of the ones we have met , we wish we hadn 't . I can 't believe you 've been sliding from world to world for the past 2 years . Yes , well , we , uh , didn 't really intend it to be that way . I opened the vortex early on another dimension before the timer reached zero . The early access corrupted the program and erased our home coordinates . Logan Saint Clair . It 's a bio-thermal security scanner . It reads a person 's unique body heat pattern . Come on . Quinn Mallory . A far cry from your basement lab , Mr. Mallory . ( Logan ) Prototronics is committed to perfecting sliding . The one to the right is the trail of your wormhole . ( Quinn ) What 's the blue one ? It 's a wormhole from one of my probes . It 's re-entering our dimension now . This is unusual . Most of the time these things land hundreds of miles away . And everything that goes in comes back burned to a crisp . Everything ? Including my double ? You know , Logan , the burning could be a function of incorrect re-entry portal coordinates . And the random return could be a problem with the gyroscope in the spectrum stabilizer . What about our problem ? Can this stuff get us home ? Quinn , if you 'll help me fix this equipment so my probes don 't burn up on re-entry , I 'll let you use the lab to try to get yourself home . You got a deal . ( Rembrandt ) You know , Monique , I 'm kind of at a disadvantage 'cause I don 't know anything about you . There 's not much to know . My father made a fortune inventing the paperless toilet . Paperless toilet ? Well , how exactly would you use a ... [ chuckling ] Never mind . Rembrandt . Would it be too forward if I invited you back to my place for a dip in my hot tub ? That sounds like a plan . All right , I ordered for us . I got them to make your favorite dish . How do you know what my favorite dish is ? I 'm your number one fan . I know everything about you . And this place makes the best frog sweetbreads in San Angeles . Go ahead . [ Chuckles ] Would you excuse me ? I 'll be right back . Hey , Crying Man . Elston Diggs . [ Chuckles ] I 'm a big fan of yours ! Mmm-hmm . Hey , can you do me a favor ? Sign that for me . Yo , thanks , man . This is going to be worth a whole lot of green when you 're dead . Men 's room ? Oh , use the one with paper . It ... it 's $ 5 , but there 's no line . Say , Monique , you sure live dangerous , girl . What are you doing hanging ' out with the Cryin ' Man ? I 'm doing more than hanging with him , Diggs . We 're engaged . You wanted to see me , Adrian ? Security found something on the scanner I thought you should see . Your heat imprint is on the left . Mallory 's is on the right . Oh , my God . He is me . Do you think we 'll get him to solve our problems before he leaves ? I don 't know . He slides tomorrow . Maybe he won 't . You 're his twin , Logan . I 'm sure you can think of some way to keep him here . Quinn , do you know we 're being watched ? We have been ever since we got here . ( Quinn ) So ? Don 't you think a place like this would have tight security ? There is something odd going on here , Quinn . I don 't believe for a moment that my double would slide without first testing it with a probe . Gosh , haven 't we learned by now that our doubles can have different personalities ? All right , look , Logan 's giving us a real shot to get home . Let 's not blow it because of a little paranoia . All I 'm saying is we should exercise caution before sharing our information with people we scarcely know . Quinn , how 's it going ? Oh , good , good . I , uh , I 'm running a dual program with the formulas I 've entered . Your data 's on the left , ours is on the right . When the computer finds our individual re-entry portal time-space coordinates , it 'll automatically lock ' em into place . How long will it take ? Could be minutes , could be weeks . [ Sighs ] What about the random return of my probes ? You using a laser gyro in your spectrum stabilizer ? No , a whispering gallery . Oh . You should take a look at what I 've built . Mmm . I love the simplicity of your design . Um , we 're all a little tired . Why don 't we take a break and come back when we 're clearer headed ? Why don 't you and Wade go back to the dominion ? I 'll meet you there later . All right . Let 's get back to work . Sounds good . Okay , so , uh , basically , we 're just waiting for them to lock . ( Professor ) $ 85 for a 10-block cab ride ? What was all that about an overweight surcharge ? ( Wade ) Professor , listen to this : " 5-minute power blackouts are scheduled every 3 hours . Bathing is limited to 2 minutes whenever water is available . " " And it 's requested that guests shower together to conserve resources . " I 'll wait until the next world . How are you today , Professor ? Uh , very well . Thank you . I see you have a new friend . I beg your pardon ? Well , between me and you , she 's cute . But your other nooner 's more my style . My other nooner ? [ Chuckling ] Yes . Tell me , uh , what was it about my other nooner that , uh , that you found so attractive ? Well , I guess I just like ' em tall , dark and brainy . Uh , but if you don 't mind my saying , I never thought it was a good idea that you two worked together . I 'll put it on your bill , sir . Have a good afternoon . ( Professor ) Miss Wells , it appears my double was having an affair at this very hotel with Logan Saint Clair . Are you serious ? No need to sound so surprised . I may not be your idea of a shower fantasy , but I do have my admirers . I 'm sure you do , Professor , but didn 't Logan say that she barely knew your double ? Yes , she did . Which raises the question : What else has she lied to us about ? Hi , I 'm Mrs. Rembrandt Brown . So nice of you to come to our party . [ Chuckles ] ( Rembrandt ) Monique ! You have anything I can put over these wet swim trunks ? How about me ? Just kidding . Ah , great . Baby , King Kong been sleeping over ? [ Both chuckle ] Don 't you look adorable ? Thank you . I 've got something I 've been saving just for this moment . It 's in my bedroom . [ Chuckles ] Well , lead on , girl . [ Chuckles ] Tell you what . You go to your room , see what I 've done with it . I 'll meet you there . Yes ! [ Chuckling ] My room ? ( Rembrandt ) Oh , man . ( Monique ) Do you like it ? Where did you get all of this stuff ? ( Monique ) Like I said , I 'm your biggest fan . I told you all about it in my letters . Letters ? I sent you over a hundred . But I never got an answer . Except from your attorney . But I 'm not mad anymore ! How could I stay mad at the man I 'm going to marry ? Mmm . Once we narrow your spectrum stabilizer , your probes will always return within a fixed 2-mile radius . The problem is you may have to construct a laser gyro . [ Machine whirring ] That could take a while . What 's that ? We 're about to go back online with full power . We 've got 30 minutes until the next brownout . I 'll use this window to execute a power test . What kind of test ? Well , I 've been trying to amp the size of the vortex so I can send larger payloads through the wormhole . [ Whooshing ] It 's too much ! Dial back ! [ Screams ] [ Grunting ] [ Screams ] ( Quinn ) Dial down ! Dial down ! [ Screaming ] Ugh . [ Panting ] Logan , what were you thinking ? That vortex had enough power to slide a convoy through lt . It did , didn 't it ? Let 's take a break , huh ? Get something ' to eat . Mrs. Arturo ? [ Glass breaking ] Max ? Oh , my God . [ Weeping ] Oh , my God . Max . My dear Mrs. Arturo , I-I 'm terribly sorry , but I 'm not your husband . I know this is painful , Mrs. Arturo , but there 's no one else we can talk to . Do you know why the company 's being so secretive about his death ? They 're worried that the publicity could jeopardize the project . Only a few key people know anything . Look , I don 't mean to be presumptuous , but didn 't you find it unusual that your husband should choose to slide rather than send a probe first ? Well , of course I did . He would never , never risk anything like that . My husband had his shortcomings but he was not an impetuous man . I didn 't want to say anything in front of her , but you don 't have to be a genius to figure out the company 's story doesn 't hold up . There 's foul play afoot here , Miss Wells . The challenge is going to be how we prove it . So where 've you been , Professor ? Haven 't seen you in a couple of days . ( Professor ) Uh , traveling , just traveling . [ Computer keys clacking ] Well , it looks like Miss Saint Clair and her guest signed out a couple of hours ago . Good heavens ! I think I left the key to my office in my other jacket . It 's no problem . I can let you in . Good man . Thank you so much . Just remain here , will you ? And I 'll be back in a minute . ( Professor ) So how are things at home ? Quinn , I 'm starting to think ... That I won 't be able to solve your problems before I slide . Don 't worry . ( together ) We still have all day tomorrow . [ Both chuckle ] You know , I 've never seemed to click with anyone like I have with you . It 's like ( together ) We 're in perfect sync . [ Laughing ] Quinn , this ... this thing we have between us , I 'd like to see where it could go . Logan , uh ... The slide , I know . What if you skipped it ? Take a chance . See if what we 're feeling is real . If it 's not , then we could work together and get you home later . But my friends ... This isn 't about them . It 's about us . Stay with me . I don 't want this to end . What 's the matter ? Nothing . It 's nothing . [ Chuckles ] I 'm sorry . ( together ) Maybe we 're movin ' too fast . [ Both chuckle ] Come on . There 's more of this city I want to show you . [ Buzzing ] [ Switch clicks ] Thank you . Sure . [ Sighs ] I won a Congressional Medal for scientific excellence ? [ Laughs ] And every time I see it , it comes as a surprise . [ Beeping ] Yes . Somebody hacked in and did a slash-and-burn on the security system . Do we have any other options ? [ Computer keys clacking ] I just found a backup file they missed . I won 't let you do this , Logan . I 'll go public if I have to . [ Screaming ] It 's too late , Max ! She pushed your double into the wormhole . The security camera caught the whole thing . I see . Can I have a hard copy on that ? I 'll download it on a floppy . ( guard ) Is everything okay , Professor ? Uh , just the little woman . Can 't do a thing without me . Professor , where 've you been ? I 've been looking for Wade . She disappeared last night . What are you talkin ' about ? Look , my double did not die in an accident . We found hard evidence he was murdered by Logan Saint Clair . Logan ? No , no , no , no . There must be some mistake . The only mistake I made was not trusting my instincts . That woman is a killer , Quinn . And I fear that the people who employ her are holding Wade a prisoner . I can 't believe I let this happen . Well , we 'll thrash that out another time . ( Quinn ) Oh , Professor , here 's Wade now . Where the devil have you been ? In a very small office at Prototronics . It took me all night , but I finally convinced Logan 's boss I didn 't know anything and he let me go . Did you tell him about her ? Yes . ( Wade ) Look , I still think you should go to the lab today . The computer might have found our home coordinates . Well , that 's far too dangerous . We shall stay here until Mr. Brown returns . Who asked you ? Uh , I 'm sorry . I 'm just really tired . Look , I got to go back there anyway . I left the timer . Don 't worry . I 'll meet you back here for the slide . Well , come along , Miss Wells . We can sleep on the next world . Taxi ! [ Knocking on door ] ( Monique ) Rembrandt ! I 've been very patient with you . You wanted to spend the night alone , I respected that . Now it 's time to open the door . Rembrandt , if you don 't open the door right now , I will burn all your clothes . I 'm sorry . I guess I 'm just an old-fashioned guy . You know what ? I have to go . I have to be up north by 4 : 00 . Rembrandt , you 're with me now . I 'll take care of you . You don 't ever have to work again . Uh , I appreciate that , Monique , but this is an appointment that I really can 't miss . All right . But first , sing for me . OK , that 's ... that 's fair . Let 's see , uh , I got tears in my ' fro 'cause I 'm standing on my ... What 's that ? Tears in my ' Fro . That is the stupidest . I hate it . Sing your big hit . I 'd Pawn My Gold Crown for You . Okay . I 'd pawn my gold crown for you If our love was true Oh , yeah , baby , that 's it . It is ? Mmm-hmm . [ Door opening ] Monique ! Michael ! ( Rembrandt ) Michael ? What are you doing in my fiancee 's bedroom ? Fiancee ? ( Monique ) Oh ! Michael , don 't hurt the Crying Man ! You can 't hurt the Crying Man . You know how I feel about him . ( Michael ) Let go of me . I 'm going to teach that guy a lesson ! Get back here , so I can kick your sorry ass into next week ! ( Monique ) Oh , run . Run , Crying Man ! [ Sighing ] It was Logan , wasn 't it ? She killed him . I 'm sorry . Oh , God . All because of that damn disc . That damn video disc . What disc ? On the day that he died , Max told me that he 'd found a video disc . There was something about the company 's plans for sliding . He was extremely upset by it . He blamed her . Do you know what was on that disc ? No , I don 't . All I know is that he said that he would rather kill his own invention than see it used to hurt people . His invention ? Your husband invented sliding ? Well , of course . It was his life 's work . Excuse me . Ironic , isn 't it ? That on this world , I should have invented sliding . Well , if you 're the same guy wouldn 't it make sense that you 'd invent the same thing ? Hey , what 's your problem ? My problem is that I didn 't invent sliding on my Earth . Now , where 's my friend Wade ? Quinn . Professor , what are you doing ? It isn 't Wade . It 's a double . What ? Logan 's boss hired her . Well , where 's Wade ? Somewhere in this building . They 're using her as a trump card to keep you here . Any luck in finding those coordinates ? No . But I got the timer back . What are we going to do about Wade ? My double had some information which could sabotage Logan 's project . It 's on a video disc . If we can find it , we can use it as a bargaining chip to free Miss Wells . [ People chattering ] Hey , what are you , crazy ? Don 't you know it 's suicide to try to ride up there ? Man , normally I would agree with you . But these aren 't normal times . Hey , man , you got room for one more ? Yeah . Always , man . Where 's your gear ? Gear ? What gear ? Man , when this baby hits 200 , this is gonna be the only stuff between you and the hereafter , dude . Wait , wait . 200 ? Like in miles per hour ? [ Screaming ] We slide in an hour , Professor . What are we gonna do if we can 't find this disc ? I don 't know . Well , he 's your double . Where would you hide it ? Where would I hide it ? Quinn . Yes ! Great minds do think alike . Nice . ( Logan ) Once we perfect sliding , we 'll be able to successfully raid parallel dimensions and strip them of their natural resources . When we control the supply of water , oil , gas and coal , we 'll have the power to essentially hold the world hostage . All right , Professor . Let 's bargain . ( Logan ) Quinn ! Be smart , give me the disc . Don 't play this game . We 're not going to trade your friend for the disc . That 's right . I know exactly what you 're thinking . Haven 't you figured it out yet ? You 're my double . What ? That 's why we 're always in perfect sync . That 's impossible . How could my double be a woman ? It 's just the difference between an X and a Y chromosome , Mr. Mallory . We have identical bio-thermal heat prints . See , I was born Logan Mallory . My mother remarried after my father died , and I took my stepfather 's name . Don 't blow this , Quinn . Once we figure out the bugs in this thing , the world is ours . All of them . What dark corner of our soul did you crawl out of ? [ Chuckles ] Come on . We know we both have a dark side . Mine 's just a little closer to the surface . Now let me have the disc . I don 't think so . I 'm afraid we have no choice , Mr. Mallory . ( Logan ) No ! [ Logan yelling ] [ Logan screaming ] ( Professor ) Ahh ! No ! Give me it . The only reason I don 't strangle you right now is Wade . So you 're not as far removed from your dark side as you thought . Look , you 're going to have to trust me . Cooperate and I 'll make sure your friend stays alive . Professor . [ Whooshing ] ( Professor ) What the hell ? Incoming ! Oh . Are you okay ? Where am I ? Prototronics . Then I am more than okay . I am positively ecstatic . [ Groans ] Help me up . I 'm so sorry . So sorry . [ Alarm buzzing ] What happened ? I don 't know . Must be a virus in the software . ( Fayne ) Reconstruct it . Now . ( Quinn ) Not until I see Wade . I don 't make deals . Then I don 't fix computers . ( Logan ) Get the woman in 267 and tell maintenance there 's a mess behind this building that needs to be cleaned up . Quinn ! You okay ? Yeah . ( Fayne ) All right , you 've seen her . Deal 's done . Not until she 's released , I 'm the one you want . Let her slide . It 's not her decision anymore . ( Professor ) No , it 's mine . ( Logan ) What ? Come on , Mr. Mallory . Miss Wells , let 's go . The computer found the right coordinates . And now they 're gone . ( Professor ) We have 15 minutes before the slide ! ( Wade ) We 'll never get there on foot ! I 'll take that one ! ( Quinn ) Hop in . Excuse me , sir . No , I do not have any spare change . And you may not use the toilet . My friends should have checked me in . Now , the name is Brown . Rembrandt Brown . Oh , my God ! The Cryin ' Man ? I 'm your biggest fan ! Never say that to me again . ( female announcer ) This is your 15-second warning for the daily 4 . ; 00 p.m. Power blackout . Service will resume in 15 minutes . Looks like you guys weren 't driving those things for kicks . It 's a long story , Remmy . I 'll tell you about it on the next world . Whatever happened to you ? Well , carpe diem is what happened to me . ( female announcer ) The building is now secure . ( Rembrandt ) Let me guess . That 's the long story ? Here we go . You open that door , I won 't pay my bill . Now give this video disc to my wife , she 'll know what to do with lt . Go , Miss Wells ! [ Whooshing ] ( Logan ) Let me in ! Hit your override button ! [ Grunts ] Oh , that 's something , man ! Too bad the ladies not here to see it . [ Yelling ] Whoa , that is something , man . [ Whoops ] Your crew going to want a table ? Diggs . Am I back in San Angeles ? You tripping , man . You in Los Angeles . Lotus land . Mr. Mallory ? Logan must have switched our geographic spectrum stabilizer with hers . So we 're going to be landing in L.A. From now on ? Her stabilizer had a 400-mile radius . We could land in L.A. , San Francisco or anywhere in between . Great . I loathe L.A. Don 't look so surprised . You knew I could track wormholes . Now give me the re-entry coordinates I need to return objects without burning them up . I have 30 seconds on this world . Import the coordinates I need to slide back safely or I kill her . Don 't do it , Mr. Mallory . She won 't dare shoot . Without those return coordinates she 's stuck here . And heaven knows what they do to killers on this world . Don 't test me . I 'll take my chance with a good lawyer . It 's done . We 'll see . Let 's go ! I gave you what you wanted . I have to be sure ! Come on ! No , Logan . This time you 're going to have to trust me . [ Screaming ] No ! It 's not done ! I 'll get you , Quinn ! I 'll get you ! Did you give her the right coordinates ? No . I programmed a set for another dimension . So she 's out there somewhere , lost like us . Yeah , but she said something about tracking wormholes . We 're going to run into her again ?

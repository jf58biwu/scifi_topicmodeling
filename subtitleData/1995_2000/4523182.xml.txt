 This is the first film produced by the Universidad dei Cine , Buenos Aires . Its goals have mainly been pedagogical . Besides gaining work experience , film students come through the Main Gate ... into the magical and wondrous world of movie creation . Subways are undoubtedly a symbol of current times . A labyrinth where we silently walk past our own kind , never knowing them or their ways . Hundreds of platforms where we analyse situations , not really trying to catch a train , but rather " a change in life . A strange game we plunge into through endless tunnels , unaware that , with every change of train , we definitively change our fate . I found subways to be the greatest observational apparatus , but I never imagined what was in store for me ... Attention , garage ! This is Bolivar here . Answer me , please Can somebody answer ? Garage here . I got a call from Plaza Italia . We are overloaded . Please send another train . I 've sent them all , Bolivar . What do you mean , " all " ? - There are no trains left here . - What ? ! It can 't be ! There must be at least one ! - Not here . - OK , OK ... Check your records . You should have one more . Maybe in another area . Got it ? Listen , Bolivar , I have nothing to check here . Don 't you realise you 're talking to your boss . I ? Got it ? Route 2 Juan Vega speaking . I don 't understand you . What have you lost ? - And now what ? - Let 's keep going forward . Left forward or right forward ? Pay attention , or we 'll be here all night . - Which way , boss ? - Wait here ! We can 't go on ! We shouldn 't stick to lights . They always fail . What do you mean ? Hello ? Please put me through to the Director General . Director General ! Vega , I hope you have a good reason for calling me . I was waiting for you . You don 't know how great it feels here , Pratt . Taking a bit of fresh air . I can 't stand stifling offices . I 'd hit the road and never go back into town . My fellow architects might think I 'm nuts , but I don 't want to go back into subways . For me , that job is over . Yes , but I can 't help you . I 'm not an architect . I don 't need an architect . And no one wants go back down there . You like problems . You specialised in maths , right ? - Topography . - Ah ! Lust for surface analysis ! One formula , one calculation ... and you put it into a book . I find it as odd as the Director General 's questions ... Blasi . Go and see what he wants , please . Maybe you 'll find him interesting , though I doubt it . When we finished building the Peripheral Line , it worked . But they 're having problems now . One more thing , just in case ... The original plans are at the Public Works Dept . Ours are a copy of the ones that were approved . But , in fact , I don 't know what they want . Knowing Blasi , it could be anything . Don 't try to get me . - What 's this for ? - I don 't know . They say it potentiates perception . Work it out . Oh ! And tell Blasi I went away ... along the highway . I assure you , we 're doing our best . We can 't search the whole system , just because of a supposition . You know kids . They love the subways . Ma 'am , five million people take them every day . It 's your responsibility. if you ignore his whereabouts , that 's not my problem . - Mr. Blasi , the builder 's here . - Show him in . Yes , ma 'am , I understand you I 'm sorry , but ... Come on in , Mr ... Daniel Pratt . I expected to see my old friend Decker . Is he coming ? I told him I needed him . No , you see , Mr. Decker couldn 't come , and he asked me to help you . Fucker ! As if it were just nonsense ! I begged him to come . I can help you solve anything . You haven 't got any idea what this is all about ! At least , he could 've called me ! Decker thinks these things are for beginners . I 'm a topographer . A mathematician . What 's that ? A branch of mathematics that studies surfaces and turns them into formula . Good for my nerves . I can 't believe it ! - Please go to your office and tell ... - Mr. Blasi . - Doesn 't anybody knock any more ? - It 's happening again . Come . Pay close attention to this ... Then go tell Decker we 're not kidding . I had a good reason to call him . But don 't talk to anyone about what you 'll see . Don 't go around telling anyone , you know how this is ... The papers print it and you 're on the firing line . I can 't overlook those details ... This one doesn 't work , either ? Get it fixed ! Millions of people walk through these tunnels ... You can 't check them all . What would we do if someone set a bomb ? Everything in here is my responsibility . It 's not easy . This is a real maze . - Sir . - Yes ? - Train 101 from Ezeiza is stopped in the access tunnel . I 've ordered it to move on . It 's blocking two levels and they refuse to go on . Line open to train 101 . You may talk . 101 , this is the Director General here . Why don 't you move on ? It 's changed back to red . I can 't take that risk , What if there 's a train on the other side ? Negative , 101 . The way is free . It 's not allowed , sir ... There could be a collision . I repeat , the way is free . - I can 't ... - I 'm telling you to move on ! - I can 't ... - Move ! We 'll have to suspend the service and search the whole area . I don 't think so . The system ... is too complicated to put it off . Driver Rodriguez , Driver Rodriguez , you are required at Signal Control . Current temperature in town is 38 . 7 Â° C ... Hurnidit ) I , 90 % . Why don 't you move when I tell you to ? But the lights were constantly changing ! I could 've had a collision ! Calm down ! I 'm the boss here ! If I say go , YOU go ! I have to follow the rules . I can 't move if the light 's red . Fuck the rules ! I know what to do and you should obey me ! It 's the company 's rules ! People 's lives are at stake ! I 'm the only one who knows what to do ! Are you ? Then drive it yourself . Come here . Do you still think I 'm lying ? I guess you now see how senous it ls . Lights detect non-existent trains . That 's to say , they fail . There are unplanned changes of rails . And a whole train 's missing . There are so many tunnels , that we can 't find it . Some big guys are coming to Parque Station at midnight . They want to see the place where it was last seen . And I 'm supposed to tell them what 's happened . But I have no explanation . I don 't know what 's happening ... And I 'm the Director General . I need to see the plans approved by the Ministry . Just in case , you know ? How can I account for the disappearance of a whole train ? Come with the plans , please . What was your name ? - Daniel Pratt . - OK , Mr. Pratt , I 'll be expecting you tonight . And if you have any ideas , please let me know . Driver Figueroa , Driver Figueroa , please go to Maintenance . - Constructor ? - Is Architect Decker in ? - No . Who 's speaking , please ? - Daniel Pratt . Would you like to leave a message ? Tell him to ask the Minister to allow me to copy the plans . No one told rne you were coming . 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 ... I 've been checking these files for 40 years . - Are you sure they 're here ? - Yes . The question is , where ? They are moving right now . They must have done it on purpose . Which plans do you need ? The Peripheral Line plans . Let me think . They should be here somewhere ... 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 ... We 've moved before , but within the same building . To other floors . Years ago , there was a terrible storm ... and these files floated about for days . Top shelf , Section G-110 . I 'll get them . - There 's nothing here . - It can 't be ! - Where else can they be ? - Take a good look . - It 's empty . - I 'll be right back . Bad luck ... They 've been removed . Original plans can 't be removed , can they ? Depends who wants them , as usual . In this case , it was one of the project 's consultants . I couldn 't say no to him , could I ? He was a quiet man , as I remember ... He used to spend hours here , studying those plans . Here it is : Hugo Mistein . Do you know him ? Don 't forget we 're talking about pure theor } I , which hasn 't been applied so fan . - Is this Topography 3 ? - Yes . The conclusion is that both spaces , though not formally equal , are the sarne as those usually applied . If an astronomer presented a theory which was acceptable ... to the common man , he 'd probably be wrong . But if someone said time freezes in certain areas ... we should at least listen . He might be right . Science and philosophy are not so far-fetched yet . Thanks . The class is over . - May I ask you a question ? - Are you a student ? - No , I 'm a graduate . - What can I do for you ? I 'm looking for a professor who taught topography for many years . Doctor Mistein ? Don 't waste your time . When did you last see him ? Some five years ago . He left the University soon after that . - Why ? - He 'd lost interest in teaching . He had something else in mind . Do you know where to find him ? Hum ... Yes , possibly . I must have his old phone number and address . We used to call him ... He didn 't answer . We never knew why . I wonder what 's become of him ... Here it is . We liked him ... Well , please excuse me , but I 'm late ... Goodbye . Thanks . Going down ? Is there a telephone near here ? - Downstairs . - Thanks . Hello . May I speak to professor Mistein ? - No . - Is he in ? No , he 's not . Can you tell me what time he 'll be back at ? - I don 't know . - Do you know where he is ? - No . Do you want to leave him a message ? Yes ... Have you got a pen ? Yes . Who are you ? - I 'm Daniel Pratt . - Pratt ? From Del Plata Architects . - It 's about a job he did for the subway ... - S / ow / ) I , please ! We need some plans ... Do you live here ? I want to see Professor Mistein . He lives here , doesn 't he ? I tried calling him several times , but I couldn 't reach him . The phone must be out of order , and I have to speak to him . You only called once . And I said he wasn 't in . Perhaps he 's back . I 've come to fetch some documents I need . He may have had an accident . What if you 're lying ? Have you seen him lately ? If you steal anything ... I 'll scream . Moebius Nucleus Moebius . Junctions ? Junctions , 16A . Wait ... Peripheral Line , final plan . April ? Are you there ? Open the door ! Who are you with ? Come this way . The stairs are dirt ) I. You didn 't do what I asked you ! Open the door right away ! You 'd better be alone ! Come on ! Quickly ! APFI7 , open up ! April ! Come , come ! Wait up . Line J Temporarily Suspended Do you know the way back home ? I have a meeting . They wouldn 't like to see you there . My mom wouldn 't have liked to see you , but still I let you in . Let 's go . Excuse me , the Director General ? - Over there . Underground 2 . - Thanks . - Why are we down here ? - Looking for a ghost train . Sit down there . Hold this and stay here , right ? Excuse me , I 'm looking for the Director General . The service is suspended . Who let you in ? What are you doing here ? - Mr. Blasi . - What took you so long , Pratt ? Is this girl with you ? Sorry , I couldn 't make it earlier . I think I know what 's happening . Are these the Ministry 's plans ? What happened to you ? I hope you know what you 're doing . The train 's still missing and I don 't want any more problems . Now come with me . - Play with it while we speak . - Fine . Exact ! ) I , we 've checked it all . The signals work well. and ... Gentlemen ... this is Mr. Daniel Pratt . Representing Studio Del Plata . His firm built the Peripheral Line . Mr. Kenn , our Engineering Director . Mr. Aguirre , who represents the Mayor . Dr. Canotti , from the Military Hospital . Dr. Nazar , from South Insurance . And our driver ... Edmundo . Be precise , please . Have you seen it or not ? Well yes , I mean ... we almost saw it . When we hit that red light at the junction . Couldn 't it have been another train ? This is the only train running . No one else has been traveling in the system for the last four hours . When Edmundo stopped at the red light , I thought it was out of order . That 's why I told him to move ahead . Just then we heard the sound of another train at the crossing . - You saw it ? - No , we couldn 't ... The light is before the bend , but we all heard it . Why didn 't you follow it ? Well ... We didn 't know which way it was going . - That was at 1 : 38 , right ? - Yes , the first time . - The first time ? - Gentlemen , this is totally useless ! - It happened again ? - Yes , at another place . We hit another red light near Lugones Junction , at 2 : 15 . And then at 3 : 30 . - You saw the train at 2 : 15 ? - No , we didn 't , but ... we felt the vibration . I tried to follow it , but ... it must have taken a different turn at General Paz Junction . CAUTION ! It 's impossible that it could have been running for so many days without being seen . You can 't be surprised by this ! You 're responsible for it ! - Now , when did ... - Wait a second , young man . We are asking the questions here . This time , we 've got it . It 's at the lower level . Maloni 's there . - You saw it ? - It was down there . - No , it was up here ! - No ! Down there ! What 's going on , Blasi ? - You heard it yourself . - Yes , right . - Didn 't you see it ? - We heard it up there . That way . Maloni , go back down . Excuse me . Tell the authorities I 'll be right there . Engineer , can we contact the main power plant ? Sure , come with me . Mr. Blast 's coming in a minute . Power plant ? Kenn here . Read me Sector 4 , please . Usual energy consumption in tunnels and stations . One train active . Can you repeat that ? Just normal , boss . You 're the only ones running . Cut the power until I say otherwise . Done , boss . Now what ? Watch the monitors and report any changes . Nonsense . We 're traveling in one wagon . Too much power oonsumpnon . What 's happening , Blasi ? One train seems to be running , though the system is shut down . Maybe it 's just a leak . Sure ... A train has leaked inside the system . Let 's check it . Restore the power . Several areas are working . Have you authorised it ? It 's being checked at different points . Could there be any runaway wagons ? Can anybody explain what 's happening here ? Gentlemen , the young man here has something to say . We have a train with people in it . It 's missing , but the system is closed . Trains cannot leave it . Train 86 is in the system . What are you saying ? The whole system 's been checked and it 's not here . You think we 're hiding it ? Shut up and let him make his point , Dr. Nazar . We know it was going to Plaza Mayo on the morning of the 4th ... - but it never got there . - You don 't say ! And when it got to Maldonado river , it turned into a boat ... - and it 's sailing to Africa ! - Excuse me , Doctor ... How can it have been running since March 4th if nobody 's seen it ? It 's almost five days . That 's just it , Engineer . The train can 't be seen . That train , number 86 ... with no technical problems and the system of 300 trains ... working at full capacity , somehow disappeared into thin air . It hit a node . A node ? What is ' a node ' ? The railway is clean . There 's nothing but trains on it . You still don 't understand ... A node is not an obstruction ... In topography , a node is a peculiarity . A higher level pole . I don 't understand a word of what you 're saying ! - Dr. Nazar , let him finish . - I think it 's the new line . What has that got to do with all this ? The whole system is a very complex network . That was true even before its expansion . But the Peripheral has made it pretty peculiar . I 'm not sure ... but I think it has integrated the whole system ... at such a high level that I don 't even know ... how to calculate it . I suppose it 's become infinite . If I 'm right , gentlemen , we can conclude that the system 's working like a Moebius band . May I ? If you look at this strip of paper , you may see it has two sides . But if you put its ends together , like this ... we get a very peculiar strip . It 's a one-sided strip , along which we could run for ever . Endlessly . If you translate this to a subway network , it should have ... an infinite number of peculiarities . Can you imagine the features of a system like that ? I can 't , either . In fact , the whole system is beyond my grasp now . - I can do nothing but guess . - This is unbelievable . We have 200 kilometers of tunnels . How can a finite surface become infinite ? Good question . However it has happened , it has . What about its passengers ? - I have no idea . - Wait a second , Pratt ... If the Peripheral Line is causing this ... we could close it and then resume normal operation . Without any danger . If you close it , the train will never re-appear . But anyway , it might re-appear running in the wrong direction . And in that case ... there might be an accident . Mr. Blasi , how many people are there on that train ? Well , I think some 30 or 40 people . Listen , Pratt ! Do you want us to believe that the train ... has plunged into another dimension , and it 's no longer in the system ? That it 's gone ? Is that it ? That 's one way of saying it . And you mean this peculiar behaviour ... has been caused by certain mathematical properties that have to do with the Peripheral ? Exactly . Isn 't there anything we can do to bring the train back to this dimension ? Not that I know . That 's your " explanation " for this ? Don 't be ridiculous ! Is that the best your company can do ? Don 't you have any other ideas ? Pity you 've got no one to give us a sensible explanation ! Pratt , a question ... Could we keep the Peripheral open with no other trains running , so that , if the missing train appears , there can 't be a collision ? No . With the new line , the whole system has infinite linkage . Hey , Mr. Mathematioian ! You think you 've done me a favour ? ! I don 't want to see you again ! Mr : Slash' I found this girl walking along the railway . Where to now ? Nowhere . You must go home . They must be looking for you . What ? Back home ? Right now ? Come enjoy yourselves on the roller coaster You 'll never forget it ! It 's about to start . Let 's take a ride . No , you go if you want to . I 'll stay here for a while . Ladies and gentlemen , don 't miss this great attraction . The fastest roller coaster in history ! Come on in , ladies and gentlemen . It 's about to begin . Moebius . Estimate maximum possibility of bends . Your attention , please ... There are only three trains remaining until closing . Thank you . To ah ' passengers . We 'd like to inform you that the service has been suspended . Because the line is out of order Sorry for any inconvenience . Thank you . DANGER ! Toda ) I , March 4th ... fast rota ! solar eclipse this century It wasn 't easy to get here , was it ? Dr. Mistein . Relax . I know you have a lot of questions to ask me . We 're traveling at an impossible speed . A simple change of railway ... The train crosses a junction after a bend ... The right combination at the right time ... and the properties of a Moebius band apply . You 've invented a perfect machine . Don 't be blasphemous , son . Man has invented a lot of machines ... but forgets that he himself is a much more complex one . - There will be no limits now . - There never were any . Man neither knows his limits nor his possibilities . He doesn 't even know that he doesn 't know himself . We 're so busy looking for external values ... that we don 't see what really matters . This really matters ! Everything would change if you just said it . You did ! You explained it perfectly well ! I passed by Parque Station , and I saw you trying to explain Moebius theory . Did anyone believe you ? No ... But they would believe you . No , I would have said exactly the same as you . The same truth . But we 're living in a world that won 't listen , dear Pratt . - What will you do , then ? - Nothing . - What do you mean , " nothing " ? - Don 't worry , Pratt ... The time will come . Don 't they understand what 's happening ? They " They 'll never wake up before realising they are asleep . What are you afraid of , Pratt ? Vertigo . That 's just normal . Nobody can confront infinity without feeling vertigo . Nobody can experience it without feeling deeply puzzled . We 're moving at the speed of thought . How could one enjoy this life ... lacking in attraction , na 'I'vete and spontaneity ? How not to choose these shadows ... when the sea of deafness out there carries us ... to helpless disgrace ? This can 't get lost . Neither men nor time disappear without leaving traces . They stick to our souls . Sir , sir , sir ! The train was here when we arrived this morning . - How long has it been here ? - Nobody knows . - Sir ... what shall we do ? - Wait here . Well , Blasi ? So much fuss and the train was here ? Moebius ! Take it to the garage and let 's forget this whole thing . Understood ? Nothing 's happened here . I never imagined what was in store for me ... When I got on the 86 train and met my old teacher , tired of repeating ... always the same stor } I , tired of fighting and being ignored . I felt he was entrusting rne with his time . It 's easy to understand ... why I choose to follow his steps , instead of uselessly trying ... to explain to a bunch of fools something they won 't understand . Anyhow , the old man was right . We live in a word where nobody listens . Hello ? Yes ? What ? I don 't understand you . Are you sure ? What have you lost ? Sir , come ! Quickly ! It 's urgent ! - sir ! . No !

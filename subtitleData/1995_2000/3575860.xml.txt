 All right , here you go , Marcus . Here 's your salmon . All right , cool . Thanks . Yeah . Afraid that 's all I got for today . Oh , no , that 's all right ; we 'll feed a mess of homeless with all this . All right . You take care . Thanks . Yep . Oh , hey , fellas . How you doin ' ? Fine . Whoa , whoa , wait just a second . Oh , it 's cool , Mr. Fishman ; we got it covered . No , no . Where 'd you get this , huh ? Salmon ? Did he give you salmon ? It 's a soup kitchen , and you 're giving ' em very expensive salmon . Fellas , put that stuff right here . I got something very special for you . What are you doing ? CHUCK : Oh , no . You 're gonna love this . ( grunts ) All right . Right here . What is it ? Chicken noodle soup . Two and a half gallons . I 'm sorry , bro . Sister Mary said no more soup . Uh , and , uh , fellas , what am I supposed to do with this stuff , huh ? I slaved over a hot stove all day . Put a couple of fish in it , and call it an aquarium . ( both laugh ) Is that what they 're teaching you in school today ? Huh ? Exactly . GARY : Hey , tell Sister Mary I hadn 't forgotten about tonight , huh ? Oh , you 're coming to watch us play ? Coming to watch you play ? I 'm gonna ref . Yeah . And I 'm coaching , so , uh , guess what ? You don 't have to worry about the refreshments , 'cause I got it covered . Yeah . All right , later . All right . Yeah , and work on that jump shot . You 're looking a little sloppy to the right . OFFICER : All right , Jack , he 's coming through . ( lock buzzes ) You a betting man , Karim ? 'Cause we got two-to-one odds running that you 'll be back in a month . You better hope that I 'm not . ( wry laughter ) ( dogs barking ferociously in distance ) ( siren wails in distance ) * * My man . ( theme music playing ) CHUCK : What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * CHUCK : When they get the ball ... All right , great job , guys . Just a few things . Now , Marcus , I know JoJo 's your best friend , but Thomas has been open for the last half hour . You own the court . Don 't let anybody get between you and the basket ! How many I 's in the word team ? ALL : None ! Thank you very much ! Let 's go ! All right , y 'all , let 's go ! ALL : One , two , three- - play ! ALL : Game time ! SISTER : Keep your hands up . Got it ? Okay . All right , take the team . ( shouting ) Dead air ! CHUCK : Three seconds ! Open your eyes , Gare ! SISTER : Let 's go , Leroy ! He 's grabbing his ankle . He 's grabbing ... He not grabbing his ... Come on , Marcus ! Drive it in ! He 's wide open ! ( whistle blows ) GARY : Reaching ! White 's ball . Good call , ref . Don 't start with me . What do you mean , reach in ? That wasn 't a reach in . You 're favoring the nun ! Again , you 're favoring the nun ! GARY : White 's ball . Let 's go . ( siren wailing in distance ) ( whistling , cheering and applause ) CHUCK : All right , fellas , good game . Hit those showers now . Use soap ! All right , Sister . Congratulations . Good game . Thank you very much . Of course , it doesn 't hurt to have the Big Guy on your side . Not to mention the ref ! Always a pleasure , Chuck . Take care , Sister . Get you next time . Bye , Gare . ( laughing ) See you later , buddy . ( footsteps approaching ) JOJO : Hey , Marcus . Look who 's here . It 's your brother . What ? Karim ? Oh , Karim ! What 's up now , baby boy ? Hey . I 've been looking for you . Hey , man . MARCUS : When 'd you get out ? Today . ( laughing ) Right . Today . Good to see you , man . KARIM : Let 's go . Oh , hey , see you later , Sister . Hey ! Can I hold you guys to that ? What you mean ? Back off , Sister . This here don 't concern you . What you lookin ' at ? MARCUS : Hey , Karim , he 's cool , man ; he 's cool . Come on , let 's go . Marcus , you guys are going home ? Come on , Sister , I haven 't seen my brother in a while , all right ? I just want to spend a little time with him . You know , we 're just gonna hang . Right , Karim ? Maybe . Okay , you guys are gonna hang , so why don 't you just hang here ? That ain 't gonna happen . All right , look , you 're going out . It 's late . Just don 't do anything stupid , okay ? You callin ' me stupid ? ! I don 't think anyone 's calling anyone stupid . Hey , hey , Karim , it 's cool , man . It 's-it 's cool . All right , come on , let 's go . Yeah . Marcus , you take care . Great . Looks like it 's gonna be four-on-four tomorrow night . Don 't worry , Sister . You just gotta have a little faith . You got time for coffee ? Uh ... well , I 'd love to , but I 've got something I gotta do , actually . Uh ... Okay . Okay , I 'll see you soon . What 's up , Karim ? Where we going ? It 's time for us to go make a little money . ( car engine starts ) MANAGER : Close down early ? You got to be kidding me . Do you know how much business I do at night ? Yeah , but not tonight . I heard something about a robbery . Yeah , like last week and the week before that ? Uh ... listen , you don 't have much time . Yeah , tell me about it . I 'm a smoker . Huh ? All right , now y 'all are up for this , right ? Don 't worry , we 're cool . That 's right . Hey , man , what if he gets a customer , or something ? So what ? We 're ready for that . Ain 't that right , JoJo ? ( laughs ) Man , I don 't know . What you worried about ? That 's just insurance . Yeah , but ... Marcus , listen , man . I 'm your brother . I ain 't gonna let nothing happen to you . Okay ? Okay . KARIM : Okay . ( tires squealing ) ( brakes squeaking ) Please , you gotta shut down right now . Come on , man , you 're being a nuisance . Don 't make me call the cops . You want to go ahead and call the cops ? You call the cops . I 'm shutting you down right now . You ! Put everything on the counter now ! And you , face down ! Do it ! Easy , man . ( gunshot ) ( groans ) I 've never had to do that before . Hey , come here . Come here . Come here . ( whimpers ) JoJo . MARCUS : Go , go , go , go ! Come on , man ! Go , go , go , go , go ! ( engine sputtering ) ( tires squealing ) JoJo , you all right ? Easy . ( gasping for air ) ( siren wailing ) DOCTOR : Take him to Trauma Four ! EMT : 16-year-old male , gunshot wound in the abdomen . BP 90 / 60 , pulse 55 and erratic . NURSE : What 's his name ? DOCTOR : Let 's go ! Joseph Perez . Everybody calls him JoJo . Let 's move him on three . Go ahead and page Dr. Rosenberg to the ER , stat . DOCTOR : Let 's go ! NURSE : BP 80 / 40 . Starting IV ... DOCTOR : One , two , three ... go . Okay , let 's go . Let 's get that oxygen hooked up , please . Get me a stethoscope . Hey , JoJo ? JoJo , how you doin ' there ? Take some deep breaths for me . Keep bagging him . Joe , come on . Okay , get a second IV , large bore wide open . Give him a bolus . NURSE : Starting second IV . Bolus start . Okay , we 're gonna need to intubate him . Set me up with a seven - and-a-half , McGill . DOCTOR : McIntosh blade . Okay , blood type cross and match . Hey , Marissa . Marissa ... Where you been ? Oh , I was just visiting Gary at the hospital . I brought him breakfast , but , uh , he 's talking to the doctor . Things don 't look too good . Oh , poor kid . Yeah . I wish there was something more I could do . Where is Julio ? Uh , he quit . He quit ? What do you mean , he quit ? Oh , he quit . Oh , that ungrateful bum . After all I did for him . I taught him everything he knows . Well , it 's a mystery , Chuck . Did he leave his hat ? What ? Yeah . Maybe it 'll fit . Fit you ? Yeah . Yeah . We gotta streamline anyway . Hey , I know my way around the kitchen . Where are the pots ? No , Chuck , you 're the manager . Yes , I am the manager slash co-owner , and now slash chef . I mean , it 's dessert . How hard could it be ? A little flour , a little sugar , baboom- - you got yourself an Ã©clair . Give me a break . ( laughing ) What 's so funny ? Well , I already called the Culinary Institute . They 're gonna send over a few of their students this afternoon for interviews . Um , excuse me , Marissa . We 're trying to establish a hierarchical structure at this establishment , okay ? That is my jurisdiction , and you 've overstepped your bounds . However , I would have definitely delegated that responsibility to you . So , good job . WOMAN ( over P.A. system ) : Dr. McAllister , please call the G pharmacist ... Man , how 's JoJo ? Well , he 's in a coma . Where you been , Marcus ? Oh , man , we just heard the news . Hmm . Can I see him ? No . Sister Mary Alice is in with the doctor right now . ( distant sirens wailing ) ( indistinct chatter ) Is he gonna die ? I don 't know . It doesn 't look good . ( phone ringing ) Oh , man . ( remote buzzer sounding ) WOMAN ( over P.A. system ) : Dr. London to Admitting . Dr. London to Admitting , stat . Come on , man . We 'll check him out later on . What are you doing here ? I came to see JoJo . You 're responsible for this . You satisfied now ? Well , see , Sister , you don 't know what you 're talking about . I know enough . I think you should leave . No problem . Let 's go . The doctors don 't know everything , right ? I mean ... JoJo 's strong . You know , Marcus , no one is as strong as they think they are . KARIM : Marcus ? ! Let 's go ! I 'm sorry , Sister . ( sighs ) ( huffing ) ( distant siren blaring ) Are you all right ? ( sniffles ) I 've been here too many times . This hallway , in this hospital . You 've got a difficult parish . ( sighs ) They 're all tough . They take everything you got . When everything you got isn 't enough , you can 't blame the parish . ( buzzer sounds ) Well , don 't sell yourself short . You 've done a lot of good . You got the community center . You got the , uh ... the basketball program . Oh , the basketball program . That 's a great thing , right ? Keeps the kids off the street , gives them something to work toward . ( sniffles ) Last year , we were Cook County finalists . Three months later , two of the players were in jail , and one of them was dead . And now ... JoJo . You know , a little while back ... I looked into getting a transfer . Mother Superior told me I should wait six months to think about it , you know ? Maybe I just needed a breather . Gary , it 's been six months , and I don 't know if a transfer 's gonna be enough . Listen , Sister , I ... You 're doing your best . No one works harder than you do . And I got to tell you something . Those kids- - they need you . Maybe they just need somebody better . Maybe she 'll change her mind . Chuck , she 's giving up her vows . It 's not like she 's quitting her job at the bank . What difference does it make ? She 's a nun , she 's not a nun . The point is , JoJo is still in the hospital , right ? Maybe ... Maybe what ? Well , I mean , I hate to say this , but maybe it 's not just JoJo . What the heck are you talking about ? I have no idea what 's going on here . ( distant church bells tolling ) Scare you ? This is the last place I expected you to be , Karim . I 'm here to see you . We 've got nothing to talk about . You had plenty to talk about at the hospital . Talking about , I got JoJo shot . I know what I know . Like I told you , you don 't know what you 're talking about . And it would be best for you to keep what you don 't know to yourself . Are you threatening me , Karim ? I 'm just talking , Sister . See you around . ( sighs ) What did Smiley want ? You know Karim . Just being neighborly . Yeah , well , you 've got some neighborhood . That 's what it 'll do- - wear you down and make you mean . I remember when Karim was just a good kid with a few rough edges . Oh , you mean like Marcus ? Yeah . Only now it seems like Marcus is about ready to head down the same path . Oh , but he hasn 't yet , Sister . What are you doing here , anyway ? Well , I 'm going to visit JoJo at the hospital , and I wonder if maybe you might want to come along . Yeah . Just give me a minute . You never know . They might have some good news for a change . ( sighing ) : I could use some good news . Good . ( heart monitor beeping rhythmically ) I can 't ... I can 't believe it . He just woke up , just like that ? I couldn 't , either , but it happens . Should happen more often . ( whispering ) : I 'd like to speak to Sister Mary . He asked for you , Sister . Welcome back , JoJo . ( distant phone ringing , rhythmic beeping continues ) ( distant siren blaring ) ( quiet laugh ) ( whispering ) Marcus ... What ? ( whispering inaudibly ) Tell Marcus ... to stay in the light . Okay . Okay . GARY : Tell me something , Sister . What is it exactly JoJo said to you up there ? Well , I think he ... ( car engine starting ) You know , I really don 't know . Well , I hope you 'll be hitting us up for more money . Could be . See you at basketball . Thanks , Gary . Take care , Sister . Okay . ( engine starting ) Nurse , look , I need your help . The kid in ICU- - he 's not gonna make it . What ? The kid in ICU- - you need to send someone in there right now . Are you a doctor ? No , I 'm not , but listen , trust me , you need to send someone in there . I can see that you 're very concerned about this . Yes , I 'm very upset ! Listen , he just came out of a coma this morning , but he 's not gonna make it . You send someone in there right now , or you 're gonna lose the kid . All right , look , I am a doctor , but I 'm not affiliated with this hospital . Now , send someone in there right now . Okay , Doctor . ( buzzer sounds ) Thank you . Just take him downstairs , please . Listen , I 'm telling you , send someone in there right now . Take him downstairs now , or you 're gonna lose that kid ! He 'll be fine . Well , he 'll be fine . ( heart monitor beeping steadily ) Oh , God . NURSE : Code nine nine , ICU . Code nine nine , ICU , stat . NURSE : Got the paddles charged , ready to go . DOCTOR : Come on , let 's go , people . NURSE : Got the gel ? DOCTOR : Okay , get the oxygen hooked up so we can start bagging him . We need some lidocaine , get the epi set . NURSE : Lidocaine and epi coming through . DOCTOR : Charge to 200 , please . Can I have the paddles ? I have that on board . Start to bag him . 200 joules . Everybody clear . Clear . ( paddles thump ) ( droning beep ) Nothing , Doctor . DOCTOR : He 's still in V-fib . Come on , kid . Charge to 300 . Charging 300 joules . Everybody clear . Clear . ( thumping ) I got backup . Still nothing . Still V-fib . NURSE : Come on , kid . DOCTOR : Okay , one more time . 360 . Clear . 360 . ( paddles thump ) ( droning beep ) DOCTOR : Still V-fib . Let 's get ready to intubate him . Give him a little lidocaine . NURSE : Here we go . DOCTOR : 75 milligrams . NURSE : 75 milligrams of lidocaine . We 're loaded . DOCTOR : Any response ? NURSE : No response . Flat line . DOCTOR : He 's gone . ( loud , droning beep ) CHUCK : Mm-hmm . Sweet , but not gaudy . A bit boozy . I like your style . Chuck , you have to try the strawberry shortcake . It 's delicious . So ? Not bad . Not bad ? Mm . It 's a bit obvious . Unbelievable . What is it ? An apple . An apple ? You said make our favorite dessert . Yes , I know , but an apple ? Don 't listen to her . I think it 's brilliant . Perfection in simplicity . Simple is good . Simple is McGinty 's . Simple is Chuck . They just told me that you were waiting . ( bells tolling ) I 've got something to tell you , Sister . I know about JoJo . The hospital called and told me that he died . McGinty 's , uh ... M-McGinty 's will pick up the , uh , cost of the funeral . And what about the next one ? And the one after that ? You gonna pay for those , too ? Look , Sister , you can 't think like that . That 's the way it is . I can 't change it . Sister , those boys that are gonna be at that gym tonight- - they count on you . Those kids- - they need you . ( sighs ) You 're making a difference . It 's not enough . Looks like somebody got lost . ( sirens wailing ) Marcus , I need to talk to you . We ain 't got time , man . Yeah , I think he 'll make time . JoJo 's dead . Oh , no , man , I thought he came out of it . He did for about 15 minutes . He came out of it long enough to look around the room . He saw Sister Mary . Where were you ? Sister Mary . Look , Marcus , I know you 're hurt . Sister Mary 's hurt , too . KARIM : So is Sister Mary . Talk to her . That 's enough . You ain 't got nothing else to say to my brother . Are we clear ? Marcus , talk to her . Marcus . ( distant siren wailing ) ( dialing ) OPERATOR : 911 , emergency . Yeah , I want to report a robbery in progress . It 's still there . Karim . Marcus , what the hell are you doing here ? I told you to stay at home . Look , man , I know what you 're gonna do . You don 't know nothing . Now , this here is between me and the man who shot JoJo . Yeah , man , but it 's wrong . It 's wrong ? Look , we never should have went in there in the first place . Marcus , you 're just a kid . Go on back to the house . Marcus . Hey , wait , listen . You go in there , you 're going to get hurt . Man , you 're really starting to tick me off . I already called the police . Oh , well , good for you . Cops in this part of town- - they 'll get here about three hours from now . Look , don 't do it , Karim , all right ? I don 't want you going back to jail . Well , I don 't care what you want . The hell with you . ( siren wailing ) Marcus , wait ! Marcus ! ( tires screeching ) GARY : I don 't get it . Marcus is a smart kid ; he should know better . Every time his brother 's around , he shuts down . Yeah , well , that 's families , Gare , that 's how it works . Yeah , and Sister Mary , she 's offering him something- - something good . He should know that ; it 's obvious . No , it 's obvious , Gare , that you never had an older brother . MARISSA : Chuck 's right , you know . The kid can 't just turn his back on his family like that . That 's something he 's going to have to choose for himself . Yeah , well , sooner or later , he 's going to lose that chance to make that choice . Well , do the best you can , Gary . It 's frustrating . Gare , may I make a little suggestion ? You 've been looking a little tense , a little tight lately . World on your shoulders . I got one word for you- - cannoli . Our first batch , made by our new pastry chef Cindy . Say hello to Cindy . Hello . Hello , Cindy . Come on , now , tell her what you think . She can take it . She 's a professional . MARISSA : Mmm . ALL THREE : Mmm ... I agree with Marissa . Mmm ... ( muffled ) : They 're ... a little chewy for a cannoli , hmm ? Where you going ? The , um , hierarchical structure , remember ? That 's , uh , your jurisdiction . Cindy , can I have a word with you , please ? Is there a problem , Mr. Fishman ? These cannolis- - there 's , um , there 's not enough of something and there 's too much of something . Could you please , um , fill me in on your process ? Well , I start with a pastry crust- - okay , well , it 's not exactly a pastry crust . It 's soy-based instead of butter and- - see , I 'm macrobiotic . Did I tell you that ? No , no , you failed to mention that you were macrobiotic . Oh , yeah . Mm . So , um , does that mean you don 't use sugar ? Crystallized date extract . Mm-hmm . And , um , instead of cheese , it 's , um ... ? Goat curd . Ah . ( chuckles ) Here , well , you ... keep up the good work . Thank you . ( gulps ) Karim . Where 's Marcus ? I don 't know . I was hoping he 'd show up here . Basketball . It 's a waste of time . Well , I don 't know . At least Marcus won 't get shot playing basketball . Well , he sure as hell ain 't gonna get rich either . In case you hadn 't noticed , he 's no Michael Jordan . Hmm . Is that what you 're into ? Getting rich , Karim ? I 'm into getting by . Ah , getting by . ( indistinct chatter ) You wouldn 't know nothing about that , though , would you ? ( door closing ) Marcus ! What are you doing with her ? Just talking to her . Talking about what ? ! Nothing , man . We were talking about JoJo . Your brother needed to talk . He just lost his best friend . JoJo was my friend , too . So let 's talk . I don 't think so . Let 's go , man . Marcus , I thought we were gonna play a little three-on-three . Didn 't you just hear me tell him it 's time to go ? Marcus , what happened the last time you left here with your brother ? What you trying to do here , Sister ? Trying to make him choose ? I 'm not trying to make him do anything . You 're making him leave his family . Hey , listen , Karim ... No , it 's okay . You angry ? You want to hurt me , Karim ? Don 't tempt me , Sister . I 'm leaving . I 'll , I 'll be back . ( sighs ) That 's it . No practice tonight . ( players groaning ) Let 's just go kick it at the crib , y 'all . ( ball bouncing ) Psst , psst , hey . Come here , come here , come here . What 's the crisis ? What do I say to her ? What do you mean what do you say to her ? You know , I never had to fire anyone like her before . What about Joey , Leftie , Irv ? That was different . They weren 't , you know ... What if I leave her a message on the answering machine ? Chuck , stop . All right , you 're right , you 're right , in person . Be a man . Right . CHUCK : Uh , Cindy ? Can I have a word with you , please ? Yes , Mr. Fishman ? Uh , in the office , please . Cindy ... Marissa has something she 'd like to tell you . Cindy ... ( chuckles nervously ) Some say you should remember how a man lived ... not how he died . Not me . Today I say remember how this man , this boy died . The word of God says judge not , that you not be judged , but I say to you , I challenge you to judge your own hearts . JoJo made the wrong choices . Did we ? For we all shared with JoJo responsibility for his life- - those of us who led him down the wrong path and those of us who failed to lead him down the right , and perhaps , worst of all , those of us who promised to illuminate his path and then failed to provide enough light . JoJo was my friend , and I let him down . I don 't ever want to do that again . So I say , remember how JoJo died and judge your own hearts . I know I have . PRIEST : Eternal rest grant unto him ... I 'm quitting the order . ... and let perpetual light shine upon him . May he rest in peace . May his soul and all the souls of the faithful departed rest in peace . ALL : Amen . ( door creaking ) Sister ? Oh , hi . I was afraid I was going to miss you . Oh , I 'm not leaving till tomorrow morning . You ... you 'll be back , though ? Yeah , in a week or two . Well , what are you going to do ? ( sighs ) You know , I don 't know . I 've never looked for a job before . Well , the Bulls ... they 're looking for a new head coach . I was thinking more along the lines of teaching . You 'd be a good teacher , Sister . I-I-I wanted to talk to you about Marcus . What happened ? No , nothing , nothing like that . It 's just that , uh ... well , we 've got an opening at McGinty 's , and I was thinking about bringing him in . And ... you want my blessing ? Oh , no , no . No , I ... it 's just that ... well , he 's going to be in a new environment , and it might be a little hard on him , and I thought that maybe ... I can 't help you . Gary , I 've already made my decision . Nice try , though . ( engine starting ) GARY : Marissa , I don 't understand . There 's got to be a connection . Why , because of what the article said about Marcus 's death ? No , because of what the other article says . It ... look , it didn 't even appear until after Sister Mary Alice was driving away . So , you 're saying that Sister Mary Alice will be responsible for Marcus 's death ? You can 't believe that , Gary . No , I 'm not saying that . What I 'm saying ... I ... what I 'm saying is , maybe I 'm just postponing the inevitable . Or it 's the paper telling me that it 's up to me to save Marcus . Well , will he listen to you ? I don 't know . All right , so lunch is Tuesday through Sunday . It 's 10 : 30 to 3 : 00 . Dinner is 5 : 30 to 10 : 00 . Well , it sounds like a busboy job . Well , it is a busboy job . And if you want it , it 's yours . Well , I don 't know . I 've never done nothing like that before . Well , it 's not that difficult . It 's an entry-level job- - I understand that- - but everyone 's got to start somewhere , you know . Oh , yeah ? Where did you start ? Where did I start ? I started in a 24-hour diner washing dishes , and believe me , busboy is a promotion . Come on . ( sighs ) How much does this pay ? Well , minimum wage to start . What 's that ? Five , six bucks an hour , man ? That 's nothing . Well , yeah , but you got to start somewhere . Man , I know guys making ten times that amount in ten minutes . Yeah , well , where are they ten years from now , huh ? I hear you , man . Come on , this is a good deal . ( pager beeping ) Hey , that 's my brother , man- - I got to go . Look , you want the job , you can start right now . What , tonight ? What about my brother , man ? You can call your brother up to tell him you 're working . MARCUS : No , man . I 'm busy . Doing stuff . All right . Look , uh ... just pick me up later , okay ? Yeah ... peace . Everything all right ? Yeah , man . Yeah , no problems , no problems . You ready to start ? Yeah . Excellent . All right , here 's what I need you to do . Need you to deposit this over at the Lakeshore Federal Bank . You know where that is ? Yeah . All right . Just drop this in the night deposit slot . It 's out front . Gare , can I , uh , talk to you for a second ? Not now . No , Gare , I need to ... Not now . This all money ? Yeah , it 's what we took in today . And then , when you come back , I 'll get you your uniform . Okay . All right ? All right . Mm . Tell me that isn 't what I think it is . That 's not what you think it is . Do you have any idea what you 're doing ? I think I know exactly what I 'm doing . Uh , Sister Mary ? Hello ... yeah , this is Gary Hobson . Sister Mary , there 's something I 'd like to show you . Marcus . What 's up , man ? What you doing here ? I told you I 'll call you when I 'm done . Done with what ? I 'm working . Working ? You 're walking down the street . Yeah , well , I 'm running some errands . Well , anyway , uh , what time you think you 'll be done with that ? 'Cause , uh , I got some things I need to do , and I 'm going to need your help . What , tonight ? Yeah , tonight . No , no , I can 't do it tonight . I got to do this . So , how much did you trust him with ? A lot . Well , how much is a lot ? Well , enough to buy a car , a lot . Well , what kind of car ? I mean , nicer than this one ? Well ... you don 't think I made a mistake , do you , Sister ? Well , let 's just say right now , I think you have a little more faith than I do . Well , uh ... well , it looks like we 're about to find out . KARIM : Hey ! Here 's what I 'm thinking . What kind of errand is so important you got to be running it in the middle of the night ? Look , I told you , so just leave it alone . You told me ? When did you start telling me ? I 'm your brother . You forgetting who I am ? Look , I know who you are . I 'm the one that 's looking out for you , boy . Oh , yeah ? When you 're not in jail or you 're getting me shot at ? What 'd you say ? Nothing . Don 't turn away from me , Marcus . Come on , Marcus . So , that 's your little errand , huh ? How much is in the bag ? It doesn 't matter , 'cause I 'm putting it in the bank . You don 't want to do that . This is not our money , man . All right , this guy is trusting me with it . Marcus , listen . Do you understand what that money can do for us ? If we take it ... ain 't going to change anything . Marcus . ( grumbling ) Wait , Sister . I guess I 'll just have to take it myself . No . ( gun clicks ) Give me the money , Marcus . Do what you got to do , brother . So , that 's your choice ? You 're choosing them over me ? No . I 'm choosing myself . ( gun clicks ) " Tell Marcus to stay in the light . " What 's that , Sister ? That 's what JoJo said in the hospital . " Tell Marcus to stay in the light . " RADIO ANNOUNCER : Good morning , Chicago . It 's 6 : 30 a.m. , ( cat meows , paper thuds against door ) and in the next 15 minutes , we 'll have Chuck with traffic I 'm coming . and Lisa with the latest ...

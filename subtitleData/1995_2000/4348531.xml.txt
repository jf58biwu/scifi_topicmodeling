 My God . I think this is it . We don 't know that yet . We will . We will , my friend . - What are you doing ? - Not here . We gotta get it to the States , under controlled conditions . For all you know , it could disintegrate before we could even read it . - For God 's sake , keep your lights on . - I 'm trying , John . It won 't stay on . We gotta get the scroll to Hitchcock . He 's the one paying our way . John , re-seaI it . We have to leave here . Yes , you 're right . - You and Jones start on down . - No-- I 'II follow you . No ! Oh , no ! And how long have these disturbances been going on ? Since early fall . But no one , so far , has been harmed by the apparition . So , alex ? Leave it to me . Be careful . It 's supposed to snow , right ? Oh , yeah . Before you all go charging off there 's one other piece of news . A donation from RandoIph Hitchcock . That the guy who got in trouble with the State Department for buying up those oil wells in the middle East ? - The same . - Why would he want to donate to the Winston Rayne collection ? RandoIph knew my father quite well and we traveled together . And in fact more than 20 years ago he was a member of this Legacy House . So I invited him to come here tonight with some kind of spectacular artifact he 's discovered . I 'd Iike you all to meet him , the one thing he requested . - Tonight ? - Eight o 'cIock , in the study . Eight o 'cIock . Here we are , sir . Have a nice evening . RandoIph . Come in . When I got your message I couId hardly believe it came from you . I don 't know why . It only took me 2 1 years to send it . Ladies and gentlemen RandoIph Hitchcock . These are my colleagues . rachel Corrigan . - pleasure . - My pleasure , I 'm sure . Nick BoyIe . - hello , Nick , how are you ? - Good , thanks . Father philip CaIIaghan . - alexandra Moreau . - hello . Nice to meet you . Enchanted . well , Derek , it wouId seem that you have raised a fine family here . It makes me all the sorrier I never had one of my own . I 'm sure Derek has told you that I was once upon a time , a member of The Legacy myself . But due to a tragic accident and perhaps an even more tragic misunderstanding I was forced to leave . I have always regretted that . As have I. I 've wondered , all these years , how to make amends . But it wasn 't until I came upon this that I felt sure I 'd found it . I can 't imagine a better place for the mysteries contained herein to be unraveled than the Winston Rayne hall of Antiquities . I don 't mind telling you it took me three expeditions to find this scroll . - Expeditions ? Where ? - To Qumran where the Dead Sea scrolls were found . What exactly is this ? That is what I 'm hoping The Legacy can tell me . As I 'm sure you 're aware the Dead Sea scrolls were found in cliffside caves . eleven caves in all . Yes , exactly . But less weII-known is the fact that the original scrolls refer to other scrolls and to a twelfth cave which has never been discovered . And you found it ? I found the twelfth cave . And discovered this inside it . But what 's it written in ? It looks almost like ... . Sumerian . - But it 's not . - No , it isn 't . There are many unanswered questions about this scroll . What it says , what this parchment is made of and when , precisely , it dates from . That 's why I was hoping The Legacy could examine and preserve this . I would love to take a crack at deciphering it . Derek , your cohorts are chomping at the bit already . Yeah , look what you 've done now . Oh , RandoIph . Thank you again . You know how sorry I am , and always have been for what happened to alicia . I 've never actually forgiven myself . well , it 's time you did . It 's over , Derek . It 's taken me years to realize that , but now I have realized it . Now you must do the same . Thank you . So you 'd Iike to oversee the work on the scroll ? unless you want to fight me for it . I 'm glad to see you and your old friend reconciled after all these years . So am I. So am I. Burning the midnight oil ? Just making some notes . So you and Hitchcock used to raise some hell together , huh ? Yeah . Quite a Iong time ago . Who 's the babe ? RandoIph 's fianc√©e . Her name was alicia . If you hadn 't educated me I would have felt certain that she was with you . Hitchcock 's a better man than I thought . Back then , the three of us were inseparable . Whatever happened to her ? - She died . - I 'm sorry . Have you come to wish me a bon voyage ? Think you can handle this ? What , the pennywhistle Inn ? Trust me . You okay ? Of course . Why ? I don 't know . It looks like you could use a good night 's rest . Did you sleep at all last night ? Not much , actually . Bad dreams , I 'm afraid . Take care . call me if you need me , okay ? No . No , no , please . please don 't go . The house isn 't really haunted . It 's just the plumbing . It 's just very loud . It just- - - You 'II never get our business again . - It 's not ghosts , really . Another satisfied customer , I see . please , it 's not as bad as it seems . really . Rent me a room , and tell me all about it . - You 're serious ? - absolutely . - well , Iet me take your bags . - Great . Come on in . - Here we go . - Okay , thank you . Now , this is an incredible room . Are all the rooms this nice ? I wish I couId say they were . This is the best of them all . After my parents died last year and left this place to me ... - ... I spent all I had renovating it . - well , it 's great . Everybody always wants to stay in a quaint bed-and-breakfast but nobody wants to share a bath . So I had them put in this customized bathroom . Even one of these shower massage heads . AII right , then , I 'II take it . You might want to think twice about that . This is the room where three people have seen the ghost . Once , it was standing by that window . Once , he was standing at the foot of the bed and once ... . Once what ? Once he even tried to get into bed with a guest . Thank you , sir . What was that tune you were playing just now , Derek ? honestly , I don 't know where it came from . Must have heard it someplace before . I hate to be the one to interrupt such inspiration , barging in here like this- - Oh , no , no , no . Not at all . I certainly understand your eagerness to decipher the scroll . well , it took me such a hellishly long time to find it I suppose I just can 't wait to discover what we have . Do you know anything ? These things take time . We 're working on it . And unless the protocols have changed since my day the laboratory would be off-Iimits to anyone except members of The Legacy . Is that right ? well , that 's still the protocol , yes . But given the circumstances , I think an exception can be made . - please . - wonderful . I 'd Iike to be able to say the place hasn 't changed a bit but it has , and all to the good , apparently . RandoIph was wondering if we 've made any progress with the scroll yet . No , we 've run some tests on the parchment and ink . Nothing yet . What about the age ? Have you been able to determine that ? Carbon dating 's done just outside of Stanford University 's campus . I 'd give them a phone call and ask if they 'd run the test again . precisely what date did they give you ? 1 1 , 000 B.C. , plus or minus 200 years . Isn 't that impossible ? From everything that I understand and I would bow to your expertise on this but as far as I know , no written language had been invented at such an early date . True . And we 've never seen writing like this before . I seem to have bestowed more questions than answers on The Legacy , eh ? Derek ? You all right ? Why wouldn 't I be ? RandoIph I think we 've done enough here . It 's better if you go now . Yes . Of course . Good luck . Yeah . I never meant to do any of it . I never meant to hurt anyone . God is my witness . I was as much in the dark as anyone . I knew no more than Conway or Jones . May God 's word protect me . They can 't blame me . Not for that . I was doing what I 'd been paid to do . Just as they were . We all went into this with our eyes open . Wide open . Derek ? I got your call . I ... . Are you all right ? What ? Your face , I can ... . I can see it in the window . It 's ... . What the hell 's going on ? Just a momentary lapse . Nothing really . - I don 't believe you . - I said it was nothing ! Excuse me , I just ... . - So , what are you doing here ? - You called me . I was seeing a patient . You asked me to come . - Don 't you remember ? - It was a mistake . Maybe you 're pushing yourself too hard . You know , " fools rush in ... . " I 'm not a fool ! - Excuse me ? - You heard me . What are you doing ? You 're sweating . I 'm fine . Come on , hot water . Harper ! Open up . How can you stand this ? What did you do with the money I paid you ? blood money . I gave it away . To Jones ' and Conway 's families . Very noble of you . also rather pitiful . I won 't be staying . What is it you want ? I want the scroll back . You can 't be serious . - Why ? - Why ? You need to ask me that ? Two men have died already . You know its power . It has to be destroyed . And you think this collection of clutter is going to keep you safe ? - I 'm alive , aren 't I ? - You 're alive because of me . And you will stay that way if you keep your mouth shut . Forget you ever saw the scroll . It 's good advice . Take it . What advice did you give Derek Rayne ? Derek Rayne . So you do get out . The scroll belongs to him now . It will do with him as it sees fit . You 've got to get the scroll back . Conway and Jones ... I 've got to get it back . I 've got to burn it ! It 's the only way to make it stop . It 's the only way to end this . I 'II see what I can do . Derek . - What the hell are you doing here ? - Sorry , I had to see you . So I broke in through the side entrance . I couldn 't help myself . I keep seeing this image . Fire . Something burning . And this sound of voices . Voices ? You 're hearing voices ? I 've heard them before . Her name was alicia . alicia Summers . She and randolph Hitchcock were due to be married a Iong time ago . - Who took this picture ? - I did . Just before ... . It was supposed to be a simple operation . Get in , get data , get out . We 'd have been fine , except alicia wouldn 't listen . She was supposed to meet us at the car but she came looking for me . This thing we 'd been tracking grabbed her and ripped her apart . And when she died , it was as if the world opened up and ... . And you could hear this sound cries of the damned . Voices screaming . It was horrible . And RandoIph loved her so much . And what about you ? Did you love her too ? Yes . I 've never said it to anyone before but yes , I did . The visions ... . But everything you 've told me there wasn 't any fire . No , nothing like that . And yet , it 's the image of fire I keep seeing . Derek . You know that people who are born with the ability to see things that no one else can see ... . There is a certain instabiIity . There is a danger of losing touch with reality . That 's why I came here to see you . Before something terribly wrong happens again . Who 's this ? The original owners of the house , the Cartwrights . I thought of enlarging that picture and hanging it up in the front hall . I wonder what happened to them ? I don 't know . They built the house and when their son died of pneumonia , they sold it . You said these disturbances began this fall ? Yes , that 's right . I remember it was just after the workmen finished with their renovations . The longest time , I thought it was just that they had done something wrong like maybe hanging the new doors off-kiIter , something like that . These renovations , did they include the room I 'm in ? Oh , yes , that was the biggest part of the job . Get away . I 've killed two men already , Mr. Rayne . What 's one more ? What do you want ? To save your life . That 's all . Have we heard from Derek ? No . rachel called . Said she spoke to him this morning . Oh , yeah ? Did she say what was wrong with him ? Not really . How is it coming with the translation ? That 's a good question . - Got an answer ? - No . No answers . I can 't make head nor tail of it , and neither can the computer . I 've had this scroll carbon dated half a dozen times and the answer keeps coming up the same , 1 1 , 000 B.C. Yeah , and we both know that can 't be right . The composition analysis of the ink and the parchment showed up this morning . Great . So what 's it made of ? flax , rice paper , papyrus ? Skin . Skin . What kind of skin ? Sheep ? Goat ? Human . Human ? And the ink is blood . Here , have a look . See the movement ? Yeah . Human blood ? Yes . The ink , or blood is motile . The scroll is alive . Hitchcock ? You know him , as well ? Yes , too well . - He 's my friend . - Is he ? - What are you talking about ? - Nothing . Or something that came between you . So terrible he 's never forgiven you . - alicia ? - A woman . Now , there 's a reason . - Shut up . - See ? Scars buried deep inside your soul . Scars he 's never forgiven . - He has . He told me . - No . Never ! RandoIph Hitchcock never forgives anyone for anything . Nor does the scroll . The scroll ? It will drive you mad . You will hear things that no one said . You will see things that aren 't there . No one can help you , Mr. Rayne . The scroll will take your sanity . And then it will take your life . Precautions , Mr. Rayne . Take great precautions . We 're brothers now . Like it or not . Oh , my ... . That 's it , isn 't it ? This was your room . The one they tore out . Poor baby . In the name of Adoshem , eternal and everlasting one prince of princes , lord of light angel of absolution ... . Let no evil penetrate this sacred circle . Have mercy upon me and let thine angels come and take up their abode in this place . Protect thy humble servant from the powers of the night and the demons of the pit . Make of my spirit a beacon of righteousness . Make of me a pillar of light and cleanse my soul of all impurity . Derek ? When did you get in ? Late . After midnight . We were worried about you . The scroll it 's not Sumerian . It 's PaIeo-Hebrew . The earliest form I 've ever seen . And I suppose now you can read this ? Yeah , I did . well , what does it say ? It 's a confession . To what ? Murder . It 's the first murder confession ever made . I don 't follow you . It 's the confession of Cain to the killing of his brother , abel . And it 's his curse : exile madness and death for whomever possesses the scroll . Oh , my . God , I should have known . Fire . - When did this happen ? - Last night . The call came in after midnight . Was there anyone inside ? Who are you ? Derek Rayne . I knew a man who claimed he lived here . If he was in there when it went up , there won 't be much left . AII we 've found so far are odds and ends burnt beyond recognition . - Any idea what started it ? - Hard to say . Given the way it went up , I 'd say it was arson . My God . I 'm here , Rayne . Drive . Just drive . Derek I received your message . It 's been many years since I received a summons to this house . well , what have you discovered ? I 'd love to know what it says . I think you know , RandoIph . I think you know . You knew when you brought it to The Legacy . I gave that scroll to you . would you Iike it back ? You 've never forgiven me for what happened to alicia that night have you ? No . You were in love with her weren 't you , Rayne ? Did you think I was blind ? - She loved you . - Yes , she did ! She loved me , Derek , not you ! Is that why you had her killed ? I would never have done anything to put alicia in danger . No ? Wasn 't it you who led us into that bloody disaster ? If it had not have been for you ... . Hadn 't been for you , she 'd still be alive . She 'd be my wife . If it hadn 't been for you . You think you know now what the scroll says ? Did you decipher the lettering yourself ? Or have you been talking to a raving lunatic named John Harper ? - John Harper is no lunatic . - So you did know the man . I still know him , RandoIph . - He 's alive . - There . My friend , you are wrong . He 's dead . And now so are you . You seemed suicidal . I didn 't think you would actually try ... . No , you tried . But I can 't go without the scroll . Are you mad ? The scroll doesn 't belong to you . It belongs to him . Curse and all . I bequeathed it to Derek Rayne . Look . Look at his forehead . It even bears the mark of Cain . Harper , no ! - Don 't ! - It 's mine now . I found it . And I 'II put an end to it . - No ! - It has to be destroyed . You fool ! No ! No , you can 't have me ! Harper . Harper . He can 't hear you . Hitchcock . He 's getting away . You want him ? No , not for now . Derek ... . It 's gone . I know who you are . You 're Benjamin , aren 't you ? And this is where you died here in the nursery . cold , it 's so cold . I know you are . But if I warmed you up and got them to redo your room would you stop wandering through the house at night ? cold . well , come on then , little guy . Come on . There you go . You 've been cold way too long . There . Get some sleep now . Sweet little boy .

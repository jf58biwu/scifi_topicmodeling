 [ Grumbling ] Damn that channel 9 weatherman ! What ? It 's not raining . I know . I cut through his yard , and the sprinklers went off . Car wash again ? Do you see any soap ? Dr. Albright , they 're having a reception for that new professor . Oh . Dr. Neesam . Mm-hmm . Should I Rsvp ? Please . Oh , uh , me , too , Nina . Dick , this guy 's kind of a big shot , so when you meet him , try not to act so ... brilliant ? No . Athletic ? Uh , well- - gorgeous ? Weird . Weird as in sexy ? Weird as in weird . Oh , so suddenly I 'm weird . Not so suddenly , Dick . I said it today , I said it yesterday , I say it every day . Oh , I thought that was just a running joke we had . I 'd do something , then after the fire trucks left , you 'd let me have it . Ha ha . All in good fun . Dick , you and your family- - I know you mean well , but sometimes it 's like being around the Addams family . Well ... I will admit that john Adams ' views of a strong central government may have been ahead of their time- - that 's not who I meant . John quincy Adams ? ! You 're comparing me to that freak show ? ! Oh ! Tommy , tell me if this milk tastes bad . We 're kind of busy right now , Sally . We have to write about our family 's history for class . Ok . Um ... my family came to America in 1852 on a dutch schooner . How about yours ? Well , um , my great-grandfather , uh ... escaped from the Nazis through the alps with his family and their singing nanny . Um , Tommy ? Yeah ? That 's the sound of music . Yeah , I know . And don 't think that we 're not suing ! Hey . Don 't throw that away . Oh . Why , do you recycle ? No . I 'm trying to get into the Guinness book of world records for the world 's biggest can collection . How many do you have ? So far ? Just the one . Oh . August . I 'm glad you 're here . Tell me , do you think that we are weird ? Well , um ... I don 't think that- - oh , come on , come on . I won 't be offended . You can be honest . Um ... sometimes ... you can be a little ... weird . And you 're a pedantic little twerp ! Now get out of the house ! Why does everybody keep saying that we 're weird ? Jealousy . No , come on . This is important . Our mission is to be average human beings . Is it possible that we 're not fitting in as well as we think ? Well , Dick , you can be a little weird . You 're the weirdo . Weird as in sexy ? You 're both freaks . Oh , yeah , compared to you ? [ All talking at once ] Hey , hey . Anybody got a can ? Harry , tell me if this milk tastes bad . Dick : family meeting ! Family meeting ! What you got there ? Books . Lots of books . What for ? We 're not fitting in . Apparently , being human involves more than just 2 arms , 2 legs , and the occasional major orifice . What we have here is the almanacs of man . Statistics on lifestyles and behavioral studies . We 've got to become completely average Americans , and that takes work ! Now , come on , start reading . Ah , look ! It says the average American uses 4.1 pounds of butter a year . Orally ? It says that the average American commute is 22 minutes . Oh , no . I 'm only 5 minutes from work . Tomorrow take the riding mower . Ok . Statistically , at least one of us should be divorced by now . Ooh ! I want that one ! And 10 % of us should be gay . That 's not why we got divorced . 10 % is a minority . We 've got to go with the majority , the average . Oh . Ok . The average family of 4 lives in a 3-bedroom residence . We 're going to have to move . You better tell Dubcek . Oh , she 's going to be upset . No . I 'm sure she 'll be fine . Mrs. Dubcek ! Mrs. Dubcek : what ? We 're moving ! Mrs. Dubcek : like hell you are ! And this area , which I 've designated " x , " is the guest suite , which opens into " y , " creating a lovely area for entertaining : " Z. " Is it cable-ready ? Does the walk-in closet have ample storage space ? I don 't know . I 'm just telling you : it does . Dr. Solomon , does the university know that you 're using your class time to try and sublet your apartment ? Just for that , Karen , you 're going to miss out on this unique opportunity . How much is the rent ? 325 a month . Cool ! I 'm in ! That 's less than my mom charges ! Uh , come on in , fellas . Watch your step . Well , this is it . Cool ! Party ! I want you boys to know I 'm in bed by 11 : 00 . Oh . Well , you know , we 'll keep it down . No , I just ... wanted you to know . This is the living room ... well , I think we 're ready . Good-bye , Mrs. Dubcek . I believe it was Mr. William Shakespeare who said , " parting is such sweet sorrow- - " bye-bye now . Well , onward to a new life . Wow . Everything 's so beige . Hmm . A perfectly neutral color for perfectly neutral living . Hey ! I 've seen this before . This is stain-resistant carpet . Look . That 's a good place for a chair . Everything 's falling into place . Yeah , but something isn 't quite right ... does it fit ? Mine does . It feels great ! Look out ! [ Popping ] You know , it is amazing the advances the swedes have made in the science of furniture , especially considering they have only one known tool . This stuff is genius . You guys , look what I got ! America 's number one pain reliever , America 's leading chunky peanut butter , and America 's favorite mustard for over 50 years . Hey , this bread is recommended by 4 out of 5 dentists for their patients who chew bread . Guys , I have a date with Mary . Which shirt looks , better , this one ... or this one ? [ Knock on door ] Hi . Hi . Come in . Hi . I 'm flora . And I 'm Steve . I 'm Dick . Hi , Dick . Are those dockers ? Yes , they are ! I have those exact pants . Well , we just wanted to welcome you to the building . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . By the way , is that your red convertible parked outside ? Oh , don 't worry . We 'll be replacing it soon with a minivan or a sport-utility vehicle . Good choice . And , uh ... your assigned parking spot is g-14 . And so you know , we don 't do laundry after 10 P.M. Wow . Is everything so regimented around here ? Well , we have a pretty active tenants association . Oh ! Could I join ? Well , sure . There 's a meeting tonight . We have to tell you , we 're so glad to be rid of the last people who lived here . They stored all kinds of junk on their balcony . It 's so nice to have some normal people here . Normal ! Normal ! Normal ! Normal ! Thank you . And you , sir ? I can 't decide . What is your most popular dish ? Well , a lot of people like the steak fajitas . Then steak fajitas it is . And , uh , how would you like it cooked ? Medium . And the sauce , sir ? Medium . And your drink ? Cola , medium . No , wait . Yes , medium . So , How 'd you like the movie ? It 's the number one movie in America . But did you like it ? It 's America 's favorite movie , and that 's good enough for me . I guess it was Ok . 2 thumbs up . Way up . I 'm having a nice time . You are ? That 's true . You 've neither screamed nor cried all evening . This is cause for a celebration . Waiter ? A bottle of your most average champagne . Oh . How 's it coming , Harry ? Well , I had a little trouble . We were trying to put the support rod from the uben into the fiord slot , but that crisis is past . Ah . Look at us . We 're doing great . Everything 's coming together . Oh , I 'm reading a great john grisham novel . It 's about a young southern lawyer who fights an evil corporate giant . Hey , my grisham 's about that , too . So is my grisham ! Hey , guys . Whoa . Who are you ? It 's me Tommy . Well , you can 't be Tommy . Tommy looks like a girl . Oh . No . I went to the megacuts . Well , if you 're Tommy , answer me this : are we , or are we not aliens ? Yeah , Dick , we are . Tommy ! Ah , there 's my grisham . Here we go . This thing- - whatever it is- - has got to go . Just have them haul all this away . Are you sure ? Yes , Nina , I 'm sure . It 's just that you 're acting kinda strange . Me , strange ? I 'm textbook normal . If anyone is strange , it 's you . You exercise too much , you drive a stick shift , you drink root beer . Oh , and you 're black . What 's strange about being black ? Let 's face it , Nina , most white people aren 't . But they want to be . What 's going on ? I 'm just getting rid of some of these kooky knickknacks . What could I have been thinking ? I don 't know . I think it 's kind of nice having personal touches around the office . I was thinking about getting one of those big ficuses . Whoa , hold on there , Courtney love . The circus is a fun place to visit , but you don 't want to live there . Can I have your Mr. Potato head ? Sure . Go ahead . Weirdo . Oh , hi , Jeff . Thanks so much for coming . I suppose you 're wondering why we asked you here . Yes . Well , is that your doormat ? Yeah . So ? Well , it doesn 't really go with the building 's decor , now , does it ? What 's the difference what color my doormat is ? Well , there are 2 approved colors , but we haven 't used either of those now , have we ? No , but it 's just that- - what were we thinking ? Were we thinking , " hmm , I know better than the other 146 tenants " ? Well , I just thought it would give my place a little personality . Oh , Jeff ! We don 't have room for personality in this complex . What we need to do is abide by the rules we 've all agreed to , right ? Ok . So bye-bye . Bye-bye . Hi , Marjorie . Come here , sweetie . Now , it seems as though we put a little dried flower wreath on our door . What were we thinking ? So , Sally , do you like it here ? Oh , I love willow glen . It 's like no place else on earth . No ... except oak bridge , willow brook , and glen brook . I can 't remember life before willow glen , and I can 't imagine life after it . Oh ! I almost forgot . I got you a housewarming present . [ Gasps ] Mary , thank you . Oh , it 's wonderful ! What is it ? It 's a wind chime . You put it in the window , and the wind rushes through it and makes a lovely sound . Sound ? As in " noise " ? Yeah . Well , it 's far too pretty to take out of the box . I know . I 'll just use it to store under the sink . Ohh ! Ohh ! Ohh ! Jenga ! Jenga ! Jenga ! That was good fun . Say , who wants to do something completely crazy ? I do ! I 'm game ! Mary ? God , yes . Let 's go get some frozen yogurt ! Come on , Mary ! You won 't believe it 's fat-free . Mary ? Oh ! Hi , Dick . Well , why aren 't you working in the office ? Uh ... I--I thought I 'd save myself the walk . I have another class coming in . What , now ? Uh ... in 3 hours . I had a really good time last night . It 's too bad you had to leave so suddenly , but leaving both your iron and your stove on , I guess that can be pretty dangerous . Take your seats , please ! Just because I 'm a little late doesn 't mean you shouldn 't be ready to learn . Now ... who knows the answer to question number 4 ? Well , who are you ? I 'll ask the questions , thank you very much . Oh ! You must be Dr. Neesam . No . The answer I 'm looking for is " marsupial . " Please concentrate . Uh , uh , no , no , no . You don 't understand . I 'm Mary Albright . This is Dick Solomon . We 're both professors here . Well , in that case , you can 't possibly take my class . Please leave . But--but this is her room . Well , then you leave me no alternative . I must leave . Auf wiedersehen . So that 's the university 's idea of a hotshot professor ? Oh , they say he 's quite brilliant . Well , I say he 's quite weird . He certainly doesn 't fit in around here . No , no , no , no . He 's too loud , too colorful , too interesting . Exactly . Thank you . Come on , Dick , we could use a little eccentricity around here . I mean , it 's getting a little dull , don 't you think ? A guy could take that personally . Excuse me . Is this the ladies ' room ? Well , I believe that is it . As they say in Sweden ... fahrvergnugen . Hey , Dick , what are you doing home ? I thought you were taking Albright to that new starbucks . Oh , the one down the street from the old one ? No , the one in between the 2 kinko 's . Oh . Across from the Barnes noble ? It doesn 't matter which starbucks ! She canceled on me . I don 't understand . Things were going so well . Why wouldn 't she like me ? Yeah . You 're just like every other guy in town . Yeah . There 's absolutely nothing remarkable or distinctive about you . And yet she resists . But you 're completely homogenized ! There 's nothing not to like ! How much less does she want from you ? Well , it is her problem , 'cause we 're doing great . Fantastic . Couldn 't be better . I 'm completely miserable . I hate it here . Kill me now . Oh , my . I thought you guys liked it here . We were just saying that 'cause we thought you liked it here . I don 't like it . I hate it ! I thought you liked it ! I don 't like it ! I miss my coat . I miss my gnome . Well , hey , I miss my hair ! There 's some things you can 't go back on . We have to tough this out . We did it for the sake of the mission . No ! This was a mistake ! Becoming more average didn 't make us more human ! It made us less ! All my bumps and quirks . That 's what made me so delightfully Harry . Pack up , boys . We 're going home ! Going home ? ! Come on ! We just got this thing together ! I 'll be in the car . Hey , guys . What 's going on ? Sally , uh ... I 've , uh ... I 've made a command decision . We 're moving back . Oh . Is that what we 're doing ? We 're not happy , so we 're just going to break our lease and move ? Yeah . More or less . No , Dick , we can 't do that . You see , I 'm in the majority now . There are more of us than there are of you , and that makes us right . I 'm a member of a community , a community that embraces wholesome American values . And if you cross us ... we will destroy you . [ All gasp ] Now , if you 'll excuse me ... I spotted a mezuzah on 2-C . And clearly , the oversize door knocker on 6-b will set an unfortunate precedent , so I think it behooves all of us to nip this problem in the bud . Hear , hear ! Yeah . That 's right . Great . Ok , the next order of business is- - [ Tinkling ] What 's that noise ? Oh , uh ... I put up Mary 's wind chimes . " Wind chimes " ? Oh , we don 't do that here . No , we do not , flora . Dr. Solomon , take those down right away . Thank you very much . [ Motor running ] Ok- - is that a leaf blower ? Diesel . Well , you can 't run a leaf blower here ! Oh , tell me about it . [ Woof woof ] It scared the hell out of Tommy 's dog . [ Woof woof woof ] Oh , it 's Ok , boy . It 's all right . Let me tell you , when he gets scared , he 's no friend of carpet . This is unacceptable ! You Solomons have been horrible tenants ! I call for an emergency eviction vote ! I second the motion ! All in favor . Well , then it 's unanimous . Bye-bye . Ok , the next order of business would be the hedge committee- - Sally . Uh , yes , Steve ? You live with them . Uh-huh . Oh . Um ... well , can I move in with you ? Nope . But I 'm one of you . No . You 're one of them . Come on , Sally , it 's time . No . Oh ! Oh ! Come on , dear . But I don 't want to go ! Without me , this place is going to be colorful and--and pretty w-With little critters and birdies tweeting all over the place ! You 'll regret this ! Becoming average was interesting , but once we got there , it wasn 't interesting at all . Yeah . I mean , those people who weren 't weird were so ... weird . Then I became like them , which was really weird . Well , live and learn . We 're back to our normal selves . [ Clears throat ] Except for Tommy , who has a little cough . Otherwise , everything 's as it should be . Am I right , fellas ? Oh , yeah . Yeah , sure . Yeah , you 're right . I 'm turning in . Yeah , me , too . Which one of you guys is bunking down with me ? That would be me . Well , don 't hog the blankets because I sleep in the nude . That 's a good idea ! I 'm going to have to try that . You guys want to crash in my van ? Yeah . Yeah . [ Buzz ] [ Buzzing ] What the hell was that ? [ Buzzing approaching ] Whoooo whoo-hoo-hoo ! Oh , ho ho ! Oh , Mary , there 's nothing better than this ! He 's baaaack .

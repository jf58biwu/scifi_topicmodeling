 [ Speaking French ] [ Banging On Metal ] GAUTHIER ? GAUTHIER . GAUTHIER ! GAUTHIER ! [ Banging On Metal ] [ Muffled Shouting ] HOLD THE ELEVATOR . HOLD IT ! HOLD IT ! AGENT SCULLY , CAN I SEE YOU FOR A FEW MINUTES ? - KIMBERLY , WOULD YOU EXCUSE US PLEASE ? - CERTAINLY , SIR . A MEMO CAME ACROSS MY DESK LAST NIGHT . I DEBATED WHETHER OR NOT ... TO CALL YOU AT HOME BUT I DECIDED TO- - AND IT CONCERNS ME ? YES , AND YOUR SISTER . IT 'S BEEN FIVE MONTHS AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO NEW LEADS OR EVIDENCE ... IN HER MURDER INVESTIGATION BY THE D.C. POLICE TEAM OR THE BUREAU . I 'VE BEEN TOLD THE CASE IS TO BE MADE INACTIVE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE . I SEE . I DON 'T THINK THERE 'S ANYTHING TO BE READ INTO THIS . I THINK IT 'S A CASE OF MANPOWER AND WORKLOAD . I WANT YOU TO KNOW , THOUGH , THAT I AM GOING TO APPEAL THIS DECISION , AND I AM GONNA GO BACK OVER ALL THE EVIDENCE AGAIN MYSELF ... TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED . YOU KNOW , IT 'S STRANGE . MEN CAN BLOW UP BUILDINGS AND THEY CAN BE NOWHERE NEAR THE CRIME SCENE , BUT WE CAN PIECE TOGETHER THE EVIDENCE AND CONVICT THEM BEYOND A DOUBT . OUR LABS HERE CAN RECREATE , OUT OF THE MOST MICROSCOPIC DETAIL , THE MOTIVATION AND CIRCUMSTANCE TO ALMOST ANY MURDER , RIGHT DOWN TO A KILLER 'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS HIS MOTHER AND THAT HE WAS A BED WETTER . BUT IN A CASE OF A WOMAN , MY SISTER , WHO WAS GUNNED DOWN IN COLD BLOOD IN A WELL-LIT APARTMENT BUILDING ... BY A SHOOTER WHO LEFT THE WEAPON AT THE CRIME SCENE , WE CAN 'T EVEN PUT TOGETHER ENOUGH TO KEEP ANYBODY INTERESTED . I DON 'T THINK THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH INTEREST . IF I MAY SAY SO , SIR , IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH INTEREST . JUST NOT YOURS ... AND NOT MINE . [ Knock On Door ] YEAH ? SORRY I 'M LATE . - ANYTHING UP ? - NO , IT 'S NOTHING . WHAT DID YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT ? SOMETHING INTERESTING CAME INTO MY ATTENTION LAST NIGHT . A FRENCH SALVAGE SHIP , THEPIPER MARU , LIMPED INTO PORT IN SAN DIEGO YESTERDAY , ALL THE WAY FROM THE NORTH PACIFIC . WHY IS THAT OF INTEREST ? USING THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SATELLITE SYSTEM , I WAS ABLE TO TRACK ITS COURSE . THIS WAS ITS ORIGINAL POSITION . AT LONGITUDE 171 EAST , LATITUDE 42 NORTH . YEAH , THAT 'S WHERE THE BOAT WE KNOW AS THETALAPUS ... PULLED UP WHAT YOU BELIEVE WAS A RUSSIAN SUB , AND WHAT I BELIEVE WAS THE REMAINS OF A UFO . OH , MULDER- - LOOK , SCULLY , I DON 'T KNOW WHAT IT IS , BUT SOMETHING IS STILL DOWN THERE ... AND NOW THE FRENCH ARE LOOKING FOR IT TOO . - SO WHAT ? - SO WHY ALL THE ATTENTION PAID TO THIS SITE ? WHAT INFORMATION ARE THEY ACTING ON ? WHY DON 'T YOU JUST ASK THEM ? I WOULD , BUT THE ENTIRE CREW IS BEING TREATED FOR RADIATION BURNS . FROM EXPOSURE TO WHAT ? THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT IS KEEPING THAT INFORMATION CLASSIFIED . COULD IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEIR RESUMPTION OF NUCLEAR TESTS ? I CHECKED . IT 'S THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY FROM ANY TEST SITE . [ Giggles ] WHAT ? I 'M JUST CONSTANTLY AMAZED BY YOU . I- - YOU 'RE WORKING DOWN HERE IN THE BASEMENT , SIFTING THROUGH FILES AND TRANSMISSIONS ... THAT ANY OTHER AGENT WOULD JUST THROW AWAY IN THE GARBAGE . WELL , THAT 'S WHY I 'M IN THE BASEMENT , SCULLY . YOU 'RE IN THE BASEMENT BECAUSE THEY 'RE AFRAID OF YOU , OF YOUR RELENTLESSNESS , AND BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY COULD DROP YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT ... AND TELL YOU THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE , AND YOU 'D ASK THEM FOR A SHOVEL . IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK OF ME ? WELL , MAYBE NOT A SHOVEL . MAYBE A BACKHOE . THAT 'S GOOD , BECAUSE THERE 'S SOME GARBAGE IN SAN DIEGO ... I WANT YOU TO HELP ME DIG THROUGH . [ Mulder ] DR. SEIZER ? YES . SPECIAL AGENT MULDER . THIS IS AGENT SCULLY . YOU 'RE HERE ABOUT THESE FRENCH SAILORS WITH THE RADIATION EXPOSURE ? HOW ARE THEY DOING ? NOT REAL GOOD . IT 'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE A PROPER COURSE OF TREATMENT , BECAUSE THERE 'S AN AIR OF SECRECY AROUND WHAT HAPPENED . THE SOURCE OF THEIR EXPOSURE IS STILL UNDETERMINED . THESE SYMPTOMS , WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THEM AS ACUTE OR SOMATIC ? I 'M A MEDICAL DOCTOR . THEY 'RE SOMATIC , ALTHOUGH I DON 'T THINK WE 'VE SEEN THE WORST OF IT . THE EFFECTS ARE DEGRADING RAPIDLY , SPONTANEOUS INTERNAL BLEEDING ... IN THE MOUTHS AND INTESTINAL TRACTS , BLOOD IN THE URINE . ALL THESE MEN ARE SUFFERING SEVERE DELIRIUM , THE PRE-ADVANCED STAGES OF COMA . WHAT KIND OF EXPOSURE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE ? TWO HUNDRED , MAYBE FOUR HUNDRED ROENTGENS , WITH A HIGH RATE OF ABSORPTION . THAT 'S VERGING ON THE LEVELS THE VICTIMS OF HIROSHIMA SUFFERED . WHATEVER THESE MEN CAME IN CONTACT WITH , IT WAS MANMADE . LEVELS LIKE THIS JUST DON 'T APPEAR IN NATURE . NOT ON THIS PLANET . DID YOU GET THE CHANCE TO TALK TO ANY OF THEM ? NO , THEY WERE IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE BY THE TIME THEY GOT TO ME , EXCEPT FOR ONE MAN , AND THIS WAS STRANGE , BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY UNAFFECTED . I HELD HIM FOR THE FIRST DAY , BUT I DETECTED NONE OF THE SYMPTOMS OF THE OTHERS . HIS LEUKOCYTES AND ERYTHROCYTES WERE HIGH . ACTUALLY , HE WAS IN VERY GOOD HEALTH . HOW COULD THAT BE ? WITH THAT LEVEL OF RADIATION , HOW COULD ONE MAN NOT BE EXPOSED ? DOESN 'T MAKE ANY SENSE . BUT IT 'S LUCKY FOR THESE MEN BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONE WHO PILOTED THE BOAT IN . AND NONE OF THESE MEN COULD 'VE DONE THAT IN THEIR CONDITION . WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR US TO TALK TO HIM ? YOU COULD IF HE WERE STILL HERE , BUT HE DISCHARGED HIMSELF THIS MORNING . HE 'S A FRENCHMAN , HAS A SAN FRANCISCO ADDRESS , HIS NAME IS GAUTHIER . [ Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Ship Horn Blows ] [ Man ] WATCH THAT PERIMETER ! OKAY , LET 'S WRAP IT UP AND GET IN THE TRUCK . [ Scully ] I 'M GETTING NO ANSWER AT THIS MAN GAUTHIER 'S HOME NUMBER . TRY THE I.N.S. OR THE FRENCH CONSULATE , SEE WHAT YOU CAN PULL ON HIM . RIGHT THERE ! [ Scully ] YES , COULD I HAVE THE NUMBER FOR THE FRENCH CONSULATE PLEASE ? AGENTS MULDER AND SCULLY , F.B.I. I 'M WAYNE MORGAN . - I 'M WITH THE NAVY 'S INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES UNIT . - HAVE YOU TURNED ANYTHING UP ? NO , NOTHING , BUT I 'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT I 'M SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR . THE CREW OF THIS SHIP IS BEING TREATED FOR RADIATION . YEAH , WE GOT ALL THAT . WE HAD A HAZMAT TEAM PORING OVER THE BOAT . - DIDN 'T FIND A TRACE . - NOTHING ? WE HAVE DIVERS IN THE WATER GOING OVER THE HULL , PUT PROBES DOWN THE BILGE . COULDN 'T DETECT THE SLIGHTEST LEVEL . SO IT 'S OKAY FOR US TO GO ON BOARD ? SURE . PROBABLY GET MORE RADIATION OFF YOUR CELL PHONE . [ Morgan ] GENERATOR 'S BACK UP . THAT BETTER ? YEAH . THANKS . IS THIS THE WAY YOU FOUND THIS ROOM ? NOTHING 'S BEEN TOUCHED , NOT SINCE SHE 'S BEEN TIED UP HERE ANYWAY . IT 'S A MESS , HUH ? FEELS LIKE HOME . FEELS LIKE SOMEBODY WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING . ANY IDEA WHAT ? NO . I 'M LOOKING FOR THE V.C.R. WHAT FOR ? THE DIVE SUIT HAS A VIDEO CAMERA . [ Morgan ] WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ? LOOKS LIKE THE FUSELAGE OF A PLANE . IT 'S A NORTH AMERICAN P-51 MUSTANG . YEAH , IT SURE IS . I JUST GOT VERY TURNED ON . IT 'S THE SHAPE OF THE CANOPY . I USED TO WATCH MY FATHER AND BROTHERS PUT TOGETHER ... WORLD WAR II MODEL PLANES AS A KID . [ Mulder ] WOULD IT HAVE BEEN CARRYING ANYTHING RADIOACTIVE ? NO . IT WAS JUST A FIGHTER . THEN WHAT WAS IT THOSE MEN WERE EXPOSED TO ? I DON 'T KNOW , BUT I MIGHT KNOW SOMEBODY I CAN ASK . [ Door Opens ] YOU 'RE HOME ! I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU ! WHY DIDN 'T YOU CALL ME ? THERE WERE THESE MEN HERE FROM THE CONSULATE . THEY SAID THERE 'D BEEN AN ACCIDENT .

I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT A PLANE THAT 'S BEEN DISCOVERED . - DISCOVERED ? - YES . A P-51 MUSTANG ... AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN WITH THE , UH , CALL NUMBERS JTT0 111470 . WELL , THOSE ARE NOT THE CALL NUMBERS OF P-51 . THERE WAS AN ILLUSTRATION ON THE FUSELAGE WITH THE WORDS " DROP DEAD RED . " I 'M SORRY . WOULD THE WORDS " ZEUS FABER " MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU ? NO , BUT AS I SAID , SOMETIMES MY MEMORY IS NOT SO SHARP . WELL , WOULD YOU KNOW ANYBODY I MIGHT BE ABLE TO TALK TO ? SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE ME THAT INFORMATION ? I WISH I COULD HELP YOU . I WISH YOU COULD TOO . THERE 'S A NUMBER OF FRENCH SAILORS WHO MAY DIE FROM RADIATION EXPOSURE . IF WE KNEW MORE ABOUT THE PLANE , WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY . ANYWAY , IT WAS VERY GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN , SIR . OH , SAY HELLO TO YOUR FATHER FOR ME . I WISH I COULD . HE 'S PASSED AWAY . I 'M- - I 'M VERY SORRY .

IT HELPS TO REMEMBER THESE THINGS WHEN A MAN LOOKS FORWARD TO HIS CAREER , TO HIS PLANS FOR FUTURE . [ Johansen ] WE ALL JOINED THINKING WE 'D COME HOME HEROES . THAT 'S ME . THE REST OF THE MEN IN THE PICTURE , A MONTH LATER , THEY WERE ALL DEAD . THE MADNESS WE PLANNED TO UNLEASH ON THE JAPANESE , WE ENDED UP SETTING IT LOOSE ON OURSELVES . - RADIATION KILLED THOSE MEN ? - THE MEN YOU SAY HAD BURNS ON THEIR BODIES , THAT 'S HOW IT BEGAN WITH US . AWFUL BURNS . [ Johansen Narrating ] WE 'D FOUND THE SUNKEN SQUADRON ... WHEN A JAPANESE DESTROYER MOVED INTO THE AREA . [ Rumbling ] BUT RATHER THAN ATTEMPT TO RETURN HOME , CAPTAIN SANFORD ORDERED US TO GO TO SILENT RUNNING . AFTER THREE DAYS , THE BURNS STARTED TO APPEAR . BAKER GOT THEM FIRST , THEN VORCE AND INNOCENTI . NO ONE HAD SEEN BURNS LIKE THESE BEFORE , BUT A LOT OF US BEGAN TO SUSPECT THEY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE PLANES ... THAT WE 'D BEEN SENT TO RECOVER . THE MEN WERE ALL FRIGHTENED OF DYING . AS THE X.O. , I URGED THE CAPTAIN TO RETURN TO PORT , BUT AGAINST ALL REASON AND GOOD SENSE , HE REFUSED TO LEAVE THE AREA . CAPTAIN SANFORD ? I 'M NOT AN M.D. , BUT I KNOW A LOST CAUSE WHEN I SEE ONE . THESE MEN ARE ALL DYING , AND THERE 'S NOTHING THAT I CAN DO TO STOP IT . JUST DO YOUR DAMN JOB . SIR , I 'M TRYING , BUT IF WE STAY DOWN HERE ANY LONGER , NONE OF US ARE GOING HOME . YOU 'RE THE X.O. YOU 'VE GOTTA GET US TO THE SURFACE . WE ARE UNDER THE CAPTAIN 'S ORDERS .

[ Man ] WE 'RE ALL GONNA DIE ! ALL OF US ! WE 'RE DYING ! CAN 'T YOU ALL SEE THAT ? YOU 'VE GOTTA GET US OUT OF HERE ! [ Johansen Narrating ] OUR SILENCE HAD BEEN SHATTERED BY THE GUNSHOT . THE ONLY COMMAND THAT COULD SAVE US FROM THE JAPANESE DESTROYER NOW ... WAS THE COMMAND TO RETURN HOME , AN ORDER I KNEW THE CAPTAIN WOULD NEVER ISSUE . JOHANSEN ! OPEN THIS DOOR ! [ Banging On Door ] OPEN THIS DOOR ! JOHANSEN ! [ Johansen Narrating ] I KNEW MUTINY WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE FOR SURVIVAL . BUT I ALSO KNEW , BY SEALING THAT DOOR , I WAS SEALING THE FATE OF THE MEN LOCKED BEHIND IT . BY LUCK OR THE GRACE OF GOD , WE MADE IT TO PEARL HARBOR . WHAT HAPPENED TO SANFORD AND THE SICK CREWMEN ? WHEN THEY OPENED THAT DOOR , THOSE THAT WERE NOT DEAD WERE DYING . THERE WERE 144 MEN ON THAT BOAT . ONLY SEVEN OF US SURVIVED . WHATEVER KILLED THEM , I WAS ALLOWED TO LIVE , TO RAISE A FAMILY , TO GROW OLD . NONE OF US EVER GOT AN EXPLANATION WHY . THIS SEAT TAKEN , MISS KALLENCHUK ? GERALDINE KALLENCHUK , ISN 'T IT ?

 Can 't keep going like this . You can 't keep pushing us like this , Ed . Your daughter ... - We 're close now . - We passed by a lake . - We need water . - We 'll have water . And food . - Much as we can eat . - So you keep saying but we don 't seem to be finding it . You heard the radio . Twelve men , an entire unit . The transmission just stopped . They 're out here . - Maybe they 're all dead . - Like we 're gonna be soon . Not if we find their supplies , find them before anybody else . I 'm thirsty , Daddy . MOTHER : Ed ? Ed ? What 's happening to us , Ed ? We 're sick . Real sick . Where 's my baby ? Lizzie ! What ? - What is it , Ed ? Is it Lizzie ? - Get up ! - I can 't . - You 've gotta get up ! What do you want with us ? HOBBES : A world exists exactly like ours . You live in this world . Your family and friends . And though you may not know it , I was sent to save you . Main Title It 's just a game . Whiskey-Three-Four , this is Whiskey-Zero-Four . Over . MAN : We 've got no signs of activity , sir . No signs of anything at all in this sector . Over . - Report , lieutenant . - We found nothing , sir . No sign of life . - Why are you here ? - Sir ? - Taking your own orders now ? - We 've been searching for days . - Then keep searching . - Permission to speak freely , sir . You sent us here to conduct a ground search for men who are highly qualified a unit that 's extremely capable and trained for survival . Yet there 's been no distress signal , no radio contact . Has it occurred to you that maybe these men don 't want to be found , sir ? Do you know what the punishment is for desertion under Santiago Law ? Yes , sir . Then pray , for their sake , they 're already dead . [ MAN MUMBLING OVER RADIO ] It 's Waters . I got a clear shot . Make it three against five . Then what , genius ? These woods are crawling with Republican Guards . - A shot now would be suicide . - Suicide 's just being out here out of water , even deeper into the forest . - We haven 't eaten since yesterday . - Stick with the program , Hobbes . We 're out here to find that unit , grab their food and weapons , and go . We just gotta find them before Waters does . [ TWIG BREAKS ] Florence ? You gotta be kidding me . Keep that kid quiet . What 's your name ? She 's sick , isn 't she ? Can you heal her ? Hey . - What 's wrong with her ? - You 're asking me ? Great , three men and a baby . MAN OVER RADIO : They 'll be spreading out through the forest , northwest . No sign here . Lieutenant ! Over here , sir ! I found her just sitting here , sir . - Who is she ? - I don 't know , sir . Hi there . Are you hurt ? Are you lost ? We 're looking for a group of soldiers dressed like us . You think you might know where we can find them ? Let 's get her to a vehicle . - Take care of her , she 's just a little girl . - Yes , sir . What ? - She 's just a kid . - She 's another mouth to feed . Oh , for crying out loud ! Something 's wrong with that kid . Why won 't she drink ? You 're afraid , aren 't you ? Water made me sick . Mommy and Daddy too . - What happened to them ? - Men came and took them . I ran . Where ? Where was this ? Stay with her . - There 's your unit , what 's left of them . - These guys ? Santiago 's elite soldiers , believe it or not . I don 't get it . Looks like they 're unarmed . They got packs . If nothing else , it means they got food . [ GUN COCKS ] Not one word . On your knees . Get your hands behind your head . What do we got here ? Yogi , Boo Boo and a picnic basket . Hope you remembered knives and forks because it looks to me like you forgot your weapons . - Where 's your food and water ? - We have no food or water . - What are you doing here ? - Gathering wood and kindling . - Where 's the rest of your unit ? - We 've all laid down our weapons . - You 're deserters ? - Yes . PINOCCHIO : Good thing we found you before Santiago . - Penalty for desertion is execution . - We don 't live by those rules anymore . We live by a new code . We can show you what we mean . Let us take you back to our camp . We have food there . It 's more than you can eat . [ DEXTER GROWLING ] [ DEXTER BARKING ] Please don 't shoot . We won 't harm you . I just want my little girl . Don 't have to be afraid . It 's okay . I think she just wants her mommy . It 's okay , sweetheart . Don 't you want your dolly ? LIEUTENANT : Radio Whiskey-Zero-Three . Tell them our location . GUARDSMAN : Yes , sir . This is where they are , the men who look like us ? - This is where you saw them ? - Yes . I don 't get it , sir . What is she showing us ? I don 't know . HOBBES : What the hell is this place ? I don 't know . But whatever it is , it won 't last long out here . I 'd like you to meet someone . If you wait here ... I smell food . Smells like barbecue . You smell that ? It smells like trouble . I don 't like this place , Hobbes . It gives me the creeps . Like Jonestown . MAN : Hello . You look tired , hungry . - You 're welcome to what we have here . - What 's the catch ? There is no catch . We require no payment . All we ask is that you observe our philosophy of nonviolence . PINOCCHIO : Nice philosophy . You ought to make up shirts with a bull 's-eye on the back . Our strength is our spirit . We know the threat from Santiago , but we refuse to accept it . That 's what drew these men to us . We 'd like to accept your hospitality but someone is wondering where we are , someone who 's sick . Your friends are already here . Great . What 's for chow ? All we ask is that you lay down your weapons . Not a chance in hell . Come here . PINOCCHIO : No way , Hobbes . - No . We 've got a long way to go . We 've gotta eat . - I don 't like it . - I don 't like it either . But I 'm hungry . Food better be damn good . How 's the soup ? Is good . Is very good . Good meat . [ CHATTERING ] What are you afraid of ? These people are unarmed . They 're eating the same food we are . I 'm not afraid of anything . Come on , honey , let the people eat . You come with your mommy . That kid knows something . - Hobbes , wait ... - What are you doing ? Look around . - Nobody 's eating . - Well , I am . - That was my dinner ! - Something 's wrong . [ DOOR SQUEAKS ] HOBBES : Republican Guard . You see ? Like you , these men have given up their weapons . They wouldn 't desert Santiago in a million years . Not for this . - Not for anything . - You did . This stinks , I 'm telling you . - Then explain it to me . - I can 't . You just gotta trust me on this one . Let 's get out of here . We won 't make it . Traveling at night without food , without water ... You need rest . We all need rest . We head out first thing in the morning . You 're not going to sleep either ? How long you been in Harsh Realm ? Weeks ? A month ? Two ? I 've seen stuff . More than you . These people are not what they appear to be . - Then who are they ? - I don 't know . - They 're unarmed . - So are you . You think of that ? I 'll take second watch . You 're a prince . MAN 1 : Move back those vehicles and clear the area . MAN 2 : Yes , sir . Move out . There . Over there . Move up . Hold your positions . Must be the kid they found , sir , the little girl they radioed about . - Where are my men ? - There . - Where ? - In the lake . What are they doing there ? You 're lying to me , aren 't you ? She 's trying to lure us down to the lake . What just happened ? What the hell was that ? PINOCCHIO : Hey . Can I talk to you a minute ? [ TWIG BREAKS ] What ? She 's got no fever but she 's still afraid . Of what ? Where 's Pinocchio ? He was supposed to wake me . Pinocchio ? - Pinocchio ? LEADER : You looking for your friend ? What happened to him ? - We only heard you calling . - No , you were out here already . You 're mistaken if you think we mean you or your friends any harm . - I 'd like my gun back . - I 'm afraid they were destroyed . Give me my damn gun . I told you we allowed no violence or guns here . Your friend kept a gun . He broke the rules . PINOCCHIO : Hobbes . What 's the problem ? What 's the problem ? - Where have you been ? - I took a walk . We 've gotta get out of here and back to the car . - Why ? - Why ? For all of the reasons you 've said . Something 's wrong with these people . Hold on a second . Just calm down . Don 't tell me to calm down . They 've destroyed our weapons . HOBBES : Pinocchio . Hey , buddy . Florence . Something 's wrong . Something 's happened to Pinocchio . I don 't know , he 's just not himself . I need you to watch him close . I 'm gonna go get the car . I 'll be back for you , all right ? LIZZIE : I don 't wanna go ! Put me down ! I don 't wanna go ! Put me down ! Let me go ! [ LIZZIE SCREAMING ] LIZZIE : Just put me down ! [ CAR APPROACHES ] Pinocchio . - What 's he doing out here ? - I don 't know , sir . - What do you know , sergeant ? - Lf you 'd like a technical diagnostic ... What the hell is going on ? The little girl , the lake ... - I 've lost two units out here , sergeant . - The lake isn 't on our maps . - There 's an error in the data . - An error ? In the game . When Harsh Realm was created the programmers had a three-percent error rate . Something may be altering or overriding the program . - Altering it how ? - I don 't know , sir . You 've told me everything you don 't know , sergeant . Why don 't you come to me when you do know , so I can destroy it . Pinocchio ! Florence ! Pinocchio . Pinocchio . Republican Guard . Waters . Five miles from here . The car . They 'll be coming . We 've gotta leave . We 've gotta go . - We 're unarmed . - We 're ready for them . Look , you 've gotta listen to me . You don 't know what you 're saying . You 're being affected by some kind of programming aberration . Nobody 's going anywhere . We 're all staying here . Then you 're all gonna die . It 's suicide . Pinocchio . Republican Guards are coming . Pinocchio won 't listen . We need our weapons . What are you doing with me ? Florence ! Pinocchio ! [ GROANING ] MAN 1 : Move it ! Move it ! MAN 2 : Hands on your heads ! MAN 1 : Move out , and check the wood line ! MAN 3 : Line them up ! MAN 1 : Everybody , come on , move it ! Come on , let 's go ! Let 's go ! Who 's gonna tell me what 's going on here ? - We do not believe in your methods . - I was talking to my men ! - Hear us out . We can feed you . - I want answers ! This is your doing , isn 't it ? - What have you done to my men ? - Your men brought us here . Then where 's Hobbes ? Where 's Tom Hobbes ? I 'm looking for a man named Hobbes . If anyone would like to come forward and tell me where he is I 'll spare your life . If not , we 'll begin executions , starting with the deserters then the rest of you , one by one . You 've got an hour , then I start lining you up . What 's happening to us ? Our images were scanned by the lake , copied into new files . Copies which are now luring people to the lake to make new copies . - Why are we getting weak ? - I think our information 's being drained . - Slowly being stolen by the doubles . - That 's what happened to the girl . Why Florence couldn 't heal her . The lake 's a programming screwup with its own digital mission to multiply and replicate . All that nonviolence crap is because the copies are fragile easily erased . - Why don 't they just kill us ? - Because they need us . For what ? Bait . Have meat . It 's good meat . GUARDSMAN : Major . Get up . Pinocchio , you can 't give up ! Florence ! - We 're too weak . - No . Listen to me , you can 't give up . You gotta keep trying . They got us divided , Hobbes , split up . That 's how they want us to die . In cages , unable to help each other . But the little girl got well . Come on , don 't give up . We gotta keep trying . Right there ! Right there , Hobbes . Check him . Pat him down . You were always a brave man , Tom , but never stupid . Why give yourself up ? Those men were ready to die to protect you . They mean you no harm . Lay down your weapon . Join us . This isn 't gonna work . You may not believe in our philosophy , but it 's served us well . We 've attracted many who have grown tired of living in fear in Harsh Realm . Who are you ? Because you 're not Tom Hobbes . - Those men out there are my men . SERGEANT : Major Waters . Something in the food , sir . I know where they are . Down here ! Your mom and dad are sick , and I can help them . Can you open this door first ? Can you do that ? [ COUGHS ] Get us out of here . Please . They 're butchers . They 're killing us . We 're never gonna make it , not like this . - What are you doing ? - I 'm gonna go get us killed . LIEUTENANT : Don 't leave us ! Please don 't leave us ! - Please don 't leave us ! - Shut up ! - Hobbes and Pinocchio , were they here ? - Yes . [ GUNSHOTS ] Seal off the camp ! Find them ! MAN : I see him ! [ TRUCK STARTS ] Florence , you see him ? Go , go , go ! Go ! Go ! [ GUNSHOTS ] Hit it ! WATERS : On your feet ! Everybody up ! You think you can kill us all , just like that ? We don 't live by the sword you wear so proudly . Erase these mistakes at once . We 're part of the program , just like you . You 'll never get rid of us . Never ! There 's food back here . Water too . Ammunition . Enough for a week , maybe more . It 's more than we need . Take it . - What are you doing ? - That little girl saved our lives . The rest belongs to them . Thank you . Go ahead . Take the truck while you 're at it . We 're gonna starve out here . - You said it yourself . - You had your chance to eat . It 's like the man said , " Our strength is our spirit .

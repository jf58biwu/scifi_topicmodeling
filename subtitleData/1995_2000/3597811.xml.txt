 All right , let 's shoot this , Marty . Hold it still . [ Bug buzzing ] Hold it still , Sloan . I 'd like to see you hold it still . The sooner they pave over this swamp , the better . It 's not a swamp . You 're standing in a forest with indigenous plant and animal species ... You 're obviously too ignorant to appreciate . Mark it . Give me another position . Let 's shoot this one carefully . This is where they 're gonna put the blockbuster . You 're a real moron , Sloan . You know that ? Tree hugger . You should be sad to see the demise of an ecosystem that 's lasted a thousand years . We all should be . Give me four feet to your left . I can 't . What do you mean , you can 't ? I mean I can 't because it 's stuck . Then unstick it . This is weird . [ Screaming ] Sloan ? Sloan ? [ Panting ] [ Bug buzzing ] [ Screaming ] Louis , let Bo do the work . How 's he gonna find a possum ? Shh . Animals sense things that we can 't . That 's how they survive . Is that how Bo knows how to hunt ? Yep . Our ancestors were hunters too , but most of us have lost those instincts . That 's why we need a little help . Dad , what 's that ? Surveyor 's equipment . Someone left his stuff out here . [ Barking ] [ Barking continues ] Stay close , Louis . [ Dog whimpering ] What is it , dad ? Dad ? Bo . Come here , Bo . What- - Quiet ! [ Rustling ] Listen to me . I want you to take Bo and run straight home . What 's the matter ? I want you to run straight home , And I don 't want you to stop for anything . - Louis , you understand ? - I just- - All right , go . [ Rustling ] Come on , Bo , come on ! [ Rifle shot ] [ Rifle shot ] Bo , no , no ! Come on , Bo , come on ! [ Barking ] Come on ! Come on ! [ Man ] last year was something of a personal revelation . We were doing an exercise called " team builders , " Where we were given two minutes to build a tower ... Out of ordinary office furniture . When I stood on mike 's shoulders and I put that electric pencil sharpener ... On top of the pile , we both knew- - We could never have done it alone . Kill me now . You ever been to one of these team seminars , agent Scully ? Um , I think I went to a constructive problem-Solving course ... When I first joined the bureau . Did you play that game where you can 't use any negative words ? I couldn 't believe how hard it was not to use the word " but . " I 'm having that same problem right now ! Have you ever been to a team seminar , agent Mulder ? No . Unfortunately around this time of year ... I always develop a severe hemorrhoidal condition . Well , it builds muscles you didn 't even know you had . Communication . That 's the key . Sorry , folks . It 'll be a few minutes . - What 's going on , officer ? - Got a little situation , is all . Thank you , Jesus . Where 's he going ? Oh , excuse me ! Are you from search and rescue ? No , I 'm sorry . I 'm just stretching my legs . They said they 'd have word what happened to my husband . I need somebody to tell me what 's going on . Just slow down . I don 't know what you 're talking about . My husband , Michael , he was teaching our son to shoot . He said the dog got spooked , and then he heard gunshots . Now they 've found a jacket with blood on it , but they won 't tell me about my husband . I 'll try to find out who 's in charge , all right ? Thank you . Now where 's he going ? Hey , stonecypher , take a look at this . This tree was here 20 years before Ponce De Leon landed . We 're gonna be late for the wine and cheese reception . [ Man ] officer Fazekas ? Yes ? - Can I help you ? - My name is Fox Mulder . I 'm an agent with the F.B.I. F.B.I. ? Who called you guys out ? Nobody . We got stopped at your roadblock . Sounds like you have a shooting . Shots were reported , but we have no evidence of anyone being shot . What do you have evidence of ? A survey team working these woods didn 't report in last night . We found one man 's bloody jacket , pretty torn up . And this morning , a boy got separated from his father . Separated by what ? It looks maybe ... Like some kind of animal attack . What kind of animal ? I 'm not sure yet . I followed good tracks for the two surveyors , But the trails became confused as they moved into the brush . There was a third set of tracks leading away ... I couldn 't identify . Couldn 't identify as the surveyors ' ? As man or animal . - Mulder ? - Just , uh- - H-Hold on a second . What about the boy 's father ? I tracked him all the way down to where he fired the shot . The ground 's rocky , but from the depressions in the underlying soil , I can tell you that he entered the bushes from over there ... Where I pick up another set of tracks , Two distinctly different set of tracks that from the way ... The ground 's upset , is probably where the man was attacked . But no other sign of him ? You have panther in these woods ? There 's panther , bear . But these tracks look like neither of those . No , sir . You know of a good motel in the area ? Excuse me . I think we can handle this very well on our own . Thanks . Mulder ? We 've got this conference . They 're waiting . Yeah . How do I say this without using any negative words , Scully ? You want me to tell them that you 're not gonna make it to this year 's teamwork seminar . See ? We don 't need that conference . We have communication like that unspoken . You know what I 'm thinking . [ Laughing ] Look ! He 's all eaten away . How do you like that , eh ? [ TV off ] He 's not coming back , is he ? Now , why would you say that ? Dad 's a good shot . If he hit what he was aiming at , he 'd be home by now . You gotta be brave , Louis . We both gotta be brave . We 'll find out more about it in the morning . Get some sleep now . [ Whimpering ] [ Knocking on door ] It 's open . Who cut the cheese ? Since you won 't be making it to the conference . Mmm ! Par-Tay ! However , I must remind you , this goes against the bureau 's policy ... Of male and female agents consorting in the same motel room while on assignment . Try any of that " tailhook " crap on me , Scully , I 'll kick your ass . It 's a pop quiz . What animal will attack the strongest , leaving the weakest to escape ? The answer is " none . " Not one of the over 4,000 species native to north America ... Will attack the strongest when the weak is vulnerable . And what does that have to do with anything ? It makes me think that what we 're dealing with here is no ordinary predator . I thought this was a ploy to get out of the conference . I think what we 've stumbled upon here is something more than local authorities realize . The scenario described by that boy sounds to me like a primitive culling technique . We 're in Western Florida . The closest thing to primitive down here ... Is living in a beachfront retirement condo . Those woods are as old as anything in the south . There 's 800 square miles of it . There 's no telling what 's alive out there . Where are you going ? I 've gotta check something out . Sometimes I think some work on your communication skills wouldn 't be such a bad idea . I 'll be back soon , and we can build a tower of furniture . Okay ? [ Barking ] [ Whining , barking ] What is it , Bo ? [ Barking ] Mom ? It 's all right , Louis . You go back to sleep now . [ Barking ] [ Barking ] Bo ? Bo ? Bo , where 'd you get to ? [ Rustling ] Bo , is that you ? - [ Growls ] - [ Gasps ] Come home , boy . Let 's go back in . [ Growling ] - [ Barking ] - All right , all right . Stay there the night . Louis ? [ Pounding on door ] Louis ? Louis ! Louis ! Louis ! Louis ! Louis ! Mom ! [ Screaming ] what is it , Louis ? It 's in the house . How 's it going ? He 's still freaked out . I might have some insight into this invisible creature he said was chasing him . The invisible man was invisible . Right . He said he was chased by a creature with glowing red eyes . Let me show you something . Mrs. Asekoff said she went outside with the dog . When she came back , the door was locked from the inside . And ? Look at this . We got some tracks here . Where ? Here and here . Dried mud against the tile , Tracked in from the outside . It could 've been brought in by the dog . No , no . You see the ball of the foot here ? A large foot . - And I count five toes . - Wait , I thought you said it wasn 't human . I 'm not saying it is . The weight distribution is all wrong . People walk heel to toe . Whatever this thing is , walks on the ball of its foot . You 're putting me on . No . My dad and I were Indian guides . I know these things . So if it 's not man and it 's not animal , what the hell is it ? Guess I 'm a little late to this dance . I found some tracks ... right here . Same as I saw before . Where was that ? In the woods . Weight distribution 's strange . They appear to be human , But whoever left these uses the balls of his feet more like an animal . Whatever it is , it 's attacked three grown men presumably in broad daylight , Disposing of its prey without detection . And it wasn 't shy last night about coming out of the woods to try again . What we 've got is a predator with low visibility and a high degree of motivation . It 's got one advantage we don 't have- - The entire Apalachicola national forest . Then how do you stop it ? By identifying it . Finding it before it finds somebody else . It 's called a " flir " for forward looking infrared . It was developed for chopper pilots in Vietnam . Detects body heat at 300 yards . That 's pretty sophisticated for government issue . I see you two have met . Jeff 's our local tech-Head . Some people prefer searching with dogs . I prefer an extra pair of hands if I get in trouble . Are we ready to go ? Once we start in , you can put away your cell phones . The only communication in these woods is with shortwave radios . So , stay close , maintain visual contact . If you get lost , initiate oral contact . That means holler . If nobody responds , sit down , don 't move . I will find you . Don 't go looking for me . I know it sounds obvious , but folks still get lost . Okay . I gotcha . Thank you . All right . Local P.D. Has all their resources looking out for a transient , A drifter who 's wanted for a double homicide in Gasden , Alabama . They were amused when I told them what we were doing . I don 't think it 's a drifter . We may be looking for two individuals . Why do you say that ? That thing lured that woman out of the house ... To separate her from her son . For what purpose ? Divide and conquer . If your enemy has greater numbers than you ... You divide and conquer to diminish those numbers . What enemy would that be ? Encroaching development . That 's what I suspected when I went to check on Louis and his mother . This is about a housing tract ? That survey team was staking out a new 100,000 acre plot . Civilization 's pushing very hard into these woods . Maybe something in these woods is pushing back . Anything ? No . Nothing at all , not even wildlife . Isn 't that a little strange ? Yeah . This forest is usually alive with sound . I 'm not an expert , but I 've never seen it like this before . Sure is beautiful , though . That 's what happens . People get to looking around , next thing they know something eats them . What do you think killed those men ? Nature is populated by creatures either trying to kill something they need to survive , Or trying to avoid being killed by something that needs them to survive . If we become blinded by the beauty of nature , we may fail to see ... Its cruelty and violence . Walt Whitman ? No . When animals attack on the Fox network . Wait , I 've got something . It 's about 20 yards ahead . Where ? I don 't see it . It 's just sitting there . It 's on the move ! It 's moving fast ! It 's-It 's going to the right ! Wait ! There 's two of them now . They 're moving in opposite directions . There and there . Where is it ? About 40 yards ahead of you . I don 't see it . Now it 's gone . I don 't know where it went . What is it ? I don 't know . They 're trying to separate us , pull us away from the others . Let 's go back . [ Gasps ] Michelle ? Michelle ? [ Rustling ] [ Rustling ] Mulder , I need help ! [ Rustling ] Mulder ! Scully ! Over here ! Scully ? Over here . What happened ? I don 't know . Where 's Fazekas ? She was walking ahead of me . She was right here , and then she was just gone . I 'm getting no reading . - What the hell 's happening here ? - They separated us . That was on purpose . They divided us so they could go after her . She was in the lead , and presumably the strongest . They take the strongest first . Take them where ? You can 't just disappear out here . You 're right . We gotta find her . How are we gonna do that ? I don 't know ! Form a line and beat the bushes . Maybe you 'll pick up a signal . No , we need help . We need manpower . That 's not gonna work out here . We need to get outta here ! Listen to me . The longer we wait , the less chance we have of finding her . This is nuts . This is looney tune , man . We gotta go back out of these woods before it gets dark . Okay , you 're right . You go back . You leave me the flir , and you go back . We gotta go together . We have to find her . Yeah , well , if we stay here , they may not find any of us . Mulder , he 's right . We weren 't prepared for this . We have no way of telling them where we are . We don 't have any food . Michelle had our only water . I 'd like to find her too , but I think the risks of that are way too foolish . All right , we all go then . You lead the way . I don 't have much faith that this device will do us any good . So far , all it 's done is split us up . Whatever it is we 're chasing , did show up on the screen at first . What does that tell you ? Nothing , except we 're going in the right direction . Maybe it can regulate its temperature . You don 't know of any animal that can ? Ticks . I 've heard they can halt their metabolism ... For up to 18 years , essentially going into suspended animation ... Until something warm-Blooded comes along . That 's interesting . Why is that interesting ? Thirty years ago , the town of point pleasant , west Virginia , Was terrorized for over a year by something . Killing livestock , terrorizing the people . Witnesses described them as primitive-Looking men with red-Piercing eyes . Became known as the " moth men . " I 've got an X - File dating back to 1952 on it . What would that be filed next to ? " The cockroach that ate Cincinnati " ? The cockroach that ate Cincinnati is in the " c 's . " Moth men 's over in the " m 's . " This isn 't the way . What do you mean ? Michelle always marks her route with little white stones . This is the same path . This is the way we came . I haven 't seen one of her stones for 20 minutes . That 's because you 've had your nose glued to that screen the whole time . I 'm telling you , we 're on the wrong trail . Somehow we got off track . Oh , man , this is not happening . This is not happening . Everybody stand still . There 's something out there . Where ? About 40 or 50 yards out . Jeff ? Nothing . I saw it . The woods have gone silent again . [ Rustling ] I got it ! I got it on my screen . Where ? Where ! About 30 yards ahead . It 's just sitting there . What is he doing ? [ Scully ] talk to him . This is not a good idea . Talk to him , Jeff ! Go to your right . It just disappeared . [ Scully ] Mulder , it 's not on the screen . [ Mulder ] Scully , I lost it . [ Scully ] I got it ! - Did you hit it ? - I don 't know . It just stopped . Where 's Glaser ? - How many shots did you fire ? - Six , maybe seven . That your only clip ? Yep . Don 't fire again unless you 're sure you 're gonna hit it . It may be trying to spend our advantage . What the hell is it , Mulder ? I don 't know . But whatever it is , it 's smarter than us . At least out here . - [ Gasps ] - Mulder ? Mulder ! Scully ! Scully ! Mulder ? Scully ! You okay ? You were an Indian guide . Help me out here . Indian guide says maybe you should run to the store and get some matches . I would , but I left my wallet in the car . What are you doing ? Trying to open my gun . If I can separate the shell from the casing , maybe I can get the powder to ignite . And maybe it 'll start raining weenies and marshmallows . Do I detect a hint of negativity ? No ! Yes , actually . Yeah . Mulder , you need to keep warm . Your body 's still in shock . I was told once that the best way to regenerate body heat ... Is to crawl naked into a sleeping bag with somebody else who was already naked . Maybe if it rained sleeping bags , you 'll get lucky . You ever thought seriously about dying ? Once when I was at the ice capades . When I was fighting my cancer , I was angry at the injustice of it ... And its meaninglessness . Then I realized that that was a struggle- - To give it meaning ... To make sense of it . It 's like life . I think nature is supremely indifferent to whether we live or die . I mean , if you 're lucky you get 75 years , if you 're really lucky you get 80 . If you 're extraordinarily lucky , you get 50 of those years with a decent head of hair . I guess it is like Las Vegas . The house always wins . Oh ! ? Ta-Da ? Go , girl . [ Mulder ] hey , who did you identify with when you were a kid- - Wilma or Betty ? I identified with betty 's bustline . Yes ! I did too . I could never have been married to Barney , though . The kids were cute . Yeah , but where are they today ? " Moth men " ? Really ? Yeah . But there seem to be only two of ' em . I don 't wanna wrestle . Get over here . I 'm gonna try and keep you warm . Sorry . One of us has got to stay awake , Scully . You sleep , Mulder . If you get tired , you wake me . I 'm not gonna get tired . Why don 't you sing something ? No , Mulder . If you sing something , I 'll know you 're awake . You don 't want me to sing . I can 't carry a tune . It doesn 't matter . Just sing anything . ? ? Jeremiah was a bullfrog ? ? Was a good friend of mine ? ? Never understood a single word he said ? ? But I helped him drink his wine ? Chorus . ? Joy ... to the world ? ? All the boys and girls ? ? ? Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea ? ? ? Joy to you and me ? Scully ? Here . Over here ! What are you doing ? Looking for food . I found some wild berries . I wouldn 't go far . Mulder , you never left my sight . [ Groan ] Scully ? Scully ? Scully ? Scully ! Down here ! Where ? I fell down a hole . [ Coughing ] You all right ? Yeah . I landed on soft dirt . Kind of . What 's down there ? I don 't know . It 's pretty dark . [ Gasps ] Scully , what 's going on ? You okay ? - I found Michelle . - Is she alive ? Not for much longer . Mulder , we have to get her out of here . - Is there a way out ? - I don 't know . I- - I 'm in some kind of a chamber . There 's- - It 's like ... Some kind of network . - Mulder ? - Yeah ? I 'm not alone . I don 't have my weapon ! Mulder ! Hold on . I 'm gonna drop my gun down . [ Rustling ] - Ow ! - Jesus ! - Mulder , are you okay ? - Don 't mind me . Scully ! Mulder , look . There has to be a scientific explanation for this . [ Groaning ] Too bad we don 't have any office furniture . If they could see us now . Go , team . A hundred more bodies and we 'll win the honey baked ham . [ Man ] agent Mulder ! We 're down here ! We 're down here ! What are you doing down there ? We 've got injured people down here . We need a ladder . Right away . Hey , over here . [ Siren wailing ] Dad 's gonna be okay . It 's gonna be okay . It 's gonna be fine . I 'm just gonna say good - Bye . [ Siren wailing ] Well , we just got all the thanks when you did all the work . On the contrary , agent Kinsley . We would 've never gotten involved in this if not for you . Really ? Yeah . You see this ? Yeah , I pointed that out to agent stonecypher on the drive down . There was something in the cave that Scully fell into , an inscription . " Ad noctum . " That 's Latin . Yeah . It means , " into darkness . " The Spanish conquistadors used to carve it on the post ... That they would lash the natives to as a warning . So , who are you saying wrote this ? Ponce De Leon came here 450 years ago looking for the fountain of youth . You mean , you think that that body , The one that agent Scully shot- - No . After 400 years in the woods , Don 't you think they might have adapted perfectly to their environment ? You 're making this up . Why do you say that ? 'Cause you work on the x-Files and you just want to write off your motel . Search and rescue are still unable to find Jeff Glaser ... Or the second predator that you reported . I wouldn 't be surprised if they couldn 't find either one of them . Agent Mulder , I 'm confused . Why would they come after the boy in the house that night ? These predators have been in these woods for a long , long time . They would 've perceived any encroachment on their territory as an enemy , Even a little kid like that . But that would mean that they 'd come after any one of us ... That had gone into the woods , wouldn 't it ? Where 's agent Scully ? She got a lift back to the motel to pack up both your things . She did ? Excuse me . My jacket 's in that car . Scully ! Scully ! Mulder , what 's going on ? Let 's get outta here . Okay . You pack everything ? Yeah . [ Child ] I made this !

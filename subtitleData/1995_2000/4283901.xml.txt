 [ Wind Howling ] [ Man Shouting , Indistinct ] [ Shouting , Indistinct ] Storm is coming ! Move it out ! [ Shouting Continues ] Last wall ! Pour it on ! Put it up ! This little piece of wood ain 't gonna hold no twister ! - We need to dig a hole ! You know what I 'm sayin ' ? - Whaley ! Big hole ! The man ought to be giving us shovels ! This whole damn place is gonna blow away . Why even bother ? - Back me up here ! - Shut up and hold it still ! I know you ain 't talkin ' to me . You 're a big man , huh ? Is that right ? Charley Potatoes . Big-ass criminal . You a bad man ? You 're a little bitch ! That 's all you are . You ain 't got no money . You ain 't got nothin ' . I 'll hold it still . [ Laughing ] Is that still enough for ya ? Huh ? [ Laughing ] [ Screaming ] Put down the hammer , Rawls ! Rawls ! [ Screaming Continues ] - Messed up old Whaley , did he ? - Messed him up good . - Now , what you go and do that for ? - The man pissed me off , boss . Who the hell doesn 't ? Box him . You can 't put me in that box . The storm 's coming . You should 've thought of that before you messed up Whaley . The hell with Whaley . You can 't put me in that box ! Boss , you can 't put me in there ! You can 't put me in that box ! You can 't do it ! You 're going to kill me , boss ! You know they 're saying tornado touchdowns all over the county . I can 't be responsible for acts of God . - Sorry , Rawls . - Let me out ! Let me out ! [ Grunting ] Somebody let me out ! Help ! Somebody ! Somebody help me , please ! [ Men Chattering ] Oh , hell . Hello , sir ? [ Knocks On Door ] Oh , my God . Should we arrest David Copperfield ? Yes , we should , but not for this . This is Raybert Fellowes , superintendent of Road Farm Six , Mississippi Department of Corrections . One of his guards found him . Not a drop of blood in the place . Well , maybe he was killed elsewhere . Whoever did it took 40 minutes to do it in the middle of a tornado . What do you make of that ? I don 't know . It 's , uh- - It 's not a simple bisection . There 's a considerable amount of his abdomen missing . It almost looks like a burning , but it 's too localized . Maybe an industrial acid . There 's , uh , no acid found in his office . Hmm . Spontaneous human combustion . - Scully . - Isn 't that where you 're going with this ? " Dear Diary : Today my heart leapt ... when Agent Scully suggested spontaneous human combustion . " There are one or two somewhat well documented cases . Mulder , shut up . Okay , what do you make of this ? I don 't have a theory , but I know someone who does . Hell , yes , Pinker Rawls who did it , though you got me as to how . - And who is Pinker Rawls ? - Inmate . - Mean son of a bitch . - Rawls was the prisoner who supposedly died ... in the tornado that preceded Superintendent Fellowes ' murder . So you 're saying that a ghost did this ? I 'm not putting a word to it . That 's up to y 'all . All I know is that Rawls hated the captain . Captain locked him in the box when the storm hit , and Rawls didn 't want to be in the box . And when we found the box , the biggest piece was about yea big three miles from here . This whole place was locked and boarded up tight . No man got in here . That 's all I 'm sayin ' . - So we 're looking for a dead man ? - I disagree . I think this Pinker Rawls is still very much alive . You know , they never found his body . Well , at the risk of further ridicule , what if this wasn 't a murder ? As I understand it , current theory on spontaneous human combustion ... is that climatic conditions play a large part . So possibly a tornado may fit the bill . We 've got lightning , static electricity at a high potential . I can 't argue with that , but I do think it 's murder . Well , then how did Rawls , or whoever , do this ? Uh , how did he get in and out of a locked office ... and prop a body up against the inside of a door ? [ Hollow Sound ] Termites ? [ Guard ] This is all he had in his bunk area . Wilson Pinker Rawls , age 34 . Eight years into 30 for robbing a wire office in Bay St. Louis . The $ 90,000 he stole was never recovered . Mm , it 's not in here . Hey , look at this . Ouch . His record dates to 1978 . Mostly small-time . History of violence throughout . I wonder who she is . - Thanks , cutie . - [ Chuckles ] - You broke out the good stuff . - Well , we 're worth the good stuff . Mmm . [ TVAudio , Indistinct ] - Hey , Robert ? Can I show you something ? - Hmm ? - Just a little food for thought . - Wait , sweetie . They 're talking about the tornado . ... Smith and Covington Counties . Take a look at this video , just in . Hardest hit was a state prison farm outside the village of Stringer ... where two deaths are reported in the wake of the storm . A funnel cloud with winds topping 150 miles per hour ... tore through the isolated work camp , passing within yards of a barracks filled with terrified inmates . Among the dead , Captain Raybert Fellowes , the farm superintendent , a 28 - year veteran of the Department of Corrections . A second casualty was a prison inmate , Wilson P. Rawls , age 34 - - - Prison authorities say- - - Excuse me . You okay , June ? ... secure the prison from the oncoming storm . High winds apparently carried the man away . Though his body has not been found , Rawls is presumed dead . You got a gun pointed at you . Don 't try to run . I ain 't running ' . Ah ! Hey ! Hey , that 's store property . Take those off ! Ooh ! There 's something so nice about putting on a brand-new pair of socks . I don 't know what it is . - I said , take those off , boy ! - Ooh ! Ooh . Ooh . [ Chuckles ] What you think ? That 's me , right ? And room to grow in . You got an attitude , I 'll say that . Get the hell up . Turn around . Hands behind the pole . Yeah , this is Bobby in Security . I 've detained an intruder at the V al-U-Mart on Nine Mile Road and route 60 . - The door wasn 't jimmied . - [ Handcuffs Clinking ] I don 't know how the hell he got in here . He was just walking around . Got him cuffed in the back . Yeah , I 'll hold . [ Car Horn Honking ] [ Tires Screeching ] - [ Mulder ] Is that the guy ? - Yeah , could be . I guess . It was pretty dark . - How 'd he get away ? - Whoever he was . You got me . Guy 's like Houdini . Turned my back , he was gone . I had him right here . You had him handcuffed ... here ? Can I see your handcuffs ? [ Dispatcher On Police Radio , Indistinct ] Do we have a last known address for Pinker Rawls ? [ Crickets Chirping ] [ Shatters ] Hey , hello ? Rawls ? What 's up ? You 're on the news , man . They 're saying you got killed . - Where is she ? - June ? She 's gone . Long gone , man . She left me , like , four years ago . You mad ' cause , uh , her and me shacked up ? I 'm sorry , buddy . Bo , I want what 's mine . I might have her address . - You got nothing in there but your nine . - [ Cocks Hammer ] Get the hell out of my house . Bo , you gonna shoot me ? Boo ! Bah ! You gonna do somethin ' ? Hah ! [ Yelling ] No . No ! This is Rawls ' last known address . Security guard 's car . Mulder . [ Groans ] [ Groans ] Gesundheit . - Oh , my God . - [ Groans ] Pistol in his hand . Slide locked open , shell casings everywhere . I don 't see any bullet holes anywhere , Mulder . [ Sighs ] Don 't recognize him from his driver 's license , do you ? Bo Merkle . This is his house . But Rawls used to live here , and he 's come back looking for something . Ninety thousand dollars . The wire office robbery eight years ago . That money hasn 't been recovered . I don 't think he spent that in prison . I don 't think Mr. Merkle did either , judging by the decor . Maybe she knows . That 's this house , isn 't it ? Yeah . - I can run down her name . - Yeah , I bet Rawls is looking for her . [ Phone Beeps ] - [ Creaks ] - Yeah , this is Special Agent Dana Scully with the F.B.I. There 's been a murder here at 922 Washington Avenue inJackson . I need crime scene support on - site as soon as possible . Thank you . Oh , and would you transfer me - - [ Dispatcher On Radio , Indistinct ] Got a name to go with the face--June Gurwitch . There 's no current address , though , and no record of her since 1996 . Maybe she changed her name . Maybe she was afraid she 'd end up like that . The state police have put out an A.P.B. on Rawls . You might warn them not to shoot to kill . He seems to find that annoying . - Look , Mulder , even if those were bullets- - - They are . Their composition 's been changed , just like the handcuffs and the prison wall . Even if these were bullets , there is no way that they could pass through Rawls ... in the way you 're describing , not without leaving him dead on the ground for us to find . I think they went right through him , like his wrist went through the handcuffs and like he walked through that prison wall . He walks through solid objects ? Changing their composition fundamentally- making steel brittle , turning lead bullets into powder . - And flesh into carbon ? I don 't know how else to explain what happened to that prison superintendent ... or to poor Mr. Merkle who 's got no face anymore . But where 's the science in all of this ? You 're talking alchemy . I 'm not saying that it can 't be explained scientifically . Maybe it 's the tornado . You suggested it yourself . Unusual climatic conditions , high electrical potential . I 'm sorry I even brought it up . We both agree on who he 's looking for ? - June Gurwitch . - Do we have any idea how to find June Gurwitch ? She has a sister named Jackie , and I have the address . [ Woman Dispatcher On Radio ] E. T.A. : ten minutes . [ Ringing , Beeps ] - Hello . - Hey , it 's me . Is this a good time ? No , Jackie , it is never a good time . TheJackson City Police just called me . Yeah . They 're looking for you . - What you tell ' em ? - Nothin ' . But they brought up Pinker . They wanted to know what he might want with you . Pinker 's dead . I heard it on the news today . Well , maybe you better call ' em just in case he 's not . - [ Robert ] June ! - I gotta go . - [ Dial Tone ] - June ? [ Door Slams ] [ Whimpers ] Hey , Jackie . That 's not very friendly , Jackie . Jackie . - [ Gasps ] - Tell me where she is . [ Panting ] I 'm not telling you anything . - [ Car Approaching ] - [ Sobs ] [ Shuddering , Whimpering ] Jackie Gurwitch ? F.B.I. ! Where 'd he go ? He left . - [ Dispatcher On Radio , Indistinct ] - [ Officers Chattering ] Her son 's spending the night at a friend 's house , and she 's gonna meet them there . She said she didn 't tell Rawls where her sister was . [ Sighs ] Mulder ... she said that he walked right through the wall . Merkle 's car is parked down the street . That 's how he got here . - I don 't know how he left . - Maybe he left on foot or he stole another car . Why would he leave without getting the information he wanted ? Maybe he 's still in the neighborhood . The local P.D. can search , but we have to get going . - Where to ? - To Meridian . That 's whereJune Gurwitch lives . - OrJune Burdett , as she 's now called . - [ Ignition Starts ] - Yes ? - Agents Scully and Mulder with the F.B.I. We are looking for a June Gurwitch , also known as June Burdett . " " Also known as " ? What- - Uh- - June ! - What 's this all about ? - An escaped convict by the name of Wilson Pinker Rawls . We believe he may be pursuing Miss Gurwitch with the intention of harming her . " " Gurwitch " ? I don 't understand . - [ Footsteps ] - June ? Pinker 's alive , isn 't he ? Jackie ? She and her son ? They 're fine . Who was Rawls to you ? A mistake . The biggest one of many . We lived together . Are you sure you know who you 're looking for ? I remember one time , this guy cuts Pinker off on the highway . Just cut him off , the kind of thing that happens to everybody every day . He followed this guy for 62 miles right over the state line . Sixty - two miles . Me pleading with him the whole way to stop . Follows the guy to his house . The guy gets out of his car smiling . He doesn 't know what 's coming to him . Pinker pulls a picket ... off a picket fence and cracks that guy 's skull open with it . - He 's not gonna stop . - What does Rawls want ? The money ? Ninety thousand from the Bay St. Louis robbery ? I didn 't even know about that till they came to the door to arrest him . Pinker was already in prison before I found that money . By accident . So you took it ? Eventually , yeah . I thought about it for about a week or two . - Where 's the money now ? - Put a down payment on this place . Bought a couple of sofas , chintz curtains , P.C. for Robert . I just wanted another chance . [ Dispatcher On Radio , Indistinct ] [ Robert ] I have a job . I 've got responsibilities . I can 't just disappear like this . It 's best you both stay under 2 4-hour guard until Rawls is apprehended . - It 's for your protection . - No , it 's for her protection . Let 's be clear . This guy , he 's not looking for me . She took his money . - Robert , I 'm sorry- - - Excuse me . I 've got my own place . I promise to stay the hell away from here . How about it ? I just want to get out of here . I didn 't break any laws . [ Dispatcher On Radio , Indistinct ] Don 't discuss this with anyone , Mr. Werther . I 'm forgetting it ever happened . Give me your keys . Get her out of here . I want a guard around her at all times . - Rawls was in the trunk ? - Yeah . We took him right where he wanted to go . [ Papers Rustling ] [ Latch Clicking ] [ Cocking Hammer ] [ Scully ] Mulder ? You think he 's trying to tell us something ? [ Men Chattering ] [ Footsteps ] Scully , look at this . I 'm assuming Rawls wrote this with his finger , like the other one , but look here . - He stopped at the mirror . - Or the mirror stopped him . What makes an object solid ? What prevents one solid object from passing through another solid object , usually ? Electrostatic repulsion . Individual electrons repelling one another like magnets . Electrons . What if Rawls 's ability somehow has to do with electricity ? What would preclude it , or contain it ? Resistance against electrical current . A good insulator like rubber , like glass . Exactly . Rawls couldn 't pass through this . Say- - Say that your theory is correct , that he can walk through walls . Why go through all this effort over an old robbery score ? It 's $ 90,000 . He could get that anywhere , right ? It 's not about the money . It 's never been about the money . Yet , he turned this place upside down , which means he was looking for something . And I think it has to do with this . It 's a lien ... on unpaid hospital bills ... dating back to 1 992 . And the patient name is June Gurwitch . And this is an ICD-9 number , a hospital diagnostic code . - This particular one means- - - Pregnancy . Right , specifically C-section . This is seven years ago . - That 's a few months after Rawls was sent to the prison farm . - Uh-huh . " " I want what 's mine . " This man 's looking for his child . ... and will return in time to take part in meetings at the U.N. A statewide manhunt is under way at this point ... as escaped convict Wilson Pinker Rawls , a man previously thought to be a victim of Tuesday 's storm , continues to elude police . He is to be considered armed and extremely dangerous . - In other news , computers - - - I 'd like to call my sister . Sorry , ma 'am . No calls . [ TVAudio Continues , Indistinct ] ... are expected to be delayed by as much as two months , and won 't be ready in time for final exams . [ Anchorwoman ] In other news , University Hospital in Philadelphia ... announced that vitamin E may effectively delay ... the progression of Alzheimer 's disease . A recent study of 1 00 Alzheimer patients found that - - This is a nonsmoking room , ma 'am . [ TVAudio Continues , Indistinct ] [ Sighs ] [ Dispatcher On Radio , Indistinct ] Looks like Collins put up a fight . Guess it wasn 't enough . I can 't tell you what happened here , how Rawls got in , but he took the woman with him . Where are they headed ? They stole a station wagon , last seen headed south . [ Camera Shutter Clicking ] [ Officers Chattering ] He has to intend forJune to lead him to his child . - Yeah , we gotta get there first . - Yeah , but where ? We don 't have a name or an address . June may not either , for that matter , if the child was adopted . Our best bet is to go through state records , but it 's gonna take some time . I 'm going to need some equipment , special issue . [ Woman On Radio ] Only your love can bring - [ Continues ] - Pinker , I apologize . - Everywhere I go - I 'm really scared right now . Talk to me . I think of you , love Please . Please say something , anything . Only you , love Can forgive me - [ Continues ] - Look , I 'm sorry about the money , your money . I shouldn 't have taken it . It was wrong . I was wrong . Pinker , I can pay you back . But I can 't wait to leave - - [ Clicks Off ] What was it ? What you have ? You dumb bitch , you don 't even know what I 'm talking about . What you have ? Was it a boy or a girl ? A boy . A boy . A boy . Boy . A boy . What 's his name ? You know his name , don 't you ? - Trevor Andrew . - Trevor what ? - Trevor Andrew . - Trevor Andrew ... Rawls . You never were gonna tell me . I 'd have gone to my grave never knowing . Hmm . But , years later , a million-to-one shot , I hear on the farm from a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy . You know what that means ? That means God wanted me to know . He fixed it so I 'd hear , and then He fixed it so 's I had passage . And I 'm here . God 's will . What do you want with the boy ? He 's my son . Now you 're gonna take me to him . Can you also check her alias , please ? It 's Burdett . - B-U-R-D-E-T-T . - It was a live birth ? That 's all you can tell me ? Yeah . Can you check on that , please ? - This what you were looking for ? - Yes , thank you . [ Dispatcher On Radio , Indistinct ] - [ Scully ] All right . Thank you very much . - [ Phone Beeps Off ] No match on Burdett or Gurwitch . Riot slugs , rubber . Uh-huh . Yeah . No ? Thank you . It 's a boy . That 's all I got . - Sealed files ? - No official files . No adoption records , no records of foster care ... in Alabama , Mississippi , Louisiana , nothing . Maybe she didn 't go through official channels . Maybe the kid 's with a friend or a relative somewhere . - V room ! Blam ! - Come on , Trevor . - V room ! Blam ! - Trevor , put your toys away . Dinner 's almost ready . - [ Sighs ] - Trevor . - [ Rings ] - I 'll get it . - No . Go wash your hands . I 'll get it . - [ Phone Ringing ] [ Knock At Door ] - [ Rings ] - [ Clicks ] Jackie , this is Agent Mulder . - June . - I 'm so sorry . You should 've saved me a trip . Where is he ? My boy , where is he ? Right . I appreciate all you 've done , taking care of him . You 're a good mother . Better than some , I could say . [ Grunts ] Something smells good in here . Wh-What are you gonna have ? Hi , AuntJune . Hey , baby . - You , you messed up ! - No ! No ! No ! [ Grunting ] [ Sobs , Screams ] Now , you sit him back down and feed him his supper . I-It 's all right . It 's gonna be all right . D-D-Don 't be upset . I ain 't mad at you , buddy . It 's okay , Trevor . Mama 's here , okay ? Okay . Come on . I 'm not gonna hurt you . It 's okay , buddy . Why don 't you come over here ? We 'll have a man-to-man . Just have a nice talk , you and me . Uh ... you 're Trevor , right ? Trevor Andrew ? That 's your name ? My name is Pinker , but you can call me Pinky . A-Anyway , uh ... y-you and me , we 're gonna take a trip . Pinker . Shut up , please . Y-You got some stuff you wanna pack up ? Some toys and stuff ? Uh- - Trevor ? - Jackie ? - Trevor , go . - Go and pack some stuff , okay ? - Okay . He 's a good boy . - [ Yells ] - [ Grunts ] Trevor , run ! [ Grunts , Screams ] - [ Screaming Stops ] - Trevor ! Trevor ! Trevor ! Hey , buddy ! Hey , buddy . Hey . Hey , Trevor ? Hey , buddy ! Help . Help . Get him outta here . Don 't make me shoot you . - Don 't make me shoot you ! - Trevor ! [ Groans ] [ Groaning ] [ Groaning ] - [ Car Keys Clatter ] - Okay . Everything 's gonna be all right . We 're gonna get you to a safe place . [ Panting ] Let 's go . Run ! Run ! Run ! Get inside . Get inside . Get inside . Get inside . [ Screaming ] [ Grunting ] Give me my son ! Trevor ! Trevor ! Give me my son ! Trevor !

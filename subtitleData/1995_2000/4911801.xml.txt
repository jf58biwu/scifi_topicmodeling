 MALE NARRATOR : The future ... The polar ice caps have melted , covering the earth with water . Those who survived have adapted to a new world . ( GARGLING ) ( METAL CLANGING ) ( WHISTLES ) ( SPEAKING HINDI ) Bad luck , english . But the slavers are producing a good grade of poxy these days . Cost you a handful of dirt or maybe that wind chime . What are you doing here ? Just waiting . Take your hand off the sail . Take it off ! I 've seen your boat before . Haven 't seen you . Took it legal . Previous owner was dead on the tiller when I found it . You had another hour before I traded up again . Just improving my means . well , I owe you then . No , thanks . I got all the supplies I need . Just came from an atoll . Eight days east , if you 're interested . Two Drifters meet , something needs to be exchanged . I know the code . But I 'II give you this one for free . Nothing 's free in WaterworId . Yeah . ( MOTORS WHIRRING ) Smokers . Just enough wind to get away clean . DRIFTER : Forget the bag . It 's not worth it . You 'II never make it with your sails down . Hey ! ( MIMICKING GOBBLING ) What can I say ? ( LAUGHS ) Joe , he 's going for it . What the hell ? Never seen that before . Here we go ! Go ! Drive ! Drive ! Faster ! Faster ! ( WHOOPING ) Come on ! He 's gonna get it ! He 's gonna get it ! Go ! Get him ! Get him ! ( CONTINUES SHOUTING ) ( GRUMBLES ANGRILY ) No ! No ! ( GRUNTING ) ( SMOKERS SHOUTING ) ( MACHINE GUNS FIRING ) ( DRIFTER GROANS ) No ! ( SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) ( SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) How many ways can I say it ? Go on , hit the swells . What do you think ? He does have a bush on him . Cut a side barter if you want , but don 't open the gates . Inbound ! Straight out . english . flag 's down , Drifter . We got enough traders . ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) WOMAN : What does he have ? Dirt . Open the gates ! ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) MAN : Bones to berries . Veins to vine . These tendons to trees . This blood to brine . Too old she was . This woman does leave us , recycled and enshrined in the presence of him who leads us . ( CHILDREN CHATTERING ) ( BOYS WHINING ) BOY : What is that ? You know me ? I know what you are . Good . Then you know if you look for trouble while you 're here , you 'II find more than you can handle . You got two hours . I 'II only need one . He 's coming over here . Me . You each get one if everything 's here when I get back . Pure dirt . ( OTHERS EXCLAIMING ) 3.2 kilos . How 'd you come by so much of it ? Another atoII 30 horizons west of here . Where 'd they get it ? They didn 't say . MAN 1 : We heard about that place , that they was all killed . That 's why they didn 't say . Smokers ? Maybe Smokers , maybe SIavers . So what 's the word ? We trading or not ? We 'II tally it like pure hydro . Works out to 62 chits . I want twice that . ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) You drive a hard bargain . Dirt ? I have never seen purer . HYDROHOLIC : I just want one sip of hydro ! NORD : No , not till you tell me . She got inkings on her back . I seen her . They say if you read the marks on the child , they 'II lead you all the way to dryland . dryland 's a myth . Some still believe . They say the Smokers even got an eye out for her . well , then , we 'd better keep it to ourselves . help you ? Yeah . Where 's the store ? You found it . You don 't have much . You the man with the dirt ? I 'II take a hydro . AII six G 's . Got any canvas ? Line ? well , we 've got line . It 's hair . No canvas . I 'II take the line . Any seeds ? Nope . Wood ? Nope . Magazines ? If I had a magazine , I 'd retire . Something to drink ? Cup of hydro . Pure . SkoaI . One more . Make it two . A man this rich will buy for a fellow outwater , I 'm sure . One . That 's an interesting pair of boots you got . Trade ? No . So , how long you been out there , man ? Don 't hurt asking . talking costs you nothing . Depends . What Iunar is it ? well , Iet 's see . Abbo , Farch , June ... It 's August . It 's August ? Yep . So , how long ? Fifteen . NORD : Fifteen Iunars ? That 's her . HELEN : EnoIa . Hey , what are you doing ? No , you can 't do that . I need another piece . I want to draw some more . I 'II give it to you . Just stay in the back . With all those chits , you could order up a bath . Have you ever had a freshwater bath ? Why are you talking to me ? Just being friendly . Is that a tomato plant ? Yeah . You have a keen eye . Saw one in a picture . How much ? half your chits . I 'II take them , too . Take what ? You bought everything . I 'II take them shelves . So , what did you see out there in your 15 months ? Such as ? An end to all this water . Asking the wrong person . BOY : Where did he come from ? The one they buried today ? Uh-huh . She found the only end there is . I 've got a proposition for you , Mariner . I 'm not bargaining , I 'm leaving . But you haven 't even heard anything yet , or seen it . You may have noticed us burying a citizen today . That makes room for one more . I 'm not staying . We 're not asking you to . AII we want is your seed . ELDER : We can look to our own for impregnation , but too much of that sort of thing gets undesirable . When she 's pregnant , you go on your way with all the supplies you need . You don 't have anything . You 're dying . No man stays out that long and turns down a woman . He 's hiding something . Maybe he 's a Smoker spy . ( WHISTLING ) When the elders say so , you can leave , and not before . ( GRUNTING ) gills . Mutation ! He 's a mutant ! ( PEOPLE SHOUTING ) MAN : ( GROANING ) My hand ! ( SCREAMING ) ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) MAN : Don 't let him get in the water ! MAN 2 : Throw the nets ! MAN 3 : He 's a murderer ! ( GRUNTING ) By what right ... You pay me to keep the peace . This isn 't it . No ! He has killed one of ours . He was defending himself . He needs to be destroyed ! kill him . Let 's kill him . That may be , but not here and not Iike this . BOY 1 : What is it ? BOY 2 : Damn . They 're too tight . I can 't get it off . Open the gate . This is another device we found on the boat . A garrote cord , for strangulation ! We don 't know what this is all about , but we believe it to be some sort of torturing device ! And this ... And this is a spy tool , for listening to the unsuspecting . ( ALL MURMURING ) The evidence speaks for itself . I move that we dispense with the mute-o as soon as possible , and in no way ... Why ? Why not use him ? Because he is a threat to the safety and the purity of this atoll . He is not a threat , he 's in a cage . He killed one of ours , however . ( ALL CLAMORING ) Is he dangerous or not ? I 'd say he is now . well , but he came in here with all this dirt , the likes of which we haven 't seen in years , not since enola came . Oh , what about it ? So it had to come from somewhere . What if it came from dryland ? Oh , don 't start ! He came from the west , I can tell you that . Locusts come from there . I 've been told that . From the west . But if he is a spy , this ichthyo-man will give away our position , our weaknesses . And if he isn 't ? But he 's still a mute-o , and he can contaminate our community . And others ! What others ? We haven 't seen or heard from another atoII in over a year . Let 's keep to the issue at hand . No , this is the issue at hand . Every year , every month , it gets worse . There are fewer atoIIers , fewer traders . Dead gardens , these windmills that don 't work , desaIinators that can 't be fixed . This place , this whole way of living , it 's ending . Doesn 't anyone else see that ? When I was a boy , there were lots of atolls . You keep on praying for help , and now one man comes here who might actually be able to save us ... He 's not a man ! It doesn 't matter what he is ! I say , if he knows the way to dryland , make him show us where it is ! people have looked for centuries , and death is all they found ! well , at Ieast they died trying ! It 's a hoax , and the sooner you realize that , helen , the better off we 're all going to be ! We 'd be better off if we got rid of that girl of hers , too ! Right ! ALL : Yeah ! The Smokers are looking for her ! I heard it from a trader ! ( ALL CLAMORING ) One matter at a time ! I say get rid of both of them ! The mute-o and the girl ! Yes ! Yes ! ( ALL CLAMORING ) Order ! Order ! Quiet down ! ( HUMMING ) You 'd Iike this , wouldn 't you ? Stick him . Sure is quiet from the shark that he was this afternoon . Maybe we hurt him . Come on , Iet 's go . No ! Stick him again . I know you want it . I know . Maybe he don 't need his own kind . ( SCREAMING ) ( MAN EXCLAIMING ) That 's it ! ( LAUGHING ) That 's it ! Don 't move , my dear ! And from Aries to Taurus , I forgot Taurus , the bull , and in the shoulder of the bull , the pleiades , the Six Sisters . well , Seven Sisters , but you can only see six . But at the beginning of each lunar , one of the sisters is perpendicularly lined up with Scorpius . And the Scorpius has a tall just like the arrow , and that arrow bisects the circle , Iike on the back of the child . Now , if I take into account the seventh sister , and I give the seventh sister a lunar , well , then that lunar , it will run perpendicular to Scorpius , creating against the dawn horizon a straight line that would run directly ... directly toward ... dryland ! No . Is it a map ? Is it a calendar ? Is it symbols ? Is it language ? You 'd tell me if you knew , wouldn 't you , enola ? Mmm-hmm . What are you drawing ? I don 't know . helen , look . Look at the prodigal child 's latest vision . ( CHUCKLES ) We 've got to get out of here . I take it the meeting didn 't go well . They 're putting us adrift , Gregor . I can feel it . No , no , they 're not going to hurt you . I 'd turn their lights off if they did . How soon before we can go ? Another week , ideally . We don 't have a week . helen , I don 't have any idea yet where we can go . Try your books again . The books ? There 's ... There 's nothing in them . There 's nothing there . I 've been through the books . There 's nothing in these books . She is the Annunciation . I know it . I just don 't know how . I 'm a stupid man . The answer 's right there . It 's just beyond me . Maybe he knows . Yes , I see . They are webbed . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten digits . That 's wonderful . They tell me , too , that you have gills . Isotropic gills . Are they merely vestigiaI or are they functional ? My name is Gregor . I 've just come to pay you a little ... Oh , my God . ( GREGOR LAUGHING ) I 'm sorry . I 'm not laughing at you . I 'm excited . Your gills , they 're functional . Ichthyus sapien . You can breathe in the water . How deep can you go ? Look , I 'm only here because I want to Iearn more about you . You don 't like humans very much , do you ? I can 't say that I blame you . But tell me , are all of your kind as bad-tempered as you are ? I have no kind . Oh , fish rot . I 'd be surprised if there weren 't others , and if there aren 't , there will be eventually . Anyway , I 've come here because I need to ask you a question . Where did your dirt come from ? Is it from dryland ? Do you know what this is ? The ancients , they did something terrible , didn 't they ? To cause all this water . Hundreds , hundreds of years ago . If I tell you , will you open this lock ? I haven 't a key . There 's a mooring cleat down there . What ? Good as any key . A mooring cleat ? I won 't hurt anyone . I 'II just leave . I 'II be right back . MAN : Gregor ! What 's your business there ? Move along ! I 'm not a brave man . If you know anything about dryland , please tell me . please ! Don 't let it die with you . No , no , no , no . Stop ! MAN : Gregor ! Move along ! ( BELL TOLLING ) ( FOOTSTEPS ) Get out of the way ! ELDER : After considerable deliberation of the evidence at hand , it is our decision that this mute-o does , indeed , constitute a threat . Therefore , in the interest of public safety , he is hereby sentenced to be recycled in the customary fashion . Proceed . I 'm sorry . Bones to berries . Veins to vines . These tendons to trees . This blood to brine . Too strange for life he was . This mute-o now does leave us , recycled and entombed , in the presence of him who leads us . Smokers ! Get out of the sun ! To your posts ! ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) WOMAN : Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! kill ! There ! ( SHOUTING ) We are safe behind this wall . Aren 't we ? Let me out ! Let me out ! I 'II fight ! help me ! I can 't find my dad ! He 's probably on the wall . Now , go in there , get a weapon and fight . Go ! Go now . Go ! Go , go ! Come on , boys ! I said move it ! Come on ! Go ! Go ! Go ! ( SMOKERS SHOUTING ) Give me the key to the city now . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! floor it ! floor it ! Come on ! ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) Swab it ! Swab it ! More ammo ! SMOKER : Break down the door ! My God ! ( GRUNTING ) Go to work now ! We 'II have this atoll in no time . Crank it ! Crank it ! Look ! MAN : Look out ! ( GRUNTS ) Oh , no ! Oh , my ... helen ! Keep that gas going ! fill them up ! ( SCREAMING ) It 's the girl they want ! Give them enola and they leave ! Come quickly ! helen ! helen ! ( GUN FIRING ) ( MEN SCREAMING ) You 're not supposed to go yet ! InfernaI machine ! Damn you ! InfernaI machine ! Gregor . Gregor , wait ! helen , I tried . There was an accident . I couldn 't make it stop . Hurry ! You can make it if you try . Run ! please , stop ! Up those stairs . Run ! quickly ! Wait ! Wait ! I 'II throw you a rope . Run quickly ! Throw the rope now . Run , enola . ENOLA : slow down ! Wait ! No ! No ! Wait ! Gregor , don 't leave us ! Oh , no ! I 'm sorry ! It was an accident ! helen ! EnoIa ! helen , I 'm sorry ! ( GUN FIRING ) Shoot him . Shoot him . If I let you out of here , you 're taking us with you . Sure . HELEN : EnoIa , get down . Here . Get over here . Get down . Hurry ! Come on ! Get the gate . ( GUNS FIRING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTING ) Hurry up ! Kamikaze ! Come on ! ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) That made a hole . Find her ! Get the girl ! There ! Go get that guy ! Go ! kill him ! Wow ! EnoIa ! MARINER : You 're too slow ! Run to the other side . Come on ! Grab on ! hold on , hold on . It 's stuck ! I can 't make it through ! Let her go ! Just drop her ! Turn the wheel . The wheel ! Turn it ! That ! Come on ! Push it ! I am ! Hurry ! Now pull ! Push it ! Push it hard ! Push it ! Okay , okay ! Now pull this ! pull this ! Go ! Go ! pull it ! pull ! EnoIa , jump . Jump ! Look at me . Jump ! Now ! Okay ! well , excuse me ! Did I say anybody could leave before the battle was over ? Did I ? No ! No ! well , do something . I hate sails . Hey ! Can you steer ? Can I trust you ? ( ROPE CREAKING WITH TENSION ) Answer me this , somebody . Why is that boat still firing ? What 's that cousin 's name ? Chuck . Hey , Chuck ! He 's pulling him right into us . Maybe he doesn 't answer to Chuck . call him charles . charles ! Stop him ! Stop him ! charles ! Adios , cousins . WOMAN : Put me down ! Put me down ! She 's here somewhere . Keep looking . ( MOTOR REVVING ) Yes , I 'II ... 660 G 's of hydro , three-quarter grade or better , 1 20 keys of assorted edibIes , jerk fish and plankton cakes , 60 keys lamp oil , 44 oId-growth grape vines , 10 assorted fruit trees , zero reloads , no animal storage on this particular atoII , zero go-juice , no refining capability . Primitive savages ! How about smokes ? Zero . Zero smokes . I remember when this used to be fun . How long 's it been since we had a really good crusade ? I know , I know . tell me , how long ? I don 't know . I ... Remember , there used to be atoIIs on every horizon ? Mmm-hmm . Where the hell are they all going ? well , we sunk a few . Found this . Nord ? Oh , now that 's warmer . Hey , all right . And the girl ? She 's not here . She might have gotten away . That 's why we came here ! We didn 't come here to practice ! We don 't need practice ! MAN : It 's too late now ! Never mind ! ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) What you got ? couple of heartbeats over there . Aren 't saying much . If you 'II notice the arterial nature of the blood coming from the hole in my head , you can assume that we 're all having a real lousy day . So here it is , I need to know about that tattooed girl . First one that tells me lives . I saw a girl . I saw ... It was ... She had a big tattoo on her . I saw a girl . I 'm not sure , but I think she got on that boat with three hulls . The boat that cost me 1,000 G 's of go-juice ? Yeah , the mute-o 's boat . Mute-o ? Yeah . He got these slits here . Like fish gills . He wasn 't really a man . A fluke of evolution . Oh , I 'm sorry . A fluke of ... evolution . I know ! Let 's have an intelligent conversation here . I 'II talk , and you listen . In the beginning , the provider said , " Let there be water , " and the seas came forth . He created everything that we know . Hey ! Hey ! Get in here ! The sun , the air that we breathe ! He made , also , both man and fish , and no combination thereof . He does not abide the notion of evolution . Amen ! ALL : Amen ! No ! No , you said you wouldn 't kill me ! Did I say that ? Witnesses , anybody , did I ? Yes , yes , yes ! You said ... You said it . Oh , I may have . I may have . No , no , no , you said you wouldn 't ... We get to the ' Deez , tank up that sky boat , send it out on patrol . We gotta keep an eye out for that ichthy-freak . I know what you 're thinking . Thinking how much longer that hydro 'd last if there weren 't three of us on this boat . well , enola won 't drink much . And I won 't ... I won 't drink at all . Not till we get there . Get where ? I don 't know , wherever you 're going . Wherever you got your dirt . told you before , I salvaged it off an atoll the Smokers hit . Smokers don 't leave anything after a raid , especially dirt . You been there , haven 't you ? dryland ? You know where it is . Yeah , I know where it is . And ... And we 're going ? You and I are . The kid we gotta pitch over the side . What ? My boat 's tore up . I 'm taking on water . I 'd be lucky to get half a hydro ration out of that . You know ... I said I won 't drink . For 1 2 days ? No . It 's better one of you dies now than both of you die slow . Wait . Wait . We saved your life . We got you out . No , you got me out so you could get out . We 're even . She can cook . She can fish . So can I. Then take my necklace . Take my necklace . I got better ones below . No , look ! After what you went through back there on the atoll , I can understand why you would want to . But she 's a child . ( HUMMING ) Is there something else , then ? EnoIa ! Go below . EnoIa . Yeah . You said so yourself . Been out there a Iong time . couple hours ago , I was potential dirt to you . We 're not Iike that . You all are . Know what I was really thinking ? Why I don 't drop both of you in my wake right now . You got nothing I need . You 're taking us to dryland . killing 's a hard thing to do well . believe me . I 'm not the one to start on . Both of us ! How long you plan to hold that on me ? As long as it takes . Okay . No ! HELEN : Let me out of here ! Where the hell are you ? Don 't you touch my child . Come here ! ( HELEN GRUNTING ) No . Don 't hurt ... Okay , now , don 't move , okay ? There . Oh , looking real good , yeah . There . There . AII done . Now , there may be some small problem in depth perception . well , it better not screw up my short game . well ? Looks good . I Iike it . Yeah . I Iike it better than your real eye . Much better . What do you say , Toby ? The truth . Looks like slime . That 's why I Iove children . No guile . It does look like slime . And it feels like cold slime ! Deacon ? What ... I 'm sorry . It 's just that there 's a problem in the pit . Maybe you should come . Let 's drive . ( PETER GUNN THEME SONG PLAYING ) The pit . Don 't bother with the scenic route . Drive ! Hey , it 's driving better . Get off ! Get off . Get out of the way . AII right , all right , all right . Okay , okay . bless you , cousins . bless you . bless all you cousins over there . Keep up the good work . Growth is progress . Growth is progress . DEPTH GAUGE GUY : Somebody ! Hey , up there ! Take it off ! Yes . Your Deaconship . hello . Good morning . Or night , whichever the case may be . What is it ? I 'm a busy man . I thought you should know . We 're down to exactly four feet , nine inches of black stuff . Thank you , sir . How many G 's is that after refining ? Maybe three refueIers . We 'II burn through that in two Iunars . Sweet Joe ! will somebody please tell me what 's happening to this place ? We outgrowed it . AII right , the only thing that is important is the tattooed girl . We don 't spare any go-juice finding her . We don 't waste it anywhere else . You cancel all those tractor pulls and all that stuff until later . You got it ? dryland is the mother lode . On your toes . Why don 't you use sea hydro ? salt 's harder on the filters . Can we have some ? It 's for her , not me . Here , come on . Is he going to take use to dryland ? Sure he is . Yeah . AII of it . AII of it . AII of it . Good . Good , good . Come on . Thanks for not killing us . Just stay away from him . Hi . Move . HELEN : EnoIa ! EnoIa , come here ! Come on ! EnoIa , come over here . Hey ! What are you doing ? Decorating your boat . It 's ugly . Where did you get this ? From down below . This is mine ! You don 't touch anything of mine . I drew it for you . You don 't draw on anything . You understand ? This is my boat . I got it the way I Iike it . You take up space and you slow me down . You know , she 's just a little girl . She doesn 't know your rules . You wanna stay ? You teach her . HELEN : EnoIa , what 'd I tell you ? You 're not so tough . You know that ? How many people have you killed ? Ten ? Twenty ? You talk a Iot . I talk a Iot ' cause you don 't talk at all . Now , how many ? including little girls ? I 'm not afraid of you . I told helen you wouldn 't be so ugly if you cut your hair . In fact , you talk all the time . It 's like a storm when you 're around . HELEN : EnoIa ! Hey ! What are you doing ? helen ! You butcher ! She can 't swim ! ENOLA : help me ! helen ! helen , help me ! helen ! helen , help me ! ( GASPING ) helen ! helen ! hold on ! Look at me . Look at me . Look at me . ( GASPING ) Oh , please , come back . please ! please ! Oh , please ! ( HELEN COUGHING VIOLENTLY ) HELEN : Hey ! hold on . Okay , almost ... Thanks . I swear , if you ever touch her again ... Look at me . You will go to bed that night and you will never wake up . Shut up . What ? Smokers ? Yeah . Can 't we outrun them ? Not with my sail down . What are you thinking about ? That 's a nice touch . That 's them . Don 't hit the kid . ( LAUGHING DEVILISHLY ) HELEN : Hey ! Coward ! ( LAUGHING ) Oh , come on ! No ! ( GROANING ) Joe ! Cut it ! Come on ! Come on ! ( EXCLAIMING ) AII right . Okay . HELEN : Oh , I 'm really sorry . I 'm sorry . But you didn 't give me much choice . Oh , I know . But you ran away . I ... What ? What are you ... No ! please , no ! No ! ( GRUNTING ) Don 't ever touch anything on my boat again . She said she was sorry ! That means you 're supposed to say something back ! Did you say something ? ENOLA : Mmm-mmm . DEACON : Fore ! NORD : Nice putt . It wasn 't a putt . That was a drive . And I wasn 't even using my good eye . Damn it ! You got an ashtray or something ? Oh , man . Damn thing never did work right . You said to bring the pilot . Yes , I did . well , he 's here . well , why didn 't you tell me ? Come on , Nord . Come on , tell me about it . The child . Did he have the girl with him ? Yeah , and some atoII witch ! They killed Ed . Now , now , don 't you fret yourself . plenty more where Ed came from . Heading west-southwest ? From here . Seems to me if we launch now , we can cut him down just about here . If he doesn 't change course . It 's not likely . He 's a wily one , that ichthy-demon . DRIFTER : hello ! Drifter ? Mmm-hmm . Are we gonna stop ? Look at the flag ! His flag 's up . I thought you all stopped for each other . ( DRIFTER YELLING ) well , maybe he has some food ! Don 't find many who follow the rules anymore . well , make it quick . What 's your business ? Trade . You got any resin ? ( CHUCKLING ) Resin ? He 's gotta be out of his mind . He 's out of his mind . I don 't have any resin . You been outwater a Iong time , haven 't you ? Must be joking me , man . Resin ! You don 't got enough . How about food ? could you say that again , please ? How about food ? Yeah , food . Yeah , that 'd be good , eh ? I haven 't eaten in , well , you know , forever . Which one of you two is the cook ? ' Cause I usually fall for the waitress . ( SNICKERS ) Like you said , I don 't have much . I 'II say . Let 's see . We can start with that wee orchard you got over there . ( EXCLAIMING ) MARINER : AII right , hold it there . We can talk . Fair enough . ( MUTTERING ) It 's a nice rod , isn 't it ? I Iike that rod . It 's a nice rod . Got yourself a wee harem going here , now , don 't you , eh ? What do you want for the women ? We 're not for sale . Not for sale ? There 's no such thing as not for sale . " Not for sale " ! Not for sale , eh ? Are they a pair , or would you consider selling them separate ? No . Our business is done here unless you got some resin or sail you can part with . I told you once already , I don 't have any . I don 't have . Don 't have . Don 't have . Haven 't seen either for trade in Iunars now . Wait . Wait , wait , wait . I do have something that 'II make you change your mind . Something that you can 't pass on . ( SNICKERING ) I took it off an atoIIer refugee camp . The life savings of the entire clan . Paper . Look at my wee paper . It 's paper . Have you ever seen paper ? Look at it . smell it . ( SNIFFING ) I been saving it for a special trade . Don 't you do it . You know , maybe I 'm talking to the wrong person here . Whose boat is this ? Is it your boat or your boat ? No . No , it 's his boat . But he doesn 't own us . half an hour . Is he out of his mind or something here ? I got two pages in here , man ! I mean , I 'd get half a dozen girls with this , you know . half an hour . You trading or not ? Don 't . Shut up . Okay . Forty-five minutes with the wee one over there . I Iike to do the talking , if you know what I mean . No ! Fair enough . Come , come , come , come , come ! No . My boat . Fair enough . Fair enough . Good , good , good . Aye . helen . Sit down . EnoIa , just do as he says . ( SNICKERING ) half an hour . Come here , come here . It 's been a while for me now . Guess it 's been more than a while , actually . I 've only got half an hour . half an hour , half an hour , half an hour ... Right , right , right ... You 're so beautiful . Aye ! Anyone ever told you that ? Give me that . What are you doing ? It 's just a game . Oh , I ... I ... We was just playing . The trade 's off . I changed my mind . well , you can 't do that .

This won 't take but a minute . I hate this boat . I hate this boat ! You garbage . You 're pretty stingy for a man who 's got everything , aren 't you , now ? ( CLANGING ) DRIFTER : You ... Where 's me boat ? Where 's me boat ? help me to me boat . ( GROANING ) Me boat . Yeah , if he knows he 's been spotted , he 'II expect us to expect him to change course , which is exactly why he 'II keep his heading . The important question is , where 's he heading ? And does he know how precious his cargo is ? dryland . salvation . Room to grow . Eighteen holes . Thirty-six . Seventy-two ! I say that he 's headed here , and we take him here . How long before we get some wind ? Days , maybe . Then why don 't we fish ? What for ? So we can get something to eat ? We ate two days ago . You ate ! Just ... Just help me fix this . I 'II catch something myself . You 're not going to catch anything with this around here . Look , we 're not trying to make you angry . And you don 't disappear just because you turn your back on us . You don 't know what fishing 's like around here . well , then you do it , if you 're the authority . Maybe he doesn 't know how to fish . I think you 're right , enola . Shut up , will you ? I 'm trying to listen for engines . I will not shut up until you stop what you 're doing and you help me find something to eat for this child ! I will scream so loud that ... HELEN : What the ... No ! Never catch anything with this . It 's useless . HELEN : Look , I 'm sorry . You were right about the pole . You were right , but we have to eat . Now , I know you can hear me ! Now , we can fish for ourselves . You show us what to do . You must know how . Even you gotta eat ! You just sit there . What ... I don 't know . ( SEA MONSTER ROARING ) ( GUN FIRING ) Happy now ? ( HUMMING ) You don 't like my singing , do you ? helen says you don 't like my singing 'cause you can 't sing . Ever try and listen ? To what ? The sound of the world . I don 't hear anything . That 's because you 're too loud and you 're moving around all the time . Try sitting still . eyeball ? Go ahead , drink all you want . It 's gonna rain tonight . I wish I had feet like his . Then maybe I couId swim . EnoIa . ( BURPS ) Sorry . Never met a person who couldn 't swim before . I can 't . people said I was weird . Maybe they were right . Maybe they were right about you , too . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Is that from dryland ? Yeah . ( SIGHS ) You know , I don 't even know your name . I don 't need one . EnoIa wanted to give this to you . And this . She won 't take it again . You don 't look much like her . well , I 'm not her mother , if that 's what you 're asking . You act like it . About six years ago , this basket floated into the atoll with enola in it . Of course , everyone wanted to shove her back out to sea . That was the Iaw . She was so precious . I wanted to keep her . So the elders talked and said that if I wanted her so badly that I couId never have a child of my own . There was no one else . She would have died otherwise . So ? It 's called compassion . ( SIGHS ) You probably wouldn 't understand , after being alone so much . I 'm not alone . Got this boat for a friend . It don 't lie to me , don 't cut my throat when I 'm asleep . Gives me a place to be . I pity you , really . What 's pity ? You don 't know ? If I knew , I wouldn 't ask . well , if you don 't know , I couId never make you understand . What are those marks on her back ? Nothing . They 're just fanciful things . Like what she draws ? She draws what she sees . She 's like a mirror . people on the atoll thought she was a ... Freak ? Yeah . I just thought she was special . I 'm not giving it to her . It 's just ... A Ioan . Yeah . I 'm not giving it to her . Is dryland beautiful ? You 'II see . ( ENOLA GIGGLING ) EnoIa ? EnoIa , what are you doing ? Those monsters 'II kill her ! No , they 're asleep now . Hands around my neck . Let the water tell your arms and legs how to move . We 're going down . hold your breath . What is it ? What is it ? Barter outpost . You said we 'd get to dryland today . Today . Tomorrow . What 's it matter ? I need resin . ( SPEAKING PORTUGREEK ) What is that ? It 's PortuGreek . Their own language . Or so I thought . ( SNIFFING ) There 's my girl . Yeah . Howdy , darling . Come on in here now . What 's going on ? Smokers . What the hell ? He 's spotted us . Sound it ! Sound it ! Sound it ! Sound it ! Sound it ! ( WHOOPING ) HELEN : EnoIa ! ( GUNS FIRING ) Starboard side ! Now ! Get in the chair ! Watch it . He 's clearing the net . Go to the helm . Get the centerboard ! Centerboard ? What centerboard ? Where , exactly ? I don 't know what to do ! Under the helm ! pull the handle ! Hurry ! Hurry ! It 's too late . Over here ! ( SCREAMING ) No ! Give me that rifle . Boy , if you wanna do something right , you 've got to do it yourself . AII right . ( GRUNTS ) I winged him . I say we load all the go-juice onto one boat and run the freak down . You can 't catch him in ten boats , and you wanna send just one ? well , I pray that you 're joking . Bring me the trackers . ( CHUCKLES ) You lied to us . You were gonna sell us back there ! We both lied . What ? I saw what I saw . He 's hurt . well , he should be . He was gonna sell us . No wonder you let her keep it ! No , you leave it . Why do they want her ? You know , there 's nothing human about you . They should have killed you the day you were born . They tried . No more lies . ( SHRIEKING ) What are the marks on her back ? people say it 's the way to dryland . dryland 's a myth ! No ! You said so yourself that you know where it is . You did . You 're a fool to believe in something you 've never seen before . I 've seen it . I 've touched it ! Dirt that was richer and darker than yours . It was in the basket we found enola in ! It doesn 't exist ! well , how can you be so sure ? Because I 've sailed farther than most have dreamed , and I 've never seen it . But the things on your boat ! " Things on my boat " what ? There are things on your boat that nobody has ever seen ! What are these shells ? And that reflecting glass ? ( STUTTERING ) And the music box ? That ... well , if not from dryland , then where ? Where ? You wanna see dryland ? You really wanna see it ? I 'II take you to dryland . Get in . well , what about enola ? There 's only air for one . Get in the water . It 'II be all right . Don 't touch anything . Okay ? I didn 't know . AII this time ... I didn 't know . Nobody does . ( MOTOR REVVING ) Can you get us out of here ? I 'd say there 're two chances of that . Hey ! No way and no how . should 've bought me that drink . Come on ! This way . Come on ! ( SMOKERS WHOOPING ) DEACON : Proper introductions first . I 'm the Deacon . If you don 't recall the face , perhaps it 's ' cause I didn 't always look like this . Now , I suspect she 's somewhere real close . So we can tear this boat apart looking for her , but I 'd rather somebody tell me where she is . And the first one that does that lives . And the runner-up ... well , actually , there are no runners-up . Oh , sweet Joe , I Iove this part . Choose them . One , two . Live or die . You know , personally , I 'd rather shoot the sperm-of-the-deviI here . But you know something ? I don 't think you 're gonna tell me , are you ? Too bad . Come on . What do you say ? She 's not your kind . You don 't even have a kind . If you say it , he 'II still kill us both . ( DEACON GRUNTING ) Let 's not get ahead of ourselves . If you don 't tell me , I swear to Poseidon I will torch your boat . DEACON : Refresh my memory . What happens when neither of them talks ? Never happened before . Never happened before . AII right ! If they won 't tell us where she is , do them ! Both of them ! kill them now ! No ! HELEN : No ! So gullible ! Bring her here . Take and ye shall receive ! HELEN : No ! Leave her ! So ends your daily sermonette ! ( DEACON LAUGHING ) Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! ( ALL CLAMORING ) Here , take them , boys . Take care of her . What is it ? Stunning . I don 't have words to even begin to ... It 's magnificent ! Look at that ! That 's square footage ! AII we gotta do is figure out this map . Turn her upside down . Does that mean anything to you ? No . DEACON : We 'II figure it out back at the ' Deez . Back at the ' Deez , boys . careful with her . careful with her ! What about them ? Do them both . Torch the boat . ( GRUNTING ) We have to go under ! No , I can 't breathe like you ! I 'II breathe for both of us . ( GUNS FIRING ) ENOLA : helen ! helen , help ! helen ! helen ! My boat . EnoIa . DEACON : AII right ! I can 't wait to get this thing out on some pavement . build some highways and some freeways . There you go , cous . There you go , cous . Be careful , now . You break them , you can 't use them . Come on ! What 's happening , cousin ? Not a word . She just sits there and leaks . well , shiver to the liver . This 'II make her give up all her secrets , huh ? Yeah , or kill her . Let me talk to her first . I 'm real good with kids . DEACON : What is this ? Get those chains off her . What are we , barbarians here ? Goodness gracious . Sakes alive . Come on , out of here , you big , nasty animal , you ! well , rub-a-dub-dub . You wanna come over here and sit on my lap ? No . well , I got something right here I know you 'd Iike . Like to draw , don 't you ? Now , they 're yours , if you help me with just one problem , all right ? Now , I got this parish . Good parish . Large parish . Getting larger all the time , in fact . Now , you know , I just don 't have enough faith for all these people . Why don 't you make less people ? Pardon ? The atoll , babies are born only when there 's room . That way , there 's food and hydro for everyone . well , that 's a quaint suggestion . But it don 't really play here , considering we are , in fact , the Church of eternal Growth . See , what we need is more land , for more people . Now , that tattoo on your back . I 've been told that that 's actually a map ? It 's the way to dryland . Now we 're getting someplace . could you teach me how to read that ? Setback . well , have you ever heard any of your friends talk about it ? You know , Iike your mommy or your pet fish ? Did he say anything ? You shouldn 't make fun of him . He wouldn 't like it . He took out my eye . And if I ever see him again , I 'm gonna cut open his head and eat his brains ! You think he 'd Iike that ? Can 't kill him . He 's even meaner than you are . But he 's not here . And he ain 't coming . And no one 's gonna save you . He 'II come for me . He will . Then you better tell me what I wanna know or he can see what 's left of you in a jar . Now , I 'm glad we had this little talk . Chain her . Chain her up . He 'II come for me ! He 'II take me away ! We 're going to die here , aren 't we ? Aren 't we ? After the atoll , when I offered myself to you , why didn 't you take me ? 'Cause you didn 't really want me . Not really . Have I been asleep long ? I was dreaming . It 's funny . I always thought dryland floated . That it drifted with the wind . That 's why it was so hard to find . Why did you believe in it so much ? Because we weren 't made for the sea . Got hands and feet . We 're supposed to walk . I miss her sound . Don 't you ? Might be able to get some hydro out of this . I can 't go on . Not without her , or dryland . I don 't want to live if there 's nothing left . There 's no hope . You 're still here . Thank you for saving me . You can thank the ancients . This is what they had . This is what they made of it . That 's why I am what I am . I may not be human , but I don 't quit . Never have . No matter what they throw at me , I ... helen ! helen ! No , no , no . helen , up here . Above you ! ( GREGOR GIGGLING GIDDILY ) HELEN : Gregor ! Smart thinking , to burn your boat . Without the smoke , I never would have found you . Who 's that with you ? Ichthyus sapien , is that really you ? I 'II throw the rope down . You catch it . I 'II help you climb up . helen . Where 's enola ? Smokers took her . They 'd have me , too , if it weren 't for him . My friend , thank you . Very human of you . well , grab your things quickly . quickly . Come . GREGOR : You see ? Right down there . There 's several of us survivors . We 'II just start over again . Don 't worry , they 'II welcome you , just like Gregor did . MAN : You can 't ask us to go get her ! WOMAN 1 : EnoIa 's the reason we 're in all this trouble . WOMAN 2 : Forget it ! We 're not going . HELEN : They don 't have any reason to kill her . They need to find dryland just like we do . Of course . HELEN : If the Mariner 's willing to go , why not us ? WOMAN 1 : If he wants to go , then let him ! WOMAN 2 : We don 't want you here ! You or the girl ! helen . The papers the Mariner brought you ... It 's the same language the tattoo is written in . Eighty-six , 56 , 27 , 59 ... If I can figure out what these numbers refer to ... They refer to nothing . What ? dryland doesn 't exist . MAN : Gregor , you 're as crazy as she is ! WOMAN 1 : We can 't stay here ! We 're wasting valuable time . More Smokers will come . We need to be moving now ! My friends , don 't you see we need this child if we want to find dryland ? I 'm not going . MAN : I say let them go . We 're better off without them , anyway ! You won 't go after her , either ? I thought you were different . I am different . MAN : Hey . Hey ! That 's my sail ! What 's he doing ? Leaving . Not on one of our boats ... You can give it to him , or he 'II take it . EnoIa said you were her friend . What do I tell her when I see her again ? Lies . If it makes you feel better . Don 't blame him . survival is all he knows . That 's why someday there will be so many like him , and probably so few of us . What do you want ? AII kinds of things . But right now , we 'II settle for everything you 've got . Ain 't that right , Bone ? You 've already destroyed our homes . Why can 't you just leave us alone ? I don 't know . Character thing , I guess . Ain 't that right , Bone ? Bone ? Bone ? I 'm going after enola . You know , for a hideous freak , you 're okay . It was a joke ! Know what that is yet ? GREGOR : What , the numbers ? Yes , I think I do . It seems to be some ancient form of geographic location , latitude , longitude . It doesn 't make sense , though . The numbers , they seem to be backwards or something . It 's upside down . The world ? The poles have reversed themselves ? I 've been mapping the cities below . The world wasn 't created in a deluge . It was covered by it . MAN : That 's blasphemy ! No , it 's true . I 've seen it with my own eyes . There is land . It 's right under our keel . None of it 's dry anymore . Some is . EnoIa 's been there . I know that now . I saw what she drew . This is ridiculous . Going after the Smokers ? He doesn 't even know which direction they came from . If she 's alive , I 'II bring her back to you . WOMAN 2 : Forget the mute-o , helen . If he brings her back , they 'II kill us all ! I can 't stand it . We gotta go help him . I can 't ask him to do this alone . Oh , don 't worry , my dear . You 're not going to have to . Hey , Doc , what 's this here ? Where ? Right there , above the squiggle . What , there ? Looks like a star . Or a meteor . It 's a mole . You got that tattoo figured out yet ? It would be easier if it was flat , big and flat . It needs to be flat . What you got in mind ? well , you cut it off her back . You stretch it , mount it . Give us a proper look . DEACON : Take her down below until I holler . Saint Joe , we 're close . After centuries of shame . ( PEOPLE SHOUTING IN DISTANCE ) They 're getting ugly . Don 't I know it . Announce me , cousin . Hey . Here he is . CROWD : Deacon ! Rise up , brothers and sisters . Turn your eyes and open your hearts to your humble benefactor , your spiritual shepherd and dictator for life , the Deacon of the ' Deez . ( CROWD CHEERING ) ( CROWD CLAMORING ) Deacon ! Children . Children of the provider . Citizens of the good ship . Please , now , hear me speak . I 've had a vision . MAN : Yeah , we 're tired of your visions ! What about the land you promised us ? Yeah ! CROWD : Yeah ! DEACON : Oh , ye of little faith . I 've had a vision so great that as it came to me , I wept . And in this splenditudinous figment of wonder ... Is that Bone 's ride ? Is that blood on the seat ? ... I saw . And you know what it is that I saw . I saw the land . ( ALL CHEERING ) CROWD : dryland ! dryland ! dryland ! dryland ! ( MUFFLED SCREAMING ) CROWD : dryland ! dryland ! dryland ! dryland ! dryland ! dryland ! dryland ! dryland ! Horse , that you ? ( ENGINE REVVING ) Look , just bring it in slow , okay ? I don 't have all day . ( ENGINE REVVING ) Horse ! Just bring it up slow . I said slow ! No ! You killed Smitty , cousin . Nice landing . ( MEN LAUGHING ) Smitty , man ! always in the way ! Smitty ? I quit ! I 'm in charge now , baby ! Come on , move ! Move ! I 'm in charge ! I 'm in charge ! No way ! DEACON : And he said this to me personally . We are to go there , and we are to settle it . And we are to build a ... ShouIdn 't be doing that . You 're gonna get in trouble . That 's right . You 're not afraid . You 've got your pet freak coming to rescue you . He 's not a freak , and he can take you anytime . He 's killed dozens of people , and he doesn 't have any mercy or anything . He even kills little girls . Haven 't we all ? Dang . It 's Horse . Horse ? Find him . Find him ! Come on ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Come on . ENOLA : Getting nervous , aren 't you ? I don 't get nervous . DEACON : And if there 's a river , we 'll dam it . And if there 's a tree , we 'll ram it . 'Cause I 'm talking progress here . Yes , sir . I 'm talking development . Yeah ! For we shall suck and savor the sweet flavor of Dryland . ENOLA : Your face is all red . helen said with anybody that has a face that red , he 's either had too much sun or too much to drink . AII right , that 's it . I 'm gonna burn your face . DOCTOR : almost time . What 's up ? We 're just talking about her friend . NORD : What 's his name ? ENOLA : He doesn 't have a name . So death can 't find him . ( MOCKING ENOLA 'S TONE ) Doesn 't have a home or people to care for . He 's not afraid of anything , men least of all . He 's fast and strong like a big wind . He can hear 100 miles and see 100 miles underwater . He could be right behind you , and you won 't even know it till you 're dead ! Give it a rest . He 'II come for me . He will . DEACON : We are the reason . Yeah ? well , I hope he does . The Lord 's creation . Remember you said that . DEACON : Look at us . Look at us here today . Yeah ! Dryland is not just our destination , but it is our destiny ! ( ALL CHEERING ) Find him . Find him ! " How can I find this glorious place ? " And he said to me , " A child shall lead you . " A child . And behold ! It 's time . The instrument of our salvation ! ( CROWD CHEERING ) Our guide in the wild . Our beacon in the darkness . Turn her around , Nord . She has shown me the path ! And before the holy-most moment is upon us , let 's sacrifice one to old Saint Joe . And let 's get this tub of junk up to speed . Yeah . ( ALL CLAMORING ) ( WHOOPING ) pull ! pull ! pull ! pull . ALL : pull ! ( MEN GRUNTING ) So which way we rowing ? I don 't have a damn clue . Don 't worry . They 'II row for a month before they figure out I 'm faking it . But why ? Oh , you want details . well , I 'm not telling these savages that we haven 't solved the map yet . I promised them results , and I 'II get them if I gotta cut them out of her back . Who is that ? Who is that ? Maybe one of the spare rowers ? Why aren 't you rowing ? It 's him . It is him . You guys are in so much trouble . Well , I 'll be damned . It 's the gentleman guppy . You know , he 's like a toilet that won 't flush . I want the girl . You know , I thought you were stupid , friend . But I underestimated you . You 're a total slime-o . I want the girl . That 's all . Well , what on this screwed-up earth makes you think you 're gonna get her ? You know what this is ? I drop it , you burn . We all burn . Now , wait , wait , wait , wait . Let 's not do anything rash here . I mean , are you sure she 's worth all this ? She never does stop talking . She never shuts up . I noticed . What is it , then ? It 's the map . She 's my friend . Golly gee . A single tear rolls down my cheek . I mean , you 're gonna die for your friend ? If it comes to that . He 's bluffing . I 'II kill him . He 's not bluffing . He never bluffs . Shut up ! I don 't think you 're gonna drop that torch , my friend . Why not ? Because you 're not crazy . No ! Oh , thank God . ( MAN SCREAMING ) ( MACHINE GUN FIRING ) MAN 1 : Look out ! MAN 2 : Look out ! That 's him ! Let 's go ! Don 't just stand there ! kill something ! Was this your big vision ? ( EXCLAIMS ) I 've always wanted to drive this monster . There he is ! There he is ! That 's him ! There ! ( SCREAMS ) ENOLA : Let go ! Let go ! I said , Iet go ! Let me go ! Let go ! Let me go ! Let go ! DEACON : pilot ! pilot ! Let me go ! pilot ! Let me go ! Let go ! You should 've stayed underwater . ( CLICKING ) Now , you know how to fly an airplane ? Lucky I do , huh ? ( SCREAMS ) Now , you stop it ! You behave yourself , now ! ( EXPLOSION ) HELEN : It 's going down . You can see it sinking . Gregor , bring us right down on top of it . Hurry , Gregor ! GREGOR : Don 't worry . Hurry . EnoIa ! Up here ! Grab on ! GREGOR : Are they on yet ? GREGOR : What is it ? HELEN : I don 't know ! Got you ! I 'm gonna rip your cute little lungs out . ( SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTING ) pull ! almost . ( EXPLOSION ) ( SCREAMS ) HELEN : No ! EnoIa ! ENOLA : No ! Saint Joe . hole in one . helen ! No ! EnoIa ! GREGOR : helen ! Hey ! Hey ! If I can 't have dryland , no one will ! ( HELEN SIGHING ) HELEN : Oh , no ! Quick ! What are we gonna do ? Tie this off . GREGOR : Hurry ! Tie it ! HELEN : Got it ! ( SCREAMS ) ( SCREAMING ) Get them up now . ( GREGOR LAUGHING ) Of course . Of course . The numbers . ( LAUGHING ) The numbers ! They must be it ! What ? I was swimming . I saw . GREGOR : My friends . My friends , look . This map ... This map , it bears a grid system with numbers the ancients used to determine geographic location on the world . Just like the numbers and the symbols on enola 's back . First they would determine the angle of the sun using this , and that would tell them where they were located on the grid and which direction they had to go . If I take a bearing from the sun and reverse the coordinates on enola 's back , then dryland is that way ! ( SEAGULL CAWING ) ( SEAGULL CAWING ) ( HELEN LAUGHING ) It 's fresh ! AII of this ! It 's fresh ! ( HELEN WHOOPING ) ( ALL LAUGHING ) I found something ! ( BIRDS CHIRPING ) Maybe we should put them under the dirt . I think it was their way . They must have known they were dying . ( HELEN LAUGHING ) ( WINDING ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) I 'm home . Where 's the Mariner ? He was outside . Wait . Wait ! I want to show you this . ( BIRDS CHIRPING ) ( HORSES NEIGHING ) ( HORSES GALLOPING ) ( BIRDS CHIRPING ) First time in your life you got nothing to say ? EnoIa , I have to go now . But you came back for me . I Iike you . Why are you leaving ? I don 't belong here . I belong out there . You belong here . It 's too strange here . It doesn 't move right . helen said that it 's only Iandsickness . We 're all feeling it . It 'II go away soon . It 's more than that . ( SNIFFLES ) well , goodbye , my friend . Oh , I have something for you . It 's dirt . Don 't trade it all in one place . Or do ! It 'II give you reason to come back for more ! ( GREGOR LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY ) It 's all I got , Drifter . It 's enough . Is it that easy for you to just drift away ? Never said it was easy . I don 't understand . I don 't understand . I mean , you brought us here . You belong here as much as anyone , maybe more . What do you think you 're going to find ? What are you looking for out there ? Gregor once said there might be others like me somewhere . I have to know . helen , if I find any others out there like you , I 'II tell them about this place , and how one woman with hope and courage found it . I have something for you , something you 'II need on your journey . I don 't have much to barter with . It 's no trade . It 's a gift . No such thing in WaterworId . well , then let this be the first . It 's a name . It 's from an old story about a great warrior returning from battle . He just set sail , and the water god cursed him , and for the next 10 years , he drifted on the seas . The warrior drifted on the seas , unable to find his way home , until finally the gods took pity on him , and they called up a warm wind that blew him home to his family , and he never left them again . His name was UIysses . It 's a good name . ( PANTING )

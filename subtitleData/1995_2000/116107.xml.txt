 The polar ice caps have melted , covering the Earth with water . Those who survived have adapted ... to a new world . Bad luck , English . But the Slavers are producing a good grade of poxy these days . Cost you a handful of dirt- - or maybe that wind chime . - What are you doin ' here ? - Just waiting . Take your hand off the sail . Take it off ! I 've seen your boat before . Haven 't seen you . Took it legal . Previous owner was dead on the tiller when I found it . You had another hour before I traded up again . Just improving my means . - Well , I owe you then . - No , thanks . I got all the supplies I need . Just came from an atoll . Eight days east , if you 're interested . - Two drifters meet , something needs to be exchanged . - I know the code . But I 'll give you this one for free . Nothing 's free in Waterworld . Ha-ha . Yeah . Smokers . Just enough wind to get away clean . Forget the bag . It 's not worth it . You 'll never make it with your sails down . Hey ! What can I say ? - Joe , he 's goin ' for it . - What the hell ? Never seen that before . Here we go ! Go ! Drive ! Drive ! Faster ! Faster ! Whoo ! Come on ! He 's gonna get it ! He 's gonna get it ! - Pick her up ! - Get it ! Get it ! Oh , no ! Inbound ! Straight out from the gates . English . Flag 's down , drifter . We got enough traders . Dirt . Open the gates ! Bones to berries . Veins to vine . These tendons to trees . This blood to brine . Too old she was . This woman does leave us , recycled and enshrined ... in the presence of Him who leads us . - What is that ? You know me ? I know what you are . Good . Then you know if you look for trouble while you 're here , you 'll find more than you can handle . You got two hours . I 'll only need one . He 's comin ' over here . - Me . - You each get one ... if everything 's here when I get back . - Pure dirt . 3.2 kilos . How 'd you come by so much of it ? Another atoll 30 horizons west of here . Where 'd they get it ? - They didn 't say . - We heard about that place- - that they was all killed . - That 's why they didn 't say . - Smokers ? Maybe Smokers , maybe Slavers . So what 's the word ? We trading ' or not ? We 'll tally it like , uh , pure hydro . Works out to ... 62 chits . I want twice that . - I just want one sip of hydro ! - No , not ' til you tell me . She got inkings on her back . I seen her . They say if you read the marks on the child , they 'll lead ya all the way to Dryland . - Dryland 's a myth . - Some still believe . They say the Smokers even got an eye out for her . Well , then , we 'd better keep it to ourselves . - Help you ? - Yeah . - Where 's the store ? - You found it . You don 't have much . You the man with the dirt ? Skoal . - One more . - Make it two . A man this rich will buy for a fellow outwater , I 'm sure . One . That 's an interesting pair of boots you got . - Trade ? - No . Shame . Enola . Hey , what are you doing ? - No , you can 't do that . - I need another piece . I want to draw some more . I 'll get it to you . Just stay in the back . With all those chits , you could order up a bath . - Have you ever had a freshwater bath ? - Why are you talkin ' to me ? Just being friendly . - Is that a tomato plant ? - Yeah . You have a keen eye . Saw one in a picture . How much ? Half your chits . - I 'll take them too . - Take what ? - You bought everything . - I 'll take them shelves . So , what did you see out there in your 15 months ? - Such as ? - An end to all this water . Askin ' the wrong person . - The one they buried today ? - Uh-huh ? She found the only end there is . I 've got a proposition for you , Mariner . - I 'm not staying . - We 're not asking you to . All we want is your seed . We can look to our own for impregnation , but too much of that sort of thing gets ... undesirable . When she 's pregnant , you go on your way ... with all the supplies you need . You don 't have anything . You 're dying . No man stays out that long and turns down a woman . - He 's hiding something . - Maybe he 's a Smoker spy . When the elders say so , you can leave , and not before . Gills . - Mutation ! - He 's a mutant ! My hand ! Throw the nets ! By what right- - You pay me to keep the peace . This isn 't it . - He has killed one of ours . - He was defending himself . - He needs to be destroyed ! - Kill him . Let 's kill him . - That may be , but not here and not like this . What is it ? Damn . It 's tied . I can 't get it off . Open the gate . Is it a map ? - You 'd tell me if you knew , wouldn 't you , Enola ? - Mm-hmm . - What are you drawing ? - I don 't know . Helen , look . Look at the prodigal child 's latest vision . - How soon before we can leave ? - I don 't have any idea yet where we can go . I haven 't figured out the tattoo on her back . I 'm a stupid man . The answer 's right there . It 's just beyond me . Maybe he knows . Oh , yes , I see . They are webbed . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten digits . That 's wonderful . They tell me , too , that you have gills . Isotropic gills . Are they merely vestigial or are they functional now ? My name is Gregor . I 've just come to pay you a little vi- - vi- - Oh , my God . I 'm sorry . I 'm not laughing at you . I 'm excited . Your gills . They 're functional . Icthyus sapien . You can breathe in the water . How deep can you go ? Look , I 'm only here ... because I want to learn more about you . You don 't like humans very much , do you ? I can 't say that I blame you . But tell me : - Are all of your kind as bad-tempered as you are ? - I have no " kind . " - Oh , fish rot . I 'd be surprised if there weren 't others , and if there aren 't , there will be eventually . Anyway , I 've come here because I need to ask you a question . Where- - Where did your dirt come from ? Is it from Dryland ? Do you know what this is ? The ancients- - They did something terrible , didn 't they ? To cause all this water . Hundreds- - Hundreds of years ago . If I tell you , will you open this lock ? I haven 't a key . - There 's a mooring cleat down there . - What ? - Good as any key . - A mooring cleat ? I won 't hurt anyone . I 'll just leave . - I 'll be right back . - Gregor ! What 's your business there ? - Move along ! - I 'm not a brave man . If you know anything about Dryland , please tell me . Please ! Don 't let it die with you . No , no , no , no . Stop ! Gregor ! Move along ! After considerable deliberation of the evidence at hand , it is our decision that this mute-o ... does , indeed , constitute a threat . Therefore , in the interest of public safety , he is hereby sentenced to be recycled ... in the customary fashion . Proceed . I 'm sorry . Bones to berries . Veins to vines . His tendons to trees . His blood to brine . Too strange for life he was . This mute-o now does leave us , recycled and entombed , in the presence of Him who leads us . Smokers ! Dead out of the sun ! To your posts ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! - Kill ! - There ! We are safe behind these walls . - Aren 't we ? - Let me out ! Let me out ! I 'll fight ! Give me the key to the city now . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Floor it ! Floor it ! Floor it ! Swab it ! Swab it ! Goddamn ! More ammo ! Break down the door ! - My God ! Ha ! We 'll have this atoll in no time . Crank it ! Crank it ! Look ! Look out ! Oh , no ! You get that goin ' ! Fill ' em up ! Helen , come quickly ! Helen ! You 're not supposed to go yet ! Infernal machine ! Gregor . Gregor , wait ! Helen , I tried . There was an accident . I can 't make it stop . Hurry ! You can make it if you try . Run ! Up those stairs . Run ! Quickly ! - Wait ! Wait ! - I 'll throw you a rope . Run quickly ! - Throw the rope now . Run , Enola . - Slow down ! Wait ! - Throw the rope . No ! No ! - Wait ! - Gregor , don 't leave us ! - Oh , no ! I 'm sorry ! It was an accident ! Helen ! Enola ! Helen , I 'm sorry ! Shoot him . Shoot him . If I let you out of here , you 're taking us with you . Sure . Enola , get down . Here . Get over here . Get down . Hurry ! Come on ! Get the gate . Run ! Hurry up ! Kamikazes . Come on ! That made a hole . Find her ! Get the girl ! There ! Go get that guy ! Go ! Kill him ! - Wow ! - Enola ! - You 're too slow ! - Run to the other side . - Come on ! - Grab on ! Hold on , hold on . I 'm stuck ! I can 't make it through ! - Let her go ! Just drop her ! Turn the wheel . The wheel ! Turn it ! That ! Come on ! Push it ! - I am ! - Hurry ! Now pull ! Push it ! Push it hard ! Push it hard ! Okay , okay ! Now pull this ! Pull this ! Pull ! Pull it ! Hurry ! - Enola , jump . - Look at me . Jump ! Now ! - Okay ! Well , excuse me ! Did I say anybody could leave before the battle was over ? - Did I ? - No ! No ! Well , do somethin ' . I hate sails . Hey ! Can you steer ? Can I trust you ? Answer me this , somebody . Why is that boat still firing ' ? - What 's that cousin 's name ? - Chuck . - Hey , Chuck ! He 's pulling him right into us . Maybe he doesn 't answer to " Chuck . " Call him " Charles . " Charles ! Stop him ! Stop him ! Charles ! Adios , cousins . She 's here somewhere . Keep lookin ' . Stop it ! - What you got ? - Couple of heartbeats over there . Aren 't sayin ' much . If you 'll notice the arterial nature of the blood comin from the hole in my head , you can assume that we 're all havin ' a real lousy day . So here it is : I need to know about that tattooed girl . First one that tells me lives . - I saw a girl . I saw , I saw- - - It was- - Sh-She had a big tattoo on her . You won . Start over . I saw a girl . I 'm not sure , but I think she got on that boat with three hulls . - The boat that cost me a thousand G 's of go-juice ? - Yeah , the mute-o 's boat . - Mute-o ? - Yeah . He got these slits here . Like- - Like fish gills . He wasn 't really a man . A fluke of evolution . Oh , I 'm sorry . A fluke of , uh- - - Evolution . - I know ! - No ! No , you said you wouldn 't kill me ! - Did I say that ? - Witnesses , anybody , did I ? - Yes , yes , yes ! You said- - - You said it . - Oh , I may have . I may have . We get to the ' Deez , tank up that sky boat ; send it out on patrol . We gotta keep an eye out ... for that ichthy-freak . You been there , haven 't you ? Dryland ? You know where it is . Yeah , I know where it is . And , uh- - And we 're going ? You and I are . The kid we gotta pitch over the side . - What ? - My boat 's tore up . I 'm takin ' on water . I 'd be lucky to get half a hydro ration out of that . You know- - I said I won 't drink . For 12 days ? No . It 's better one of you dies now ... than both of you die slow . Wait . Wait . We saved your life . We got you out . No , you got me out so you could get out . We 're even . She can cook . She can fish . - So can I. - Then take my necklace . Take my necklace . - I got better ones below . - No , look ! Oh . After what you went through back there on the atoll , I can understand why you would want to . But she 's a child . Is there something else then ? Enola ! Go below . Enola . Yeah . You said so yourself . Been out there a long time . Couple hours ago , I was potential dirt to you . - We 're not like that . - You all are . Know what I was really thinkin ' ? Why I don 't drop both of you in my wake right now . You got nothin ' I need . You 're taking us to Dryland . Killing 's a hard thing to do well . - Believe me . I 'm not the one to start on . - Both of us ! How long you plan to hold that on me ? As long as it takes . - Okay . - No ! Let me out of here ! Where the hell are you ? Don 't you touch my child . Come here ! Okay , now don 't move , okay ? There . Ohh . Oh , lookin real good , yeah . There . There . All done . Now , there may be some small problem in depth perception . Well , it better not screw up my short game . - Well ? - Looks good . I like it . Yeah . - I like it better than your real eye . - Much better . - What do you say , Toby ? The truth . - Looks like shit . That 's why I love children . No guile . It does look like shit . And it feels like cold shit ! Deacon ? What- - I 'm sorry . I-It 's just that there 's a problem in the pit . Maybe you should come . - Let 's drive . The pit . Don 't bother with the scenic route . Drive ! Hey , it 's drivin ' better . Get off ! Get over there . Get out of the way . All right , all right , all right . Okay , okay . You guys are great . Bless all you cousins over there . Keep up the good work . Growth is progress . Growth is progress . Somebody ! Hey , up there ! Take it off ! - Yes . - Your Deaconship . Hello . Good morning . Or night , whichever the case may be . - What is it ? I 'm a busy man . - I thought you should know . We 're down to exactly ... four feet , nine inches of black stuff . - Thank you , sir . - How many G 's is that after refining ' ? - Maybe three refuelers . - We 'll burn through that in two lunars . - Sweet Joe ! Will somebody please tell me what 's happened to this place ? We outgrowed it . All right , the only thing that is important is the tattooed girl . We don 't spare any go-juice finding ' her . We don 't waste it anywhere else . You cancel all those tractor pulls ... and all that stuff until later . You got it ? Dryland is the mother lode . On your toes . Excellent . - Hi . - Move . Enola ! Enola , come here ! Come on ! Enola , come over here . Hey ! - What are ya doin ' ? - Decorating your boat . It 's ugly . - Where did you get this ? - From down below . This is mine ! You don 't touch anything of mine . - I drew it for you . - You don 't draw on anything . You understand ? What- - This is my boat . I got it the way I like it . You take up space and you slow me down . You know , she 's just a little girl . - She doesn 't know your rules . - You wanna stay ? You teach her . Enola , what 'd I tell you ? You 're not so tough . You know that ? How many people have you killed ? Ten ? Twenty ? - You talk a lot . - I talk a lot ' cause you don 't talk at all . Now how many ? - Including little girls ? - I 'm not afraid of you . I told Helen you wouldn 't be so ugly if you cut your hair . In fact , you talk all the time . - It 's like a storm when you 're around . - Enola ! Hey ! What are you doing ? - Helen ! - You bastard ! She can 't swim ! Help me ! Helen ! Helen , help me ! Helen ! Helen , help me ! Helen ! Helen ! Hold on ! Look at me . Look at me . Look at me . Oh , please , come back . Please ! Please ! Oh , please ! Hey ! Hold on . Okay , almost ... there . Thanks . I swear , if you ever touch her again- - You son of a bitch . Look at me . You will go to bed that night , and you will never wake up . - Shut up . - What ? - Smokers ? - Yeah . Can 't we outrun them ? - Not with my sail down . - What are you thinkin ' about ? - That 's a nice touch . That 's them . Don 't hit the kid . Hey ! Coward ! Fuck ! No ! Cut it ! Come on ! Come on ! All right . Okay . Oh , I 'm really sorry . I 'm sorry . But you didn 't give me much choice . Oh , I know . But you ran away . I- - What ? What are you do- - No ! Please , no ! No ! Don 't ever touch anything on my boat again . She said she was sorry ! That means you 're supposed to say something back ! - Did you say somethin ' ? - Mm-mmm . The child- - did he have the girl with him ? - Uh-huh . - Seems to me if we launch now , we can cut him down just about here . - If he doesn 't change course . - Ah , it 's not likely . He 's a wily one , that ichthy-demon . Yeah , if he knows he 's been spotted , he 'll expect us to expect him to change course , which is exactly why he 'll keep his heading . The important question is , where 's he heading ? And does he know how precious his cargo is ? I say that he 's headed here , and we take him here . - Drifter ? - Mm-hmm . - Are we gonna stop ? - Look at the flag ! - His flag 's up . I thought you all stopped for each other . Well ... maybe he has some food ! Don 't find many who follow the rules anymore . Well , make it quick . What 's your business ? Trade . You got any resin ? Resin ? He 's gotta be out of his mind . He 's out of his mind . I don 't have any resin . - You been outwater a long time , haven 't you ? Must be jokin ' me , man . Resin ! You don 't got enough . How ' bout food ? Could you say that again , please ? - How ' bout food ? - Ah , yeah , food . Yeah , that 'd be good , eh ? I haven 't eaten in , well , you know , forever . Which one of you two is a cook ? 'Cause I usually fall for the waitress . Like you said , I don 't have much . Now listen , eh ? Let 's see . What do I have to do ? We can start with that wee orchard you got over there . - All right , hold it there . - We can talk . - Fair enough . It 's a nice rod , isn 't it ? I like that rod . It 's a nice rod . Got yourself a wee harem goin ' here now , do ya ? What you want for the women ? We 're not for sale . Not for sale ? There 's no such thing as not for sale . " Not for sale " ! Not for sale , eh ? - Are they a pair or would you consider selling ' ' em separate ? - No . Our business is done here unless you got some resin for sale you can part with . I told you once already , I don 't have it . I-I-I don 't have it . Don 't have it . Don 't have it . Haven 't seen neither for trade in lunars now . Wait . Wait , wait , wait . I do have somethin ' that 'll make you change your mind . Somethin ' that you can 't pass on . I took it off an Atoller refugee camp . The life savings of the entire clan . Paper . It 's paper . Have you ever seen paper ? Look at it . Smell it . I been savin ' it for a special trade . Don 't you do it . You know , maybe I 'm talkin to the wrong person here . Whose boat is this ? Is it your boat or your boat ? No . No , it 's his boat . But he doesn 't own us . Half an hour . Out of his mind somethin ' there . I got two pages in here , man ! I mean , I 'd get half a dozen girls with this , you know . Half an hour . - You trading ' or not ? - Don 't . Shut up . Okay .

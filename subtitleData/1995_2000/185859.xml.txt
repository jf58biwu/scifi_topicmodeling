 Girls , our campaign is progressing . You 've all heard of Elizabeth 's success ! But we can 't stop there ! We must go forth and strike again . I 'll brief you on your next tasks . You 'll need to take notes . Henry ! Henry ! Yes , Henrietta , right away ! Then make it right away ! Right , are we all ready ? We 'll begin then . The most pressing task is ... Henry , have you fiinished ? Sorry ! Very well then . We 'll continue . First with you , Sara . Your next assignment will be Sir George Morton . ... an order of 24 prams . Yours faithfully ... You can go now , Mary . You 'll send that tomorrow . - But the Peabody fille ... - I 'll attend to that . Off you go ! Take a cab home . Thank you . Good night , Sir George . Good night , Mary . Sara , darling ! Georgie , darling ! You look lovely tonight . Ravishing . Make yourself comfortable . I 'll mix us a drink . Scotch on the rocks . I remembered ! I 'm so glad you could come ! I told me wife I 'd be very late ! The staff have gone home . We can be alone for hours ! - How nice ! - Isn 't it ... My dear ! I found him lying there . I was always in fiirst , you see . He didn 't accept tardiness so I was always careful to be on time . I 'm sure he thought very highly of you , but he 's dead . You have to face that . Business must go on . That 's why I 'm here , Mary . Yes , Mr. Rudge . I 'll do all I can to help you . Good girl . Nowthese investment sheets , the fiigures appear correct , but I can 't link them to the individual fiirms . They 're cross-referenced here . Orders going out , here , returns , here , payments , here . Profiits , defiicits , orders on hold , and orders completed . I see . It 's a bit complex , isn 't it ? Sir George wanted his system to be complex . " Industrial security " , he called it . Hello ? Would you put him through ? Yes , sir . an off of £ 10 000 . We tendered for that on the 21st of the month . Yes , I can break it down for you : £ 5000 initial cost , £ 1000 survey , £ 2500 to cover wages , the rest in interest at 9 % . Less your overhead which we 'll defray at the signing . I 'll attend to that . The contract will be in this morning 's post . I 'm so sorry , where were we ? I was wondering about the complexity of the system , but you seem to have a fline grasp of it . I 'm putting you in charge . There 's no other way out of it . an outsider would need weeks to manage it . But ... a temporary measure , until I think something up . You will do it ? - I 'll do my best . - Excellent . I 'll leave you . I 'll be in my offiice . Steed . John Steed . Oh , yes ... The ministry said you 'd be by , but I don 't know why . Since you 've asked : 11 murders . a downright epidemic ! all prominent businessmen . That 's the only common factor . - Why come to me ? - I 'd like your help . Willingly , but how ? You were at Sir George 's offiice this morning . - Checking the books ? - Rapidly ... Is it conceivable that Sir George 's murder covers up another crime , say ... embezzlment ? - Impossible . - Oh , dear ! I examined Sir George 's books in detail , just 2 days ago . Everything was in order . - I see . - His staff are very effiicient . Especially his secretary . The idea of one of them embezzling is absurd . - Thanks anyway . Good day . - Good day , Mr. Steed . - Yes , sir . - Miss Penny ! Take a memo . To the minister . My dear minister ... Re : the man you sent me this morning . Far be it from me to advise you , but I felt that he was over dramatizing . Hysterical even . The idea that a plot , as he suggested , may exist , seems to be pure fantasy . You were so effiicient with Morgan I 've decided to use you again . His name is Jack Findley . Henry will give you the details of his favorite clubs . Henry ! Findley is a woman chaser . Let 's hope he 'll take to you . He will ! I 'll make sure of it ! Oh , Jack ! I can 't believe we 've only just met . I feel as if I 've known you for ages . That 's nice . From another admirer ? It 's very cute . - and it works too ! - No ! It does ! Sara , calling H.Q. Insurance ? No link between benefiiciaries . Shareholders ? Somebody bumps the boss and cleans up on the market . Half the victims had private companies ! Personal grudge ? Could be . - But you don 't think so ! - No . 11 men , unconnected , prosperous , respected ... Steed here . Yes . Where ? I 'm on my way . Correction : for 11 men read 12 ! He 's Jack Findley , of " Findley and Company " . Prosperous businessman ? His company is in London . His accountant is Joshua Rudge . Rudge ? I don 't know him . I do . I met him earlier today . - What 's that perfume ? - I 'm not wearing any . - It 's very pleasant . - Sweet . Too sweet for aftershave . Don 't move . There was a woman here ! We should locate her . Tire pump . See if you can have it identifiied . I 'm going to see Joshua Rudge . Mr. Rudge ? What is the nature of your business , Mrs. Peel ? It 's rather personal . One moment . - Mr. Hooter will see you . - Thank you . Excuse me ! Good afternoon , sir . Your wife sent you to collect her parcel ? - Mr. Hooter ? - Yes . Mr. J.J. Hooter ? Indisputably . - What can I do for you ? - Identify some perfume . Of course . Is it one of my creations ? - I don 't know . - Where is the perfume ? Did you know , Mrs. Peel , there are many more convenient sprays available ? I myself manufacture more than 100 kinds . It was all I had . a question of identifiication ? You have come to the right person . My proboscis is probably the most sensitive in Europe . - I 'll be glad to assist you . - Thank you . First I must prepare . I wear this to protect my sinuses . No obnoxious effluvia can assault my nostrils ! It is highly necessary . I smell a great deal . You do ? I mean ... you do ! My nose is in great demand . Perfumer 's exhibitions , Paris , Tokyo and New York . I have smelled all over the world . You see the splendid beast , naked before you ! It 's very ... handy ! Wait until you see him in action ! Wait until you see him twitch and flare . Distilled water . Pure to the thousandth part . Right , my nose is yours . Now ! - " Leap into my Fervid arms . " - Pardon ? Got it right off . a tingle at the back here , a tickle at the front , a hint of sweetness . " Leap into my Fervid arms . " It 's my own creation . Exclusive and expensive . Do you sell a great deal ? Only to the very well-off . - Have you a customer list ? - Indubitably . Miss Merkle ? Yes , sir ? Bring me the fille on " Leap into my Fervid arms " . Yes , sir . It 's very kind of you . Not at all . The customer list appears to be missing . It was sent to the warehouse this morning . I 'm sorry . I 'm unable to assist you right away . Later today , perhaps ? Thank you , I 'll do that . Oh , Mrs. Peel ... - Your appliance ! - Thank you . a fresh nose snood , please , Gladys . Charming woman , that Mrs. Peel ! a delightful freshness about her . She was very interested in my nose . She ... You spoil me , Henry , really ! It 's my favorite perfume . Gladys Merkle calling H.Q. Come in ! Hurry up , Henry ! Yes , dear . Come in ! Tell Mme Henrietta my mission is completed . Successfully completed . I 'll tell her . My congratulations . Yes , dear ! Sorry , dear ! Henrietta congratulates you . and now ? Joshua Rudge , dear . Dear Mr. Rudge ! I should look my best for him . Yes , dear . My red dress . With the pearls . This one ? There were 2 of them , jumped me from behind . No sign of Joshua Rudge . Disappeared completely . - Permanently ? - Perhaps . This broke off during the flight . a man 's fob seal ! Or a woman 's charm bracelet . I saw one today , at the perfumer 's . I 'm due back there soon . Fill that in with amber . Do I look like that ? Dead ! Dead . Soon after you left . a sudden seizure . a seizure ! Poor Mr. Hooter . He promised me a list of clients . - Sorry , I can 't allowthat . - You can 't a / / ow / It 's a close-knit business . Mr. Hooter and I ran it between us . So now he 's gone ... I 'm in charge . - I 've given it a lot of thought ... - Yes , colonel ... What about the 1st killing ? Thanks , colonel . Well ? It flits . In each case , the offiice system was so complex only the secretary knew it . - So when he died ... - The secretary took his place . They 're so effiicient , they 're now running the show ! There 's the answer . They 're all hired by different agencies . There 's no link . - Young , pretty , effiicient . - Ruthless . Someone is bringing them together . Who ? Mr. Rudge is here , Henrietta . Bring him closer . It 's so nice to meet you at last , Mr. Rudge . Good morning . What can I do for you ? I wanted to see Mr. Rudge . - He 's not here . - Not here ? He 's on an extended holiday . Extended holiday ! He promised to help me . Steed . John Steed . It 's only a trifling matter , but he did say ... While he 's away , I 'm in charge . Have a seat . Thank you . What 's the problem ? I 'm setting up in business - stocks , investments - but it 's a little diffiicult . I have £ 4 million to manage . - £ 4 million ! - To manage ! It 's the extent of my credit . I see . Just how can I help you ? I don 't have an offiice yet . I 'm working at home , alone . Mr. Rudge said he 'd help me fiind someone for my paperwork . It would be part-time , mostly evenings . It will take a great deal of intiative to cope . What you need is a secretary . a thoroughly effiicient secretary . Mrs. Merriweather ? Mrs. Peel , these fiigures are incorrect . You 're showing £ 120 more than necessary . The Baxters phoned last night , after you left . They wanted their goods , so I sent them . - Rather than lose a customer ... - I see . You did well to use your intiative . I like that . Thank you . You 're also very effiicient for the rest .

Ladies , come along . Position 33 , please . Relax into it slowly . Leaving ? I 'm working overtime on my next victim . Keep your knees straight . - Good evening . - Good evening . - Correspondance this evening ? - Yes . I 've been thinking . about what ?

Letters written , bills paid , everything neatly filled . - I must say it baffles me . - What ? Your filling system . It 's so complex I don 't understand it . I do , so when you 've gone , I can take over . - Gone ? - abroad . away on some business trip . Good night , Mr. Steed . Good night , Miss Penny . Right , ladies . On your feet !

The goal of this organization is to take women from the secretary 's chair and to put them at the executive desk . To bring men to heel and women to power . - 20th century amazons ! - Exactly . - Do you still wish to join us ? - Yes . - Whatever it may entail ? - Whatever .

She could have been the greatest ballerina ever . Then , they took her away . Bussinessmen . " Form your own company , Henrietta . " " We 'll manage it for you . " That 's what they said . But they destroyed her , bankrupt , ruined , until fiinally ... Men did that to her , businessmen ! That 's why I did what I did . For her ... in her memory . One , two ... It 's okay ...

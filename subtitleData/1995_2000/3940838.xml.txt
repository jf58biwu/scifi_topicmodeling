 ( Rygel groaning ) God , I 'm going to be sick . What 's with the rough ride ? Moya need a tune-up or something ? Moya 's pregnancy has drastically weakened her ability to Starburst . Some minor turbulence is an unfortunate by-product . If this is minor , I don 't want to see major . It 's not just the Starburst , John . Moya 's sensors are dimmed . We 're practically flying blind . I 'm compensating for that . All her systems are running less efficiently as well . She can 't help it . Her child has first call on her resources . Now I understand why the Peacekeepers tried to prevent this pregnancy . We are about to exit Starburst . There is no reason for concern . Famous last words . I guess we can turn off the " fasten seat belt " sign now . Pilot ! Incoming ! I see it ! Whoa ! Zhaan : Pilot , any damage to Moya ? None detected , but the other ship has lost propulsor control . I 'm deploying the docking web to bring her aboard . is that wise ? Our record with guests isn 't too sweet , Pilot . Moya and I should have avoided that collision entirely . Yeah , but isn 't there some way we can ... No . I 'll rally the troops . Stop there . I am unarmed . But your ship is not . We 've detected a massive energy weapon . Powered right down , for the moment . is that not evidence of our peaceful intentions ? There are more on your ship . Two others , also unarmed . May I inform them that it is safe for them to emerge ? Aeryn : All right , go ahead . Salis . You may join us now . You . You can 't be alive . I saw you dead . I saw your stinking corpse . Rygel ! What the hell are you doing ? It 's him ! It 's Durka ! Vicious , murdering bastard . Captain of the Zelbinion , the first ship I was imprisoned on . My torturer ! Aeryn : Don 't be ridiculous , Rygel . Durka died well over 100 cycles ago . Crichton : Rygel ... you 're way off base here . No , he is not " off-base . " I amDurka . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut .. . ... a radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole .. . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship . A living ship full of strange alien life-forms .. . Help me .. . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? ... being hunted by an insane military commander .. . ... doing everything I can .. . I 'm just looking for a way home . Rygel : Let me at him ! Crichton : Damn it ! D 'Argo : You claim to be Captain Durka from the Peacekeeper Command Carrier Zelbinion . I was . I told you it was him . Behave ! Aeryn : How is it possible ? Even if you survived the Zelbinion , you would have died of old age over 50 cycles ago . He was fortunate . We saved him . I am Salis . My people are the Nebari . You brought this monster on board . Rygel . He poses no danger . No danger ? He tortured me . That behavior will not recur . He is now incapable of evil . D 'Argo : If this is Durka , how can we be certain that he no longer poses any threat ? Because we spent over a hundred cycles making sure . Rygel : A million cycles would not change him . He will always be Durka . Put me down . Salis : Your friend will soon understand that he is wrong . Crichton : It might take a while . Being tortured has that effect . I suppose you would know . You are a Sebacean . No . I 'm a human . Human ? I 'm not familiar with your species . We are due to rendezvous with our host ship in this quadrant . In the interim , we will require quarters and sustenance . Durka : Does this ship possess any kind of containment cells ? We are transporting a very dangerous criminal . What 's her crime ? Nothing you need concern yourself about . Our quarters ? D 'Argo : They 're ready . This way . I will supervise the repairs to our ship personally . D 'Argo : The DRDs have nearly completed their damage assessment . Have you ever been stung by the watruka plant ? Not yet . Salis : They , too , present an intriguing exterior . Yeah . Appearances can be deceiving . I 'm sure the same has often been said about me . Please ... Help me . Chiana . They won 't tell you what I 've done because they 're embarrassed . You ... You wouldn 't consider it a crime . But we do and that 's enough . I beg you . I beg you for amnesty . We 're not a diplomatic ship . Then use moral authority , please . What they 're going to do to me is cruel by anyone 's ... ( electronic whining ) ( gasping and choking ) Stop it ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Her behavior was inappropriate , which is why she wears a collar in the first place . I don 't give a damn if she 's an axe murderer , Elvis . She was just talking to me . You crippled our ship , endangered our lives , disrupted our plans . Are you now the arbiter of our justice system as well ? Zhaan : The Nebari practice mind control ? We simply eliminated those thought patterns that led him to behave inappropriately . Eliminated ? A process of neural realignment so intricate that each subject must be placed under cryonic suspension for nearly 100 cycles . So it is the real Durka . Zhaan : And what does each subject feel during this ... this " treatment " ? Durka appreciates what we did for him . Ask him if you don 't believe me . Perhaps I will . Had it been possible , we would have saved everyone aboard the Zelbinion , not just Captain Durka . Why was it not possible ? They refused to surrender . You defeated a Peacekeeper Command Carrier ? How many warships did it take ? We have no warships . One of our standard host vessels engaged the Zelbinion , much like the one coming for us . ( knife being sharpened ) Get out of my quarters . What are you up to , Rygel ? Nothing . I 'm just sitting here reflecting on my fond memories of Durka and the Zelbinion . Great . Reflect all you like , but you will leave the visitors alone , is that clear ? Visitors ? Has Moya turned into a Glendian pleasure vessel now ? I 'm just here to make sure that you don 't think it 's a good idea to run amok on some childish vendetta . That is a sadistic madman out there . So you have claimed . I was there ! lmprisoned on board the Zelbinion nearly a hundred cycles before you were born ? What do you know of Durka ? Nothing ! Actually , I was taught a great deal about Captain Durka 's distinguished career . Force fed a pack of Peacekeeper propaganda ! Ha ! And what did you think when we came upon the wreck of the Zelbinion and found that your brave captain had shot himself ? Simply this . You said that you found his corpse . Obviously you were mistaken . Apparently he chose to end his distinguished career by faking his own death , all to save himself whilst his crew died around him . You don 't know what happened . I know all I need to . Durka is alive . ( gasping ) See that he stays that way . Aeryn : I must say I am more than curious . I studied all your achievements at Peacekeeper training . I achieved nothing as a Peacekeeper . The liberation of Mintaka Three ? The quelling of the Cenobian rebellion ? These are legendary . No . These are meaningless , brute-force solutions . The Nebari showed me a better way . The Nebari took over the Zelbinion and killed your crew . We had invaded their sector . How did you survive their attack ? I faked my death and left on an escape pod . You deserted your ship ? I have done far worse in my time . ( knocks ) I thought you might be hungry . I am . Thanks . Not very tasty . Nope . But it 's the best we have . They 're pretty worried about you . Well , of course they are . I , uh ... I don 't respect authority . I do what I want when I want to do it . is that the only reason you 're in there ? Look , this ... this is stupid . I 'm not going to eat like this . I , uh , I appreciate your trying , though . So , you were about to tell me why Salis and Durka went to so much trouble to bring you back . Because I left the half-dead sanctimoniousness of my planet the first chance I got . I , uh ... I stole food when I was hungry . Jumped transport without voucher . Defended myself when necessary . Did you ever kill anyone ? They tell you I did ? I 'm asking you . No . Then help me understand the collar and the cuffs . Among my people , you ... you conform . You don 't do the things I ... I did . What will they do with you now ? Same thing as Durka . Mental cleansing into a ... into an obedient zombie . They do that to their own kind ? Gah . They do that to anybody they please . They think they 're doing you a favor . Like hell . Not to me , they 're not . No ... I won 't let ' em ! Chiana , relax . You relax . They 're not going to frell with yourbrain , are they ? No , and they 're not going to with mine , either . I 'd rather be dead ! Chiana , stop it ! Easy . It 's all right . You 're all right . Don 't let them take me . Please . You 're all right . Crichton : According to Chiana the Nebari mental cleansing is a bit like brainwashing . No . It is more a correction . Crichton : There 's a difference ? Durka : Yes . As much as a difference between a knife attack and life-saving surgery . ( yelling ) Zhaan ! Zhaan ! Moya 's detected explosions in the Maintenance Bay . John ! Aeryn ! Anyone ! Zhaan , stay put . D 'Argo , meet me down there . ( shrieks ) ( grunting ) You ! You set off a bomb inside the damned ship ? He grabbed me . He tried to strangle me ! Crichton : He 's been brain-neutered , you moron . Crichton ! This bastard just tried to frag us . Did not . Yeah he did , and I 'm ready to kick his sorry ass off the ship right now ! Listen to me . He isn 't cured . I saw it in his face . The evil , it was there ! My presence obviously seems to give you great pain . With Salis 's permission , I shall confine myself to areas outside your sight . No . We 'll lock Rygel up first . You stupid Luxan ! I am trying to save us from that maniac ! A ship capable of destroying the Zelbinion is headed our way . We do not want to make them our enemies . Salis ! What 's going on ? There was an explosion . You thought I had something to do with the blast ? That was my first assumption , yes . Well , switch to your second assumption . I had nothing to do with it . I can never believe you , Chiana . Remain calm . We 'll be home soon . Didn 't you ever ... ever want to travel ? See other places ? Do other things ? Yes , and I have . When you were my age ? When I was your age I was focused on what I could do to fit in , not stand apart . But I thought my ... my " standing apart " appealed to you . I see the way you look at me . You want to run your hands around again ? ( gasping and choking ) Remain calm . ( panting ) I 'm perfectly calm . I found this in Rygel 's quarters . It 's Jelifan fire paste , stevva crystals and detonators . Fortunately , the ignorant Hynerian got all the proportions wrong . Not enough stevva crystals . And if he had gotten them right ? Well , we wouldn 't be having this conversation now . Pilot : The explosion does not seem to have damaged Moya 's systems . What if he tries again ? He won 't . He 's locked in his quarters under restraint . You will of course turn him over to me when the host ship arrives . I will do nothing of the sort . He has serious flaws in his character that must be corrected . Even Rygel , with his many faults , does not deserve that . There are many aspects of your character that would benefit from adjustment . My point exactly . ( handcuffs springing open ) ( doors whoosh open ) Who is that ? I 'm in no mood for visitors . ( doors whoosh closed ) ls someone there ? Pilot , are you playing with the doors ? Quiet down , or I 'll have to hurt you . Quiet , you toad ! Let 's deal . All right , we both want something , don 't we ? You want to be untied so you can kill Durka , right ? And what I want is to get off this ship . You got any problems with that ? We 're making great progress . You scream , I push this cushion down to your colon . ( gasping ) Untie me . Ha ! Typical male . Satisfy yourself first . I can tell you exactly how to get to the transport hangar and what codes will open the door . Got to do better . I can find it myself and crack the door code . I got in here , didn 't I ? I can create a diversion and draw everyone away from the hangar . They 'll be too busy chasing me to bother with you . Okay . I , uh ... I apologize for calling you a toad . I make allowances for stress on this ship . Oh , no . This isn 't stress , old man . Stress is if you don 't come through for me . The Nebari woman 's escaped ! She 's in my quarters . Rygel ? Rygel . Rygel , you better not be lying ! If Chiana has escaped she 'll probably head here . I 'll wait here for them . Salis ? Chiana may have escaped . ( sighs ) Find her . Make sure the others know that she 's capable of violence . So are we . ( muffled groaning ) ( muffled groaning continues ) I guess he wasn 't lying . ( spitting ) She 's headed for the hangar . Wants to steal a transport . Zhaan , we got a problem . Chiana 's on the loose . Pilot , get the DRDs searching . Wait ! Wait ! Untie me ! I 'll-l 'll help you search . I 'm the one who told you she 'd escaped . ( electronic pulsing ) The DRDs are searching all the atmosphere ducts . John , no sign of her on tier three . Got it , Zhaan . Keep searching . D 'Argo ? She won 't get by me . Aeryn : Oh , you can do it yourself Rygel , then . Ah , that hurts . Rygel : Agh ! Get him away from me ! I can 't find Chiana . is someone guarding the Command ? Why ? is she capable of taking over the ship ? Possibly . She is capable of anything . Crichton , there 's movement on your tier . There 's movement on your tier ! Zhaan : Chiana did this ? Looks like it . ( sighs ) Considering what Salis had in mind for her , I can 't be surprised . The question is , how are the Nebari going to react ? We better find her before she racks up another victim . Come on , Rygel . Rygel : Right behind you . Pilot , any reports from the DRDs ? Pilot : No trace of her . She 's very good at staying hidden . D 'Argo : If you see Chiana , shoot to kill . If you insist . Did I overhear correctly ? Salis is dead ? Yes , I 'm sorry . No . Please , no ... Salis cannot be dead . ( grunting ) ( groans ) ( grunts ) ( grunting ) D 'Argo , I 'm halfway through tier four . No sign of Chiana . You got anything there yet ? Hey ... D 'Argo , you read me ? What do you think you 're doing ? ! ( gasps ) Crichton . D 'Argo . Zhaan . Can anyone hear me ? Come in . Not good . ( gasping ) Hello , ( gasping ) Rygel . You undid the Nebari mental cleansing . Isn 't that the most superb irony ? ( coughs ) : Durka . And now , Officer Sun rejoins us . I was just about to tell Rygel how good it feels to be back in my right mind . While I was cleansed , I genuinely felt ashamed of who I was and what I 'd done . But do you know , thinking about it now , I have no idea why . I take it you murdered Salis . It 's the simple things you really miss . ( breath shaking ) ( gasps ) Crew of Moya , this is Captain Selto Durka , the new commander of this Leviathan . I am in complete control of this ship and I am holding Rygel and Officer Sun hostage . You will leave this ship immediately or you will die . Crichton , Durka murdered Sal ... Pilot ? Anybody ? Durka , talk to me ! Crichton ! Zhaan , respond ! ( growling ) ( yells ) Crap ! Pilot : Zhaan ? Thank goodness . That madman 's taken over half of Moya 's systems . Even the Comms are under his control . Can you override , Pilot ? He knows every synaptic bypass . Every countermeasure I take , he anticipates . Whoa ! Whoa , whoa , point that thing somewhere else . You heard Durka 's ultimatum ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Nebari mental cleansing doesn 't get the tough stains out . Even with the hostages , we must retake command . Right . You got a plan ? ( snickers ) Have I got a plan ? This hatch leads directly to command . Are you sure ? Just look for the girl . Look , I 'm not too sure that she ... Hey , try not to fall out of the ship again . I 'll do my best . There appears to be an obstruction in the access shaft . I was wondering how long it would take someone to try that . ( grunts ) D 'Argo ? ! Crichton ! Witnessing a legend in action . This must be quite a privilege for you , Officer Sun . ( chuckling ) You 're not a legend , Durka . I take that back . You 're a disgrace . Because I had the intelligence to know when to retreat . Ah , but you didn 't retreat when the Nebari took the Zelbinion . You ran . The crew of the Zelbinion is dead . I am not . Officer Sun , how is it you 're not a Peacekeeper anymore ? The one thing I 've always admired about these Leviathans is their wonderful talent for Starburst . Say goodbye to the Nebari sector . ( engine powering up ) Starburst ? I thought we couldn 't Starburst . ( engine powering down ) Score one up for the underdogs . Because of her child , Moya is unable to Starburst for several more arns at least . He 's obviously not aware that Moya 's pregnant , but he 's sure to find out about the pregnancy soon enough . Crew of Moya , you will reactivate Starburst immediately , or I will kill the hostages . Come on out , Chiana . Look , I don 't have time to play this game . Durka 's gone Hannibal Lecter on us . Chiana : I don 't know what that means . And why bother me , anyway ? ( Chiana laughing ) I 'm just here to talk . Still nothing . Attention . Despite my demands , Starburst is still non-operational . Perhaps it might expedite matters if I leave the channel open this time . Aeryn : This won 't help you . You have studied my techniques Officer Sun . You know very well how good I am at getting results . Rygel , do you know what we Sebaceans dislike more than anything else ? Heat . Intense heat . To think this could have been avoided . Durka , you are pathetic . Look at you , salivating at the chance to maim and kill someone who can 't even defend herself . Foaming at the mouth like a sick trelkez . Pathetic . Why , Rygel , what 's this ? Something I should have said to you a long time ago . Durka : Yet you didn 't . I was going to save you for a bargaining tool , but now I 'm wondering , do you think your shipmates would really care if I just burnt your face right off ? Go ahead and find out. i don 't care . Because the all-powerful Durka is a failure . It 's the truth , Durka . You tortured me without mercy , but you never broke me . You only made me stronger . And even if you kill me , I 'll be laughing at you , because the last thing I 'll think of is you on Nebari Prime for another hundred cycles being ground back down into nothing . This Leviathan you 've commandeered is pregnant . Aeryn : Check the nutrient flow . Look at the power levels . All those resources are going somewhere , aren 't they ? Moya 's diverting energy to her baby . Get ready to greet the Nebari , Durka , because there 's nothing you can do to get Starburst back . Yes there is . Chiana : Turn around . I 'm unarmed . Turn around . Listen . ( screaming ) ( coughing ) You okay ? Are you finished ? I 'm sorry . I 'm not used to trusting anybody . I suggest you start . How could Durka have broken the ... the mental cleansing ? It 's irreversible . It 's not my department . Take that up with your mental engineers . That 's why he wants to get away from here so bad , 'cause he 's afraid my people will recondition him . Well , that 's something you have in common . Might be able to use that against him . Well , maybe it 's to my advantage to team up with him . Do you have a hearing problem , Chiana ? Durka 's insane . He 's a psychopath . Legendary . And nobody knows what a hundred years of happy meals have done to him . You could end up with yourthroat cut . Maybe . But I know how to hide . I know how to disappear . Do you know how to breathe vacuum ? He doesn 't have to find you . He can shut off the life support everywhere except for Command . Commit , Chiana . You 're with us , or you 're on your own . When my people find out what happened to Salis , they 're going to want to cleanse the lot of you . Yeah . I guess that makes us natural allies . Alright then . What 's your plan ? Why do I always get stuck with the greebols that don 't have any plan ? No , no . I 've got a plan . You 're just not going to like it . Why ? 'Cause I don 't like it . I don 't trust you any more than you trust me . Fair enough . Let 's hear it . Bait . You are very resourceful , young Nebari . Make it work for you . Here 's the news . The ship 's pregnant . We kill the baby , and we can Starburst the draz out of here . New information please . Or you 'll die . You think the baby 's down there ? How bad did they mess with that great military mind of yours , anyway ? Where did you get the directions ? From the ship ? Right . Shoot me . What do you know ? They 've reconfigured data to send you in the wrong direction . A trap . And why should I believe you ? Because we both want the same thing . Hey ! No , no , no . Let ... let me go first . There 's a hatchway through there . It leads straight to the birthing chamber . I don 't like dark rooms . Yeah ? Well , some froth-mouth with a metal eye shut off all the lights . Durka : And how is it you know this room ? I did a lot of crawling through the ship 's ducts . That 's how I ... I stumbled across the baby . Did you , indeed ? No ! It isn 't that easy , Crichton . ( Chiana whimpering ) You okay ? Your stupid plan . In the room. I said to get him in the room ! You said to the room ! - Let me see . - No ! Frellthat . He 's going to kill us all anyway . Go get the ... get the bastard . Can we get control of the door ? I 'm trying . ( yelling ) Dammit ! Zhaan : John ! John ! Hey , Durka ! How far do you think you 're going to get without your propulsion control ? All I need is the Transport 's Phase Cannon . One shot into Moya 's midsection will solve the Starburst problem . Pilot , stand by . We 're going to give Durka the boot . Pilot : He 's cut off the controls ! I can 't open the outer door . Damn it , Pilot , now 's not the time . Get control back . Pilot 's onto it , John . The doors are malfunctioning ! ( motor sputtering ) Those doors won 't stop this weapon . Come on , Durka . Don 't be an idiot . You think Moya 's going to take you out of here after you kill her baby ? His weapons are powering up . Durka : Sorry to have to cut this short . No . Shut the doors ! Pilot : That 's done it ! The outer doors are open . Pilot , shut the door ! - Close the door ! - l 'm trying ! Zhaan : John ! Doors closing ! Hold the door ! Stop the doors ! Pilot , stop the doors ! What ? ! Crichton ! Open the hangar ! Now at once ! Or I 'll blast my way back in ! Crichton ! Hold the door ! I can 't stop them ! ( both yelling ) I 'm in ! Durka : Crichton ! Don 't you leave me out here . I 'll hunt you down and I 'll kill you ! Get in line , Durka . Besides , I don 't think the Nebari are going to let you do a lot of hunting . Crichton ! Listen to me ! Give them my regards when they pick you up . Durka : Crichton ! Crichton ! Ifthey pick you up . Either way , I don 't really care . is Moya still mad at me for throwing that bomb ? Moya understands . Crichton threw a bomb , too . But the one he threw stimulated her to expel Durka 's transport . I didn 't know she could do that . Did you know she could do that ? Moya didn 't even know she could do it . Oh . Pilot says she 's still in a lot of pain from the damage she caused protecting her child . Mmm . Ah ! You can have that back now . Sure now that I don 't need it . You know , I never thought I 'd say this to a Hynerian , much less to you ... Stop there . Ha ha ha . Don 't you dare thank me for saving your life . I wasn 't going to . You weren 't ? Why not ? Because amidst all that unfinished business between you and Durka , I don 't think you even knew I was there . Oh . But you handled yourself well . Hmm. I did , didn 't I ? Beat him at his own game . You just compared yourself to a Peacekeeper . Zhaan : Look , I have to find the pain before I can remove it . Hold still . - Stop it ! - Shh ! How 's the patient ? She 's a brat . You want we should kick her off the boat ? ( sighing ) : Ask me tomorrow . So , do I get to stay ? Moya 's gathering her strength for a Starburst . That should put enough distance between us and your people . Thanks . What 's the matter ? We have rules . Yeah ? Well , when I see any of you following them , so will I . I 'm easy . I owe you . The others will not be so forgiving . Well , just drop me off at the next planet where there 's something worth stealing . This isn 't a prison transport anymore , Chiana . You can get off whenever you want . One question . Where were you when Salis was murdered ?

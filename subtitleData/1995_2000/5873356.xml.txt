 [ loud whooshing ] Here we go . Thank you . Thank you . Another perfect landing . Primo idea , wearing the goggles , Wy . Now I just got to worry about keeping the bugs out of my teeth . You sure you don 't want to try your pair ? It 's killer . Three quick pumps on Lisa 's helium hi-tops and I 'm kissing sky . Gary . - You were spotted . - Again . When Lisa zapped up those flying shoes you promised to keep a low profile . Hey , I have been . I 'm a stealth bomber . So you don 't know anything about this UFO that mooned a British airways flight ? You try keeping your pant up at mach two . So I had little fun . Big Whoops . What can happen ? - I 'm Special Agent Scolder . - I 'm Special Agent Molly . - FBI . - We 're here to Investigate the UFO . - Any luck ? - Not much . Just keep repeating " A glowing swizzle stick tried to gut me . " - Doesn 't make any sense . - Why does everything have to make sense ? Can science explain why aliens abducted my Jack Russell Terrier ? Can science explain the Mutant Worm Boy of Tacoma ? The Scandinavian Leech Beavers ? The vampires who crashed my bar mitzvah ? A swizzle stick form the sky ? Makes all the sense in the world , Molly . Trying to hurt my feelings ? Gary 's been enjoying his sneakers and you haven 't tried yours on . I got this thing about heights . My ears pop on a step stool . Come on . What have you got to lose ? My lunch . Don 't you think Gary 's going too public with this flying gig ? So someone saw him . It 's not like anyone 's closing in on our airline . The Java Man coffeehouse , originally opened in 1968 as Dr. Rainbow 's cosmic muffin hut . Closed down by local authorities shortly afterwards . How come ? Controversial brownie recipe ? No . A series of health code violations . Molly , I was make a joke . Oh . We should have a signal for that . Mmm . Really , Scolder , do you expect to find your purported extraterrestrial visitor in a coffeehouse ? After traveling 180,000 light years wouldn 't you need a little perk-me-up ? Did you catch that one ? Yes , I did . But I just didn 't find it particularly funny . Fair enough . I say we sit here , order a couple of frapachinos and keep our eyes open for anything unusual . Thank you very much , loser . - Are you cheating ? - Excuse me ? Sorry . It 's just ... Ladies and gentlemen we 'd like to remind you that abroad this flight there are no rules , no seat belts and no peanuts . Thanks for flying air Gary . [ screaming ] Bad turbulence . Bad turbulence . Mayday . Mayday ! [ Screaming ] I 'm on my way . There 's been another UFO sighting . Something apparently crashed to Earth . They need me at the Coroner 's office . You go ahead . I 'll be fine here . Extensive tissue damage suggests the subject crashed from a height of approximately 12,000 feet . Internal contents show the last meal to consist of white bread , bologna , mustard , and what appears to be cheese possibly cheddar . Said contents indicate a juvenile appetite . Bite radius concurs . In conclusion evidence begs the question- - Who or what dropped a bologna sandwich from 12,000 feet ? On a stakeout , huh ? No black and white , no cherries on top . - You 're a G-Man , aren 't you ? - You 're obstructing a federal investigation . I knew it . FBI . A real live FIB-EE . Hot chow . Hey , how many guys have you , you know ... taken out ? Only one . But we went dutch . - That 's a joke . - [ laughs ] Anyway , I 've dreamed all my life of being a fed . I 've applied like 400 times . Chet Donnelly . - Sound familar ? - Donnelly ? So you live at that residence ? Yeah . Well , it 's only temporary . How 'd you like to give us a hand in this investigation ... Chet ? Would I ? Oh , yes ! Wyatt , your brother 's outside talking to the FBI . What ? - Are you sure it 's the FBI ? - I 've seen him at the Java Man . We 're under surveillance . Okay . Don 't panic . We 'll be all right as long as Gary stays out of sight . [ loud whooshing ] Whew . You wouldn 't believe the turbulence up there . Nasty . I came this close to a 12,000 foot belly flop . Got anything in the fridge ? I lost my sandwich during re-entry . Forget your sandwich . I think the FBI has got you staked out . She 's not kidding , Gary . There 's some guy across the street . Leave it to me . [ knocking ] Housekeeping . Got to clean your room . You look familiar . Have we met ? Wait by the ice machine while I scrub your tub . Strange . You clean these rooms and yet you forget there 's no bathtub in this unit . And if I didn 't know better I 'd say you were the mystery woman - from the Donnelly Residence . - Maybe . I 've seen things that I can 't explain- - UFO 's , time manipulation and now ... Here you are . You seem to be in the middle of it . I just want answers . That 's exactly what I want from you . Mr. Smarty-Pants . " At this point in the investigation , I believe the UFO may be linked to an extraterrestrial organism of superior intelligence ... " This is rich . We have nothing to worry about . I can take a hint . You don 't want to be bothered . I 'll have the morning girl come in . - You just got here . - Watch it or your tub will overflow . [ water running ] The only thing extraordinary is the size of the bath ring . That tube was a shower before she came . Your mystery woman really knows her grout . In 1959 , three Soviet Georgian Yak Herders inexplicably burst into flame . In 1962 , a glowing cloud of Wood Mites destroyed all the Nylon in a Northwestern fishing village . in 1974 , a man the size of a walnut was captured and interrogated by South American freedom fighters . What does this have to do with the UFO sightings ? Damn . I had it a second ago . I hate it when that happens . Could it be your mind is preoccupied with the beauitful , mysterious grout woman ? I must confess there is something about her ... [ knocking ] It 's our star witness who I 'm hoping can fill us in on grout girl and our UFO . [ panting ] I 'm sorry I 'm late . Mom made me take out the garbage . Wow . Cool room . You guys live the life . Chet , I 'd like you to meet Special Agent Molly . Mr. Donnelly . Ma 'am . Mr. Donnelly . Chet , we need to ask you some questions . Have you ever been hypnotized ? - Do you think he 's under ? - I think he 's comatose . Understand . We have to delicately peel away the subconscious layer by layer before drawing any repressed memories . Chet . Do you hear my ... ? Mommy , why can 't I play with the dollies ? Can I have another fizzle ? I don 't want to go . Kindergarten 's full of bullies and scary girls . Um , let 's jump ahead to the present . Okay , Chet ? Have you ever encountered a caucasian female , 5 ' 9 " , 120 pounds , brunette , full pouting lips with eyes you could fall into and never hit bottom ? We think that this individual may possess certain ... paranormal abilities . Do you know such a woman ? My head ... electricity . [ screams ] My skull 's flattening ! My eyes rolling off the top of my head ! Whoa . Where 'd Wyatt snag a set of curves like her ? What 's she doing now ? My head , it 's expanding like a balloon ! No , wait ! It 's ... it 's getting smaller . No bigger than a can of spackle . In the sky ! What 's that ... flying man ? ! Can ... spam ... clam ... yam . I am what I am . I am a yam ! Banzai ! Direct hit . Yes . Enemies damp . City locked in fear . Mission accomplished . Time to head home . You heard him . He identified a " flying man . " That 's got to be our UFO we 've finally got a lead . What we have is a seriously disturbed ex-marine . A flattened head ? Delusions like that are way beyond paranoid-schizophrenia . [ loud whooshing sound ] FBI . You 're under arrest . It 's intuitive grasp of our language is amazing . He 's nothing more than a high school student seeking attention by climbing onto his roof . Come on , Molly . Look at that hair . That face . Clever simlulation but no human looks like that . What does he look like on the inside , I wonder ? Thank you for securing him but our visitor is in my hands now . He 'll be transferred to Bethesda where the surgeons will cut him open . Split his brain . Poke around . See how it is he- - or it- - can fly . Nobody 's poking around my brain ! I want to talk to my lawyer ! I want to talk to my congressman ! I want to talk to Connie Chung ! This is great . Gary 's missing and you 're just standing there . He could be anywhere . Aren 't you worried ? No . I implanted a homing beacon in his skull while he was napping . See ? That show us where Gary is . So what 's that one ? That 's the one in your skull . - Oh , no ! - What ? ! What ? ! What ? ! The FBI 's captured Gary and they 're going to dissect him . Oh , God . What are we going to do ? Don 't tell me- - - You 're here to mop the bunker . - Sorry . No time for snappy repartee . You should be frozen . When you came to my room I synchronized these watches . I put one in my pocket the other in the bedside table . After you left there was a seven minute discrepancy between them . Well , what 's a little time-warping between friends ? Your tricks won 't work as long as that functions . It 's a de-ionization field dampener . I figured your powers were electric . It eradicates charged ionic particles effectively neutralizing your powers . How did you know ? After you left my socks were inexplicably clingy . Lisa ? Get me out of here ! I don 't want anything to happen to him . I just want to know your connection to this . Her connection ? That will be determined once we 've dissected her as well , Agent Scolder . And so ends another perfect day with Lisa , the K-Mart genie . Bite me , Wallace . I guess it 's up to Wyatt to save us now . And now batting clean-up for the Philadelphia Phillies is Wyatt . [ imitating an echo ] Wyatt ! Oh , man ! They got Lisa too ? This is great ! This is just great ! Hang on , guys . The cavalry is on the way ... unless the cavalry get sucked into a jet engine . Look , Agent Scolder . You 've got to let Gary go . He 's not an alien . He 's just a boy . Nothing special- - complete zero . Two skinny legs some freaky hair a face you could grease a skillet with . I think he gets the idea . Why does he have a homing beacon in his skull ? I 'll explain it later . I 'd like to help you . The trouble is I know you can fly . I just don 't know how . I know you 're capable of time manipulation and probably much more . I just can 't prove it ... but I will . Believe me , I will . [ screaming ] Scolder ... we got a report from Norad . - A second UFO is heading this way . - Wyatt ? - Friend of yours ? - Not so long . A second UFO can only foreshadow a potential invasion . The commitee has ordered a preemptive strike . As I speak , the trident laser-guided missile has been launched to bring it down . We 've got to do something fast . You 're right . You wanted to truth , Agent Scolder ? The truth isn 't out there- - it 's here . - Right in front of you . - Go on . I 'm not ... human . [ gasps ] [ growls ] Go ahead . Put on the shoes . Flying 's fun . [ growls ] So that 's how Gary and Wyatt created me . I can 't explain the physics , but here I am every bit as magical as you suspected . You don 't actually believe this , do you ? I know you believe us if you don 't unplug your de-ionizer and give me back my powers Wyatt 's going to be spread over the southwest like a handful of mulch . Please . I 'm the only one who can save him . But if I let you go ... my proof is gone as well . Scolder , that 's federal prisoner . You can 't let her go . - I 'm running out of time . - I 've been waiting my whole life for someone like you- - evidence that the paranormal does exist . Please . Thank you . Of course , you realize I have to erase your memory . What a shame . Nothing to remember you by . Except this . I 'm going to hate not being able to remember that . What did you do to him ? Erased his memory like I 'm about to do to you . Ooh ! Lis , give me a sec . Okay . She 's all your 's . My lips are tingly . So are mine . Whoa ! Lisa ! Thank God . - Now get us out of here ! - Wait ! We have to disarm thre missile . Oh , man ! Which wire do we cut ? In the movies , the live wire is always the red one . But sometimes the red wire 's a decoy for the bomb squad . - So , not the red one ? - You asking me or telling me ? - Huh ? - What ? - Speak up ! - What ? Excuse me . [ yells ] You guys watch too many movies . The case of the flying boy was never solved . Though Agent Molly Chalks it all up to mass hysteria I still feel there was something bigger behind it and though my work 's too often an intangible fabric of ether stitched together with cobwebs , void of any certainties I know the truth is out there- - somewhere . ALL : Yee-ha ! Yippee ! Whoo ! Captioned by Grant Brown

They come two in a pack . - Yeah . Would you sell this for , twenty dollars ? Thank you . Um , this is fascinating . Cake with frosting injected inside . Technically , it is filling . Whatever is , it 's tasty . I am Jarod . - Dan Healy . - Hi , Dan . Is that your family ? My wife , Susan . My son , Todd . Just made all conference thrid straight year . You must be very proud . In my whole life . How about you ? Any family photos ? Oh , yes . This is my mother . This is my brother . And this , belong to my father . Distinguish flying cross . He gave it to my brother , and my brother passed it on to me . Flying this for a father ! Are you close ? I was separated from my family when I was a boy . I am searching for them . I hope you find them , Jarod . Thank you . That 's the express , it doesn 't stop here . Just remember , there is nothing more important than family . No ! No . Stay with me , stay with me ! Somebody call an ambulance ! I let them down , Jarod , I let them all down . No , no , no ! There are pretends among us . Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be .

You should have been a paramedic . He is still unconscious , but he is stable . His family . They seem like good people . Why the hell the guy did this ? I don 't know . Is suicide the answer ? I set myself on fire because I am convinced it 'll send a message , Sydney . It 'll stop the war . We understand that . But what are you feeling ? Stay with the simulation , Jarod . But he had people who loved him . How can he do that to them ? That 's not significant to the simulation . Family is important to anyone , Sydney . What he is doing won 't stop the war . It 'll just destroy the family . Why would someone want to do this ? Jarod , suicide is not just an action . It 's a cry for help . I hope that I can . Questions remained about the deadly spill inside ECS ( Environmental Containment Systems ) , a private firm specialized in hazardous materials clean up . We obtained exclusive fire department for it , taking immediately after a container of deadly MZT foam ruptured during routine storage . Three ECS workers were killed when the concentrated pesticide burned to their lung and paralyzed their nerve system . ECS spokeperson Curt Wilkes . ECS is engaged in a full and thorough investigation of this tragedy . Our hearts go out to the family of those employees ' ... . We called up the ECS engineer Dan Healy . Not now .

" ECS Accident Kills Three " " Larry Meyers " Dear Susan and Todd , I have failed you as a husband and a father , just as I failed my friends and co-workers . I am sorry for the nightmare I made in your lives , You deserve better . Love , Dan . Welcome to ECS , Jarod . I read my orientation pack that the company ... seventy-five million dollar profit last year . Yeah , and that Taiwan is a tanker we just pump three Belgian crew . Their shipping line is one of our biggest clients . This is very interesting . You process the waste with this system . What comes out is highly concentrated . And highly deadly . We secure the waste , we seal them in these level A containers and then we ship them off to some salt mine in Nevada , where they won 't give anybody any trouble for a while . High grade polyethylene container . Does it last about twenty thousand years ? Yeah , Dick Clark will be ... open it . Funny , Strickland . Do you have any recommendations how we seal this ... ? It is highly combustible and highly toxic . Since it 's the level A container , I would suggest the double polymer neoprene and graphite seal . That 's right box , wrong ribbon . We 're going back to black end because a part of the seal with red one was Dan Healy 's design . It 's no longer for use . Because of the MZT accident . Yeah . Wear this . As remembered . And remindering . Good morning , Miss Parker . - Broots . - Sydney . - You are looking ¡ ­ refreshed . New underpants will do that to you . Sydney , you made it funny . Startling , I 'm afraid . Last night I went on a date . You had a date ! That 's when two people actually meet instead of typing to each other on the computer keyboard . So if it was a date , how can you be sure that those are your underpants ? Bernice and I went to this amusing little place , the Chocolate . You , you went a comedy club ? New experiences keep my psychiatric skills ... - Not to mention that ... - Exactly ! How many psychiatrists does it take to change one light-bulb ? Oh , Wait ... Oh ... Go ahead and tell us , ah , wait ... Wait , don 't tell us . Sydney , you are supposed to set the punch line ... now . Sydney ? I have the transfer report for you , Gibbs . Forty-seven containers , almost a record . Check this out . Um , You are a funny guy , Strickland . Got you ! Have a little respect , will you ? People died here a few weeks ago . Easy , Hunsacker . They were my friends too . Larry taught me that gig . He would thought that it was fine . You eat that stuff ? They are very good . Food of the Gods . Dupont , right ? Yes , it is me . M.l.T. , Exxon Valdez , Kowet . It takes a long time to build that kind of resume . Actually , I typed it in four minutes . That 's funny ! I 'm Curt wilkes , media relations . Nice to meet you . I just came down here to make clear no ECS 's employee under any circumstances in the discuss of the MZT accident with the press . That 'll make it a mean of Dan Healy 's suicide attemp . I wonder how that happened ? Dan will have to say , when , if he regains his consciousness . Don 't give the status ... Got it ? Oh he doesn 't want Dan here already . He is a conductor . This is not good . I want you to sweap the Center for Sydney , every corner and every room on every sublevel . If he walked out , I want the sign-out sheet . And Sam , be luky . Yes , Miss Parker . This is , this is really quat . It 's the Center , Broots . People have the tendency to vanish . Like Mr. Lyle . - Have you ever seen he was like this before ? - once . Really ? Over what ? It was personal . I hope he is okay . Do you think , do you think he is okay ? You tell me ! Help , help ! Larry ! Help me ! You saw them dying , didn 't you ? It 's like nothing I 've ever seen . They were hasting the container up on the truck . First one just blew . No one was wearing the protective gear . For Hunsaker , said it 'll deal out clear . But the MZT took about twenty seconds to turn their insides into ... I heard the alarm , and I arrived there with Strickland but the time we got in there they have already eaten through them . Never have a chance . You know Dan was so careful . He worked on this for three years , tested and retested this . Not against the MZT . It doesn 't make any sense . Is that what you defend him from Wilkes ? Oh that snake only cares about corporate image . You know Dan was debilitated . He shouldn 't go down for doing his job . - He needs to see you . - Mum , I can 't . Todd , Todd , please . No , I am not going in there . Excuse me . I fixed it for him . You were at the bus bench . You helped Dan . I didn 't get the chance to thank you . I am Jarod . - Susan . - Hi , Susan . How is he doing ? The doctors won 't know for a while . He may never ... Is that your son ? Todd , right ? Yeah , Todd . Dan talked about him . He doesn 't want to see his father . I don 't know why I 'm bothering you with our problems . Sometime it 's nice to talk to someone who is not a reporter . Everyday these vultures ' asking did his father kill those people . I think he started to believe it . It is a very bad idea . Mr. Raines finds out we get Angelo to help , he is going to ask questions . Uncle Fester will never know the truth 's missing . How long do you think it 's going to take to feel what Sydney was feeling ? That answered your question ? Jarod drew this . Who is he ? Le Morte . Who is Le Morte ? The one who brings death . This is the ECS twenty-four pulling out now in the accident site eazing a tanker pouring indicator telling me it got a full load of triptochloronol . - Jes , look at all the fumes ! - It got some of magicore leak to attempt onsite depressurization . Anyone call the paramedic ? ... a tank in the case of three thousand and rising fast . This suckers is going to blow if we don 't pump fast . Update me . It 's already up to four thousand .

He wrote up 253 eye-glass prescriptions last year and gives out little lemon lollipops . Sydney fled to reflirt the barber ? Well , just before this was taken , he was on this elevator . The tower elevator . So he is a probably a client . Let me see Jarod 's sketching again . It 's gone . - Hi , Todd . - No comment . I am not a reporter . Then what do you want ? I came here to tell you that I think father is innocent . I guess that is why he jumped in front of a bus . Now get out of my face . I was with him on the bench . You 're the guy who saved his life ? I wish I could move faster . Father didn 't care about his life for ours . Who ask you to ? Nothing . Nineteen bottles of beer on the wall , nineteen bottles of beer . If one of the bottles happen to fall , um ... .. What 's in that ? MZT . Are you crazy ? Relax . Dan sealed this holding . It is ? Yes . And it has been for the last five hours . The accident wasn 't Dan 's fault . He didn 't kill Larry Meyers . If he didn 't , who did ? Eighteen bottles beer on the wall , eighteen bottles of beer , um ... . You have a new mail . Is this the man ? No , no , no . The eyes are brown . Watch yourself on the mind that police get to draw this . Think . But it will help if I know who he was . Is he your father ? No . Here , of the middle of the right eyebrow , were spot , an imperfection . Yes . That 's it . But his eyes , Sydney . Are you crying ? Of course not . Did that man hurt you ? Sydney is in trouble , isn 't he ? How is it that you know everything that 's happening in this place ? Intuition . We saw your little drawing of Martin Zeller . Who is he ? I don 't know exactly . But I remember how sydney was feeling when I ran that simulation . Who is he ? Sydney wants to tell you , he will . Just to find out where the Center traveller offices put Zeller up . Sydney will be there . How do I know this is not one of your boom ... , Jarod ? If you care about Sydney at all , go alone . No sweapers , no cleaners . I just hope you get there in time . In time for what ? To stop him . Stop . You should be here twenty minutes ago . You are late . You are right . I am very late . You don 't remember me . There are so many of us you can 't remember the names . I don 't know what you are talking about . You are a mad man . You should hear every name . But your time has run out . At my age , time means nothing . I believe this does . Do it , if you will . Frankly , I am tired of hiding . No . It is too easy . You 're willing to hear me out ? Yes ? And then ? Then ¡ ­ I will kill you . Who won the fight ? Go to hell ! Guess you are defending him , your father that you said you don 't care about . Won conference three years in a row . He 's proud of you . He told me . When ? Just before he tried to kill himself ? All of he was thinking about was you and your mother . He thought by killing himself he could stop the questions and that he could ease the pressure on both of you . I am not saying it 's right . But it 's just what he was feeling . An insect made out of medal and wire . Fishing lure . Like bait . Yeah . Dad makes this as a hobby . This is my lucky one . Got me a bite every time we went for a trial . I saw a picture of you and your father fishing . It looks like fun . You know when fishing with your dad ? I wasn 't lucky enough to know my father . You know yours . Take advantage of it . What is it ? The night before ¡ ­ before he was on that bench with you , we got a really bad fight and I said some stupid stuff . I told him that the accident was his fault , I told him ...

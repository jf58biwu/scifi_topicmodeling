 Would you look at the size of that thing ? Every sweep confirms ... That is a dead ship . - And you 're sure it isn 't Crais 's ? - Positive . What is another Peacekeeper ship doing in the Unchartered Territories ? Don 't know . Something 's wrong . Yeah , no kidding , like shouldn 't we be doing warp a thousand by now ? Think how big the winner with this battle must be . I 'm with John ! I say we leave this tomb immediately ! And I say that there is information on her data spools that could lead us home . There may be weapons on board we can use ... . and I need to know who she is . What ? Who cares what her name is ? It 's the Zelbinion . So what is it with the Zelbinion ? It is the most feared ship in the Peacekeeper armada . Yeah , well clearly someone didn 't get that message . She 's been missing in battles for over one hundred cycles . Aeryn , confirmingt that there is breathable air beyond the connection hatch . Pilot cautions you remain starboard and high . Most of the vacuum damage was sustained in attack from below . ' - Is this a good idea ? - You can stay behind if you wish ... but I have questions ... Ready ? I can 't believe you lived on a ship like this , your whole life . When you told me endless tales of your home , d you spoke of forests and rivers , valleys ... Well I was thinking of walls , not unlike these . Well , I 'm sure it looks better with carpeting . This ship is legendary , even in my culture . It was thought invincible .. Yeah , well just ask Leonardo Di Caprio . C Even the big ones go down . Deep space desiccation . I expected you to go looting , Rygel . I am Dominar of over six hundred billion subjects . I shouldn 't stoop so low . If I recall , you stooped for the last three derelict ships we came upon . Or was it four ? Is something bothering you ? When I was ripped from my throne over a hundred and thirty cycles ago , this was the first vessel I was tortured on. é It 's no better in here . It 's such a large ship and nothing to salvage. é How disappointing that other scavengers have robbed us of our glory . This navigation console has been completely destroyed . There are no galactic star charts here . This excursion is over . Wait ... What about this console ? The lights are still on .. Someone has regenerated communications . Recently ? Or do you guys have like the best car batteries of all time ? Aeryn ! I 'm blocked ! - Mine ! - No ! No ! N Officer Sun ? The escaped prisoners . How does she know us ? Aeryn ? Because she is from Crais 's ship . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , à a living ship , full of strange alien life forms . Help me ! Listen , please ! Is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander . who can do everything . I can 't . J I 'm just looking for a way home . You will remain in Review Stance until I dismiss . Understood ? Name ... Division ... Assignment ? - Gilina Renaez . - Speak up ! Tranco Support . Maintenance Provost . Chin up ! Eyes locked ! Why don 't you give it a rest , Miss Drill Sergeant ? Can 't you see she 's going to pass out ? - I 'm not like her . - Not remotely ! She is a Tech ! Not a soldier , right ? No weapons ? So why not lighten up ? More flies with honey , that kind of thing . You clearly do not understand , she is from Crais 's ship . , That means he is nearby . She knows exactly who we are and would consider it her duty to lie to us . Point taken ... but if she drops , you 're not going to get your answers . This is my world John , don 't interfere ! Still alive ? How is that possible ? She can 't be from the original crew . I don 't have those answers ... I suggest you go over and ask them yourself . To that ship ? Never ! Never again ! How long have we known each other , Rygel ? Long enough for me to see your blue backside meditating , but not long enough for you to touch me . Confront your demons , Rygel ... or they will chase you from the shadows to the pyre . Captain Crais didn 't want to delay his search for you , so after coming upon the Zelbinion , i he ordered my unit over for a full tech survey . What happened to the rest of your unit ? Two solar days after arriving ... another ship came out of nowhere ... . I 'd never seen such a weapon before ... . I barely had time to escape before they incinerated our Marauder Transport . It 's the Sheyangs ... There 's evidence of their work all over the ship .. - Could they have done all this ? - Hardly ! The Sheyang are nothing more than opportunistic foragers . Can you tell me what happened here ? How the Zelbinion died ? - Long before we arrived ... other scavengers pried loose the data spools ... There is no record . Officer Sun , I think you should know ... I consider you a traitor ... and therefore worthy of the punishment it merits . but as a Sebacean ... I believe you are deserving as I ... to know the truth about a cultural treasure ... I am not lying when I say ... I do not know . I will investigate the radiant chamber , I 'll meet you at the next junction . We 'll wait for you , D 'argo . I can 't believe you 're not Sebacean . Human ... It 's kinda like Sebacean , but we haven 't conquered other worlds yet , s so we just kick the crap out of each other . Thank you for stopping her from killing me today . I try to save a life a day ... Usually it 's my own . Oh man ! - if you guys only used your knowhow to ... - To what ? To fulfil your vision of who we should be ? To do good . We are Peacekeepers other cultures hire us to keep order , to keep harmony . As well as assassinations , s torture , kidnap . Knock it off , weasel . I 've barely got used to sharing my accommodation with one of these abominations . Dispel the thought of two . Hello , Rygel .. Welcome home . Everything I see confirms her story . There aren 't even any wire columns left in the weapons control room. ô This vessel has been gutted to worthlessness . Oh no ! He 's from my unit . I knew him . Sheyang victim . Burnt to death . Officer Kranda . Kranda ? What was he doing guarding the likes of you ? This is grot work . Your whole unit was demoted after your defection . They can only be reinstated upon your death . Come on ... Let 's get outta here . Excuse me , Zhaan .. Could you check Scan Vector Gappa and tell me what you see ? I 'm ... I 'm not sure ... I ... think it 's a ship , trying just to just out of sensor range . A ... Sheyang ship ? Why are the Sheyangs back ? What didn 't you tell us ? If this one doesn 't co-operate , kill her ! Is that why you 're still alive ? Because you co-operated with the enemy ? - I am not the traitor . You are ! - Tell me ! - Stop it ! That is enough ! She knew they were coming back . She knew . That 's enough ! She 's not a traitor ... Not by a long shot , Crais never gave her a chance .. Not like the chance we 're giving you . I hid , while the Sheyangs filled their ship to capacity . They said they were going to come back for the D.S. Is that Defence Shield ? It 's not operationals but it 's the least damaged part of the ship . Let 's go ! Move ! Go ! - Situation ? - Their plasma conductor is targeted on us . Let 's signal our intent to leave , and depart without incident . Impossible with the Sheyang ... If they sense strength , they flee ... Weakness , and they attack without mercy . Then we get the others aboard , we decouple and then attempt to Starburst . They have the ability to destroy us before we even get ten metras . We have no offensive capabilities , e nothing to signal strength . I know . No , this panel is useless ... but if we could bridge the connections from this side to the other , we could make the defence screen operational . Do it ! Officer Sun , I know you 're not a Tech , but ... Just tell me . It all depends on the power reserves ... - It ... it 's going to take eight arns , minimum . - Eight arns ? No , no , no , I know what she 's talking about . It 's a progressive power draw , so the fibre pattern has to be maintained in sequence . That takes time , right ? Yes . Eight arns ? The Sheyangs could fire at any moment . This new ship makes no move to defend itself . When was the last time you saw a Leviathan in the territories , Teurac ? Even you , at your age have never claimed such a prize . It is a fortunate time . Ripe ! Defenceless ! Mine ! Evran ! Prepare to attack ! The Sheyang have initiated their weapons countdown . - They 're going to need some help . - It 's too late . If Moya becomes severely damaged , we may need to retreat to the Zelbinion . D 'Argo ? Zhaan ? Moya and I are very afraid of fire . What I wouldn 't give for just one Kkore Cannon . One Wettox missile . I spit on your grave , you sons of cowards ! . I rip out your throat I ... Pilot , transmit his image to the Sheyang vessel . - But what would ... - Do it ! - Transmitting . A Luxan ? We 're fighting a Luxan ! Terminate plasma ! Terminate plasma attack ! Cut transmission ! I don 't believe it ! They 're powering down their weapons .. Congratulations , D 'Argo ! You 've just bought us some time . Right , no lies ! Does this ship have any weapons aboard that are still active ? Anything we can use to fight back ? No , everything has been dismantled or destroyed . What about this thing ? The defence screen ? - What will this do ? - What do you think ? - No , the question is , will it stop a Sheyang attack ? Well be that as it may we can 't stall them for eight arns . Four ... . Four , I 'll , um ... I 'll do half the work . What ? Is there some kind of union thing I don 't know about ? No , it 's just this wiring is very ... sophisticated . Yep , and I love opera ! Beautiful ! I cannot lie to an opponent in battle . It 's not lying , simply mislead them . For a priest you certainly have a very flexible morality . Well I apologize. é It must be done and you must do it ! I will assist you if we live . Is something the matter ? This isn 't going to work . The main fusion panel is charred .. Gilina , you told Aeryn that you could do this . I didn 't want to be executed for failing to try. é Look , I told you , we are not killers . You killed Captain Crais 's brother . That was an accident ... Our ships collided , it could easily have gone the other way . Can I get you both some rations ? Some chilled frotein perhaps ? We 're out of fibre lined conduit , Officer Sun . - Those are the wrong kind . - I 've searched throughout the ship ! Have you tried Medical Rejuvenation on the Seventh Tier below the ... I know where it is ! That door 's jammed ! ô We possess the salvage rights to that vessel you are docked with . And yet you will not produce the Authority Manifest to confirm that . Must we distrust each other ? Once my soldiers are back on board , you may continue your salvage . End this charade , Teurac ! He has no soldiers . ' He doesn 't even have a crew . My young protege does not think you can back up your claims . He thinks we can invade and destroy you . Curious , I was just thinking the same thing about you . Your quaint cockpit seems to belie any military boasts . Your crummy cockpit seems to belie any military boasts . Pray that you should never know ... and Ka D 'Argo ... A make no mistake ... you are trying my patience . - Well done ! - Barely ! You must stop with this incessant prompting . You asked for my help , D 'Argo . You foisted it upon me , and now that moment is past . How much time do we have , Pilot ? If we are to believe the Peacekeeper Tech , e two more arns . Three conversations without substance I believe is enough . The next one will spur an attack .. It 's always red wire or blue wire . Red wire or blue wire . And at the last possible second , ... he cuts the wrong wire . And the bomb never goes off ? No , no , he cuts the wrong wire , that 's the whole point . 15 seconds later they 're running out of the building and everything blows all to hell . And you call this entertainment ? Yeah , well , you know , it replaced cock fighting . Oh , my eye ! Let me see . Let me see . Oh , come here . Let me see . Oh , I 'm sorry ! Let me see ... It 's okay . Yeah ? Yeah ? You know what else happens in these movies is that ... . the guy and girl always end up surviving ... liking each other . We have such fiction also . It 's a small universe . Come now ! We 've just begun ! Oh , there you are , we 've been looking all over for you , Rygel . You 're making the DRDs nervous . We need your negotiating talents . I think I was meant to die here the first time . That 's why the spirits have brought me back to the Zelbinion .. I don 't think so , for one thing , the captain of that ship is dead . - Not to me ! - Then you must confront him . - How ? - Find his corpse , it will set you free . I have never known a full Luxan warrior ... to be on a ship without defence and offense ... My intention ... . is not to lead us into a hidden threat . What is your intention ? Evran ! Ignite the plasma generators . Aim for the Leviathan ! Destroy her ! What do you mean they 're firing ? What did you say to them ? Nothing , they will not respond to my signal . - How close are we ? - Close ! B Just connect all the black wires ! The black ones ! Here ! - How much time , Pilot ? - Less than 50 microts . - Officer Sun ? - Yes ? - Pass me up those connections - Yes . Come on , come on , come on , come on . Thirty five . That 's it . Thirty . Full charge , Evran ! No mistakes ! Twenty . - Quick . - Okay . Okay . Come on baby , baby , baby . - Got it ? - Yes . Ten . One more , okay ? , Five . Hurry ! - Got it ! Got it ! The defence screen 's held , Moya 's unharmed . Evran ! Our weapon had no effect .. Recharge immediately ! Hit them again ! Listen to me , Lomus . I am greatly disappointed in you ... Somehow I expected ... é the Dominar of Hyneria to be more ... dominating . I regret to dampen spirits , D 'Argo , Pilot reports a problem . My scans show the defence screen is not fully complete ... There are gaps which leave us vulnerable . The D.S. is two identical systems overlaid on top of one another . We only had time to hook up one . Whoa , whoa , wait a minute ... How crazy is this ? Now there 's two systems , right ? Yeah . So why don 't be install one of them on Moya ? I have been sworn never to compromise Peacekeeper technology with the enemy . I will do it for you ... For all of you . To displace an Overlord during battle and then fail ? But it 's not my fault ... What about my father ? Your oath ? Frax your father ! This is on you ... Choose . I will lead my unit and capture that shipe with no prisoners taken . Those gaps in the protective barrier you must fly throughr are small and shifting . Do you leave me a choice ? Perhaps one day ... . they will sing songs of your early death . So you like deep space physics , too ? Yeah ... You know cosmic theory ? Yeah , it 's something that intrigues me . I got my doctorate in it . - A doctorate ? ... What is that ? It 's ... a couple of letters they add to the end of your name . Not much help out here , though . Last textbook I read made a case for why you and ... all other forms of alien life didn 't exist . Can you , um ... can you anchor this while I pull ? Yeah . - Hold that ... Got it ? - Yeah , go . It seems Human and Sebacean men are ... , much the same . Yeah , I 've not noticed any differences in the women , either . I 've set up four of the components ... . ... in the Maintenance Bay . Sorry for interrupting ! Aeryn ! Aeryn ! Aeryn would you wait ! What the heck 's the matter with you ? Oh , I 'm sure you could see how heavy these things are , rhere 's at least another ten in there . Do not come down this corridor without one . Would you stop ! ê Hey ! Look , hey , what happened back there was ... - None of my business ! - Yes , it was ! You and I are shipmates . What I 'm trying to say is ... haven 't you just clicked with a guy ? - What , clicked ? - Yeah , you know , found a guy attractive . Yes , but it ... I didn 't let it ... In the beginning , I found you ... interesting . Me ? Yes , but only for a moment . Good ... That 's ... good . I mean , it 's good to be on even terms . I agree . It 's always a good idea to clear the air . Very clear air ! Durka ! Is it really you , Durka ? You killed yourself Durka , you coward . You once told me I would never leave your ship alive ... You robbed me of so many cycles ... But no matter what you did to me ... I 'll always remember one thing ... You lose ! I have full separation from the main module . Launch the others ! - How many are there ? - Ah , at least a dozen ... They 're moving too fast to track them all . Pilot , can they get aboard the Zelbinion ? Can they breach the defence screen ? When I kill the bypass , a these two polaric discs will be attracted to each other , strongly , so you have to hold them apart , s because if they touch each other , this whole room will be vapourised . Alright scoundrel foragers . It 's time to prove our glory . Have any of them made it through ? I can 't tell yet , I 'll have to do a debris analysis . Quickly ! Aim for the gaps in the defence screen ! I 'll do it myself ! They 're going to pull incredibly hard . Okay ! Ready ? Now ! - Aeryn , where are you ? - Maintenance bay ! What 's the problem ? We think one of the Sheyangs got on board the Zelbinion . How in the hell did that happen ? Not important ! What is , is he may be heading right toward you . - You 've got to stop . - Not once I 've started the process .. Then finish the process . - I 'm working as fast as I can ! - I want you to get out of here ! I won 't leave you ! On the ground now ! Do it ! Gilina , I want you out of here . You die here , John , I die too . He keeps blocking my route , forcing me to take the long way round ! You may have to defend yourself ! Look , Aeryn , it 's a long story , but I 've kind of got my hands full here , s so you 're going to have to get here ! You 'd better get here fast , because Froggy 's outside the door right now . Aeryn 's gonna get here . Come on , Aeryn ! Come on ! They spit fire ? How come nobody tells me they spit fire ? Aeryn ! Come on , Aeryn . Come on . Ssshhit ... Hi there , big guy ... Look ... . as you can see it 's not likely we 're going to hurt you so just take anything you want , but if these two paddles touch ... Listen gashole ! You kill us , you kill yourself ! You had your chance to retreat . Come a little closer , then let 's just find out what happens . Sorry about the mess . Absolutely not ... Our situation is untenable as it is . I 'm with D 'Argo on this , John . J Allowing Gilina to encourage Crais 's return is suicidal at best . Look , the Sheyangs are sitting out there waiting for another chance to slip through . and Crais is going to come back , one day . - What then ? - We have done well to evade Crais as it is . With a start , he would soon catch us . Not if she doesn 't tell him we were here . I 'm a trusting soul at best , but not to a fault . The Tech will not reveal our presence . - How can you be so sure about that ? - You know what happened to me ... Being deemed irreversibly contaminated by Crais . Contamination by enemy lifeforms ... ' That could happen to you . Punishment is death ... or worse , banishment . I hope you will only ever imagine how horrible it is to never return to the life that you love . ? You are smarter than that , Gilina ? I have sent a distress call to the Peacekeeper Carrier that passed through here earlier . It is returning at maximum speed . Any word from Lomus ? His life signal is no longer active . What do you think we should do , Evran ? I 'm sorry you are leaving , my officers are drawing up plans to retaliate . I doubt so ... You had nothing , n but you used it well . Evran , there is no shame in losing to a clever opponent . And K D 'Argo ... D I make it a point to some day kill my clever opponents . You were magnificent , D 'Argo ! With or without your assistance ? In spite of it . Crais will ask you many questions . I will lie . I wish I had been so smart . You free this weekend ? I have to overhaul a Prowler engine ... but apart from that ... yes . Gilina ... I don 't want you to go . ' Are you asking me to stay ? No , I can 't , I can 't , this is no way to live . I can 't ask you to come back with me , because ... Crais would kill you . So what do we do ? You get vacation time ? I 'm never going to see you again , am I ? Yes ... Well , we 'll find a way . We 'll organise a rendez vous point later . Something . Anything . Something . Crichton ... There is no more time . We must go . In a minute , D 'Argo . Life sucks . It brought us together . Okay ... It sucks a little less . Crichton ! Crichton ! Hey . A greeting I shall never understand . Well , it 's kind of all purpose let 's the other person decide what they want to talk about . What if they don 't want to talk ? - Then they say " hey " back . - Hey . Well now the first person that doesn 't want to talk can be trumped if the other person realises that they need to . Hey . I hate being ambushed . Well , you got him in the end , that 's all that counts . I wasn 't talking about the Sheyangs . You know , on my world they say that loss is the hardest emotion to deal with . In my world , showing pain is a sign of weakness . How can you not feel pain after what you 've been through ? Don 't presume to understand me , John . Oh , that 's not fair . That 's not fair , Aeryn . You bash me all the time for being soft . Well the fact of the matter is that sometimes it 's an advantage I think I understand you perfectly . There 's no way you can know what I feel . If I , somehow , someday get a chance to return to my world , a walk around my old neighbourhood , see my old house , Dad 's truck , a best friend 's bike on the lawn , and then I get a chance to go inside . I walk through the living room , upstairs to my room . I had a poster of Clint Eastwood .. The Good , The Bad and The Ugly . And then I think ... what if everyone were dead ? What if all my friends and family were lying there dead ? Now what would it be like to go home then ? I stand corrected . ( Sous-Titre : Agellus )

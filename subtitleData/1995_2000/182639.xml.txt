 HOBBES : My dearest Sophie , even as I write these words feeling my pen press against paper I struggle to make sense of the world where I am now prisoner . A world that looks and feels like our own but was created not by God , but by man . A world whose reality was written in bytes and bits Defense Department software running on a computer to which my consciousness has been chained . My friend Pinocchio reminds me this is just a game a digital reality where all that matters is survival . But there is more here , Sophie . A woman named Florence saved my life with the power to heal . Who gave her this power ? Some programmer ? For what purpose ? Or could it be , even in the unreality of this strange world there exists a higher power ? One whose call only Florence can hear . [ GRUNTING ] Florence . [ WHISTLES ] Hobbes , take a hand . HOBBES : You see her ? PINOCCHIO : No . - What the hell got into her ? - I don 't know . - She ever just run off like this before ? - Something 's up . HOBBES : Florence had run to answer a threat . Whatever gave her the power to heal gave her other powers as well . The ability to sense dangers Pinocchio and I could not even suspect . I 've become used to running here , Sophie , used to living in fear . Never stopping to think there might be a higher purpose behind all this . A purpose no programmer could have imagined . My friend Florence was on a mission of mercy relying on her faith in a higher power . We did not know it yet , but so were we . Hobbes , stop ! Don 't move ! - What ? - Stand still . - Minefield . HOBBES : You sure ? PINOCCHIO : Oh , yeah , I 'm sure . - Retrace your steps , Hobbes . - Lf we follow Florence 's tracks ... [ CLICKING ] - Son of a ... - What ? Just get the hell away . Hey , stand clear . - Don 't move . - Oh , you think ? Give me your knife . What did you hear ? A click . - Just one click ? - One click . It 's your lucky day . It 's an antipersonnel mine with a pressure-release trigger . I 'm gonna try to defuse it . Put the knife between your boot and the pressure plate . [ CLICKING ] Go ! HOBBES : A world exists exactly like ours . You live in this world . Your family and friends . And though you may not know it , I was sent to save you . It 's just a game . God does not reserve his gifts for any one soul . Florence 's miraculous ability to heal was shared by others . Women who , unlike her , lived in isolation . Women whom Florence , sensing danger , had gone to find . For here , just as in the real world , the darkness preys on the light on the innocent , the holy . So Florence ran , praying she was not too late . FATHER : Are you one of them ? Don 't shoot . Don 't , don 't . Don 't shoot . I 'm just a man . Just a little man trying to provide for his kith and kin . You like to give me a heart attack . I thought you were , you know , one of them . Kind of short on conversation like them too . You wouldn 't happen to know where they went . Sisters . Sisters ? Healers ? A bunch of women , got the healing touch . See , my little boy my little son , he 's gut sick . In a world of pain . Terrible , terrible pain . You 're the answer to our prayers . Can you heal our little boy ? Poor thing , he 's green with pain . FATHER : We want to thank you very kindly . HOBBES : Survival is the most basic of instincts . By all rights , Pinocchio and I should have died in that minefield . But the women Florence had run to save were closer than she knew . As I lay in that field , feeling life slip away from me I became aware of a presence . A presence to whom I owe my survival and to whom Pinocchio would come to owe something far greater . Pinocchio . PINOCCHIO : Florence . Florence . Who are you ? Where am I ? How did I get here ? Hobbes . Where 's Hobbes ? Is he dead ? What are you doing ? Oh , God . Sorry , Sister . It 's my leg , isn 't it ? How bad is it ? Let me see . Where 's my leg ? Where 's my frigging leg ? [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] - Hello , Sister . FATHER : I told you . What did I tell you ? She 's yours . For my cut of the profits , of course . I said the lot of them . She could lead you to them , to where them other healers went . BOUNTY HUNTER : What makes you think she knows ? I know who can make her talk . You being funny ? I know someone . You 'll see . Better happen fast , before Santiago finds them . Leave me alone . You people shouldn 't have saved me . You should have let me die . You think you 're doing me some big favor . How long you think a one-legged guy 's gonna survive in this godforsaken hellhole ? This is all just too frigging rich . I said , leave me alone ! HOBBES : Harsh Realm is a faithless world , one where God is not believed to exist . And yet , how else to explain my survival ? The faith that sustained Florence and the healers was a threat a silent challenge to those who preached faithlessness . So they were to be hunted down destroyed by those who built their empire on fear . MAN 1 OVER RADIO : Kilo Six , this is Kilo Base . Report status . Repeat . Report status . MAN 2 : Kilo Six to Kilo Base . I 'm solo on the edge of a field in grid 4-4-8-9 . No sign of target . MAN 1 OVER RADIO : Kilo Base to Kilo Six . Kilo Base to Kilo Six . Stay put . Your unit 's on the way . Roger that . Hold position , wait for my unit . Kilo Six out . [ GUNSHOTS ] Don 't move . The next shot 's a kill shot . MAN 1 OVER RADIO : Kilo Base to Kilo Six . [ CLICKING ] Hold it ! Lie still ! Move and we die . You 're lying on a mine . That was the trigger we just heard . It 's a pressure-release . One wrong move , it 's gonna go . - You die too . - I 'm not offering it as a choice . MAN 1 OVER RADIO : Kilo Base to Kilo Six . Kilo Base to Kilo Six . Confirm location . Come in , Kilo Six . Over . What are you doing out here ? I heard you referenced a target . - Kiss my ass . - Kiss it goodbye . My unit 's on its way . - They 're never gonna find you out here . - They 'll find me . They 'll find the jeep running or hear the radio . This area 's gonna be crawling with Republican Guard in just a short matter of time . - I got friends who will find me first . - Oh , yeah ? Where are they ? [ DOOR OPENS ] Are you coming or going , honey ? Right , whatever . I know I 'm fascinating . Stare at the freak all you want . I don 't want to be no cripple . I don 't want to be no gimp . You want to help me , grow me a new leg . You can 't do that , can you , healer ? Can you ? [ RATTLING ] You 're scared , aren 't you ? [ CAR STOPS RUNNING ] The radio 's dead , the car 's dead . - Screw you . - You 're gonna die out here , soldier . - For what ? Santiago ? - Sure as hell not for you . Brave man , aren 't you ? Out there killing innocent people in the Realm . You mean vermin like you , and this phony Sisterhood ? - Who ? - Group of women . Healers . - Claim there 's some higher power . - It 's a fact . I 've seen it . - There is no higher power than Santiago . - You 're so wrong . Yeah ? Prove me wrong . Let go of my wrist . Let go , and I 'll prove you wrong . Not a chance . I got someone wants to see you . Bring him here to me . You can get her to talk ? We need the location of a group of Sisters . Healers on the lam . She knows . She 's one of them , but an outcast . Come to warn them . But she knows where they are ? Where we can find them ? Yes . - That ain 't no answer . FATHER : Let me just talk to him a little . Excuse me . Excuse me . There 's been some kind of misunderstanding , see . What we ... [ WHISPERING ] He needs payment . [ HORSE NEIGHS ] MOTHER : What are you doing ? BOY : Let me go ! FATHER : No . MOTHER : Let him go . Let him go ! BOY : Put me down ! FATHER : No . You can 't take him ! He 's not a slave . He 's just a kid . You 'll have another . They 'll feed him . At least they 'll feed him . HOBBES : You 're shaking . You 're gonna get us both killed . ESCALANTE : Go on . I can save your life . Prove there 's a higher power . All I want is to get off this thing in one piece . Okay . All right . You 've gotta let go of my wrist . Lesson number one : Grace . Hey ! Hey ! This is mercy . Now we 're gonna learn about prayer . [ GASPING ] You people don 't understand . I can 't live like this . It 's what a soldier fears most . What he can 't see . A piece of metal buried in the ground . Boom . You 're not a soldier anymore . You 're half a man . People look you in the eye your good eye , and say it don 't matter . Spirit matters . That 's a lie . You may do okay if you can believe it . But , no , not me . Ah ! God ! My third day in Yugoslavia , a military action , not even a war . They said the mine had been planted by rebels . The guys we were fighting for . It took my leg at the knee half of my face . You believe that ? Not even a good story . I volunteered for Harsh Realm . Be a real hero , both legs back . Maybe this is God 's way of punishing me for thinking I rated a second chance . You have no idea what I 'm talking about , do you ? No matter . It 'll all be over soon . All right . Nice and slow . Easy . Easy . [ GROANS ] All right , I need a rock . A good-sized one . This is called faith that you don 't run off on me . - Trust is another thing . - You 're full of BS . The only way we make it out of this field is together . Now , give me the rock . Right here . On top of the knife . What is this lesson ? Humility . [ GASPING ] Okay , go that way , one step at a time . Lead the way . Where 's the clip ? One bullet , that 's all I ask . Damn it ! Where 's my ammo ? " Manus Domini . " The hand of God . Manus Domini . You believe this crap ? You think God gave you these powers ? There 's no God here . It 's a freaking computer game . Some guy made you , writing computer code . Yours is the hand of man . Who would give you the power to heal , but not to speak ? God ? This is some man 's perverse fantasy that you went and made a religion out of . It 's all making sense to me now why you banished Florence . You think you 're special . But she knew you weren 't . She knew you 'd have to take up arms to fight , to survive to outlast Santiago . He 'll tolerate no greater power , no religion , no threat to his rule . My advice to you : Run . Keep running . Because Santiago will find you . And when he does you 're all gonna die . ESCALANTE : What are you doing ? HOBBES : Stay there with your hands on your knees . I 'm taking any chance you wouldn 't return me the favor of saving your life . I spent the last four hours on my hands and knees making sure that you didn 't get killed . There 's a big difference where I come from . Oh , yeah ? Where I come from , we shoot first and talk about it after . Glad to see I 've had an impact . My unit comes out and finds me like this you 're gonna wish that you had shot me . Tell them you had orders from a higher power . Oh , you think that you proved something ? All you proved to me is why we 're winning out here . Hey ! We 're lost . We 're going the wrong way . Smile , Sister , you 're going home . [ GROANS ] I could have killed you three times already , and I 'd kill you now but there 's no profit in it . Santiago pays when you and your Sisters are delivered alive . You looking for them too ? Don 't shoot , I 'm just a man . Just a little man trying to provide for my kith and kin . Looking for who ? You about made me have a heart attack . Who are you looking for ? Sisters . Healers , they say . Uh , I got my wife around back . Gut sick . Terrible , terrible pain . Just over here . Maybe you could just have a look-see . I 'm afraid I can 't help her . Well , you know , maybe she just needs to see a kind face . I got to find these Sisters . He knows where they are . They took my boy . - No . You see , she 's delirious . - They took my son ! He knows ! He sold my son into slavery . [ MOTHER SOBBING ] Anytime . Finish the job . Come on , damn it . Come on ! Come on ! What are you putting me through ? ! Why are you doing this to me ? ! [ SHOUTING ] I 'm gonna help you . HOBBES : Faith cannot be meek . Faith must be strong . What Pinocchio now knew was the truth that had made Florence an outcast from her Sisterhood : That the innocent must not only be cherished they must be defended . PINOCCHIO : Take it easy , huh ? One false move , you 'll end up like me . What ? I guess you are special . [ GUN COCKS ] He made me do it . He pulled a gun on me , and I like to have a heart attack ... Quiet . Florence , stand up . This is a lesson in humility . My orders are to search and destroy . No mercy . - I still expect to be paid by the head . FATHER : What about my cut ? - He took my boy . - You 'll get what you got coming to you . You just make sure there are no survivors . - Untie us . - I was just thinking that . [ GROANS ] [ CLICKING ] [ COUGHING ] Careful . HOBBES : The ability to heal is a gift but bestowing that gift takes from the healer , weakens her . It is self-sacrifice , motivated by love , even for one 's enemy . Perhaps Florence and her Sisters are merely virtual characters . But if that 's true , then what of their love ? Is it any less real than our own ? I 'm dying . You 're not gonna die , soldier . [ COUGHING AND GROANING ] What is it ? HOBBES : The events of these past days have changed little in Harsh Realm . The Sisters are still on the run from Santiago , as are we . And yet , everything here seems different to me now , Sophie . I now look at this strange world through the eyes of a believer knowing that where there is darkness , there is light . Where there 's fear , there is hope . That our cause is worth fighting for and worth winning . [ NEIGHING ] I 'm taking the boy home . There are other boys . You 're Tom Hobbes . - How do you know my name ? - The healer believes you 're the one . She 's wrong . Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH SDH ]

 I don 't want to hear it . Honestly ... I 'm sick of listening to your lies . Would you just listen to what I 'm saying . I heard what you said , Quint . But Donna told me everything you say and everything you 're gonna say . - Damn ! - What ? Something touched my hand . - Where are you going now , Quint ? - Hold on . Quint ? What the- - ? Quint ... You haven 't been listening to a word I 've said , now have you ? You know that crazy girl means nothing to me . Yeah , well ... . You gotta have more faith in me , girl . I guess I do . It 's tight , but I 'm getting through . Better you than me . Hey , I heard that . So , um , ... how 's the ammonia levels , doc ? Point zero-nine-eight . Pay dirt , partner . Looks like a medium roost . Antrozous pallidus , I think . I 'm going to try to get in . Yeah , if it gets too tight , you need to turn around and come back because you do not wanna rely on me getting your ass back up here . What happened to sending in a camera and a lens ? Jimmy , you know I prefer the hands-on approach , right ? - Would you do me a favor ? - What 's that ? Remind me to lay off the cheesecake . You 're talking to a brother . You know I don 't mind the extra weight , especially if it 's in the right place . About five meters . Mostly mothers and young . You might lose me in a minute . Sheila , you know I hate when that happens . That 's all right , though . I got 911 programmed in on the cellular . Hey Jimmy , if you hate bats and caves so much , what the hell are you doing with me then ? For one , I won 't lie . You kind of cute . And two , I like ' em , but like at a distance a real distance , like on " Wild Kingdom . " And that 's why you 're down there and I 'm up here . What the heck ? ! There 's some kind of- - Jimmy ? What the heck is this ? All the dust ! Ugh ! Who are you ? Why are you landing that thing here ? I 'm Dr. Tobe Hodge , the CDC in Atlanta . - Center for Disease Control ? - Hey , I never touched that girl . Dr. Casper ... we need your help ... immediately . There 's a plane waiting to fly us to Texas . Wait a second . Hold on a minute . Look , you 're the best in your field , so we came directly to you . That 's Dr. Alexander McCabe . He 'll be accompanying us . I don 't mean to pry , but what in the hell is this all about ? There 's a biological emergency . What kind of biological emergency ? Bats , Dr. Casper . Bats . - Sheriff Kimsey ? - Dr . Hodge . Appreciate y 'all coming . We have some gear . Yeah , I can see that . You must pack a lot of clout there , doc . The CDC considers this assignment to be of singular importance . Good . Well , hell , let 's get to it then . So , ma 'am , you 're a doctor of what exactly ? Wildlife zoology with a speciality in Chiroptera . Uh , huh . Bats , sheriff . I work with bats . Bats . Uh , huh . So does that make you a bat-ologist ? No . It makes me a wildlife zoologist with a speciality in Chiroptera . Uh , huh . To be honest with you folks , I 've never seen anything like this before . We 'll take over the forensic work now , doctor , if that 's all right with you . Hell , yes . Take over . I never did care too much for the sight of blood myself . It 's a damn shame . Some folks around town think that kids might 've done this . Some satanic cult ritual or some other such nonsense . Starting with the male cadaver . The incision just below the temporomandibular joint at the neck extends in depth all the way to the hypoglossus . I 'm sure that jugular incision was the initial point of contact . They went for the lethal attack . Hey , Jimmy , I 'd imagine nobody 'd mind if you wanna step outside and keep old Doc Swanbeck company . Yeah . That 's a good idea , sheriff . You guys just keep doing what you 're doing . The external anterior jugulars have been severed down to ... the carotid on the right side of the median . Sheila , I 'm gonna need your confirmation now . Looking at the neck wounds ... I 'd say we have a bite diameter of four centimeters ... and a circumference of , say , 13 centimeters . The Pteropodidae family . This is impossible . These bats only feed on fruit and nectar . This can 't be . - Excuse me ? - This must be some kind of sick hoax . Unfortunately , we 're fairly certain that this is not a hoax . Wait a second . Are you saying some kind of bat did this ? I 'm afraid so , sheriff . Well then , there is something very wrong here , gentlemen , because this sort of thing is not suppose to happen . What 's going on here ? What is it you 're not telling me ? The total number of attacks may be higher . We 've only been able to confirm these five for certain . Yesterday was the first human encounter that we know of . I 'd say it was a hell of a lot more than just an encounter , doctor . All the attacks were similar and occurred here in western Texas , all in the past six days . Impossible . Dr. Casper ? Bats do not kill people . Period . There must be some other explanation . One that has absolutely nothing to do with bats , and therefore ... nothing to do with me . Miss Casper . You 're right , of course . But the bats that we 're talking about , they 're very special . Special ... In what way ? Exactly what are we talking about here , doctor ? Well , the two bats that escaped from my lab were brought from Indonesia . They 're test subjects . The Pteropus poliocephalus in question- - Hold on a minute ! These are flying foxes we 're talking about ? - Oh , no . Shit . - Yes . But , those are among the most endangered species in the world . Not to mention the ugliest and largest bats you ever wanna meet . Let me get this straight . Are you telling me you 're responsible for the death of those kids , Dr. McCabe ? Dr. McCabe sought our assistance as soon as the bats escaped . Now , we 're here to stop these things before they can kill or contaminate others . Contaminate ? What were you guys experimenting with ? Well , let 's just say it was ... .. virus-based . I really can 't discuss it any further . I 'm sorry . So , um ... we 're here to help you find your infected guinea pigs , is that it ? And destroy them , if you can . Oh , you can count on that . Well , I 'll help you find them , but I 'm not gonna destroy them . And I 'm not gonna let any of you destroy them either . Oh , don 't worry . It won 't go that far , I assure you . Bats can be anywhere in a 100-mile radius . That 's their range . Of course , they could also be in a barn or underneath a bridge or in a sewer . Well , that 's just dandy . But we gotta get started somewhere . So if you had to pick one place to look , where might that be ? Here . The attack happened between the town and national park . It would be the most likely corridor between its roost and its food . Kimsey . Where ? This definitely not gonna look good in the morning paper . These killings weren 't done by a single bat , or even two . Our bats must be infecting other bats with the virus . Emmett ? ! Mayor . This is Dr. Sheila Casper . Dr. Casper . This is Mayor Branson . Emmett , tell me what in heaven 's name is going on here , would you ? As far as we can tell , we think this was done by some sort of bats . Bats . Yes , ma 'am . Now , I know it sounds crazy- - The bats we 're referring to are diseased . They 're infected with some sort of virus . We don 't know much more yet , but we hope to soon . What am I supposed to tell the families , the town ? That we got a bunch of rabid bats on the loose ? Whatever you say , Amanda , you need to say it now , alright . Warn folks , tell them to stay inside at night , till this all blows over . Deputy Munn will start putting calls out . All right , Wesley ? What we need to avoid right now is any sort of panic . Oh yeah , you can save that panicking stuff for later . You mean the TV , radio- - Yeah , whatever you gotta do , Wesley , just do it . Now put the word out . And cancel that god-damn football game tonight . They 're gonna lose anyway . Dr. Hodge , anything ? Yeah . Good news . Preliminary blood tests from the two teenagers suggest that ... any abnormalities infecting the bats is completely host-specific ... and can 't be transferred in active form to humans . So you 're saying , that the bats can only infect other bats ? The virus was designed specifically ... not to be transmittable beyond the bats ' own zoological order . Tell me , Dr. McCabe , what exactly did you do to them ? I 'm sorry , but I 'm ... I 'm not allowed to say . Now that 's bullshit ! Those things are killing people in my town , and as far as I can tell , you 're directly responsible for that . We need to know what we 're dealing with here , doctor . I 'm kinda curious myself , now that you mention it . All right , I 'll tell you then . You let me know how I do . Some how , you 've increased their natural intelligence . Yes . And their ability to work together communally . That 's not so bad . We could all use a little dose of that . Then you made them aggressive . Now that 's bad . Finally , you made them carnivores . No , Dr. Casper . I made them omnivorous . Put my bats anywhere in the world and ... .. they will feed . But why would you do that ? Because I 'm a scientist . That 's what we do . We make everything a little better . Bigger livestock , better crop yields . Millions of years of evolution . What arrogance to think you could do better ! Apparently I have , Dr. Casper . Apparently I have . You son of a bitch . I don 't know about you ... but I don 't like anything moving higher up the food chain than me . Period . Okay , look . Our chief concern at the moment ... must be , ensuring that this disease ... is not allowed to spread to the bat population at large . If their feeding habits are disrupted ... say so long to that nice little balance-of-nature thing we had going . Take a look at this . This is a bat migration schematic I 've created . It traces migrations , feeding patterns ... . I 've entered the usual information : climate , food sources , bat roost . Those dots ? Those are our bats . Once the temperature changes and they start freezing , they 'll migrate ... following their food to temperate climates . By February , this colony ... would reach Mexico City , San Antonio and New Orleans ... just in time for Mardi gras . If our bats infect other bats ... and those newly-infected bats follow their usual patterns ... of migration- - Show them , Jimmy . That my friends , is six months from now . And it ain 't gonna be pretty . Of course ... my ass will be long gone by then . If we don 't stop them , what happened to those kids is gonna happen all the country . So what do we do now ? The only way to stop the spread and contamination is to locate the roost ... and to annihilate every last infected bat . So you reckon these things 'll hold them , huh ? Yeah . - They 're called mist nets . - Feels like fishnet stocking to me . They 're a little tougher than they look , sheriff . Hey , Wesley , Jimmy , come in . - Yes , sir . - How y 'all doing over there ? We 're all getting along gangbusters , sir . We just hung a bunch of those damn net things . Yeah , they 're called mist nets . Whatever . They feel like fishnet stockings . How about that . Y 'all keep your eyes open . Let me know if you see anything . Yes sir , you 'll be the first to know , sir . Yes , give me that information . Local law enforcement is adequate . They 're on a need-to-know basis . Same as the team . He 's here . He 's with me now . Fine . They 're in the field . She 's very competent . I was very impressed with her . Blood on the moon . Excuse me ? My mama use to say when the moon was red like it is now ... then there was blood on the moon and somebody was gonna get killed . Sheriff , if you 're trying to put me at ease , it 's not working . Sorry about that . It 's okay . If you don 't mind me asking , what 's that for ? This ? It 's an ancient Chinese symbol for the bat . Chinese consider bats good luck . Harbingers of good fortune . What got you into bats in the first place ? Well , when I was a little girl growing up back in Ohio , we had a barn . Had some bats in it . Scared the hell out of me . Used to give me horrific nightmares . So anyway , one night , my dad finally dragged me out back and caught one of the bats . He explained to me all the good things bats do , like pollinating rain forests and eating insects and what have you . And then he made me hold it . And I gotta tell you it was the gentlest thing I 'd ever seen . Guess , I 've been bat-crazy ever since . The thought of killing one , goes against everything I come to believe . Well I 'll tell you what , you catch one of those things tonight , I 'll pet its belly for you . Hell , I might even take it out to dinner and a movie . Oh god , there 's too many . - What do you mean ? - Come on ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Come on ! Get in the truck ! Let 's cover the vents ! Any possible entrance ! Hurry up ! well , that 's all being taken care of , sir , as we speak . " We 're gonna need some help down here ! " " Son of a bitch ! " " They 're trying to get in ! " Jimmy here , what 's going on ? These things , they 're not like any bats I 've ever seen ! They 're trying to get into the truck ! - Where 'd I put my damn keys ? We 're on our way . I can 't find my damn keys ! They 're trying to get into the engine ! Whatever you do try and stay calm . I ain 't calm , and I 'm telling her to stay calm . Son of a bitch ! Come on ! Come on ! Shit ! - Sheila , they 're getting in ! Oh shit ! Get it off ! Get it off ! Shit ! Sheila ? Do you hear me ? Come in ! Sheila , do you hear me ? Come in ! Sheila ! Watch out ! I 'm going to shoot it ! Are you alright ? Are you okay ? Holy shit ! - Use your gun for a sec ... . ! Come on , man ! Shoot them ! - I 'll hit the sheriff and Sheila . Shoot over them . Try and scare them off . Then again , we could just high-tail it out of here now . Alright , hold still . Let me take a look at you here . Alright , hold on a sec . - Sheila . Are you okay ? Are you all right ? Yeah , I have been since you left . Hey ! Sheila ! Yeah ? Looks like they left a little something behind . Oh god , sheriff , don 't move . Don 't move ! - All right , be careful now . Okay , One two , three ! That 's why I leave that kind of stuff up to her . See . What did I tell you ? Ugly ! Now this might sting a little . - Sheila , I 've been doing some thinking . And what I figured out is this : This is fucked up ! Now , I 'm thinking about heading to Antarctica right about now ! Now , I checked into this . There 's not one bat up there , because they hate the cold . Hey , Wes ? Get a hold of the mayor . Make sure everyone is inside ... and their house is secure , alright ? Go on , now , get on it . - Alright , that should do for now . - Thanks . Holy shit ! McCabe 's bats . - Sheriff , do you have your gun ? - In my hand . This might be a good time to use it . You only have to clip their wings . Huh ? Clip their wings ? Would you shoot their damn heads off ? And don 't miss . Damn ! - Hey . Are you all right ? - Yeah , we 're great . Nice timing . Thank God you got one of them . I need to study it immediately . We 've got other plans for this one , doctor . Catch your own . Alright ... when I open this cage , I want you to reach in and grab him by the neck and wings , alright ? Are you crazy ? Try to be gentle , but firm . - I think can handle that . - I 'm sure you can , Emmett . Okay , you ready ? On three , gentlemen . One , two , three ! God damn . That sucker 's strong ! Okay , easy . Sheriff , would you take his other wing . Please ? Please ? Thank you . Oh , no , Jimmy , thank you . Are you sure , he couldn 't tear that bug out ? No , it 's injected under the skin where he can 't reach it . - Won 't hurt him , though . - Oh well , that 's a relief . We 're in business here . I 'm telling you , this isn 't going to work . I know what these things are capable of . - You getting a clear fix , Jimmy ? - Crystal clear , baby . Great . Should be able to pinpoint the roost 's entrance to within a few feet . I 'll tell you something , I lied . I 'm not gonna pet this thing 's belly . Don 't let us down , sweetie . How 's it tracking , Jimmy ? Perfectly . Long as it keeps moving away from me . Houston ... we got a problem . Maybe , we can capture another bat . Can we ? Try again . That could take days . So , what the hell are we going to do now ? Evacuate the town immediately . Order a comprehensive evacuation for 100 miles , here to Mexico . And Hodge we 're gonna need more help . A lot more help . You can study it now if you like . Sheila , I just ordered reinforcements . They 're gonna arrive in the morning . Effective immediately the CDC is evacuating the town of Gallup , Texas . Good work , Hodge . Evacuation ? Yeah , I think that 's a good idea , doc . Based on this localized program ... well ... it looks like all this time , them damn things been making their way directly towards town . We might still have some time . Hey , Manny ... you got any ketchup ? What is going on here ? What are all these people doing out ? I thought they were warned . As far as I knew , they were . Sheriff , Thank God you 're here . Christ in a sidecar , man ! What the hell are all these people doing out ? We 've warned them six ways to Sunday ! Nobody wants to believe . Everybody in Texas thinks they know everything , about everything . Oh , my God . What is it ? They 're coming . Their echolocation calls , their sonar , I can hear it . They 're coming ! Aw , shit ! Oh , my God ! Move off the streets ! Everybody get inside ! Please ! Get inside right now ! Hurry up , everybody ! Take cover ! Take cover , please ! Everybody get inside ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Oh , my god ! You gotta get inside ! Move ! Move ! Get inside ! Get inside ! Get inside ! Close the doors ! - Hey , You all right ? - Get out of here ! Get out of here ! - Ok ... Holy ... shit Come on ! Get inside ! - Oh , my god ! Ohh ! - Oh , God ! Oh , my God . Ok . Alright . All right , everybody , back ! Let 's just take it easy , okay ? Take it easy . Back ! Get in the back . Go ! Now ! AH ! ... . AHH ! Get down ! Get down ! Aghh ! Uh ... . uhh ! Aw , ... shit ! Come on ! Come on ! Get inside ! Get in there ! Get in there ! Get down ! AHH ! Get inside ! Please ! Hey , Mister . Mister , hold on ! Mister , there 's people down here ! Oh , shit ! Sheila ! Get inside now ! - Sheila ! Sheila ! Stay calm ! Help me ! Help me ! - Sheila ! AHH ! NO ! Oh , God . Sheila ? You all right ? He saved me . Sheila ? You gonna be alright ? He saved me . He saved my life . My God . Jesus . Wes ? God damn it , Wesley . Excuse me , ma 'am . All right . We 'll see what we can do . They 're evacuating everybody now . Airstrip 's closed down . They got roadblocks outside of town . Mexicans are trying to clear everybody out , down to Oaxaca and Rosita . Jesus , Emmett . What are we gonna do now ? I 'm still working on that , ma 'am . Old Texas custom . This evacuation covers the entire town , doesn 't it ? Yeah . No one 's going in or out now . So tell me something . What in the hell are we still doing here ? We asked them to let us stay . Say what ? To aid in locating and destroying the bats . You gotta be pulling my leg , because , this shit is not funny . They 're only giving us 48 hours . Hey , why am I the only one who doesn 't know about this ? 48 hours before they launch a full on military air strike ... armed with Alpine missiles . They 're gonna bomb every cave , cavern and dugout foxhole ... in a 100-mile radius of Gallup . What ? Are they crazy ? They 'll kill everything in Gallup , and not a single bat . That 's right . And we cannot let them do that . Now , I begged them for this chance , and they agreed . But we 're basically on our own . I 'll tell you , I 'm not going to let them blow my town off the face of the earth , without a fight . People got their homes here . Hell , they got their whole lives here . And I gotta make sure they got something to come back to . The reality is we 're sure to be quarantined for the next month , whether we stay or not . What ? He 's staying too ? I created them . This will give me time to review my work ... and figure out what went wrong . Jimmy , we could really use your help . I 'd understand if you don 't wanna hang around . Let me tell you guys one thing : If another one of your bats looks at me ... if his head moves like this , or his eyes go like this ... like he might look at me ... I 'm coming for you . Does that mean you 're gonna stay ? Yeah . I 'll stay . Something called a Chroma B-340 . The newest thing in spy satellites . When the satellite passes over Texas ... they 'll center infrared cameras on a 50-mile radius south of Gallup . Give us a direct feed . When the bats emerge from their roost , it 'll be your turn . The military wants to be as hands-off about this as possible . You 'll have to make the I.D. Think you can do that ? I can try . This is our school . It 's not as primitive as you 'd might think for a small town . We can fortify it as good as any . Let 's hope so . Alright , you can set up in here , this is the science room . All the computers have high-speed modems . Try to hook us up to Langley . Let 's secure the building before dark . Yeah , I heard that . What is that ? That is Montserrat singing Donizetti 's Lucia . A real touchstone of the bel canto repertoire . You 're an opera fan , sheriff . I 'm impressed . Don 't tell anybody about my hidden vice . Folks around here would run me out of town if they knew . Don 't worry . Your secret 's safe with me . You are a sick individual . Let 's get out of here ! There . We are now as secure as the goddamn Alamo . Bad example there , Jimmy . Oh , yeah . You 're right . You know , maybe we should hang up a few cloves of garlic around here . What do you think ? I got hooked up to the base . Once the satellite passes over , they 'll start sending us the photos . That 'll work . And once we find them , then what ? Let 's assume they 're all living in the same roost . Given their communal behavior , I 'd say that 's likely . Poison ? Not an option . The most popular poison for bats is chlorophacinone . Largely ineffective against them and highly lethal for humans . Believe me , I checked into this a long time ago . Maybe we could try and trap them ? Whatever we do , we have to get them all . Why not just bomb the sons of bitches ? No , that won 't do . An explosion would definitely scatter them ... and might not even kill all that many . This is like some kind of a nightmare . I mean , I 'll never sleep again . Wait a minute . That 's it . What ? We 'll put them to sleep . When the temperature drops below 40 degrees , bats begin to hibernate . But at 32 they freeze to death . Right , but how do we do it ? Yeah , especially in the middle of a heat wave . All we need are cooling units , powerful enough to freeze the roost . Well , all right . Jimmy , call Langley and see what they can come up with . I 'll check it out . Hey , Sheila ? Seems to me , you 're thinking of walking into that roost ... with a whole lot of those things hanging right over your head . Bats are nocturnal . They don 't have any bearing during the day- - Yeah , but those are normal bats- - I know . But , we don 't have any other choice . Yeah . Yeah . I got it . Alright , boys and girls , we are all set . There 's something called the NGIC Industrial . A cooler that emits a combination of Freon , CO2 and pure oxygen at superhuman velocity . It could cover Cairo in icicles in three days . Good enough . Once we locate the roost ... they 'll do an airlift and drop-off at the entrance . That 's as far as they 'll go . They don 't wanna know about us . - They 're preparing for a bomb raid . - We 'll need special gear to go in . What ? We 're going into the roost ? All of us ? Don 't worry . You 'll stay out and monitor our progress , alright ? Right . Maybe next time . We are at the drop zone . Commence drop . Sheriff . Lift with your legs ! If I had legs like that , I 'd probably use them more often . I ordered the best body armor they had . You 'll need it . This is all Kevlar , steel-reinforced . You don 't say . The breathing gear is used to protect us from the ammonia fumes . In a roost with millions of bats ... ammonia from the guano can reach lethal levels . - Guano ? - It 's bat shit . Oh . Yeah , right . Wonder how that one slipped out of my mental thesaurus . Trust me . You don 't wanna die choking on no bat shit fumes . That 's it . Last page . It looks like them . Sheila , y 'all need to take a look at this . That 's them , alright . Those are our bats . No , this can 't be right . This is a mountainous area , that 's just northeast of the national park . We ruled that area out already . There are no caves there . Nothing . There 's no way . Well , that 's because they 're not in a cave at all . They 're in a mine . The mine is right in here . It was recently shut down . It 's not on any maps ... but I 'm telling you , it 's huge , and it 's called Black Rock Mines . - Black Rock Mines . - Are you certain ? - That 's affirmative , Major . We 're absolutely certain about that . Good work . We 'll be there at dawn . All right . Sir , they 've located the bats . We 're clear to move in at 0600 hours . No , that 's no longer an option . Who knows where they 'll be then ? If we go in while they 're out feeding ... . Sir , based on the nature of these creatures ... I strongly suggest we wait for daybreak . You don 't need to tell me how dangerous they are , major . The government has been working on this project for over a decade . McCabe was working in weapons development . Yes , major , it was us . We started it ... and now we 'll end it . These are from a geological survey . I figure the bats have to be here . No . They 're deeper . They would never allow themselves to be that vulnerable . Since it 's man-made , the trip down should be easy ... if there hasn 't been too much collapse in the tunnels . How about other entrances ? The entrance the bats are using is the only one this place has ever had . One entrance , nice tunnel down . Should be a piece of cake . No , it won 't . They 'll know you 're there . They 'll know what you 're up to . They 'll try and stop you . What are you talking about ? They 're always aware . That 's how I designed them . To be perfect killing machines . - What ? - Son of a bitch ! They found us . - How ? How could they get- - ? - Because I called them here . And now we 'll put an end to all this . They 're taking out the power ! Those bats didn 't escape from your lab , did they , McCabe ? You let them go , didn 't you ? Very perceptive , Sheila . How could you ? You knew what those things were capable of ! You know how many people have died ? Do you care ? They simply need to be controlled ! If you understood them the way I do , you could control them ! Then do it ! Control them ! Then go on ! Stop them right now ! Why would I wanna do that ? Son of a bitch ! They 're getting in ! Look out ! Stay away from the windows ! I 'm firing up the generator ! They 're getting through here ! Come on ! Get out of here ! I hate this shit ! Work with Daddy ! Shit ! It 's on now . Get back ! Get back , Sheila ! Get back ! Get away from the window ! Get out of here ! I got something for your asses now ! Come on ! Burn , you goddamn rats ! Burn ! You want some of this ? Come on ! You done messed with the wrong brother now ! Come on ! Burn ! You ain 't getting this ass ! Can you handle this , motherfucker ? ! Damn ! You piece of shit ! Come on ! Work with me ! Come on , baby ! Work with me ! Come on ! Now come on ! Come on ! McCabe ? Come on back here , now . Doctor , just come back inside slowly . Don 't you see ? They want me . They 've come for me . Because I can control them . I made them that way . Come to me . Hey , listen . They 're gone . Because they got what they came for . Oh , my God . They tried to do it . They tried to go in during the night . Would you look at this shit ? Damn ! It 's down there . What is ? Refrigeration unit . It 's a big one . Looks like they wired this whole damn place with explosives . - To seal the mine . - That seems to be the plan . Command , come in . This is Sheriff Emmett Kimsey . I 'm with Dr. Sheila Casper . We 're at the Black Rock Mines . Major Reid here . Sheriff , right now there 's an air campaign headed your way ... with instructions to bomb and gas that mine ... in exactly 62 minutes and counting . I suggest you get out of there . Now . We can 't do that . If they bomb , the bats will scatter . No one will be able to stop them . I don 't know if you know this , but your cooling unit is in the cavern . Yes , sheriff . But , those men were not able to turn it on . That was a failed mission . What ? We are going to have to go down there and turn it on . If you can give us a little bit of time , we can turn this thing on for you . No , I will not halt this air strike ! Do you understand ? Now , get the hell out of there , and that is an order ! Listen to me . We are here right now ! We can turn it on . You gotta give us a chance ! Listen , I 'm making the call . Now get out ! Shit ! Alright , we got about an hour . To get down there , turn on the unit and seal the entrances . Hey , Sheila . Look over there . Good . Say the word , baby . I 'm at your command . If there 's any problem , you know what you have to do , right ? What are you talking about ? You 'll both be up here with me by then . We are the only ones who know how bad this can be . I need to know you 'll blow that entrance if you have to . Trust me , Sheila . It 's not gonna come to that . But you 'll do it . Yeah . You can count on it . What 's that saying ? " Any day above ground is a good day " ? When this is over I 'm laying on the beach for like three years ... someplace where they never heard of a bats . Fire up the blender , Jimmy . I 'll bring the tequila . Two tunnels . There 's only one on the map . Great . You gotta make a choice . To the right . See those over there ? Those are possum bones . Possums don 't live down here . One of our bats dragged them in here as an in-flight snack . Very good , sheriff . I 'll make you a chiropterologist yet . You all right ? Are you all right ? - Yeah . - Fine . What 's with this water ? It 's guano . It 's filled with parasites and insects ... that feed on it . Are you kidding me ? I am not up to my chest in bat shit ! I 'm afraid you are , Sheriff . Whew ! Nasty . Is this what you call normal ? I wouldn 't call anything I 've seen in the last few days " normal . " And I truly did not think it could get any worse . Wait a minute . If there 's this much guano in here , then ... . Aw , Jesus . Welcome to ground zero , sheriff . Oh , my God . I never would 've believed it if I didn 't see it . God , there must be millions of them . You folks need to be real quiet right about now . It 's taken you 15 minutes to descend . You have 30 minutes ... to fire up that cooling unit and get your asses back up top . What 's the temperature down there ? Fifty-four . It 's better than we hoped . Just curious , but anybody have any idea how to work this thing ? I know you 're not asking me . Let 's hope they remembered to gas it up , huh ? That would be nice . Okay , hurry up . Losing time . This shouldn 't be too difficult . Looks like we are going to need a key to complete this job . - Oh no ! Shit ! - Damn it ! I found one . Let 's hope it 's the right one . Jimmy . Jimmy , It 's working . It 's working like a dream . Bravo , as they say in opera . Get up here before the fat lady sings . Avenger , you 're clear to arm . Roger , base . We 're arming . Oh , shit ! I think we better keep moving . Oh , God ! It 's gone . No , they 're just circling their prey . Jimmy ? If we don 't make it , you know what we discussed , right ? You gotta blow that entrance . Yeah . Sure . Jimmy , we have no other choice . Yes , you do ! You have seven minutes . Now , Come on ! I lost your video ! Get it off me ! Get it off me ! Get it off ! Damn ! Shit ! Shoot it ! We gotta get out of here ! - Can you breathe okay now ? - Yeah . How much time , Jimmy ? Four minutes ! Come on ! Initiating firebombing run . Sheila . Come on ! - We 're not gonna make it ! - You will ! Come on ! Jump ! Jump ! Commencing final approach . - Come on ! - Go ! Go ! Blow the entrance ! You can make it ! Come on ! Come on ! Now ! Call them off ! Major , call off your boys ! We did it ! We sealed the mine ! Are you sure ? We have to be absolutely certain . Am I certain ? ! Is pig pork ? Yes , I 'm certain ! - What 's the status ? - Here you go , sir . All right . We got satellite confirmation . Good work . Now , get the hell out of there . Avenger , abort mission . Return to base . Roger , we are RTB . Sheila . You okay ? Uh ... huh . Yeah . - You hurt ? You okay ? - I 'll live . You did it . I told you , Sheila . Just hold that there . The temperature 's dropping fast . Our bats should be sound asleep , their little bat asses frozen forever . Provided there are no other entrances . No , that 's it . That 's the only way in or out . Good job , guys . Honey you stink . I don 't smell anything . I smell bat doo-doo . Before you get all precious , you ought to take a look in a damn mirror . That ain 't your best look , either . Come on , doo-doo ! - Okay . It 's about time for a cigar .

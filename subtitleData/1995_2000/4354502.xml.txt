 - [ Woman ] Previously on The Pretender . - [ Sydney ] SL-27 . What does it mean , Jacob ? [ Miss Parker ] I believe my mother rescued some of the children here . - [ Man ] Rescued ? - It 's a long story . - You have a problem with Raines ? - He is out of control . When you were Dr. Raines , you were my colleague . I never detected this unholy obsession . You didn 't look hard enough . [ Woman ] Tonight on The Pretender . [ Young Sydney ] Very good work , Jarod . You 're making progress . [ Young Jarod ] Sidney ? Who 's that ? Who 's that boy ? Another test subject . He 's working with another doctor . - What 's his name ? Can I talk to him ? - No . - But I don 't have any friends . - You won 't be seeing him again . Sydney , where are they taking him ? Yeah . This is Garrison . Flight 1701 . Tell the Oklahoma office we have their witness , sealed and ready to deliver . Remind them we 've got better things to do than escort their chameleon . Got that ? Yeah . 1701 out . Still no update on Eugene 's locale . That 's all right . We 'll find him ... just as soon as we finish playing escort to the Man of a Thousand Faces . Come on ! Let 's go in there . Hey , Lon Chaney , hurry it up in there . Ho ! Marshal Cody . How do I look ? Well , it 's a face only a mother could love . [ Man Narrating ] Oh , God . Unpucker your sphincter , Broots . It 's just me . Miss Parker , I didn 't ... [ Clears Throat ] hear you come in . And how 's your little John Tesh fan ? Fine . She 's-She 's fine . I 'll , uh ... I 'll tell her you said hello . Um , is there something on your mind ? I need a personal favor . From me ? Is it possible to run a global Internet search ... without anyone from the Centre knowing ? Oh , I guess , yes . But if they ... If they , uh , catch you , they 'd crucify you . Why ? You want me to see if someone 's been doing it ? I want you to do it for me . No . No , I couldn 't do that . Please . [ Sighs ] Okay . These are missing children from the late ' 60s . Names , birthdays , physical attributes , some photos . Nobody can see this . Do not scan these pictures and don 't transmit them over the Internet . - But ... - If you find anything , find me . Well , if it isn 't the Keystone Kops . [ Chuckling ] We spend our lives keeping ' mob snitches alive , and all we get is grief . There 's a bunch of guys with flat noses that would like to get their hands on you . With Marshal Cody here ... never happen . Unlike you and Garrison , he 's never lost a witness . Oh , yeah ? Well , all I know is the quicker we dump your butt ... the sooner we can get back on our case . [ Garrison ] Cool it , Lane . Marshal Cody 's just tryin 'to do his job . Let 's go in the back and get you somethin ' to drink . - You 're a fun guy . - [ Laughing ] Did I miss something ? All the marshals in D.C. were laughin ' about it . Heard about it during my holdover . One of their witnesses ... a guy named Diggs ... he bolts on their watch . Well , in this business , that sort of thing happens . That 's only half the story . A couple of weeks before that , this Diggs 's partner ... he cuts up Garrison with a homemade knife ... and then takes a dive from 30,000 feet during the plane transfer . Must have been pretty embarrassing for the Marshals Service . Now you 're catching on . I thought you must have heard about it . I 've been busy . [ Tones Beeping ] - [ Line Clicks ] - Dr. Shafton ? Sydney . [ Sniffs ] I need to see you . Lane . Look , I know it must feel like a slap in the face ... the service transferring me into the middle of your case like that . Nothing personal , but we were doin just fine without you . Look , this Diggs thing just has me on edge . That 's all . I 'm here to help . Mind if I take a look ? In three days , Eugene Diggs is supposed to testify against the Arellano cartel . If we don 't get him back , the government 's case goes south and these drug runners walk . We 'll get ' im back . We 're not gonna break for chow till we do . " S-P-A-M . " What 's it stand for ? America . If we hadn 't shipped that stuff to England during World War II ... the Beatles would 've sung in German . I imagine the sound of an insect vocalizing in any language would be fantastic . Do you mind ? Mmm . It 's delicious . [ Lane ] Are we gonna go talk to Eugene 's wife or not ? Beats himself up over everything . That 's one bad habit I can 't get that kid to shake . Come on . Diggs and his best friend , Jimmy Rayford , owned a little air cargo company in Arkansas . Business was in trouble , soJimmy makes a deal with the Colombians ... to fly some special cargo . Now , Eugene , who trusts Jimmy with his life ... thinks they 're haulin ' coffee beans . Of course , Jimmy 's runnin ' cocaine . D.E.A. nails ' em , so we got them to testify against the cartel ... for reduced sentences ... case closed . TillJimmy Rayford tries to attack you with a homemade knife during an air transfer ... tries to escape by parachuting out of one of our planes ... and leaves Eugene Diggs to take the fall . Bad news travels fast , huh ? Well , I guess the boys in Washington aren 't too happy with you guys . [ Laughing ] They 're not the only ones . How the hell could I talk to Eugene ? You got your people camped out in my front yard . You got my phone lines tapped . My friends won 't even come near this place anymore . The truth is we might be the only friends that you have left . Now you 're not doin Eugene any favors by lying ' to us . Eugene is scared . Jimmy said these cartel guys were tough , that they 'd just as soon kill you as look at you . Then let us help you . Like you helped Jimmy Rayford ? Mrs. Diggs , we can protect you ... both of you , from the cartel . I told you already . I don 't know anything . He 's out there alone , scared , without a friend . Who can he trust now ? Jarod , you need to finish the simulation . I wanna see the other boy . You know I can 't allow you to have contact with anyone . - Fine . Then I can 't finish the simulation . - Why not ? How am I supposed to pretend to do this if I 've never had a friend ? You simulate a lot of things you 've never done before . I want to see the other boy , Sydney . I want to know what it 's like to have a friend . [ Ringing ] - Yes ? - Yeah . It 's Garrison . Diggs 's lawyer just came in . Eugene wants to talk . I 'm on my way . I hope , for your sake , your client 's callin ' to give up . I put you in contact with him . What , I have to talk him off the ledge too ? - [ Groans ] - Sorry . I forgot about your war wound . - Deputy MarshalJarod Cody . - Cody . [ Laughs ] Guess that makes me Annie Oakley . - Here we go . - [ Switch Clicks ] - Eugene ? - How 's Helen ? How 's my wife ? Have you seen her ? Son , your wife would be a whole lot better off ... if you 'd just stop this nonsense and bring yourself in . I can 't do that . Colombians will find us . That 's whatJimmy said . That 's why I ran . I ain 't sticking ' my neck out with nobody standing ' behind me . [ Garrison ] You forgetJimmy . The cartel didn 't kill him , and you know it . - Now Jimmy abandoned you . - No . He got scared . Jimmy was my best friend , man . He sold you out , Eugene . He never told you about the drugs ... and he tried to run and leave you to take the rap . No . He made a mistake . He was just trying to save our business . Look , I 'm not gonna listen to this anymore . You loved Jimmy , didn 't you ? He was like a brother to you . - Who 's this ? - My name is Jarod . - It 's lonely out there . - What the hell do you know about it ? You 've been running , and you 're scared . You feel like you can 't trust anybody . Nobody 's telling you the truth . - [ Sniffling ] I didn 't want any of this . - I know you didn 't . But you can 't run forever . But it 's safer for me and for Helen . Hey . You tell her I love her , Jarod . Eugene . - Eugene . - Public phone . Collinsville , Texas . [ Men Chattering ] Eugene . - You don 't have to run anymore . - Jarod ? Yes . It 's going to be okay . - [ Lane ] He 's got a gun . ! - I promise . [ Garrison ] Federal Marshal . ! Freeze . ! - [ Gunshots ] - He 's unarmed ! - We 're moving to you , Jarod . - He 's unarmed ! Don 't shoot . ! Don 't shoot . ! He 's unarmed . ! Don 't shoot ! [ Garrison ] Get after him . ! - [ Engine Starts , Revs ] - [ Man ] Hey . ! That 's my bike . ! I got one dead drug runner , a trial set to start in 72 hours and now this . ! There goes your perfect record . I 've been combing state and federal databases . Every time I get close to someone with remotely comparable parameters ... I hit a brick wall . You can pick up women on the computer , but you can 't do this ? No , not if I can 't send pictures over the Internet . I 'm sorry . [ Clears Throat ] Okay . You age one of the photographs and send it out . I wanna know what this is about . Excuse me ? It 's just that I 'm risking my neck here ... and I ... I have a right to know why . It 's about my mother . These children may have had something to do with her death . So , how 'd he look ? Like someone who misses his wife a lot . You know , the only thing he 's worried about ... is you . [ Chuckles ] - You two look very happy . - It 's our honeymoon . Be a year next month . You always hear about those people that marry their first true love . Well , that was me and Eugene . I never even kissed another boy . After the ceremony , we went down to a little motel in Corpus Christi . - Looks very nice . - Oh , it was a rathole . But it was all we could afford , so it 's ... it 's special to us . Eugene doesn 't trust you people anymore . Because ofJimmy Rayford ? They went to grade school together . Some older boys were beatin ' up on Eugene ... and Jimmy came in and stood up for him . Got his butt whipped , but , uh , he saved Eugene from a lot worse . I can 't tell you how many times I 've heard that story . Well , they were best friends . Few things are stronger than that . Yeah . The one person that Eugene thought that he could always trust and believe in ... turned him into a drug runner and sold him out . But to Eugene , Jimmy was everything . You ever think that maybe Eugene was right aboutJimmy ? Jimmy Rayford jumped off that plane because he 's a coward . [ Scoffs ] He tried to hang everything on Eugene . That 's what kind of best friend he was . Mrs. Diggs ... two federal marshals ... they opened fire on your husband today . They missed . Next time , he might not be so lucky . [ Sighs ] Help me ... so I can help Eugene . There 's a pay phone . He calls me . [ Sydney ] I have never been so afraid , Dr. Shafton . Is this about Mr. Raines ? [ Exhales ] Everywhere he goes ... everything he touches ... dishonesty , malice . Well , why haven 't you confronted him ? Raines is a dangerous man . He may be involved with the murder of Miss Parker 's mother . And that accident that put my brother in the coma ? It may not have been an accident at all . [ Scoffs ] Now ... You 're making excuses , Sydney . I fantasize about killing ... killing him . Now we 've got less than 48 hours ... before the grand jury convenes . I want Diggs back where he belongs ... ready to testify . I have to find him . Why ? So you can put a bullet through his head ? - He 's a fugitive . - He 's a kid . - He reached for a gun . - That 's a lie , and you know it . Why is this case so personal to you ? I checked the file . There 's no connection between you and Diggs . What happened the night thatJimmy Rayford died ? It was my fault . That 's what happened . I went up into the cockpit to call in a report . Next thing I know , cabin pressure 's gone ... and Garrison 's layin 'there all cut up . Lane ! Help me ! Bob Garrison gave me my break into the marshals , and I let him down . He 's not just my boss . He 's my friend . We found him , Sydney . We found him on the sublevel elevator goin 'down . You can 't escape from there . I wasn 't trying to escape . I was trying to find my friend . [ Sighs ] Jarod . I just know , if I saw him once , I know he 'd be my friend . I don 't have the authority . I 'm just tired of being alone ... tired of not having anybody to talk to . If I had a friend , I 'd do anything for him . [ Garrison On Videotape ] Come on , Jimmy . We 've been talking here for 15 hours . [ Rayford On Videotape ] If I cut a deal with you guys ... you gotta promise me Eugene 's gonna be okay . He didn 't know anything . I got him into this . I gotta do right by him , you know ? I 'll take the prison time . You just gotta protect Eugene from the Colombians . He 's my friend . [ Young Jarod 's Voice ] If I had a friend , I 'd do anything for him . So , Agent Cody , is this your idea of a bribe ? Now why would I want to bribe you ? Because you think I 've been talking to Eugene . - I do wanna talk to you about the case . - Talk . I got a copy ofJimmy Rayford 's confession . How the hell did you get that ? I pretended to be a federal prosecutor assigned to the case . I 'm kidding . Garrison had it . So ? So , Jimmy Rayford asked for a tougher sentence from the U.S. Attorney ... with the condition that Eugene got a Witness Protection Program . - Eugene got it , correct ? - Yeah . So why would Jimmy Rayford attack a U.S. Marshal ... and jump out of an airplane if he had what he wanted ? Have you ever spent any time in a federal prison ? - Some . - So then you know it 's ... it 's no Club Med . So you 're saying thatJimmy Rayford ran ... because he wanted to avoid jail time . That doesn 't make sense . Well , tell that to Garrison . He 's the one who took 75 stitches in the back . [ Exhales ] [ Videocassette Engages ] Agent Lane had gone to the forward cabin to radio ahead . The prisoner asked to use the restroom . Once we were in the rear of the plane , he bent to tie his shoe ... and retrieved a homemade knife from his sock . He reached up from a bent position and lunged at me . Lunged at me . And lunged at me . I made a defensive move , but he caught me in the back with a downward movement . Caught me in the back with a downward movement . Caught me in the back with a downward movement . You can see the point of impact from the cut in my shirt . I went down immediately , and that 's when the prisoner escaped . Reached up from a bent position and lunged at me . I made a defensive move , but he caught me in the back with a downward movement . You can see the point of impact from the cut in my shirt . I went down immediately , and that 's when the prisoner escaped . This is a terrible tragedy for the entire Marshal 's Service . Well , Garrison , looks like you stabbed yourself in the back this time . [ No Audible Dialogue ] Are you sure nobody 's been monitoring your terminal ? [ Exhales ] As sure as anything gets around here . Uh , I disconnected the link from the Centre mainframe . This baby , uh , should be flying solo . [ Keyboarding ] Are those the same clothes you were wearing yesterday ? Oh . Yeah . I 've been running faces against the D.M.V. files across the country ... for , like , the last 16 hours , and ... [ Clears Throat ] I came up with Dara Landers ... 32 , lives in suburban Milwaukee . - Address ? - [ Clears Throat ] Oh . I , uh , hope this helps you find the truth you 're looking for . Thank you . And take a bath , would you , Broots ? Mm . - [ Country ] - [ Jarod ] Try to keep him calm . [ Rings ] - Helen . - Eugene . I want you to come home , baby . I miss you so much . This doesn 't make much sense anymore . Listen , I know . But I can 't trust these people anymore . They tried to kill me , Helen . If they even knew where I was ... if they even knew ... we 'd never see each other again . - Eugene , they might already know . - Why ? What are you talkin ' about ? - You didn 't tell ' em about me callin ' you ? - I 'm sorry , honey . You told ' em I called you ? Why ? 'Cause I 'm afraid . That 's ... You sold me out , girl . I cannot believe you did that to me , Helen . You just sold me out . But we can trustJarod . [ Line Clicks ] I shouldn 't have done this . He 's scared , and I don 't know where he 's gonna go . He 's gonna go where he feels safe ... like maybe a honeymoon motel . Sydney . Would you tell me more about these ... violent fantasies you 've been having ? I think about what Raines did . Take Angelo . Angelo was my project ... very special . That is until Raines twisted him into something else . When I think of all the innocent minds he has destroyed . Can 't you solicit help from someone from the Centre ... the director ? I cannot trust her . I cannot trust anyone of authority at the Centre . What about Miss Parker ? She digs into matters she shouldn 't . I 've warned her several times , but she won 't listen to me . How does that make you feel ? Angry ! Helpless ! What else ? What else , Sydney ? I can 't take much more . [ Footsteps ] [ Door Opens ] - It 's me . It 's Jarod . - You almost got me killed , Jarod . I had nothing to do with that . I promise you . Yeah , well , your last promise nearly got my head blown off , man . Look , I understand why you feel that way . But you have to trust me . You people can 't protect me , so I don 't need you anymore . I don 't need anybody anymore . Well , there 's somebody that really needs you . [ Switch Clicks ] You shouldn 't have told him . You should 've trusted me ... the way I trusted you , the way I trusted Jimmy . - I 'm sorry . I was afraid , honey . - So you bring him here ? No . No , he 's not like the others . You can believe him . I swear . I swear . Oh . [ Crying ] Welcome home . What the hell are you doin ' , Jarod ? You move without me ? You put a civilian into a volatile situation ? You issued a challenge , sir . I took it . What 's important is Eugene is here , and he 's still your witness . Now , tomorrow morning , we get on that plane , and we take down the cartel . Yeah ? Well , he moves first thing in the mornin ' . You got that ? Bring in the wife ... smart move . When you 're on the run , people you love ... people you miss ... they 're the most important things to you . [ Latino Man On Phone ] What the hell are we paying you for ? You don 't come cheap , Marshal . Both of these witnesses should have been taken care ofby now . My client is pleased aboutJimmy Rayford ... but Diggs was never supposed to be brought in alive . Well , there were some unforeseen complications there . [ Latino Man ] It doesn 't matter . That plane will land ... but it will be in a million pieces when it does . [ Garrison ] That 's what this remote control is for , right ? It will disable the electrical system . - Whatever you say . - [ Beep ] [ Doorbell Rings ] Hello . I 'm looking for Dara Landers . I thought one day you might come . - Might come ? - You 're Dara 's sister , aren 't you ? - Her sister ? - You look just like the woman who gave Dara up for adoption . Her name was Catherine . - Parker . - I 'm not sure . The lawyer was the only one who knew her last name . May I speak with Dara ? I assumed you knew . Dara passed away two months ago . Dara was a gifted child . She graduated college at 17 . She loved the theater , playing the different roles . Even when she was a little girl ... she would make up an entire world ... and then lose herself in it . She seemed to have a very happy life . We wanted to give her the best ... that any child could possibly have . The lawyer who arranged the adoption ... do you know his name ? Steinman . Mm , no . Uh , " berg . " Steinberg . Michael Steinberg . Yes . - Do you know where I might find him ? - I 'm sorry . He moved away without a word . Um , I think it was back in ' 82 . - And you had no further contact with my mother ? - No . No , but I remember that Mr. Steinberg said ... she had a dream of moving to Europe ... of giving her little daughter a better life . That must have been you . If I may ask ... how did Dara ... Surgery . Removing her appendix . One minute , she was just fine . And the next minute ... What 's this ? Oh , uh , Dara had it when ... when your mother brought her to us . You can have it if you like . We wanted all of Dara 's friends to have a memento . Thank you . [ Phone Rings ] - Jarod here . - It 's Helen . - l-I 'm worried about Eugene . - Helen , don 't worry . There is no way that Eugene is getting on that plane . Garrison and Lane just took him . They 're flying him tonight . [ Beeping ] - Looks like someone 's entered the cargo area . - [ Beeping Stops ] [ Beeps ] Boss , somethin 's up . The pilot just buzzed me . He got a warning light . Someone may have accessed the plane . Where ? [ Clattering ] Heads up , Lane . See anything ? There 's nobody down there , but there 's a panel open . - Where 's the access hatch ? - It 's in the back . - You stay here . - No . I 'm comin ' with you . You remember what happened the last time . You didn 't know when to let go , kid . What 's goin ' on ? Everything 's fine . Stay in your seats . Thank you . Give me your piece . Give me your piece , boy ! That-a-boy . Is this what happened toJimmy Rayford ? You just dump him at 30,000 feet because he was gonna tell the truth ? The truth don 't pay as well as it used to . Now , I push this button ... two minutes later , this plane becomes a fireball ... spread all over the Oklahoma countryside . [ Struggling , Grunting ] Wait here . Good move , partner . [ Gasps ] Why ? [ Out Of Breath ] Economics . There 's no money defending theJimmy Rayfords of the world . Grab the parachute . Take the remote . Here . No . Here . Bitch . [ Gasping ] Bitch . See , Jarod ? Friends will burn you every time . [ Grunts ] - [ Beeping ] - No ! [ Airplane Losing Altitude ] Electrical systems out ! Go to reserve ! Mayday ! Mayday ! This is U.S. Marshal Flight 1701 . We 've lost flight control . I repeat . We 've lost flight control . Cover her . - Jarod . - Garrison and Michaels are working together . - I 'll explain later . - What are you gonna do ? Tell the pilot to get ready to pull up hard . We 've got one minute tops ! - [ Alarm Beeping ] - We 've got 30 seconds ! You got 30 seconds , Jarod . Fifteen seconds ! [ Lane ] We got 15 seconds . ! - Yes ! - [ Laughs ] All right . [ Exhales ] Well . I always knew that would come in handy . [ Exhales ] Well , looks like we finally got the shackles on the right person . [ Hushed ] Miss Parker . - I 'm packing in the search . I 'm out of it . - Why ? I got results on some of the other names from your mother 's files . - Most of them are dead . - Don 't you fall apart on me now , Broots . No . You don 't understand . They died of sudden , unexplained illnesses ... all within the last six months . - Oh , my God . - Yes . - This is bad . This is ... very ... - [ Shuffling , Squeaking ] - I gotta go . - [ Cell Phone Beeps ] You look upset , Mr. Broots . Is everything all right ? [ Clears Throat ] Tracking Jarod is a full-time job , sir . And you 've been putting in long hours . I 'm distressed to discover that you took your computer off the network . [ Wheezing ] It makes me wonder ... if your loyalties are to this mission ... or some personal endeavor . l-I don 't have any personal endeavors . Perhaps I should reacquaint you ... with the consequences of lying to the Centre . [ Wheezing ] Broots 's actions are under my authority . Then I should hold you responsible for the lack of results . You can do whatever you like ... but we won 't get any results until you get out of my way . I have business to attend to . We 'll discuss this further at another time . You know where to find me . Jarod has expressed his inability ... to complete the simulation without another Pretender . As a result , I 've convinced a colleague to establish new parameters ... for the Pretender program . Jarod . There 's someone I want you to meet . Jarod , this is Kyle . Kyle , Jarod . - Hi . - Hi . Where did they take you , Kyle ? [ Locking Case ] [ Door Slides Shut ] He buried ' em , Jarod . You should 've been there . - [ Jarod ] All right . - Good luck to you . Thank you . So , you two are finally gonna start your new life together . - Thank you , Jarod . - So , who are we gonna be ? Don 't worry . Nobody 's ever gonna find you . I have experience with this sort of thing . You 're the marshal . Well , not really . - Actually , today , I think I 'll be a chef . - [ Engine Starts ] [ Screaming , Cheering ] [ Chattering ] [ Woman ] Hey , cowboy . What 's your secret ingredient ? Well , now , if I told you that , it wouldn 't be no secret . Here you go , little lady . Enjoy . [ Mews ]

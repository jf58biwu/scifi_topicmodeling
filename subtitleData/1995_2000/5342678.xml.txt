 Move ! I want to see a weapon here and a weapon there ! Sergeant , split your squad ! Set your weapons for close range . Laser sight interlock engaged . You ready to seal the room ? System 's armed , sir . Ready on your order . Prepare to seal the room on my count . 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ... Attention all personnel ... .. the room is sealed . I repeat , the room is sealed . Control two to building commander ... I 'm showing an intrusion beyond perimeter three . Moving to check it out . Sector perimeter three , scanning ... I see it . Opening fire now . Nabel , this thing 's been spotted and targeted already . Frankly , I was expecting more . The company 's expecting much more . Mr. Saggs , if you 'll just be patient ... Must have missed ! Holly molly , I 'm taking shots here . I 'm hit , I 'm hit ... AAV 13 , do you copy ? We just lost contact with command post three outside the second perimeter . This is command to chopper 4 we lost contact with post three . Can you drop them some temporary communications gear ? Screw that , command ! You didn 't lose contact , you lost them . Over . I 'm putting rockets in that area , hear me ? Over . Check your goddamn screens ! Where is he , Nabel ? Heading this way , Mr. Saggs . He 's on his way . Move the armored personnel carriers and hopscotch from the east sector to the west ! And keep them moving ! Lost the dual sensors ! What the hell is that ? Air 4 , what the hell is going on out there ? What are those explosions ? How many of these things are there ? We 're eating it bad ! One . Repeat , one ! We took a hit hit bad ! Jesus ! Alright everybody , stay cool . Holly shit ! It 's right outside ! Stay cool . Stay at your work stations . - Do it ! - Open fire ! Hold your position ! Hold your position , damn it ... This exercise has concluded . Security stand down . How many people know about this ? I 'm the only one with the complete picture , Mr. Saggs . I split development between divisions , different planets ... That 's why it cost so much . Yeah , it was expensive . But you know , Nabel , with enough of these we could take over the world ! Which world ? Earth , Nabel ! The government 's been hanging by a thread for years . I mean , with a hundred of these ... How many we got ? Five thousand . You astonish me ! A particle weapon . There 's nobody within five years of having anything even remotely like it . Now ... This thing turns them on and off . You want to activate them , you just click here and give them your objectives . Here ... I assigned your voice primary command authority . Nabel , you 're a genius ! I 'm proud of you ! The company will be very proud of you ! If circumstances only permitted I would greenlight one great hellacious bonus for you and a promotion right on the spot . But with our objective on Earth you can see how that precludes it . I see ... Well I know you would , Nabel ... I mean , after all , you are a genius . Of course this all has to be ... deniable . From which you can unfortunately infer that you , too ... Have to be deniable . Destroy Dr. Nabel . - No ! No ! This is heavy freight PKF 946 requesting clearance in the Inter Pork docks . PKF , reduce speed to 1500 and contact your corporate controller on the designated frequency . This is John Canyon inbound from Mars City calling Inter Pork . I 've got 147 trailers of Mars ' finest genetically squared jacked up hogs which , naturally , I want to dump as soon as possible . You got dock open ? Canyon , this is Keller at Inter Pork packers dispatch . You 're two day past due ! Check out my regrets , pal . Do you want these hogs or not , Mr. Keller ? You get them into C Dock , Canyon ! Park your load and park your mouth ! Bitchin ' Betty , I 'm checking on the cargo . As you wish , freight driver . Magnetic floor activated . How you all doing , huh ? You like that don 't you , huh ? Everybody happy ? So ... where 's my beer and when do I get paid ? You can unhook your rig , Canyon . Stop by the office in half an hour I 'll cut you a check . I 'll unhook when I got my money , no offense . You know that 's not company policy . Yeah , I know that . That 's why it 's my policy not to unhook until I 'm paid . You are late ! Plenty late ! You want I apologize ? I got the hogs here in good shape . I did it as quick as I could . You knew my rig was slow and you hired me for the job . I 've taken that into consideration . And that 's the reason I 'm willing to offer you 1,500 credits . No , no ... you owe me 6,000 ! You don 't seem to get it that I 've only offered you the 1,500 out of impulsive generosity ! I think it 's time for you to leave ! You 're upsetting my pigs . Alright , Jackie ... Go get him , Jackie ! My pleasure ... No no no , Jackie . That 's not the way to throw a punch in zero gravity . See , this is the recommended technique ... Shit ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ? You 're gonna depressurize the area and kill us all ! Canyon , these hogs are company property ! They belong to me until you pay me ! Now get the hell off my rig ! I 'm gonna get a court order , you hear me ? You 'll forfeit your right of any payment ! Yeah , yeah , yeah ... - Do you hear me ? Hey Cindy . Hi , John . Gone only four weeks this time , huh ? Yeah . I got lucky . I picked up a load of square pigs on Mars . Who is this ? My name is Mike Pucci . Let 's not get ahead of ourselves . You are a space trucker , kid ? Not yet . He 's taking a solo today . - Oh yeah ? Hey Habib , give me a synthburger well done and a side of sham fries . What kind of rig you driving ? Pachyderm 2000 . Pachyderm ? Right ... So you 've been driving for a while I guess . It 's hard to beat that old iron , kid . Student Mike Pucci report to area T. That 's me . Wish me luck , Cindy . Good luck , Mike See you . Who 's the kid ? To you I mean . The customer , like you . I didn 't always use to be just a customer , huh ? - Hey ... - Sorry , new rules ! They 're recycling all leftovers ok ? Of all the cheap bullshit ... I don 't like it any better than you do but I can 't afford to get fired especially now . What 's going on ? Well ... you know my mother 's on Earth , right ? Maybe you mentioned it , yeah . She 's gonna have an operation and it 's really serious and I promised that I 'll be there with her . Oh that 's rough , I 'm sorry . So when are you leaving ? Leaving ! ? You know what a ticket costs ... I 'd have to pull double shifts here for over a year to earn my way out of here . - Let me ask around , see what I can come up with . You are a good man , John but you are not a company man . They only give Earth funds to company people and not of them has the balls to risk taking me . God , what I wouldn 't give ... You know what I want . Yeah . How many times I proposed you ? Three ? I think you left out a few . Last couple of times you were pretty loaded . Tell you what ... You agree to marry me ... I 'll get you to Earth ! - Cindy ! - Yeah right ! It 's a deal then , huh ? John , you get me to Earth and if you still want to marry me when we get there I 'll do it ! Alright , alright ! I 'm gonna get back to work , okay ? Right . Sonic pick . Cool , man . - Yeah ! - Shhh ! Get the tow truck ready . I 'll unhook the load and meet you there . - OK . Hey , John . - Oh , hi ! - Still working independent , John ? I still own my own rig , pick my own loads and don 't sell ad space on my tits if that 's what you 're talking about . You 're back for Kev 's funeral ? Oh , I didn 't hear . He and his load got into the scum cluster . Not much of either came out . Oh . Hijackers killed him , huh ? And then some . Who do you think got him ? Word is that captain Macanudo stumbled on him . That guy 's a damn depraved animal . Captured Kevin 's load ... All they sent back was his dick . Using a tennis ball can for a coffin . Cremation would 've had more dignity if you ask me . Anyways , John , we 're planning on having a wake after the service . Hey John ... You hauled Inter Pork hogs ? Yeah , they 're my hogs until I get paid for ' em . Would you look at that ! Some piece of garbage wrapped in human skin is trying to jack my load ! Yeah ? You wanted to see me , Mr. Keller ? Yeah . I understand you just graduated from space truck school . Yeah ! I need someone to push a shipment of square hogs to Little Chicago on Titan . Square pigs ? Isn 't that John Canyon 's load ? It 's an Inter Pork load . I fired Canyon yesterday . You got a feeling about that one way or the other ? No . No , I barely know the guy . Good . Cause there 's about 1,500 out of work freight pushers here who want that job . Yeah , well , I 'm the best . Your potential is frightening . You want the job ? I 'll take it . Pick up your pink probationary coveralls from Ammoson Supply . See you keep them clean ! Pink , huh ? They 're pink . Hey Mike , congratulations ! Thanks . John ! Mike got himself a new job . Well , normally we 'd have some kind of blowout for that but I see from your pajamas who you 're working for . Which is nothing to celebrate . John , not everyone can be independent . Not everyone can drive their own rig , babe . John , I 'm sorry about you losing your job , okay ? This is my only shot . I 'm out of money , I 'm out of credit . Somebody 's gotta get these pigs to Titan . You took a fearless world of inventory , kid and then you took my job ? Well , if you can live with that , great ! But I don 't have to ! Now you hump yourself down at the other end of the ball ... Look , I treat you with respect . I 'm asking you do the same here . - Keller 's here ! Hey look , kid ! Your boss brought the circus with him ! We 've come to pay our respects . The circus ! A pair of trained turds , right here ! He 's just blowing steam , Mr. Keller . This Kev thing 's got people upset . Slam your teeth , Delia ! I want you off this hub , Canyon ! Oh , I 'd like to oblige you ... If you 'd paid me , I 'd be gone by now . We fueled your rig . Now move your ass down there and off of this station ! I don 't work for you ! Ok ! What ? Somebody say something ? Huh ? You don 't mess with me , Canyon ! And you never ever mess with the company ! Now hold on , Mr. Keller ... The man 's within his rights here . Step off , kid . Kid 's a real space lawyer ! Get the hell away from me , Canyon ! Mel , Jackie , do something ! Jackie , do something ! Warning , hull breach ! Decompression occurring . Evacuate the area ! My god ! Somebody help me ! Help me , please ! Jack , come on ! Grab him ! No , Cindy , get out of here ! Cindy , get out ! Save her ! Give me your hand ! Come on ! Come on ! It 's the wrong door . Get in now ! John , it 's the wrong door ! Get out ! What are you doing ? John , close it . - This is occupied ! Nice lady . Come on in the cubicle , both of you . Alright , check the stalls ! Get out ! What are you doing ? Get out ! This is occupied ! This wouldn 't be strictly a social call , would it ? It 's always a pleasure to see you , Mr. Zesty . I need to get off the hub . I need a load . It 's problematic , John . Problematic . There are people who would like to see you put down like a diseased dog . Powerful people . How about I recite all the times that I helped you out ? This and that ... Here and there ... An appeal to my sentimental side ? Yeah . I shall open my heart at once ! I do have something . Something unpleasant I fear . We 'll take it . I 'm his partner . Says who ? What ? You 're saying I 'm not ? I lost one job because of you . You owe me ! I stay here , they 're gonna mount my ass on the board ! You are a passenger , not a partner . So what 've you got , Mr. Zesty ? It is a rush shipment to Earth . Two day schedule . Containers to be left in high orbit on arrival . He said Earth . We 'll do it . What 's the cargo ? The manifest states ... Extruded polymer sexual surrogates . Sex dolls ? They 're paying five times the going rate . And providing all the paperwork , forged of course . But undetectable . I said ... done . I hesitate to caution a man of your experience but the consigners of this cargo were most emphatic that their delivery schedule be adhered to ! And don 't temper with those containers ! Is this gonna take long ? There 's troopers all over the place . No , I 'm almost done . Do you see her coming ? No . You think the law grabbed her ? No , she 'll make it . I like her . She 's friendly . Yeah , she 's got a kindly nature . You mind if I ask you what the deal is with Cindy ? I don 't get you . I think she likes me . I 'd like to pursue it further . I 'd like to know if you 're involved . If I get your drift , and I do get your drift I must tell you that a gentleman , Mike a gentleman doesn 't answer a question like that . That 's a no ? Sorry , I 'm late . I had to give them the 30 seconds notice . Here , help me out . It 's all right . Geez , my underwear . I haven 't seen this before . Is this a friend of yours ? Actually that 's my mother Carol . It was taken before I was born . I can see where you got your good looks from . Thanks . Wouldn 't mind meeting her back then , huh ? - Yeah ? Yeah . Here we go . There ! Jeez , I 've never seen trailers like these before . They look ... - Creepy . They look like they 've come a long ways already . What do you think is in them , John ? I don 't . Something very creepy ! At maximum velocity we 're still gonna be 60 hours the wrong side of the delivery time . If we stay in the shipping lane . John , you wanna fill me in on your plans here ? I don 't ask you yours . Look ... We 're all in this together , okay ? I think you owe me and Cindy the courtesy of an answer here . All systems functional . Pressure within acceptable ranges . Electronic subsystems testing . John , look , the minute we pull outta here the transport troopers are gonna be all over us . Do you get that ? Now you 're just gonna have to learn to live with your fear . If it gets too bad , breathe into a paper bag or something but shut up ! Collar yourself ! You better power down , Canyon ! I 'm sorry , boys , I got a priority load of perishable goods here . It 's not a request ! We got questions about Keller . Last time I saw him he was being sucked ass first into the outer darkness . John , I think these guys are getting serious . We better stop . Yeah ! Not while I still have an option open . All units converge ! Abandon pursuit . Repeat , do not pursue . We can get them , damn it ! The orders are to abandon pursuit ! I love taking orders . Looks like we lost ' em . More like they stopped chasing us . That was some of the best driving I 've ever seen . Oh thank you . Just put the pedal to the metal and play footsie with fate , son . Breakfast is ready . Turn your cortexes on up there . Food 's ready . Mike , Cindy ... Come on . We on time ? We will be . We left the space lanes . About six hours ago . What is this ? Saliva activated cappuccino and eggs . Don 't you like it ? What the hell is that ? Some kind of floating junkyard ? Welcome to the scum cluster . What the hell happened to them ? Asteroids got some of them . Asteroids ? Where are they ? Where are they ? Yeah , where are they ? Warning ! Density 10 asteroid field . Freight driver ... You 're approaching too fast for evasive maneuvers . Don 't make me turn you off , Betty . John , this shows a big cluster coming straight ahead . I don 't see anything . It 's got to be a malfunction , right ? It 's black rock ! - What ? - Strap yourselves in ! I think we 're clear . I 've never been so afraid in my life . Look out ! Ok . Cindy ? Yeah . Mike ? Yeah . I 'm going for some light . How bad do you think it is ? It felt bad . Sure did . Betty , confirm what I 'm seeing here . Freight driver , main and secondary engines are down due to pressure constriction of components in direction control ... Thanks , Betty . ... and internal coolant system has also shut down . You 're welcome , freight driver . No chance for a fix ? Sure . After a five hour cool down . We 'll roast in here before then . It 's getting hot in here . Yeah , I figure we got about two hours before we burn up . Escape pod is no good . Too far away from the nearest colony to make it . Anyway , it only holds two . So what 's that mean ? We 're gonna die ? There 's always a chance that our emergency locator beacons will draw somebody before that happens . Somebody ? What do you mean somebody ? John ! ? Sure ... There 's always a chance , baby . Always a chance . We got a little juice left in the parking rocket . If we can cut the load loose we should be able to put ourselves in the shadow of one of them asteroids . Yeah , that 'd give us enough time to fix the main engines . Let 's go . It 's a one man job . Be careful . You were born on Earth , weren 't you , Cindy ? Yeah , New York City . That 's technically a part of Earth . Earth ... I 've always dreamed about going to that place . That 's great . You know ... birds , trees ... Those things living in the rivers ... Yeah , fish . My mother used to take me to see them a couple of times . Earth is an amazing place . It 's so hot . Yeah . Do you mind ? No . I 'll do the same . I feel so much better . John , how you doing out there buddy ? There 's some kind of automatic seal deal here . I 'm gonna have to try cracking it off . Alright , you do that . Let me know if I can help you out , okay ? Mike , we gotta stop . Wait ... wait . Stuff like this happens all the time . We got to realize one thing I 'm engaged . What ? It started out as a joke . John asked me to marry him and I said sure , if you take me to Earth . That 's total bullshit ! A promise is a promise , okay ? John 's a good man . I don 't have to justify myself to you or to anybody ... We gotta stop . I 'm sorry . This here is not gonna work . It 's awfully warm in here . It 's awfully hot in here , isn 't it ? So ... let 's take her clothes off , be more comfortable , huh ? ! Right ? Yeah . Would that have been your idea ? Yeah it was my idea . So what ? Well I think it 's a pretty cheesy way to get a look at my fiance 's tits . Knock it off , John . Look , that 's not what 's going on here , John , at all ! I got to hand it to you , Mike . King of the smooth dogs . " Oh , it 's hot in here ... " " Your husband 's outside ... " - We 're not married , alright ? - You know what I think of a guy ... who forces a girl to marry him in exchange for giving her a lift ? I 'd like to know what you think ... Hey , hey , stop it ... Stop fighting over a girl ! There 's gonna be two scoops of ashes in about two hours , alright ? We 're gonna die here , ok ? Why don 't we try for a little dignity for a change ? I can 't unhook the load . There 's some kind of an auto defense mechanism on the containers . Whatever 's in them , it ain 't no sex dolls . A plastic date doesn 't need that kind of protection . Yeah , tell me about it . So what are we gonna do now ? Why don 't we divert the coolants from the refrigerator through the inside plumbing ? That 's a great idea . It would give us something to do anyways . The Pachyderm 2000 rig ... It don 't have a refrigerator . Why the hell not ? Because it 's an option . I don 't buy options , you know ? Like ... it 's either suede seats or half tinted four port , or ... silent suck toilets . I don 't buy options . Great . But I did bring this . Suck a ZOX . Well , at least we got some notice . It gives us time to prepare ourselves for the end . However you do that . Attention , freight driver ! We 've been approached by an oligarch class passenger liner . Passenger liner . We 're being saved . There 's likely gonna be some conditions attached to that . Liner identified as former vessel A7-N843 . Vanished 10-24-92 . It didn 't vanish . It was jacked . These are the jackers , man . If it 's who I think it is boy are you lucky you 're not wearing those company pajamas . Move out , come on . Let 's go . Come on , hurry up . Get that hatch open ! Come on ! John , how many guns you got ? I 'm not even sure this one works . They 'll be in here in a minute ... If you 're not gonna use it give it to me . I 'll use it ! You 're gonna make one of them desperate last stands ? Look , set aside what this scum might have in mind for us what do you think they 're gonna do to her , huh ? Mike , there 's not a lot we can do . We just hope that our cooperative attitudes and our sunny disposition see us clear . What did you have in mind , Mike ? We hold them off as long as we can and then ... What ? I 'll save two shots for the both of us . Oh , great ... yeah . Can you put that thing away someplace safe , ok ? We 're not gonna let them take us ! Give me the gun ! Mike , I gotta go to Earth , okay ? So if I got to wait through neck-deep crap , I 'm still going ! Everybody , come on , move ! We don 't work for the company , remember that ! We 're friendly , friendly . Drop it ! We don 't work for the company . Over to the control panel ! Move it , now ! We 're going , we 're going . You 're all prisoners of the Regalia , if anyone 's curious . If you try to escape , you will be killed ! If you resist , you will be killed ! If you fail to obey orders , you will be killed ! Ah , what the hell we 'll probably kill you anyway . Alright , get them out of here ! Come on . Move it ! Get out ! Move ' em out ! Come on . - We don 't work for the company Move it ! Sorry . Come on . Stay with me ! Look at that , huh ! ? Salvage specialist . Shut up . What are you hauling ? - We don 't know . - You don 't know ? I 'm telling you that we don 't know . Never cared . It 's a mistake to give up caring . That 's too much . Macanudo wouldn 't like it . You leave the captain to me ! My pleasure . Cutt , man ... Manifest says what they 're carrying is sex dolls . Sex dolls ? What do you think they 're really carrying ? Gotta be something hot . Drugs maybe . You like drugs or guns best , Lou ? I like drugs . I like guns better . - Scummy . - Yeah ? - Hook ' em up . - This way ... Where 's Captain 's equipment ? Over here . Manifest says they 're carrying sex dolls . Thank you for apprising me , Mr. Cutt . Well I do know how you love to be apprised , sir . You have been perspiring . It was about 170 in the cab . I compliment you , my dear . You have a strong , distinctive and not altogether unpleasant body odour . It 's gratifyingly approachable . Captain ... we want to thank you for saving us . We 're real grateful about it , Captain . Thank you . I didn 't save you , you company scumbag . I jacked your load ! Well , whatever , we appreciate it . I think it 's important that you understand we do not work for the company . I want to know what your cargo is who 's the shipper and who 's the consignee ? We don 't know none of that . You 're gonna kick yourself later . If you have trouble to inform yourself . I wouldn 't have to slice off your manly process . Is he talking about my dick ? Captain , we 're just independent contract haulers . We 're trying to make a living . We don 't ask a lot of questions . What we do know is whatever 's in those cars is not something to mess with ! Do I look like someone to mess with ? No , sir . Like I have the IQ of an egg timer ? No . Those are high security double-due containers you 're hauling . I say the pair of you are company butt boys ! Wrong ! If you 're gonna hack off my dick , do it ! And I 'll change my name to Terry or Lee or something neutral . That ain 't gonna change what I know ! Your dick ? Is this your dick ? No . That one 's mine . Ok . I 'm gonna run a proof of Fermat 's last theorem in my head . That takes between 8 and 17 seconds . And then we 'll begin again . Captain 's a genius . Yeah . I was head of company research and development . Top man . Slotted for the big job . I was betrayed by that bastard E.J. Saggs . Fool though he 'd killed me . Made the mistake of having it done in the laboratory . I was able to save myself . Recreate my body . You are a very attractive woman . In the normal course of human affairs you probably wouldn 't look twice at me . Captain , where are we going with this ? I am drawn to beauty like other men . The beauty ... beauty gives me a wide birth in life 's halls , so to speak . Were you not chained to a major support beam of my ship I wouldn 't stand a chance of having sex with someone so alluring as you . Leave her alone you half-electric asshole . He didn 't mean that ! He respects the brave way you confront your disability . Kill him . - Wait ! - Mr. Cutt ... Look , I 've got to get to Earth . I 've got to see my mother . So keep the load and give us the rig , and ... I 'll have sex with you . Really ? Yeah . Right there on the floor if that 's what you want . I think we should prepare to my quarters , my dear . Scummy . John , we gotta do something ! What are we gonna do ? Just sit here ? Don 't corrupt the right to be indignant , kid . She 's my fiance . What would make you more comfortable , my dear ? I have seven different forms of sedation . Alcohol . The usual pharmacology . Let 's not fool ourselves , Captain , alright ? I just want to get this over with . I can accept that . However , I 'm confident that I can make you a favorable impression . I rebuilt my own mind . So you got a homemade brain . I rebuilt everything . Every organ . I emmit a low-amp electrical whang pulse designed to drive women wild with pleasure . Stop , you 're gonna make me puke . Quit talking or the deal 's off , okay ? I pray you allow me a few moments to coordinate my seldom used reproductive sequencer . Yeah , sure . This casing 's made out of some exotic alloy and these security seals , man , they 're something new . I wouldn 't mess with that load . It 's bad . It 'll eat you alive My heart is racing , Mr. Truckman . Ok , Sam ... Hit it ! - God ... - You alright ? That 's a diamond blade that just shattered . What the hell does that ? One of those things . We gotta try something else , Lou Yeah . What the hell is that ? Sam ... Sam ... are you alright ? What 's cooking ? Something 's cooking . What are you talking about ? Smells like somebody 's been making hamburgers . God damn , Sam ! It 's you . It is ? Sam ... What did I tell you ? Shut up ! I gotta tell the captain . John , we gotta do something ! What do you think they 're doing to her up there , huh ? It 's not the first time , kid , and she 's doing it for the team . We 're a hundred percent operational , my dear . Hey , you wanna lose the manlidge or you 're gonna give me a nosebleed . It 's a good luck charm , I never take it off . Just close your eyes and think of Brooklyn . You treacherous bitch ! Nothing personal . You just made the biggest mistake of your life ! Big talk for a guy who can 't get up off his back . You 'll never get off this ship ! Oh yeah ? Watch me ! Mr. Cutt ! There you are , Captain . Lou just went looking for you ... The load ... You want me to leave ... okay . Alright , Captain , ok . Back awfully quick , aren 't you , Captain ? Did she ride you out ? Kill ' em , huh ? What ? What ? Oh , you want to kill them . Absolutely , touchdown . You wanted to cut them down ? You don 't mind if I tenderize them a little bit first ? Scummy . You overblown cretin . Well , aren 't you a regular Mr. Fix-it ? I 'm sorry you couldn 't find it in your heart to give me a chance . You could 've been my beloved concubine ... . ... and shared my position here . Well , I guess it wasn 't in my fortune cookie . Now all you 'll share is my crew 312 of them in random order . But first , you can watch me kill your friends . Or , if you prefer , you can scrunch up your cute little nose and turn other way . Do it , Captain . Captain , did it occur to you that a load with that kind of protection ought to be checked out first thing ? After you , Mr. Cutt . Yes , sir . Right behind you , Lou . Come on , get in there . Oh wow . Oh man ! Holly shit . What the hell is all this junk ? These are my babies . Captain ... State of the art disintegrators , boys . This baby will bake a man in 500 milliseconds and leave his watch and small change lying on the deck . Just what have we got here , sir ? We 've got Saggs , boys . We 've got E.J. Saggs . right by his shriveled little scrotum . A little reprogramming and the company is mine . Ours , if you will . And then I 'll feed Saggs' liver to the ship 's rats . Hey ... look at this . This one 's missing . What ? Damn ! What 's that do , Captain ? Quiet ! It 's coming ! Kill it ! What the hell is going on here ? I don 't know but I bet we 'll get blamed . Let 's get out of here . Bite it deathnut , asshole . Get ready . Let 's go ! Five minutes to complete cool down . We ain 't got five minutes ! Fire it up , will you , Mike ? We made it ! I can 't believe we got out of there . I gotta say I 'm very very happy to be here . God damn I am ! Me too . Of course you always feel that way after a near miss . It wears off . Attention , freight driver there is a breach in the exterior hull of container 1 . Pressure and oxygen loss is total . If we got a vacuumed container , too bad , you know . If the load 's perishable it 's already perished . Yeah , so forget it . Wait a second , does somebody hear something back there that sounds like there 's something back there ? I do . Bitchin ' Betty , take over ! Mike , suit up . Cindy , move over here . Ok , sit here . You watch these gauges . You see a red light come on you shout at me on the radio , okay ? Alright . I will need you to elaborate on your instructions . Bitchin ' Betty , you hold the course toward Earth ! You better keep this , ok ? It 's an SOS . Yeah , that can also be a trap . Light me . There 's a flame in my pocket . Maybe I should get the first aid kit . Forget it . I cauterized the main arteries but I don 't have much time left . What happened back there at the Regalia ? Soldier a warrior activated and did what it 's programmed to do . And what about our cars here ? You know what 's in them ? An army . What ? I made them for the company . Genetically engineered biomechanical super warriors . My babies . You can 't stop them . There 's gotta be some way to shut those bastards off ! We 're doomed I 'm afraid . If I had an anus I 'd probably soil myself . You gotta tell us how to stop these things ! They activate in waves . 1,2,4,8 ... This thing here locks them up . You boys got a use for this ? - He 's gone . - Yeah . For a son of a bitch gamp rapist murderer he died ok . Come on . John ... John ! Do it ! Wow . We should go check it out in there . We need some light in here . I 've got a flashlight . It ain 't exactly made for the space . It 's made for reading under the blanket , isn 't it ? Damn ! This thing doesn 't work until they 're all grown up . Let 's ... get back outside and wait for ' em . Yeah . Come on . Here . John ! Is everything ok back there ? We don 't know yet . I can 't see anything . Isn 't there supposed to be four of them ? Yeah . Where 's the other two ? Cindy , put your space suit on ! They 're headed toward the cab . Do it , John ! Freeze ' em ! Do not damage or destroy your means of transport to Earth ! Do not destroy your means ... It 's programming . They can 't wreck the truck . John , he 's got a Swiss army knife ! Oh shit , I made it mad ! Cooking time estimated 45 seconds . Next time there 's gonna be eight . We 're in a qucik decaying Earth orbit . So when I cut the load loose it 'll drop into the atmosphere and incinerate those mutant guys . I want the two of you to get in the escape pod and get out of here . No , we 'll go with you ! You ain 't being asked . Mike , you drive the pod . So what 's the plan , John ? Well ... I 'm gonna try to free the coupling . Blow it if I have to . And then I 'm gonna ride the rig down . Look , John , the goddamn rig will never make it through the atmosphere . Get serious . Kid , this is a Pachyderm 2000 rig ! It was mine before you were born I know what it 'll do . Now I got something I want to say to both of you . Cindy , I 'm releasing you of all your obligations to marry me right now . Alright ? And I want to apologize for the way I 've done it . It weren 't right . And ... you know , I guess I 've been jealous since I saw the way you two behaved with each other together . Look , John , you don 't have to apologize , really . Well , I don 't do it so well anyway . Probably ' cause you 've never done it before . My advice to you is you take this woman to the church at the first exit off the freeway and you get hitched ! You are a lucky man . Ok ? Alright , partner . Kick butt ! We 're about ready here , John . How is it going buddy ? Oh , it 's hanging by a thread . I 'll have it cut in no time . I can practically kick it apart . No sign of any genetic deal , so ... Go on , get out of here . John , I figure we 'll try for the Palmdale space port . You can bring your rig in there . Yeah , that sounds good . I 'll see you there . Betty , how much time before we hit the atmosphere ? 32 seconds , freight driver . Entering atmosphere . Had enough for you ? Wow , man . There he is . - Look , Mike , is that smoke ? - There 's bound to be smoke ! The shielding will be burning off . Come on , John ! Come on , baby ! - Come on . - He 's getting closer . He 's gonna make it . He 's gonna make it , Cindy . Here he comes . Oh my god . My god , Mike . Hey ... hey ... Hey , look here . You married yet ? Good to see you . We interrupt this program for a special news update . Two space truckers and a waitress have saved the Earth from an invasion from outer space . The three discovered they were carrying an army of robotic warriors sent by persons unknown to conquer our planet . Mom ... I have Mike and John here with me . Oh , just a second . Would you like us to come back when you 're a little more recovered , maybe ? Nah , I 'll be right with you . Sit down . Can we get you anything , Mrs. Welch ? Get this Mike ... call me Carol . Mom ? Mom ! This is Mike . Oh , Mike , yeah , welcome to the family . This is John . Oh yeah ... You are Carol Welch ? Cindy 's your daughter ? This Cindy ? What ? Do I look weird or something ? You look great and beautiful , like the picture that I saw of you , but that picture was taken twenty years back . Could somebody tell me what 's going on here ? You see when I got sick , they offered me a choice . Die or get frozen . Anyway , I got the deep freeze they thawed me , they cured me here I am . They froze you ? Well , there 's a lot of fancy names for it but ... Yeah . I don 't look freezer burnt , do I ? Not from what I can see . Special agent Rigid , I 'm taking charge here ! What do you want ? Pat ' em down . What ? I 'm head of presidential security . We 're securing this room for a presidential visit . The president ? The president of the world is coming here ? Yeah ? - Mr. President , I ... - Ok , Rigid , move along . Shoo ... I 'm president Saggs . And I 'm here to express the gratitude of my administration . And my constituents . All the people of this system . Saggs ? E.J. Saggs ? I thought that the president 's name was Dobey . Dobey is the former president . He resigned last week . Government 's been privatized . High time . We know who you are Saggs , ok ? You sent those things to Earth and you cost us a good rig and you almost got us killed about fifty times , okay ? Take it easy ! You 're talking to the president here . I 'll grant you there 've been mistakes made and there have been lies told . But I assure you , whatever you 've been told I was not aware , and I was not involved . You were not aware , right ! I mean , could it be that some individual in the company just overreached himself ? He sent these things to Earth as a kind of insurance policy in case the merger talks broke down . But I wouldn 't like this sort of rumors to be circulating during the first crucial days of my administration or ever ! No problem . Now ... just so happens there 's a new rig ready to take off and it 's waiting for you there on gantry F. What did you think you could do ? Buy us like a tuna for sandwich ? I 've also arranged to have your mother 's hospital bill taken care of . Now hold on a second ... And for your other troubles maybe this will compensate to some small degree . We didn 't do what we did for money and money doesn 't fix anything , alright ? You have our cooperation and our silence , sir . Oh good . Good ! Well , I must run . Remember now , hush-hush ! Yes , sir . Thanks ... for everything . - Mr. Independent . - What was that about ? - You 're gonna keep this ? - No , we 're not gonna keep it ! We don 't want no part of that money . You know , you guys could really use that money . Getting married and all . Hey , we don 't want that kind of money ! You two don 't get it , do you ? If you don 't take this money and shut up about what happened they 're gonna come after you , and you 'll disappear . Now you got to take it ! We got to take the money ! We got to take this and become company butt boys for the rest of our lives , yeah ? I want to make sure that you understand the facts . You gonna take it , John ? - Are you gonna take it ? - No ! But I don 't want you to end up like me ! God forbid . Somebody fragged Saggs . You know , I think it was us ! Oh , my god . We better get out of here . - Yeah . - Come on . Too bad Saggs blew himself up . Never got to thank him for the new rig . Alright , here we go . I 've never done this before . Any chance I 'll lose my lunch ? You 'll be fine . 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ... We have booster ignition !

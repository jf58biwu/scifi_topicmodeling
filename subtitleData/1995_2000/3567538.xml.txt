 - Previously on The Pretender . - Broots is in the middle of the custody battle . The P.I. was trying to dig up something on his ex . Thanks to you , my daughter hasn 't stopped crying . Tomorrow I send her back to her mother , which is a place she doesn 't wanna go . Mr. Lyle . The freak gets around more than Ed McMahon . - Who is this guy ? - I don 't know . And that 's what scares me . - [ Ice-cream Truck : Jingle ] - [ Child ] Ice cream ! [ Stops ] - Hey , Jarod . - Hey , Kevin . Can I get you the usual ? My mom thinks you should get a medal for gettin ' rid of that other ice-cream man . She says that anybody that would sell drugs to little kids should be put under the jail . - She thought it was funny that 's where you put him . - [ Laughs ] I was happy to help . - Hey , what 's that ? - Magic 8 Ball . - Magic ? - Shake it up , ask it a question , and it tells you the future . - Really ? Can I try it ? - Go for it . Will I ever find my family ? What did it say ? " Better not tell you now . " Hmm . - I 'm standing in front of the federal courthouse ... - [ Sirens Wailing ] in the aftermath of what appears to be the well-executed abduction ... ofkey murder witness Emma Barrett . Eighteen months ago , Barrett , 37 ... witnessed the cold-blooded killing of her son Max ... an innocent bystander caught in the cross fire of a violent shootout ... involving ruthless Yakuza crime boss Sammy Tanaka ... in what federal agents are describing as a preplanned , surgical-type strike . The van carrying Ms. Barrett to testify against Tanaka today ... was the third vehicle in a heavily armed motorcade . The victim will be riding in the third vehicle ... of a heavily armed motorcade . Several witnesses here today say that the scene was unbelievable ... like something out of a movie . Blue smoke grenades were detonated on both sides of the plaza . Colored smoke grenades could be detonated here and here . - Why was this person kidnapped ? - That 's not important . But I need you to continue with the rescue plan . Because the victim is located in a transport vehicle here ... I would suggest a second and third scenario . Automatic weapon fire from behind the building over here ... and a staged auto accident somewhere here . That would leave the transport van vulnerable to assault . The strike on the van today was followed by two other scenarios - automatic gunfire around the courthouse perimeter and a staged car accident - all drawing attention away from the transport van ... containing the State 's key witness . We do have two reported wounded at this point . They are Special Agent Russell Gillson ... and the driver of the van , AgentJeffrey Edwards . - [ Continues Indistinct ] - [ Jarod On Monitor ] It 's still flawed , Sydney . In order for the rescue to succeed ... the van driver will have to die . We 'vejust received information from Memorial Hospital ... that the van driver , AgentJeffrey Edwards , has died . Edwards was 35 years old and is survived by a wife and two young sons . - [ TVClicks Off ] - [ Recording Rewinds ] The van driver will have to die . - Oh , my God . - The van driver will have to die . What have I done ? I killed a man today , Sydney . I killed him as if I 'd pulled the trigger myself . - Jarod - - Simulation 2578 . You told me it was a rescue scenario . Then I see it used in the killing of a federal agent ... and the abduction of an innocent woman . The Centre is not in the abduction business . - You tell that to Emma Barrett . It 's Lyle , isn 't it ? - What are you talking about ? - I 'm talking about lies . - [ Slams Phone ] I 'm talking about how innocent people have died because of the way you use my simulations . You used me ! Well , no one is going to die anymore . If it 's a war the Centre wants , it 's what you will get . But I promise you , Emma Barrett will not be the next casualty . [ Dial Tone ] [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Mr. Parker ] Something on your mind ? We just received a phone call from Jarod . Calling to turn himself in , I hope . He claims that the Centre 's involved in the abduction of a key witness ... who saw her 10-year-old son murdered . - Who did the killing ? - A Yakuza crime boss - Sammy Tanaka . - Sounds dangerous . - Jarod claims that the abduction was based ... on a simulation he created just before he escaped the Centre ... but I assured him that the Centre isn 't involved . That may have been a mistake . Don 't tell me the Centre is now slumming ... with any criminal that waves enough green ? Well , it 's not the same now that Mr. Lyle is - Mr. Lyle . Then stop him . We 'll stop him . Daddy , you helped build this place . You cared about what it stood for . How can you just turn your back on that like it never existed ? Things were just different then . Maybe it 's time for a younger lion to roar . Mm . - [ Sound Of Gunfire ] - [ Man 's Voice ] Shots Fired . ! Shots fired . ! [ Jarod 's Voice , Echoing ] A series of diversions . A staged auto accident . - [ Gunfire Continues ] - Shots fired . ! Shots fired . ! - [ Jarod 's Voice ] Automatic weapon fire . - [ Man 's Voice ] I 'm hit . ! Colored smoke grenades could be detonated . ... leave the van vulnerable to attack . - [ Sounds Of Gunfire Continue ] - [ Man # 2 ] They 've got Barrett . ! They 've got Barrett . ! - Mr. Darrow ? Jessica Kline . - Call meJarod . The D.O.J. ' s office in Washington called and said you 'd be coming in . I didn 't realize it would be so soon . There 's a lot of work to be done . I know most of the attorneys in the D.C. office . - How long have you been assigned there ? - I just started today . Stepped right in the middle of it , didn 't you ? This has Sammy Tanaka and the Yakuza written all over it . - You represent Emma Barrett . - Yes . Ms. Barrett has been through so much - the loss ofher son ... and , for over a year , that woman has lived in fear and isolation . And now this . - [ Chattering ] - [ Siren Approaching ] Why has the case taken so long ? You 've read the folder on Sammy Tanaka . D.O.J. ' s been trying to nail him for 10 years . The honchos in Washington wanna make sure we 've got our act together ... before this case sees the inside of a courtroom . - Would you like to question the agent involved ? - [ Detector Beeping ] Very much . - What else can you tell me about the shooter ? - He was Caucasian ... white hair , about 35 . - What about the others ? - I didn 't get a good look . No . The eyebrows were thicker . That 's it . Russell . How you feeling ? I 'm so sorry , Ms. Kline . This is Agent Russell Gillson . Jarod is another lawyer from D.O.J. David Chase , field agent , F.B.I. Agent Chase . Agent Gillson . I was wondering if I might ask you some questions about the Emma Barrett abduction . It all happened so fast . It was kind of a blur . You told the police there were three gunmen . Yes , sir . They were carrying automatic weapons - Asian make , I think . I just wish I could 've gotten off a few more rounds . - You were able to return fire ? - Yes , ma 'am , but it was too late . By then , Jeff - Agent Edwards was shot . The service teaches you to detach yourself emotionally , but , the truth is ... I 'll never forget the look on his face while he was dying . [ Man ] All right , let 's go , Tanaka . - [ People Chattering ] - [ Kline ] Speak of the devil . [ Gillson ] Tanaka 's killed one too many this time . [ Man ] Move it on . Let 's go . Well , thank you for your time . - Take care of your shoulder . - Yes , sir . [ Mr. Lyle ] No . Sir , the deal is progressing as designed . Yes , if things continue as planned ... the Centre can expect a significant deposit in 48 hours . Yes , sir . I understand the delicate nature of this particular operation . And I personally assure you success . Adieu . Those vertical pieces of glass behind you are called doors . Polite people knock before they open them . Why is the Centre doing business with drug dealers and murderers ? - You 'll have to be more specific . - Sammy Tanaka . Why weren 't we informed about the abduction of Emma Barrett ? - I don 't know the woman . - You 're a liar . - Is he taking steroids ? - We know about your corruption of Simulation 2578 . You two have been busy . I decided to expand the Centre 's scope of operation . Beyond that , I can 't discuss it . Security reasons . Jarod will take the use of his simulation as a personal attack . That sounds like a threat . To involveJarod as an accessory to murder and kidnapping - that is asking for retribution the likes of which you can 't even imagine . I 'll take that under advisement . You don 't have to knock when you leave . [ Chattering ] Well - [ Clears Throat ] that was pretty terrible . What are you complaining about ? You got what you wanted . - You got the kid . - You gave me no choice , and you know it . I just wanna know how you knew I took ... your precious child support money and went to Vegas . - I didn 't . - Well , somebody knew , and they told the judge . - That 's how come you won . - Wait a minute . I don 't think anybody won here . [ Crying ] You knew this would happen if you didn 't change your lifestyle . I don 't care about this . I 'm upset about Atlantic City . - Atlantic City ? - Do you have any idea how much bus fare to New Jersey costs ? - [ Paper Rustling ] - There . Don 't gamble it all away like you 've done everything else in your life . I don 't do that anymore . What ? - What ? - [ Whispering , Indistinct ] Here , in case you get hungry . Gotta go . Be a good kid . Come on . Everything 's gonna be all right . Come on . [ Jarod ] The loss of a child - I couldn 't even imagine . [ Jarod ] The loss of a child - I couldn 't even imagine . [ Kline ] I doubt Tanaka 's losing any sleep over the Barrett boy . He 's as ruthless and cold-blooded as any man I 've ever met . According to Tanaka 's file , he 's been linked to over a dozen murders ... but he 's never been convicted . Men like Sammy Tanaka insulate themselves from the act . They push buttons , and people die - until Max Barrett and his mother stepped out from that pet shop . - What happened ? - Tanaka 's temper got the best of him . He got crossed in a drug deal by a wannabe Vietnamese heroin dealer - big mistake . That doesn 't sound very smart . Sammy Tanaka may wear $ 5,000 suits and drive a Rolls-Royce ... but , underneath it , he 's still just a hothead punk from Tokyo . He caught the guy on the sidewalk and opened fire . An innocent boy killed by Tanaka 's bullet ... coming out of the wrong pet store at the wrong time . Emma Barrett was the only person to actually see Tanaka pull the trigger . - Do you still think she 's dead ? - If she doesn 't , the F.B.I. does . The bureau 's decided to pull all but the minimum number of agents off the Barrett case . - Why ? - Waste of time and manpower . The woman was probably dead before she was ever taken out of that van . Then where is her body ? Why take her at all if killing her was the objective ? It 's been 24 hours . We haven 't heard a word . I 'm sorry . And once the victim has been isolated by the friendly forces , what then ? That would depend upon the remaining strength of the kidnappers . The best scenario would be to relocate the victim ... within a one-block radius of the initial assault . - And how long should the victim be held in check ? - Twenty-four hours . Excuse me . - Late for something ? - I hope not . [ No Audible Dialogue Over Montage ] Excuse me . Have you seen this man or this woman ? Mm-mmm . The rescue victim should be held in a low-profile structure ... one with a clear front , rear and side access . A low-income hotel would be optimal . [ Man On Radio ] Bring out the Barrett woman . We 're pullin 'in . What are you doing ? Where are you taking me ? [ Whimpering ] No ! - Wait ! Wait ! - Run him down ! Go ! [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Exhales ] [ Phone Ringing ] - This is Sydney . - [ Jarod ] Emma Barrett is still alive . I saw a Centre team transport her out of a hotel ... less than a block from the original abduction . - You 're positive ? - They shoved her in a van and took off . They nearly killed me . There was nothing I could do . - I 'm as outraged as you are about this , Jarod . - Then help me . I need to know where the Centre has taken her . Our Mr. Lyle is being very tight-lipped . What do you think they 'll do with her ? The Centre will hold her until they 've gotten their money . After that , her life has no value . Please , Sydney . There 's enough blood on our hands already . [ Dial Tone ] [ Monitor Beeping ] [ Wheezing ] Excuse me for not getting up . - I want them off my back . - Them ? Miss Parker and Sydney . They 're asking questions - questions fed by information that could only be supplied by one man . Jarod . He was spotted by a Sweeper team last night . With due respect , maybe you should reexamine the entire Tanaka scenario . I assume the Triumvirate is monitoring this maneuver closely . Don 't tell me about the Triumvirate . I am in control of this situation . Barrett 's been moved to a Centre safe house ... and I have a meeting with Tanaka 's son in two hours to finalize this deal . I don 't want any more interference . You have my complete and total loyalty . Have this placed on Miss Parker 's desk . [ Rings ] The information is on its way . I hope she won 't be a problem . You know our way . You have my complete and total loyalty . [ Phone Ringing ] For 13 months , you sift and dig and prepare a case from the ground up . When the moment finally comes , it all blows up in your face . - What happened ? - The judge refused to postpone the trial . - We still haven 't located Barrett yet . - And I quote : " It 's not the burden of this court to assure delivery of witnesses . - It is the State 's . " - How long ? - The trial resumes tomorrow morning at 10 : 00 . - [ Sighs ] Without Emma Barrett 's testimony , a child-killer 's going to go free . I 'm sorry , Jarod . I 'm out of cards to play . [ Clears Throat ] So ? How do you like your new home ? Pretty cool , huh ? - Yeah . It smells though . - Smells ? [ Sniffs ] Like burnt toast . It does ? Well , that 's , uh - That 's because l-I burn dinner . I mean , every once in a while . I think it 's that stove . That old stove is - It 's kinda - Hey , I put up a swing set out in the backyard . You still like to " shwing , " don 't ya ? - I guess . - Uh , honey ? Um - Uh , listen . Be careful . [ Exhales ] - She 's a beautiful little girl . - [ Loud Clatter ] [ Gasps ] Oh , Sydney ! - You almost gave me a heart attack . - I didn 't want to be seen . It appears your custody hearing went as you 'd hoped , huh ? Oh , yeah . Yeah , it 's - Listen . Thanks for giving the information about my ex-wife goin ' to Las Vegas . - What ? - You didn 't tell the judge ? - Mm-mmm . - Well , then - [ Clears Throat ] what are you doin ' here ? I need your help to break into Lyle 's personal files . Mr. Lyle ? Are you - Are you nuts ? He 's crazy . - A life is at stake , Broots . - Yeah , mine . Sydney , I just - I just - I just brought my daughter home . Could you imagine what they 'd do to her if they caught me ? I 'm sorry , but I can 't . - [ Pats Shoulder ] - Congratulations on your daughter . Thanks . Look , um [ Door Opens ] - I 'm-I 'm sorry . - [ Door Closes ] - Thanks . - [ Gasps ] - Hello , Mr. Broots . Oh , my God ! - Sydney ! - [ Rap ] [ Phone . Dial Tone ] [ Ends ] - Is there something wrong ? - Um - - I forgot the number . - Oh . - [ Handset Settles In Cradle ] - We have to talk . [ Exhales ] Okay . [ Clock Ticking ] [ Loud Rap ] [ Speaking Japanese ] I 'm sorry . The translator was supposed to be here 15 minutes ago . [ Continues In Japanese ] [ Miss Parker ] He wants to know how an organization so powerful ... can be run so inefficiently . - Hi , Tommy . - Hi . [ Laughs ] [ Speaking Japanese ] You two know each other ? Tommy and I spent a , uh ... long , hot college summer together in Tokyo . He wants to finish up the details of tonight 's exchange . He says the 10 million will be transferred online ... from his account into the Centre 's . Then he 'll take receipt of the package . And I 'm guessing - Emma Barrett ? Tell him I will personally oversee the transfer . What ? He insists that I be present during the exchange . Fine . Fine . Tell him ... that 's fine . Tommy ? What happened to his hand ? The Yakuza punish by taking the little finger of the offending party . - What 's a guy have to do to lose a thumb ? - Good question . See you tonight . [ Man ] Every other test comes out the same way . [ Chattering Continues ] [ Birds Chirping ] [ Exhales ] Do you realize how dangerous this is for me ... and my daughter ? I think I understand danger , Mr. Broots . [ Clears Throat ] I feel like I should ask you for your autograph or something . You know ? I mean , don 't you think it 's strange that here we are , face-to-face ? Strange ? Strange like everything else associated with the Centre . Look , um , l-I still don 't understand ... how you could be responsible for what happened to this Emma Barrett person ? They used one of my simulations to kidnap her ... and now they 're trying to sell her to the men that murdered her son . [ Discordant ] [ Exhales ] The Centre is doing business with child-killers ? I think they 're keeping Ms. Barrett in a Centre safe house . I need to access Mr. Lyle 's security records to find out where that house is . I already told Sydney it 's impossible . Sydney ? - He asked for help with this ? - Yeah . But , you see , the thing is , Lyle doesn 't use computers . He doesn 't believe in them . That 's what scares me the most about this guy . Now , anything this important , someone would have to physically get into his office . Oh , no . Oh , no , no . You-You - You don 't expect me to do that ? We all need help , Mr. Broots - help with the things that are most important to us . [ Laughing ] Whee ! Whee ! You sent the information about my ex-wife goin ' to Las Vegas ? - You 'll be a good father . - [ Swing Creaking ] A child can 't ask for more than that . Jarod , I - It 's - l - It 's too dangerous . - l - - This is Max . He was the same age as Debbie ... when he was shot down in the street in cold blood . - [ Chattering ] - Help me . Jarod . [ Singing , Indistinct ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] The cool air is soothing to my skin . Why did you leave this information on my desk ... about Mr. Lyle 's meeting with Tommy Tanaka ? - You seem upset . - What do you want ? The same as you - normality , a return to better times . A 10-digit access code . Mr. Lyle will have one exactly the same except for the final digit . During the transfer of funds , you will need to enter your code number ... without being detected . - You 're gonna steal Lyle 's money ? - No , Miss Parker . You are . [ Grunts ] [ Button Clicks ] [ Beeping ] - [ Line Ringing ] - Hello ? The-The Eagle has landed . [ Chattering ] [ Man ] Everything 's ready , Mr. Lyle . Mr. Tanaka will enter his access code , the funds will begin to move ... and then you enter yours to receive them . - Let 's just do this . - [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Speaking Japanese ] [ Speaking Japanese ] Parker . - What 's going on ? - Mr. Tanaka would feel more comfortable ... - if somebody else were to enter the access code . - Who ? Do it . [ Typing ] [ Miss Parker ] Transfer underway . Mr. Tanaka would like to take possession of his property now . [ Inhales ] Bring the woman down . - [ Beeping ] - [ Mr. Lyle ] Wait , wait . The money is moving in and then out of the account . - What are you trying to pull ? - [ Triggers Clicking ] - [ Glass Crashes ] - [ Grunting ] What the hell is going on ? Who did this ? - Jarod . - Damn it ! Jarod 's getting away ! - [ Shouting , Indistinct ] - [ Tires Squealing ] - [ Mr. Lyle ] Clear that up . ! - [ Gunfire ] [ Man Shouts In Japanese ] Ten million dollars . Add that to the funds lost in Omaha ... and Jarod has walked away with nearly $ 30 million in Centre assets . Not to mention the 40 million he took during the Wall Street transfer . - Which he returned . - Minus interest . That 's not the point . Jarod 's involvement in this situation ... has placed me in an extremely vulnerable position . I warned you about the danger of involving him in anything like this . There 's no way he could have known the location of that house without help from the inside . Is that an accusation ? It 's obvious a man likeJarod will settle for nothing less than complete justice . I want every Sweeper we have available on this case . - Find Barrett . - And if they can 't ? Set up a security seal around the federal courthouse . Sammy Tanaka 's trial resumes in the morning at 10 : 00 . Jarod will try to deliver Barrett then . I 've promised the Tanaka family he will not succeed . [ Jarod ] This place isn 't much , Ms. Barrett , but I can protect you here . You should eat something . You don 't trust me . I understand . But if I wanted to hurt you , I wouldn 't have fought to get you out of that house . Then let me go . [ Sighs ] It 's not safe . I know the men who took you . They 'll stop at nothing to get you back . - Sammy Tanaka . - The men didn 't work for Tanaka . They were going to sell you to him . - How do I know you won 't sell me ? - You don 't . [ Opens Drawer ] But he does . All I remember is blue smoke filling the van ... the sound of gunfire . Did you see Agent Edwards before he was killed ? Yes . He was a good man . I believe he had children . Two sons . Do you have family , Mr. Darrow ? I was separated from my parents when I was very little . I - I 've been searching for them . I hope you find them . How many shots was Agent Gillson able to get off before he was wounded ? - Shots ? - Yes . He said he was able to return fire before he was overpowered . Oh , no . You must have misunderstood him . Agent Gillson never even pulled his weapon . I just wish I could 've gotten off a few more rounds . - You were able to return fire ? - Yes , ma 'am . Right . - I 'm done , Jarod . - What do you mean ? For over a year , I 've been living in motel rooms ... not even allowed to visit Max 's grave . My son is gone . Nothing 's going to change that . And now a man is dead because he was trying to protect me . A man with a wife and two children . I don 't want any more blood on my hands . And what about your son ? Unless you stand up - unless you walk into that courtroom and point your finger at Sammy Tanaka - then none of this mattered . Is that what you want ? You knew Jarod was going to be at that transfer tonight . I was wondering the same about you . Save it . You played me like a piano , and I 'm sick of the tune . This is about burying Lyle , isn 't it ? The Triumvirate has grown weary of Mr. Lyle 's leadership . By dealing with Sammy Tanaka , he 's left the Centre exposed . You didn 't dream this up all by your little self . Who else is involved ? [ Gasping ] [ Mr. Parker ] I am . - Let him go . Please . - [ Whimpers ] I apologize for the secrecy ... but it was important that you believed exactly what you believed . And all that stuff about a younger lion - that was all part of it ? - Yes . For your own protection . - The money ? Diverted into a secondary Centre account . At the proper time and through the proper channels ... information will be leaked implicating Mr. Lyle in the theft ... and the disappearance of Emma Barrett . [ Exhales ] Why didn 't you just tell me the truth ? Well , considering everything that happened , I - I didn 't think you 'd trust me . So , if Sammy Tanaka and his psychos think that Mr. Lyle ... stole their money and their witness - It wouldn 't be a very good time to be Mr. Lyle . Now would it ? [ Grunts ] My name is Russell Gillson . I am currently a special agent working for the Department ofJus [ Tape Fast-forwarding ] - I was assigned as personal protection for one Emma Barrett . ... armed men made access into our van ... containing myself , Barrett and AgentJeffrey Edwards . I drew my weapon and fired several rounds in defense . - [ Tape Rewinding ] ... fired several rounds in defense . ... fired - fired - fired - Bang . You 're dead , Agent Gillson . - [ Watch Alarm Beeping ] - [ Grunts ] [ Beeping Continues ] [ Moans ] Ms. Barrett . Wake up . We have to be in court in a couple of hours . Ms. Barrett ? Emma , are you awake ? How did you know I 'd come here ? 'Cause this is where I would come if it was my child . Max was such a funny little kid . But timid , afraid . There was this big dog that lived in the apartment next door . Every day , when Max would come home from school ... this dog would start barking - deep , dangerous barking . And Max , he wouldjust stop at the end of the hallway ... wait for me to come get him . He was so afraid . That 's when I decided to buy him one of his own . [ Crying ] It was my fault we were coming out of that pet store . You had no way of knowing what was going to happen that day . Max loved you , and you loved him . That 's all you have to remember . [ Crying Continues ] [ Sniffles ] Court begins in less than two hours . Do you really think Tanaka and those other people ... are going to just let me walk into that courtroom ? As a matter of fact ... I do . [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Automatic Weapon Fire ] Kevin , hello . It 's Jarod . Yes . The ice-cream man . I was wondering if you might do me a favor . [ Chattering ] I expected more security . Well , the F.B.I. must think Barrett 's already dead . He 's got less than 10 minutes to get her on that witness stand . Maybe we should look the other way this time , Miss Parker . We 're talking about the killing of a child . We 're talking aboutJarod . This is Parker . Give me a status check . - [ Man On Radio ] North access secure . - [ Man # 2 ] South access secure . I want everybody on their toes . - Jarod should be here at any - - [ Automatic Weapon Fire ] [ People Screaming , Shouting ] - What are you two doing here ? - We heard the gunfire , and we came over . - [ Explosions ] - This way ! This way ! Miss Parker ? Son of a - He 's already inside . Let 's go . Let 's go . ! - Wait , wait ! - Hold it ! - [ Beeping ] - [ Man ] Go back . ! Move back . ! [ Gavel Raps ] In the case of People v. Sammy Tanaka , does the State wish to call a witness ? - Your Honor , the State wishes to request a delay . - Grounds ? I believe the court is well aware the State 's key witness ... is unavailable for testimony at this time . And I believe , Ms. Kline , you have been up this dead-end street . My ruling stands as posted . Now , do you or do you not have a witness to call ? [ People Whispering , Indistinct ] [ Sighs ] Your Honor , we do not . - If it pleases the court - - [ Spectators Murmuring ] I would like to present Emma Barrett ... as witness for the prosecution . Nice to see you , Ms. Barrett . It 's nice to be here , Your Honor . We 'll take a five-minute recess , then swear in the witness . [ Gavel Raps ] I would like to thank you , Agent Gillson ... for all your help in bringing Mr. Tanaka to justice . I couldn 't have done it without you . [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ People Gasping ] I 'm D.O.J. and those people are wanted . Arrest them . There he is . Go ! Take him ! Oh ! You 've gotta be kidding . Let go of me . Jarod ? Jarod . ! - [ Mr. Parker ] Did they captureJarod ? - No . Damn it . Well , at least we 've eliminated one problem . I made it clear to Sammy Tanaka 's people that Mr. Lyle is not to be trusted . It 's a win-win situation . We take down Lyle and pick up $ 10 million . [ Beeps ] Impossible . - What is it ? - The account 's empty . The money 's gone . [ Jarod ] Ten million dollars . It 's going to help a lot of people . I just want you to know that I couldn 't have done it without your help . If you hadn 't transferred the funds from the Centre 's secondary account ... none of this would have happened . Thank you . Oh , and , uh , enjoy the gift . Will you ever come home , Jarod ? - Yes , you are , sir . Perfectly . - [ Car Alarm Chirps ] I assure you that the stolen money is being tracked down as we speak . I understand. I - I prom - I promise you we 'll have no more trouble with Sammy Tanaka or his people . Yes , sir . [ Engine Starts ]

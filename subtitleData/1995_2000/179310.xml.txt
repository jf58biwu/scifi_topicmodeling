 God help us . [ Man ] I wonder if the Chigoes have the same god . All right , this ain 't church . Retrieve the collateral damage and move out . This L.Z. Is hot . Let 's go . Yes , sir , over here ! - No one could survive this . - That 's the tail section . [ Man ] Come on . Take a look at this . [ Man # 2 ] Okay . [ Clattering ] [ Yells , Grunts ] Stop him ! Hold him ! Hold him ! [ Indistinct Shouting ] Cut him off ! Cut him off ! Whoa , whoa ! Wa-Wait ! Wa-Wa-Wait ! L - I-I 'm the farthest man from home , okay ? - L-I-I 'm the farthest man from home . - Okay , easy , sir . I 'm Captain Joyner , United States Army Special Forces . We 're here to help you get home . Look at there . Right there . Up there . See ? Twelve billion people . Twelve billion lives . And then there 's me , okay ? Twelve billion lives , and then just me ! Incoming ! Just me ! You can 't get me home . See these people ? They can go . L - I told them they could go . But not me ! Not me ! They can go , but not me . ! I 'm the farthest man from home . ! I 'm the farthest man from home . ! I 'm the farthest man from home ! I 'm the farthest man from home ! [ John F. Kennedy ] There is no strife , no prejudice ... no national conflict in outer space as yet . " But why , " some say , " the moon ? Why choose this as our goal ? " And they may well ask , " Why climb the highest mountain ? " Why , 35 years ago , fly the Atlantic ? We choose to go to the moon . ! We choose to go to the moon in this decade ... and do the other things . Not because they are easy , but because they are hard . Because that goal will serve to organiye and measure ... the best of our energies and skills . Yeah , all right ! [ Laughing ] Boom , boom , boom ! - [ Kennedy Continues , Indistinct ] - Get some ! Down ! Good-bye ! [ Beeping ] [ Blows ] [ Woman On TV ] Thank you for tuning in to Adult Entertainment . The Chigoes are launching an attack outside Proxima . Hey , Vansen , why do they call aliens " Chigs " ? - Because they look like chigoes . - What are chigoes ? They 're like fleas . They burrow themselves into your skin . Well , to me they look more like praying mantis or a walking stick . - We could call them walkers . ! - Let 's blow the hell out of the walkers ? - Yeah . - Keep working on it . [ Kennedy Continues , Indistinct ] ... because that challenge is one that we 're willing to accept ... one we are unwilling to postpone ... and one we intend to win . - This over ? - Commercial . They 're transmitting the Bears / Forty-Niners game . The Niners suck . They haven 't won a Super Bowl in 68 years . They 're talking about canceling the season because of the war . Now , I 'll live through the war , but , man , I will die if I don 't get any football . Well , we can 't have the aliens gettin ' credit for a kill they didn 't earn . [ TVAnnouncer ] Next on the History Network , Planes of Yesterday . Get some ! Bam ! Boom ! Bam ! Good-bye ! Bam . ! Boom . ! See ya . ! - I can 't leave ! - I will find you ! I believe in you . [ Door Slams ] Tellus , isn 't it ? Where you were gonna colonize . I never thought I 'd see it . From Earth it would have taken 12 years for the next wormhole to open . In space it 's just a short cut through reticulum . I was just thinking what it would have been like to have been with her . Seeing Tellus together for the first time . [ Engine Droning ] - Ship 's dropped anchor . - We 're goin ' in . Way too hot . We have a mission briefing in 15 . - Maybe we 'll know more . - Look . An army A.P.C. Where the hell did that come from ? I 'm going down in the observation room to get a better look . Nathan , I hope you 're not getting any ideas . Bad ideas . [ Men Chanting ] Ooh-ha , ooh-ha . ! Off of the rack in the middle of the night ! [ Woman ] Make a head call , and I 'm ready to fight ! [ Men ] Make a head call , and I 'm ready to fight ! [ Woman ] Give me P. T. Good for you , good for me . Sir . [ Screaming ] [ Indistinct Shouting ] [ Screaming Continues ] - Take him to the 14th middeck . - Yes , sir . [ Screaming Continues ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Man ] This way . What 's goin ' on ? Good to see you again . They told me the light hurts your eyes . I didn 't wish to make you uncomfortable . And I 'm certain you didn 't want to create any discomfort . That 's why I thought we should talk . [ Sighs ] We wouldn 't want to be irresponsible ... with the account of your experiences - in particular , what you may have learned ... from any extended exposure to the enemy . You can trust me ... because I know . The marines killed one on Mars . We 've studied it . And now I know more about them than anyone should . So tell me . Tell me what I know . Tell me what I know . Tell me , or you 'll be taken away ... and you 'll be reeducated about your time on Tellus . I can tell you what I know about you . You 're not the farthest man from home . [ Door Opens , Closes ] Sit down . All right , this one 's in the air . Our mission is a reconnaissance patrol of two planets ... in the Indi 20-9100 star system . Both are hot . Chigs own ' em . West , what ? Are you wonderin what to get me for Christmas ? The rules of engagement are as follows : Don 't hang around for seconds . We lost the entire 34th to an ambush on a similar patrol . I want you on the flight deck at 1720 . The time will be 1650 . Ready , ready , hack . [ Watches Beeping ] - [ Door Closes ] - I know that guy . Sewell . He 's on the Aero-Tech board of directors . He 's one of the ones that had me thrown off the Tellus mission . - All the way down here ? No . - What would he be doing ? Saratoga could just be a layover for some civilian destination . No . There 's a Tellus survivor on board . [ Scoffs ] You saw the army A.P.C. Arrive . When I went to middeck it was restricted ... but I saw someone in a biohazard suit under Green Beret escort . Sewell was there . Sounds like maybe a crewman was exposed to a chemical leak . Aero-Tech had two colonies - Vesta and Tellus . Vesta 's three parsecs away , and Tellus is in reach . Na - Nathan , the Tellus attack was weeks ago . - The chances that anyone is still - - West . She 's dead . Drive on . It don 't mean nothin ' . - How the hell would you know what it meant , Tank ! - Enough ! Nathan . Nathan , he 's right . There is nothing you can do about her . Nothing . The only thing that you can do is get back in the war ... and that we do in 30 mikes . So suit up . [ Man ] We want to be there at 0700 tomorrow . - [ Woman ] Yeah . - [ Whistle Blows ] - Quittin ' bell . - Yep , quitting ' time . [ Man ] We had to cut through the bulkhead yesterday . [ Man # 2 ] Yeah . [ Screaming ] - [ Steam Hissing ] - Help ! Coop , what 're you doin ' ? They don 't make nothin with InVitros in mind . Right . I told you before . Don 't haunt me . I was with the colony . You know , you come here , and you sit here ... and you-you walk here ... and you ... get in my head ... and you-you-you get in my ears ... and you get in my eyes ! L - I-I did nothing ! I did nothing but live ! O - Okay , I 'm far from home . I 'm very far from home . You can go . You can go home . The others have gone home . They 've gone home , and they - they have left me here alone . Kylen , Kylen Celina - Has she gone home ? No . She 's far . [ Sighs ] She 's very far from home . [ Locker Closes ] Hey . [ Clears Throat ] All set , sir . Where 's West ? [ Indistinct Chattering ] Hey , you see that ? What gives ? [ Chattering Continues ] - [ Alarm Blaring ] - West ! What the hell are you doin ' ? [ Alarm Continues Blaring ] He 's overridden the system . You are one dead marine if you don 't stop right now . Think about it , West . - [ Air Escapes ] - Where the hell do you think you 're going , soldier ? You have a mission to fly . Drop that cockpit , and you are gone ! Gone ! [ McQueen On Headset ] This is the dumbest move I 've ever seen , West . Tellus is hot . The aliens own it . You 'll be boloed before entry . Now you turn ' em and burn ' em right back here . He 's beyond insubordination . He 's on the brink of desertion . He 's out there operating with no regard for good order or proper conduct . He thinks he 's only putting himself in danger ... but by bailing out of the mission , he puts all of your lives on the line . ! He threatens every grunt that hits the beach who relies on our recon . This war wasn 't made just for Nathan West ! Every life in this war is tied together ! Sir ! It wasn 't a selfish act . It was a selfless one . He believes people are alive on Tellus . He went out after someone . That someone better be worth dying for ... 'cause that 's what 's gonna happen to him if no one does anything about it . Sir , if you were able ... if you weren 't grounded by your injury , would you go ? I 'll be damned if he takes the easy way and dies before I can get at him . Now , you 've got a mission to fly . [ Alarm Beeping ] Hawkes , I 'm doin ' it . Goin ' Elvis after West ? 74.6 megastatute kilometers into the sortie ... I 'm changing course to Tellus . Wang and Damphousse are gonna cover for me . It 's a 48-hour patrol , so we 've got 36 hours to go out and get him . - We ? - I need a wingman to C.M.A. After me and West , you 're the best jockey in the 58th . You and West are after me . Question is , are you and me goin ' after West ? [ Indistinct Chattering ] [ Alarm Beeping ] - [ Alarm Blaring ] - [ Man On Speaker ] All personnel clear the flight deck . - All personnel clear the flight deck . - [ Excited Chattering ] Flight deck is clear . Close flight deck bay doors . [ Beeping ] [ Man On Headset ] Stand by for hammerhead launch . [ Alarm Continues Blaring ] Let 's get lit . [ Man On Headset ] Begin hammerhead engagement sequence . Joker , this is Ace of Diamonds , 72.6 M.S.K. ' s goin ' Elvis . Copy that . It 's now or never . Ace of Diamonds , this is Jack of Spades . I 'm at your 4 : 00 tight . Roger that . I have a visual . Let 's smoke ' em . [ Woman 's Voice ] Mary Gavin , Tellus colonist , number 45327 . [ Dog Snarling ] [ Barks ] [ Clattering ] [ Man 's Voice ] Mike Bowman . These are the tags of those who survived . Russell Kettingham . Never forget us . Kylen Celina . Nathan , we 're always together . Look to the high ground . [ Mechanical Sound ] [ Dog Growling ] [ Dog Yelps ] Kylen Celina . Nathan , we 're always together . Look to the high ground . [ Shane ] Trans-Tellus injection complete . Reports that the Colonial Cutter went down around the 31 st Parallel . We 'll grid-search starting there . Roger that . [ Woman ] They won 't come here . We seen them outside . They don 't come inside . Ashford . Theresa . You were on my level . It 's Nathan . Nathan West . West ? My God . You were removed from the mission . How - I 'm here to find Kylen Celina . Where is she ? Where are the others ? - They took them . - Where ? Show me . No . For all we know , they 're dead . For all we expect , they 're dead . - But you 're not certain . - They got them . They got them and took them away . These things kill . That 's all they do , these things . You came to look for survivors . We 're all that 's left . Take us home . I can 't . My plane 's disabled . I won 't have enough power to escape orbit . The marines know that you 're here . They 'll send somebody after you . No . I 'm here without authority . They won 't come . Congratulations , West . You got what you wanted . You 're finally one of us - Tellus colonist . Is it everything you thought it would be ? Stranded on this planet ... waiting to die . After the initial attack , many of us were still alive . But they were waiting , those things . I don 't remember landing . I was just suddenly aware that I was running and running . I saw flashes of light ... and flashes of their weapons firing on the wounded . It 's funny how the mind works sometimes . Even at those moments with the colonists running in all directions ... I became aware that this planet looked a lot like Earth . Theresa and I were followed . We hid in the cave . We believe they know where we are . But I think they 're afraid of their dead . When it seemed safe ... I went alone to the spot where our colony was gonna be . There . Twenty-five miles northwest . The aliens burned everything . I looked at the charred remains ... and even after all those deaths , that 's when I knew ... our dream was over . You know where they 've taken her ? Tell me . Theresa will never go , and I won 't leave her alone . Fifty years from now ... on that burnt spot ... the trees will be back , and so will we . Now tell me where she is . [ Shane ] Still no sign ofhim . We 're bingo on zero plus 45 . Roger that . Maybe West got his mind right and went back ... or never made it . [ Instrument Beeping ] I got something - 38.5 degrees north , 60.2 degrees west . That 's his hammerhead . There 's a flat surface , like a lake bed ... four degrees north-northeast . - Looks like we can put ' em down . - Roger that . Let 's go in . [ Shane ] That 's no lake bed . They must have corked their position . - [ Alarm Beeping ] - [ Shane ] They 've got us locked on . [ Cooper ] We got incoming . ! Whoa ! I 've been hit ! I 'm goin ' down ! Crankin ' the chicken switch ! [ Ship Crashing ] Queen Six , this is Ace of Diamonds . Come in . This is Wild Card Base . Go ahead . Have met heavy enemy resistance . Jack of Spades is down . Please advise . Hold tight , A.O.D. Dispatch an A.P.C. To Tellus immediately . Sir , that area 's restricted . - Do it ! - There 's no air cover . There will be . [ Instrument Beeping ] [ Beeping Intensifies ] If I was a Chig , you 'd have a hole in your head right now . Why don 't you light a bonfire ? You 're supposed to extinguish all flame before moving on . Look who 's talking regulations . I wouldn 't even be here right now if you hadn 't made yourself your own commander-in-chief . A survivor told me she was alive . And is she ? All you heard is what you wanted to hear . I never asked you to come for me ! Oh , my misunderstanding . I 'll just go back . Wait ! My plane 's in a million pieces , and I 'm taking incoming . [ Imitating Gunfire ] [ Gunfire Continues ] It 's too hairy ! They 're gettin ' closer ! I ain 't goin ' back till I 'm outta rounds . [ Imitating Gunfire ] - I 'll follow you . - I know a place they won 't go . Whoa ! Get outta here ! Get the hell out ! - We 're under fire ! - You brought them here ! Now they know where we are ! - You said they wouldn 't come ! - We 're gonna die because of you ! Wait ! Listen ! - [ Rumbling ] - You were both right . No , it 's not them . West ! Come on . You 're goin ' home . [ Sighs ] Let 's go ! We got 30 seconds ! Go ! Go ! - Come on . - [ Groaning ] Oh , I can 't do it . I can 't do it . Hammerheads ! - We 're rollin ' in on your six . - Let 's send a rattlesnake right up their - [ Instrument Beeping ] [ Cooper ] Air cover . ! Move . ! Move . ! Kylen . Kylen ! - Get him in here . Five seconds ! - Come on . ! Get in . ! Five seconds ! Five seconds ! Let 's go ! Colonel McQueen , with the crap you 've pulled in your career ... that you continue to pull , you should 've been drummed out of the Corps . Sir , with my war record , I should have been made a general . Why not ? You give orders like one . Insubordinate orders . Who the hell do you think you are sending your people ... and army personnel into a hot L.Z. ? Sir . ! I volunteered , sir . ! Volunteered ? You deserted your mission . Sir , I insisted Lieutenant Hawkes do so . I thought you wanted to be a Marine Corps officer , Vansen . Your parents were officers . What would your father have thought of his daughter being court-martialed ? Sir , this starts and stops right here . This was my misconduct , my responsibility . I went over the hill . I took the aircraft . Neither my superior officer nor my fellow officers ... would have engaged in a breach of duty if not for me . I was aware of the severe consequences ... and am prepared to be the only one to face the repercussions of my actions . They rescued two survivors , sir . Your actions , each of you ... and the repercussions of which have been reclassified ... compartmentaliyed . You understand that all actions and accounts upon the planet Tellus ... did not exist , nor will they exist . Any breach of this understanding ... is a violation of compartmentaliyed information ... and there will be severe consequences . Dismissed . - What the hell was that ? - Enough ! It 's not to be talked about . Those were orders . I know Commodore Ross . He wouldn 't hesitate for a second to court-martial all of us . Someone higher up obviously pulled a string . If we 're not careful , we could be hanging from it . See you in 50 years , Nathan . I heard we 're shipping ' out . Chigs are hittin ' Procyon . Third Wing 's gettin ' their asses kicked . It 's gonna be hairy . It 's far from here . Real far . I want you guys to know ... I was close . To her ? To home . [ Man On P.A. ] All hands , this is the captain . Prepare to set sail . [ Man ] Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

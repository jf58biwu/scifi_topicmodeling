As you know , from the second revolution , USA has tried ... Extensively to establish an egalitarian society ... A society of mediocre people , but the problem is ... That to run a society , requires certain management functions people ... Poor is unable to develop . Do you mean the senators , or the president ? Not at all . Anyone with average intelligence or less ... Could handle those charges . But the people who oversee the economy runs the trains , ... Airlines , communications , factories ... Unfortunately , those people can not be mediocre . Surprisingly ... we are not very many ... How is it , Fewer than 3 thousand Something like that ? ... - Yes . You were brought here because ... Want you to be one of us ... I ? Our recruitment department has followed you for 2 years ... Your intellectual abilities are quite substantial . The house thinking , chess ... was a sort of test ? Of course , we brought so well . This is a secret facility ... People do not know where it is , whether there ... The idea that real equality is achieved promoting inequity ... Would be something a ' little difficult for them to understand . If you want to continue with your previous life , you 'll go as numb as you arrived . How to know what not tell people about this ? Return is an option , but not without consequences . Surgery we are talking about is real . It has been practiced for most potential recruits yesterday . What happens if I join ? It will tell your family and friends that you died during surgery . And begin a new life , but you will have to sacrifice ... You will live here permanently , you can not have children ... But there are rewards ... You have the freedom to use your brain . Harrison ... It is difficult to assimilate , but think about this ... Tenth of the U.S. Population , 35 million people ... Died in the war of the second revolution and its consequences . If we do not remain vigilant , all happen again . Can you live with that guilt ? 'Il Take you to a quiet place so you can think . 35 million . - The numbers are just details . Well , here you will live . - This is , uh . Yes . Do you like the decor ?

Again , quadrant 4 be sealed at 21 hours . A nice to meet you , young , came at a good time ... Do you want to elect the next governor of Connecticut ? Excuse me ? - We were about to elect the ... Next governor of Connecticut , politicians in the past used the choice ... Instead of selection , we now know that no one stands to be governor . People never thought made a difference with your vote . All I managed was to choose different people each time ... To return not tyrants or something . Our process makes it just as well , but we saves time and money . Makes sense . - Then do it . Me ? - Sure . No problems with committee members . What should I do ? - Well , the names of all adults ... Of Connecticut were assigned a random number on this computer ... Simply choose a number of to eight digits . Do it . Elected official to elect the enter a 8 digit code . Wochuk Genevieve , New Haven , married , 3 children , waitress ... Hello ? - I speak with Ms. Benavieve Wochuk ? Si . - One moment please .

What a surprise . Jenny , go get Dad the bathroom ... I will be governor , Douglas , not throw it at your sister 's hair . How soon to rule , dear ? Someone will contact you , to view details of your presentation . Am I going to fix my hair ? - Of course . Goodbye , Governor Wochuk . - Goodbye and thank you . Douglas stops ... Lovely , aumentémosle the band a bit mental . Yes , Lord . Once you heard the horse called Phar Lap ? The best racehorse in history . The problem is that he always won , and people do not gamble , or going to the track . So I put weights until he could no longer win . Almost killed him , but balanced the game , and that we do here ... We balance the game . Think fast . Begin to balance human games before the end of the last century ... Just before the revolution . A guy named ' Jordan ' , now retired , came back and won effortlessly . First it was sports , but then we balance all . This band invented the mind . - I saw that on TV . Any previous lack of this kind ? No , it 's clean . Does not seem intentional , only envíenle a letter to scare him . If it was an accident , did the right thing , you should always give your best ... Otherwise not know about penalize you . I do not want to rush , Harrison , but we should be at 1 ... In administration and must arrive on time . Right . Last night , seeing those programs I realized that Everything looks like in the 1950 's . Is it intentional ? Rule number 1 : Everything is intentional . U.S. Was happier in that decade , at least ... People who lived at that time remembers well , and ... After the revolution , administration redesigned the country as well . As a homesick alien ... but it works . Hey Harrison , how 's it going ? - Pretty confusing . I think your mind can bear this confusion . Soon you will have questions sure that me ... When you come and see me anytime ... Yes , Lord . - Without a mouthful , sure . Today there are fewer than 100,000 police officers nationwide ... Less than 3 % of what it was before the revolution ... Excuse me for interrupting . - Okay , it 's Connie Wang , my assistant . Harrison Bergeron , the new recruit Phillipa . How are you ? - Nice to meet you . I have been talking to Governor Leslie for half an hour ... Y refuses to cancel the execution ... Maybe you can convince . What I can do , Connie People make the law ... We are only here to advise and help manage ... . This is the first execution under the new law ... Proposed by parliament in Florida , applying the death penalty ... Traffic offenses . Francis Narrows is about to pay with his life ... By illegally turning left . Beside me is Lorraine Newbound ... Leader of the Association of Miami penalties against ' No ' capital ... Mrs Newbound , you are under this new law . Absolutely . Although should include parking fines . How bad parking . - A crime is a crime ... Why should we pay to build prisons ? Death to all offenders . - Thank you , Ms. Newbound . As you can see , a black bag is placed in the head ... Francis Narrows . The system is activated . And the power ... That 's funny , before the revolution , when I was a child ... Almost no executions ... There were discussions among experts on how to fight crime ... More prisons , more police , gun control , better rehabilitation ... Guidance Counselors , training programs , nothing worked ... But ... When mediocre people , took control ... They realized they would find like fighting crime ... So they decided to fight only against criminals . Traffic Violations . - Do not be unfair , Connie ... It worked . There are plenty of police fat sitting on ... Stations , watching soap operas in the country . Mr. Shockley I saw a lot of TV , and every day he runs . Most are repeats , if not promoted ... This affects the advertising dollars , and we want people to see ... For the deterrent value ... Almost no crimes out there . - Maybe we should kill them all . That would take care of crime forever . Do not fuck with the will of the people , young Harrison . We discussed this with Connie all the time ... She said it is better 100 guilty free ... One unjustly executed . But I do not know . If those 100 who saved , killing 2 innocent ... The good we have one less . I mean , it sounds insensitive but ... Is only a matter of numbers . Jaque . - Still awful to see . Do not see it . I think Shockley is the only one who enjoys seeing them . Welcome to life without the band mind . Yes . Ever play chess with Alma ? - Not only with my brother . Miss your family , right ? - Yes . Something like that could not talk to them ... But there is a biological bond that unites us . Believe I hate knowing that I 'm dead . They just remember , Harrison . It is normal ... I go up to their mental bands in cases like yours . This does not relieve me . Sorry , that was stupid . What about your family ? - Oh , mmm ... I think I killed , I grew up here . Looks like a tie . All that work lost . - Not so ... It was an incredible game . And you 're amazing . I 'm sorry , I must go . Harrison ... Before ... Queens passed between us , there was a position ... Where you could do mate in 4 . You saw it , right ? - No . That was at the house of to think . That was for the draw , but if you do it again I 'll kill you . That 's just because if ... Now the other . Harry Now tell me , what banana cake you prefer ? ... Does the mine or your mother ? Both are excellent , but sorry , my love ... I must say why . .. Yours is the best . Oh , Harry . Mom . - You told me last week ... My banana cake was better than him it . Sorry mom , but ... - Fair ... At least I know I 'm where if you think yours is better = = Enjoy . What do you think Jennifer . - Uh , well ... Clearly the concept and idea are nothing new ... The script is mundane , action ... mediocre . I like it , do very well on Tuesday after ' Neighbors . ' I agree , there were some jokes smart , but surely the station ... The deleted , ask 13 chapters . What did you think of Harrison ? Was horrible . - If they did a great job . See I can not believe this . - All saw it ... Even when started TV was down ... The least common multiple ... But sometimes quality programs snuck ... But we , unlike , conscious decision ... Not show things that could be appreciated by all ... In this way , we eliminate completely quality ... We are very proud of that . - Very proud . Open up please . Every moment , every program , in channel ... Recorded or live , seen anywhere in the country ... Is guided through this room . Is completely safe , steel walls 10 meters thick . When that door closes , no one , not an army , can enter . Listen , Harrison , if you become a member this ... Department , and I hope you do , have an enormous responsibility . Yes , Lord . Let me show the recording studio . Hurricane Walter is taking strength in the Atlantic ... And is moving towards the coast of Carolina 30 miles per hour ... It is too early to predict landfall , but ... We advise those who live there , to prepare ... Do not switch channels to find out what happens . Cut . , Was good . Are they difficult to use ? - No , just look around here . Look , focus , pan , tilt , incoming sound . 2 donuts , a cup of coffee , and you 're a cameraman . Is not that right , Burt ? This is for beginners , usually eat half a dozen . Hi . The Adventures of Robin Hood ... More ... heart hate ( The Searchers ) by Northwest ( North by Northwest ) . What a Wonderful Life ( it ' ; a Wonderful Life ) . And an incredible Jazz . I did something for you ... Down in Equalization . You are very sweet . - Well ...

Promise me you will not use more . - I promise . I 'm serious . - To my equal . Soul and I never ... I mean , I never ... I 've never ... - I know . Let me know if I do well ... You 're doing well . Enter with confidence , Harrison , enters . Understand you completed your orientation . Yes , Lord . - Well ... Are you OK ? - Yes . Well , well , now I can not promise reach you at the place you want ... But is there any administration department that interests you ? I can be useful on TV . - TV ... Is the thread that holds the fabric of our society ... The TV programming is a big responsibility . I understand . Let 's see if I can talk with some contacts . That is fantastic . - I went for coffee , you come with me ? Thank you . Harrison ... Your ability scores ... They are amazing . Absolutely amazing . Sugar . - Thank you . And in your evidence of ideology ... A bit erratic . But what think of our little world ? Have been creating a society fair , and they are doing ... But ? Go on , want to hear . But it is difficult to understand than to have equal out ... We do what we want here . This happens only because we were born with certain mental abilities ... Not equal , but at least is equal opportunity ... While forget the sacrifices , no contact with our previous life ... No marriage , no children . That part is hard to accept . - I know ... It takes time accept . Any other concerns ? Well ... Dime . - It 's just that ... Every time I hear good music , or see a great movie ... Is that our society will never more thing ... I know the constitution says the government should us all ... Equal , but ... - Are you sad ? Me too I am sad , much . Do you know this music ? Is Beethoven ... The ' Emperor Concerto ' . You imagine how I feel ... Knowing that I strive for a world ... Where no Beethoven never born . But it should be ... Not a word in the constitution ... Should only be ... Look at this ... Oh , god . The Bible tells us ... Do not want the alien ... But just as we do . It 's in our genes ... damn . Not only want their homes , their land , things ... Appearance also , talents , intelligence ... And when we want what belongs to others , hate ... And when we hate , what happens just saw . For thousands of years , this has happened . So if I choose ... Between this and remove what you saw ... I myself shoot Beethoven . Here is a copy , Harrison ... Look at it , analyze it well . And your plans on TV ... I will accept you . Come on , try it . Open , please . It 's very simple ...

It gives children something educational ... If invented this magical place ... Puppets , talking animals , , games and things like that ... But all will be equal . Whatever ... I thought that the idea would be fun to learn ... Instead of learning the constitution as such ... Could turn into a song ... The same with the alphabet . Make the task easier teachers . What about the children they see the program ? How . - Harrison , we can not force ... People to watch TV , if children who watch the program ... Learn more , we will raise them their mental bands . This destroys the idea . No one should learn from the TV . Leave discs in my desktop before you close , tomorrow the review . No problem . Administration will make an analysis in the semantic seminar starting in 15 minutes . Repeat ... Administration will make an analysis in the semantic seminar starting in 15 minutes . Mr. Chairman , I believe it is imperative is granted a reprieve ... In this situation . No , in any way . - But Mr. President , the Prime Minister ...

Monitored and recruited when he was 9 years ... Been here all the time . She does not know ... How could he do that ? - Because I believe in what we do . I believe this with all my strength .

I think we can stop this . I can make up that you did to test our security . I can fix it . The privileges of power , that is as egalitarian . So this is it ... The idea that 20 years ago intervened to save Phillipa . Is that a crime ? - No ... The crime is to sacrifice 300 million of minds , in the name ... Justice and welfare , as you violate the law when it suits them . Now is 300 million and one , because his daughter has porridge instead of brain . This was a tragic human error . But that does not hinder what we do here . What we do here is screwed up marriages computer garbage electronic control ... Not made them all equal , did the same , and that is very different . They are happy , Harrison , are happy . Yes , but I 'm fucking unhappy . And you know , I like , it 's real , I feel alive . All admire what you 're trying to do ...

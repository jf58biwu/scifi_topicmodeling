 Captain 's Log , Stardate 49655.2 . Our sensors have located a variety of flower which may prove to be a valuable nutritional supplement . I 've sent Mr. Neelix and Mr. Tuvok to collect samples . Whoa ! Smell that air , Mr. Vulcan ! Look at that sky ! Oh , it 's an exhilarating day , isn 't it ? As you well know by now , Mr. Neelix , I do not experience exhilaration . Oh , let 's not quibble about semantics . A breeze is blowing , the sun is shining . It 's beautiful . The weather is certainly adequate for our purposes . Adequate ? You know something ? You 're acting more " Tuvokian " than usual this morning . I am who I am , Mr. Neelix . It is impossible for me to be more or less like myself . There you go with the semantics again . But you know what I 'm talking about . I 'm afraid I don 't . Well , then , I 'll explain it to you . You 're a nature lover , aren 't you ? I appreciate nature , yes . It 's one of the things that you and I have in common . And here we are , on a perfect day , foraging for an exceptionally lovely variety of orchid- - your favorite flower- - and all you can say about the experience is that it 's adequate . I just ... I don 't see why you 're not having fun . We are not here to have fun . We are here to collect samples . Why ? is there some regulation that says we can 't do both at the same time ? I know . Why don 't , why don 't we sing a song while we toil , hmm ? It 'll cheer you up . I 've been studying Vulcan music . Uh ... do you know that lovely tune that starts : O starless night Of boundless black ... That " lovely tune " is a traditional funeral dirge . I know , but it was the most cheerful song I could find in the Vulcan database . Come on , Tuvok , join me . O starless night Of boundless black ... Mr. Neelix ... Yes ? Do you think you could possibly behave a little less ... like yourself ? Are Neelix and Tuvok back from the surface ? Not yet . We 're having some trouble with the transporter . Captain ... there 's a minor glitch in the molecular imaging scanners . Ensign Kim should have it up and running in a few minutes . Try narrowing the annular confinement beam . How 's that ? Let 's try it again . Kim to away team . Sorry for the delay . We 're ready to bring you back . Acknowledged . Energize . There 's something wrong , sir . I 'm only getting one pattern . Tuvok or Neelix ? I don 't think it 's either of them . Abort . It 's too late . Kim to Security . Intruder alert , Transporter Room 1 . Identify yourself . I 'm Lieutenant Tuvok . And I 'm Neelix . Sir , according to the bio-scanners , he 's right . Somehow their patterns have merged . I think the logical thing is for me to go to Sick Bay . And you recognize all of us ? Of course . Doctor , Captain Janeway , Ensign Kim ... Kes . My scans indicate that all biological matter was merged on a molecular level . Proteins , enzymes , DNA sequences . The man you see before you is literally a fusion of two men . But he 's surprisingly healthy , considering the circumstances . All vital signs are stable . What 's the last thing you remember ? I ... we ... that is to say , Tuvok and Neelix , we had just finished gathering the samples . We were beaming back to the ship . The next thing I knew , I was standing on the transporter pad as you see me now . I 'm also picking up traces of a third genetic pattern . It appears to be plant-based . The orchids . We had collected several dozen samples of orchids . They were in our sample containers when we beamed up . Well , they 're part of your genetic structure now . But they don 't appear to be affecting your biochemistry . Torres said you were having trouble with the molecular imaging scanners . That 's right . Maybe this alien plant life affected the scanners in some way . Possibly. I 'll know more after we 've run a diagnostic on the biofilters and transporter logs . Get on it . In the meantime , I 'll send an away team in a shuttlecraft to collect fresh samples of the orchid for further study . Doctor , let me know as soon as you have something more . Yes , Captain . Kes , take our patient to the Science Lab and perform a full bio-spectral analysis . I 'll start examining the genetic data . This situation must be very difficult for you , Kes . Perhaps it would be easier if someone else administered these tests . Thank you for your concern , but I 'll be fine . This scan is very delicate , so try to remain still for the next 20 minutes . I 'll do my best . Don 't worry . We 're going to figure it out . Oh , I 'm not worried . I couldn 't be in better hands . This crew , you 're consummate professionals . You 're my friends . My family . So worrying would be illogical , don 't you think ? Would you mind if I asked you some questions about what you 're going through ? Not at all . Well , do you feel as if you 're thinking with two minds- - two separate minds ? Are Neelix and Tuvok inside of you , talking to me , talking to each other ? If you mean am I suffering from some form of multiple personality disorder , I don 't think so . I do have the memories of both men , but I seem to have a single consciousness . You must find me very odd , Kes . No , of course not . Try to keep still . So ... what should I call you ? Ah , a name . I hadn 't thought of that . What an intriguing question . I can see why the Doctor is finding it so difficult to choose one . A name can have a significant effect upon a person 's sense of identity . I 've got it . What ? Why don 't you call me ... Neevok . Wait . This is better . How about Tuvix ? Tuvix it is . I 'm so glad you 're here to help me through this , sweeting . I 'm sorry . It was instinct . Why don 't we finish the scan . Chief Medical Officer 's Log , supplemental . Extensive microcellular scans on the merged humanoid have , thus far , yielded no clues to either a cause or a method of separation . Ah , Captain , so good of you to come . How are you feeling ? I feel well . You might even say ... exhilarated . I 'm glad to hear it . Well , that 's what I wanted to talk to you about . In the past 24 hours , I 've undergone rigorous diagnostic testing , submitted to an extensive psychological profile and I 've been poked and prodded in organs that I didn 't even know I had . While all this testing may no doubt be necessary ... frankly , I 'm restless . To tell you the truth , we could use a little help in the Mess Hall . And I 'd be glad to give you a hand . But ... after careful consideration , I 've decided that the most sensible thing for me to do is to resume the tactical post . Tactical ? Remember , Captain , I do possess Tuvok 's knowledge and expertise , and while I have no doubt that the crew misses Neelix 's cooking , you need your most experienced Tactical Officer . That 's me . If I may , Captain . Mr. Tuvix ... Tuvix ? Apparently , that 's what he likes to be called . Mr. Tuvix is , indeed , in perfect health . And since I 've collected all the data I need , there 's no reason I can 't continue my investigation without him for the time being . And , according to my tests , he 's quite correct when he says that he possesses Tuvok 's knowledge and expertise . He also possesses Tuvok 's irritating sense of intellectual superiority and Neelix 's annoying ebullience . I would be very grateful to you if you would assign him some duty . Any duty ... somewhere else . Well ... Mr. Tuvix ... I 'm not ready to assign you to the Bridge just yet , but why don 't you join the senior staff for our noon briefing , and we 'll see how it goes from there . Captain , has anyone ever told you that you are as fair-minded as you are lovely ? As a matter of fact , Neelix has told me that occasionally . And if you really do possess his memories ... you 'd know that flattery will get you nowhere . The transporter was functioning normally . Biofilters , pattern buffers , everything checked out . What about the problem with the molecular imaging scanners ? According to the transporter logs , they were optimal at the time of transport . It was a perfectly routine beam-out sequence . No anomalies , no power overloads , no malfunctions . Our scans of the planet 's surface and atmosphere don 't show anything out of the ordinary . There 's no evidence of any type of alien interference . Frankly , Captain , we 're at a loss . And the orchids , Kes ? Have you found anything unusual about them ? Commander Chakotay brought back a few samples on the shuttle and I ran a biochemical analysis . They contain the same elements as many plants : chloroplasts , lysosomal enzymes , cytoplasmic proteins , but there 's nothing unusual . There 's never been an accident like this recorded in the entire history of transporter technology . I 'm not willing to accept it as a random malfunction . Captain , I recommend we program a holodeck simulation , try recreating the accident . Sex . I beg your pardon ? What I mean to say is- - and I apologize for cutting you off , Commander- - l think we 're on the wrong track . Kes ... you said that the flowers you examined contained lysosomal enzymes . That 's right . According to Tuvok 's botanical research , the presence of lysosomal enzymes could be evidence of symbiogenesis . Symbiogenesis ? Symbiogenesis is a rare reproductive process . Instead of pollination or mating , symbiogenetic organisms merge with a second species . Andorian amoebae , for instance- - they 're able to merge with other single-celled organisms to form a third unique species . A hybrid . Like you . Exactly . It 's an interesting idea , but we 're talking about microcellular organisms here . I 've never heard of symbiogenesis occurring in a species as complex as a humanoid . Actually , Captain , when you think about it , Neelix and Tuvok were broken down to a microcellular level during transport- - DNA , protein , all in a state of molecular flux . And if the enzymes that cause symbiogenesis interacted with their DNA while they were in the matter stream , it might 've caused their patterns to merge . Like an Andorian amoeba . Just like that , Tuvix is born . It 's the best theory I 've heard so far . It 's the only theory I 've heard so far . And it 's worth investigating . Mr. Paris , take a shuttle to the planet and collect additional flower specimens . Yes , ma 'am , but I 'd recommend waiting until morning . The weather on the planet can get pretty nasty at night . Very well . You 'll depart at 600 hours . Good work , Mr. Tuvix . Kes . Oh , hello . Hello . Do you need something ? Actually , I was wondering if you 'd like to join me for dinner . Well , I , uh ... You 've already eaten ? Well , no . You 're not hungry ? Actually ... lf memory serves me , Wednesday 's the day that Neelix always cooked Trellan crepes- - your favorite meal ? That 's right . Well , why break with tradition just because of a little transporter accident ? Somebody 's eggs are burning ! Those are mine . Can you flip them for me ? I can 't find a spatula . Just ... try tossing them . Why don 't you have a seat ? I 'll be with you in a minute . Do you mind telling me what 's going on here , crewman ? We 're making dinner . I see . All right , everybody out ! On whose authority ? Chief of Security or Head Chef- - take your pick . Out , out , out ! Come , come . Out ! So you really enjoyed the crepes ? Oh , they were absolutely delicious . Don 't you think Neelix always made them a little too spicy ? These were a little different than usual . Did you change the recipe ? Only slightly . I thought more moderate seasoning would allow the flavor of the mushrooms to come through . I loved the mushrooms . I 'm glad . I can 't believe how disorganized this galley was . It 's a wonder Neelix ever found anything . He says he has a system . But I guess you already know that . I admire your strength , Kes . Why do you say that ? I know I 'm not Neelix , but I can posit with complete certainty that if the situation were reversed- - if suddenly he found himself without you in his life- - he 'd be absolutely lost . I have to go . Thanks again for dinner . Good morning , Captain . Commander . You 're here bright and early , Lieutenant . Actually , I 've been here since 0400 hours . I wanted to work on that proximity detector glitch in the security subroutine . And how 's it going ? I managed to correct it . Tuvok said it could take up to ten days to check out all the possible problems . How 'd you fix it so fast ? I had a hunch . " A hunch " ? That 's correct . You 'll have a report on your desk first thing this afternoon . Kim to Mr. Tuvix . Tuvix here . We 're just about ready to start the transporter tests , if you 'd like to join us . I 'm on my way . Excuse me , Captain . Well , he 's certainly fitting in , isn 't he ? There 's an old axiom : " The whole is never greater than the sum of its parts . " I think Tuvix might be disproving that notion . Give me the flowers from the airponics bay . Here you go . One prize-winning chrysanthemum ... one garden-variety clematis ... and last but not least ... one symbiogenetic alien orchid . I never thought that botanical science class would come in so handy . Torres to Transporter Room 1 . We 're ready down here . Acknowledged . Energizing . We 've made over 100 attempts to reverse the symbiogenesis using the medical transporter , and each time , this has been the unfortunate result- - complete cellular collapse . The genetic codes of the chrysanthemum and the clematis are so scrambled that the targeting scanners can 't recognize the original patterns . I suppose it would be like trying to extract the flour , eggs and water after you 'd baked the cake . Obviously , in the case of Mr. Tuvix , we 're dealing with a much more complex organism than a flower . In effect , we 're talking about recreating two humanoid life-forms without so much as a single discrete strand of DNA to start with . Are you saying I 'm going to be this way forever ? I am an incredibly skilled doctor and I will continue to pursue a safe and effective treatment until I find one ... but I won 't lie to you . I 'm not optimistic . It could take months , even years , to find a solution . And we must face the possibility that this condition is simply ... untreatable . I feel as though I 've lost two patients . I 'm sorry . I 'll inform the rest of the crew . Come in . I hope I 'm not disturbing you . It 's all right . Um , please ... sit down . Ocampan prayer tapers . For Tuvok and Neelix ? It 's funny ... if something happened to Tuvok , if Neelix were here , he 'd be the first person to comfort me . And if I lost Neelix ... Tuvok would be the first person to guide me spiritually . Now I don 't have either of them . You have me , Kes . Thank you . But ... I remind you of what you 've lost . It 's not your fault . I know , and I 'm trying to accept who I am now . Captain Janeway tells me there 's a place for me on this ship ... but I can 't help feeling like ... like some sort of impostor . Maybe we can help each other get through this . That 's what I 've been hoping . I know this is going to sound very strange to you ... perhaps even illogical ... since , in a way , we 've only known each other a few days . But I want you to know ... I love you , Kes . But I hardly know you . A-And besides , what about ... what about Tuvok 's wife , for one thing ? He was completely devoted to her . What happens when Voyager gets back home ? Are you just going to forget her ? I could never forget T 'Pel . I carry Tuvok 's love for her inside me and I would never ask you to forget Neelix . How can you talk this way ? Because I carry Neelix 's love for you inside me , as well , and I always will . You heard the Doctor . It could be years before he finds a way to bring Tuvok and Neelix back- - if ever . For you , that might be a lifetime . Please go . I 'm sorry . I should 've controlled my emotions . All I really came to say is that I 'll be here for you if you need me . Kes . Captain . I 'm sorry. I shouldn 't have bothered you this late . I 'll , uh , talk to you tomorrow . Actually , I was having trouble sleeping . I could use some company . Would you like some hot tea ? Please , sit down . I was just looking over some old letters Tuvok sent me when he was temporarily assigned to Jupiter Station . Most people would say his writing is cold , analytical , detached , but ... I 've always found it to be ... concise , efficient thoughtful . I hear his voice when I read the words . And Neelix ... I 'd become so fond of him , Kes . I can 't imagine what you 're going through . I wanted to talk to you about Tuvix . He came to see me this afternoon . Oh ? He said ... he said that he loves me . I suppose I can see how that 's possible , given the circumstances . I wasn 't sure what to say . At first I was angry , but I know how he 's trying to comfort me and I know that he feels alone , too . To tell the truth , he 's a wonderful person . Do you have feelings for him , too , Kes ? No , I don 't . I mean , how could I ? I still love Neelix ... and I 'm not ready to give up on him , no matter what the Doctor says . I know how you feel . You 're experiencing what people on this crew have been going through since we first got stranded in this Quadrant . Do we accept that we 're separated from our loved ones forever ? Or do we hold on to the hope that , someday , we 'll be with them again ? What do you do , Captain ? Oh ... I struggle with it every day . Sometimes , I 'm full of hope and optimism . Other times ... I dream about being with Mark and it 's so real . Then , when I wake up and realize it 's just a dream , I 'm terribly discouraged . In those moments , it 's impossible to deny just how far away he really is . And , uh ... I know that , someday , I may have to accept that he 's not part of my life anymore . So , are you saying that I should just accept that Neelix isn 't a part of my life anymore ? I would never tell you or anyone else to give up hope , Kes . I think the best thing you can do now ... is give yourself time . Thank you , Captain . I 'll go now and let you sleep . My door is always open to you , Kes . Captain 's Log , Stardate 49678.4 . It 's been two weeks since the transporter accident that created Mr. Tuvix and , while it 's still not entirely clear that he 's with us permanently , he 's certainly been doing his best to settle in . The crew seems to be growing accustomed to his presence , and he 's proving to be a very able Tactical Officer who isn 't afraid to express his opinions . While he 's forging relationships with many of the officers , he seems to be keeping a respectful distance from Kes , allowing her to adjust to the circumstances on her own terms . As for my relationship with Tuvix , I 've found him to be an able advisor , who skillfully uses humor to make his points . And although I feel a bit guilty saying it , his cooking is better than Neelix 's . My taste buds are definitely happy to have him around . Sick Bay to Ensign Kim . Please turn to your emergency medical holographic channel . How can I help you , Doc ? Suppose l found a radioisotope that could selectively attach itself to specific DNA sequences . Could the surgical transporters be reprogrammed to lock on to those enhanced sequences and separate them from the remaining DNA ? Well , I think so , but we 'd have to modify the molecular imaging scanners , and find a way to compensate for the higher levels of radiation . Thank you , Ensign . Wait a second . What 's going on ? It 's pure speculation at this point . I 'll let you know when I 've learned more . This is about Tuvix , isn 't it ? I 'm on my way . Eight ball , corner pocket . That 's game again , Commander . We 've created a monster . Best out of five ? Would you mind if we finished this later , Commander ? Not at all . Hi . Hi . How have you been ? Good days and bad days . You ? Me , too . Listen , I 'm sorry I 've been so distant lately . Kes , you don 't owe me an explanation . I 've been doing a lot of thinking . And I 'm hoping that we can be friends . I would like that very much . And I 'd like our friendship to grow . You would ? Yes . But it 's going to take time . I 'm not going anywhere . Doctor to Lieutenant Tuvix . Tuvix here . Please report to Sick Bay immediately . Until late in the 21st century , physicians administered barium to patients with certain gastrointestinal disorders . The radioactive properties of the barium made the lining of the intestines visible , with a primitive imaging technology called X rays . Instead of barium , we 've come up with a radioisotope that attaches itself to the DNA of one of the merged species , but not the other . Then we simply beam out the selected DNA , and segregate the two merged species . You see these ? They used to be a single merged flower . And you can use this same process ? It will require a more detailed reprogramming of the transporter , but , yes , I believe we can restore Mr. Tuvok and Mr. Neelix . That 's wonderful . Isn 't that wonderful ? I assure you , Mr. Tuvix , there 's nothing to worry about . We 've accounted for every variable . Except one . I don 't want to die . It 's funny ... if we 'd had the ability to separate Tuvok and Neelix the moment Tuvix came aboard ... I wouldn 't have hesitated . Of course not . But now ... in the past few weeks ... he 's begun to make a life for himself on this ship . He 's taken on responsibilities ... made friends ... I count myself as one of them . So , at what point did he become an individual and not a transporter accident ? Come in . You wanted to see me , Captain ? Yes , Mr. Tuvix . Please , sit down . I feel as though I 've been dragged in front of the Numirian Inquisition . Will you excuse us , Commander ? We 've just been discussing the unfortunate ... predicament that we 're all facing , and I thought it was important to get your perspective before making a decision . Are you suggesting that this is your decision to make ? I am the Captain of this ship . Begging your pardon , Captain , it 's my life . Isn 't it my decision ? Aren 't there two other lives to consider here ? What about Tuvok and Neelix- - two voices that we can 't hear right now ? As Captain , I must be their voice , and I believe they would want to live . But they are living , in a way . Inside me . It 's not the same . And I think you 'd agree with me . They have families . Friends . People who love them and miss them and want them back , just as I do . But restoring their lives means sacrificing mine . Captain ... what you 're considering is an execution . An execution- - like they used to do to murderers centuries ago- - and I 've committed no crime at all . Aren 't you arguing for an execution , too- - of Tuvok and Neelix ? I 'm here- - alive . Unfortunate as it may be , they 're gone . And I have an opportunity to bring them back . Don 't you think that I care about Tuvok and Neelix ? Of course I do ! Without them , I wouldn 't exist . In a way , I think of them as my parents . I feel like I know them intimately . Then you know Tuvok was a man who would gladly give his life to save another . And I believe the same was true of Neelix . You 're right , Captain . That is the Starfleet way . And I know there 'll be some people who will call me a coward because I didn 't sacrifice myself willingly . Believe me , I 've thought of that . But I have the will to live of two men . Look at me , Captain . When I 'm happy , I laugh . When I 'm sad , I cry . When I stub my toe , I yell out in pain . I 'm flesh and blood . And I ... have the right to live ! Kes ... I need your help . I 've just come from the Captain , and she 's thinking about forcing me to go through with the separation . If anybody can make a difference , Kes , it 's you . She 'll listen to you . We 've helped each other through this , and I know that you care about what happens to me . Please . Kes , you may be my only hope . Come in . Captain ... Tuvix has asked me to speak to you on his behalf . But I can 't . He shouldn 't have put you in the middle of this . But I am in the middle . I have been since the moment of the accident . I don 't know how to say good-bye to Neelix and Tuvok . I know this sounds horrible ... and I feel so guilty for saying it ... and Tuvix doesn 't deserve to die ... but I want Neelix back . You 're excused , Ensign . Mr. Paris , what is our present speed ? Warp 6.5 . I 'd like to conduct a field test of the aft sensor array . Please , slow to impulse . Commander ? Until the Captain makes a decision , Mr. Tuvix is still the Tactical Officer . Mr. Tuvix ? I 'd like to speak to you alone . Can I assume that you 've come to a decision , Captain ? I have . I think we all should hear what you have to say ! Please come with me , Mr. Tuvix . No . I 'm ordering you to come with me . Security to the Bridge . Commander , are you going to stand by and do nothing while she commits murder ? ! Wha .. ? Mr. Ayala ! Yes ... Lieutenant Paris ... you ... Doesn 't anyone see that this is wrong ? ! Let him go . Each of you is going to have to live with this ... and I 'm sorry for that . For you are all good ... good people . My colleagues . My friends . I forgive you . Commander Chakotay , advise the Doctor we 're on our way to Sick Bay . Deck 5 . I 'm sorry , Captain , but I cannot perform the surgical separation . I am a physician , and a physician must do no harm . I will not take Mr. Tuvix ' life against his will . Very well , Doctor . Please step aside . I assume this is the radioisotope . Please sit down on this bio-bed . Locking surgical targeting scanners onto the isotope probe . lnitiating separation sequence . Energizing . Neelix ! Hello , sweeting ! Greetings , Captain . Mr. Tuvok ... Mr. Neelix ... it 's good to have you back .

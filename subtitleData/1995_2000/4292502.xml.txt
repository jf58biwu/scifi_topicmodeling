 Ohh ! Oooh-ooh . [ Man ] " We 've given your grievances a lot of consideration . " Yeah . But no , don 't think you 're not expendable . No . He never once said I was doing a good job . All my hard work . Nobody ever stuck up for me . [ Panting ] They were all treated special . - All right , nobody moves ! - [ Woman ] Oh , no . Oh ! - Everybody stays ! - [ Woman Screams ] Shut up ! I said shut up ! Now listen to me ! Everyone listen to me . Okay , the children can go . Everybody else , nobody moves ! - I need the police , quick ! - Do you hear me ? I said , nobody else moves ! - [ Whimpering ] - [ Children Crying ] Come on ! Please don 't harm anyone . Get away ! I 'll shoot ! - You 're frightening these people . - I 'll do it ! Hey ! I will do it . They 've done nothing to you . Oh , you don 't know . Give me the gun . [ Sighs ] I am not a loser . No , you 're not . They made me do it . - [ Police Radio Dispatcher , Faint ] - They made me . But you 're not going to do it . [ Woman ] Can you believe this ? - You 're gonna show them . - [ Shouting , Faint ] You 're gonna show them . - [ Door Opens ] - [ Police Radio Dispatcher , Louder ] No ! - [ Gunshots ] - [ Patrons Screaming ] - [ Gunshot ] - [ Groaning ] [ Woman ] Stay down ! [ Sighs ] [ Panting ] I 'm gonna die . Nobody 's going to die . All right , folks , clear . Let 's move back . Move back now . [ Policeman ] Sorry . Back . Back , please . Where are the wounded ? - What ? - I 'm F.B.I. Where are the people who were shot ? Everybody 's inside , but you aren 't gonna find any wounded . - You the first medic on the scene ? - Yes , sir . - What happened ? - It doesn 't make any sense . We got a call that there 'd been a shooting- - at least one man was down- - but when we got here there wasn 't a damn thing to do . [ Woman Sobbing ] I 'm Special Agent Scully , F.B.I. I want to talk to somebody who can tell me what happened . I can tell you what I saw , but I don 't think there 's a man here who can tell you what happened . What did you see ? You should talk to this man . He was one of the ones shot . - You were shot ? - Right here . Right in the stomach . I felt the bullet enter me , and the next thing I remember was being on the foor . My legs and arms were numb , and I could taste blood in my throat . - Then I see the man 's face . - What man ? The same guy who tried to talk the gun guy out of hurting anyone . What did he do ? He touched me , and he said I was gonna be okay . Then all of the sudden I could feel my legs and arms again . - Who are you ? - My name is Fox Mulder . I 'm an F.B.I. agent . I understand you 've been read your rights . Will you talk to me , Mr. Muntz ? Can you tell me what happened ? God ... spared my life today . He took pity on my soul and He washed away my sins . How do you mean ? He reached down and He healed me with His hand , with the palm of His hand . Who did ? A man . A holy man . All I can think is , it must have been the good Lord Himself . - Did you talk to him ? - Who ? The shooter described a man who reached down and healed him with the palm of his hand . - He 's gone . - They let him leave the scene ? Well , nobody let him leave . He was in custody , they were talking to him , and somehow he just disappeared . - Just vanished ? - Without a trace . It struck me as I was sitting here . What ? Everything changes but the sea . What do you want from me ? I thought we might at least allow ourselves to reminisce . I have nothing to say to you . Really ? We used to have so much to say to each other . So many good times at the Mulder summer place . Your kids . Young and energetic . I remember water-skiing down there with Bill . He was a good water-skier , your husband . Not as good as I was , but then ... that could be said about so many things . Couldn 't it ? I 've repressed it all . Well , I find that hard to believe . Particularly since I 've come here today ... to ask you to remember something . Something I 'm going to have to ask you to try very hard to recollect . [ Shutter Clicking ] Yeah , he gave his name as Jeremiah Smith of Suitland , Virginia . He gave a P.O. box that 's turned out to be a phony . He had no driver 's license . All the cars in the parking lot have been accounted for ? Yeah , which means he must 've walked from somewhere nearby . We 've got a canvas out . - And you talked to him personally . - Yeah . Damnedest thing , and I swear this is how it happened . I look down at my notebook to write something , I look up , the guy 's not standing there anymore . It was like he just disappeared . - [ Van Engine Starts ] - [ Phone Beeps ] Thank you . - Mulder . - [ Woman ] This is Asst. Director Skinner 's office . - Would you please hold for him ? - Yeah . - Agent Mulder . - Uh-huh . - I just received a call here that might cause you some alarm . - What is it ? Your mother 's just been admitted to a hospital in serious condition . A small coastal town in Rhode Island called , uh , Quono- - Quono chontaug ? I 'm on my way . [ Machinery Beeping ] The nurse said she had a stroke . They don 't yet know the nature or severity of it , but the doctor 's on his way down . She 's cold . Mulder , I don 't want to jump to conclusions . I don 't want you to think the worst . People recover from these situations all of the time . Mom . She hasn 't been able to speak . She 's been in and out of consciousness . - How did she get here ? - [ Nurse ] A 9-1-1 call came in . The paramedics from Shelter Harbor ... found her on the foor of the house . Mom . Hi . It 's okay . Everything 's gonna be okay . What is it ? What do you want ? I think she wants something to write on . Palm ? [ Door Slides Open ] [ Doctor , Paramedics Conversing ] She 's had what 's called a subarachnoid hemorrhage . But they 're very hopeful because the circulation was restored so quickly . She 's gonna be under constant supervision ... and the best care in the hospital up in Providence . It could be a lot worse . - Thanks . - You okay ? Yeah , I 'm , um- - I just can 't help thinking there 's a correlation . Correlation ? A connection to the shootings at the fast food restaurant . I 'm sorry , l- - I don 't understand . My mother wrote the word " palm . " That 's what the man who healed the victims used- - the palm of his hand . Y-You think it 's a leap ? Mulder , there 's no deep mystery here . Your mother is at the right age ... for something like this to happen . Yeah , but why the word " palm " ? Well , there could be several reasons . But to be honest , I don 't think it means anything . Her brain and her thought processes ... have been- - have been radically changed by what 's happened . It could very well have affected her center of speech , her language . But you can 't explain it exactly . Nor can it be explained how the wounded were miraculously healed ... or how the man who healed them vanished into thin air . I 'm sure it can and will be . Mulder , I 'm gonna drive you to the nearest motel . - It 's been a very long day . - I wanna go back to D.C. - To do what ? - Find out who this miracle man is . This is everything shot by the first news crew on the scene . Outtakes and unedited footage . - Did they get any tape of the man in question ? - Yeah , at 8 : 22 . [ Mulder ] There . That must be him . - [ Scully ] Whoa ! What happened there ? - Yeah , he 's gone . Where did he go ? - Did you see that ? - Y-Yeah . It 's like he 's gone , but there 's somebody else in his place ... wearing the same clothes . Could that be another detective ? - Why don 't you find out . - Where are you going ? If I told you , you 'd never let me go . - Mulder , you haven 't slept in almost 24 hours . - Call me if you find anything . [ Sighs ] No , not at this point . [ Radio : Dispatcher , Indistinct ] - [ Radio : Indistinct ] - [ Agent ] All right . Wait , wait- - [ Thunder Rumbling ] He was here with her . What ? With your mother . The cancer man . - What are you talking about ? - Maybe I can bring you up to speed , Agent Mulder . - Did you take these ? - They had quite an argument , as you might gather . You seem surprised . Surely you were aware they knew each other . Or what brought them here together . I don 't know . - Did he hurt her ? - No . No , she collapsed after he left . If I hadn 't been here to make the call , she might not have survived . What did they argue about ? I don 't know . I was forced to keep a discreet distance . You must 've had some idea , or else you wouldn 't have followed them here . He wants something from her , something she may have kept in this house . Unless you know another reason they would 've chosen to meet here . The day my parents divorced , my mother vowed never to set foot in this summer house again . I know my mother . She kept her word . It could be something very old . Certainly something very important . I have no idea what that could be . - No idea at all ? - No . Sir ? - Excuse me . I- - - Yes ? - Are you Jeremiah Smith ? - Yes . I 'm afraid there 's been some mistake . I saw my photo on the news saying I fed a crime scene . I 'm here to turn myself in . Uh , would you come with me , sir ? Mm-hmm . From the moment I stepped from the crowd and asked the man to put down his gun , it seemed like ... a dream , as if I was out of my body . There were reports- - somewhat fantastic reports- - about what happened next . I know . I saw the news reports . I 'll have to say that I don 't remember any of it . - Nothing . - You gave me a wrong address , sir . Then you left the crime scene during the interview . I don 't remember that . I 'm sorry . What do you remember , Mr. Smith ? I remember showing up for work the next day , being at my desk . That 's my first recollection . At the Social Security Administration ? I 'm not sure what I 've done wrong . You haven 't done anything wrong , sir . May I go ? Yes . But until this matter is resolved completely , I 'd ask that you notify us if you 'll be out of town for any reason . [ Sighs ] Agent Scully ? This becomes a responsibility , a thing that I 'm now called upon to put right and put down . Certainly you expected nothing less . I 'm not ashamed of my actions . " Ashamed " ? You 're not allowed the luxury of human weakness and penitence . You 're not allowed to put your indulgences ahead of the greater purpose . I no longer believe in " the greater purpose . " Then your fate is just . My justice is not for you to mete out . You may have reason . You have no right . You have no means either . You presume to dictate duty to me ? Have you any idea what the cost of your actions is ? What their affect might be ? Who are you to give them hope ? What do you give them ? We give them happiness , and they give us authority . The authority to take away their freedom under the guise of democracy . Men can never be free ... because they 're weak , corrupt , worthless ... and restless . The people believe in authority . They 've grown tired of waiting for miracle and mystery . Science is their religion . No greater explanation exists for them . They must never believe any differently ... if the project is to go forward . At what cost to them ? The question 's irrelevant , and the outcome inevitable . The date is set . At what cost to them for your own selfish benefit ? How many must die at your hand ... to preserve your stake in the project ? [ Knocks On Door ] I 'm not impressed by your miracles or moved by your trickery . Your justice will be meted out . By whom this time ? And by what tool ? By those who possess the tool of your destruction . Hold his calls . - I want his name , I want to know everything about him . - Excuse me ? I want the smoking man exposed to be the murdering son of a bitch that he is . What 's your problem , Mulder ? - Where have you been ? - At our summer house . He was there with my mother . He 's the reason for what happened to her . - Where did you get these ? - It doesn 't matter where I got those . The thing that matters is that that man is called to answer . I want his name ! - I don 't know his name ! - You know how to get it ! - These men don 't have names ! - Then you tell me how to find him ! There was a time when I might have been able to tell you how to contact him , but that time has passed . He knows about the man that disappeared from the restaurant shooting . - What are you talking about ? - He 's trying to kill him . - He just came in yesterday . He turned himself in . - What ? He- - He gave a statement . - Where is he now ? - He works for the Social Security Administration . We 're looking for Jeremiah Smith . Mr. Smith ? - Hello . - I 'm with the F.B.I. I 'd like you to come with me . For what ? I 've told you everything I know . I thought they said you 'd call if there was anything . I 'm sure you don 't want to cause a scene at work , sir . No , of course not . I 'll come along . Can you tell me where you 're taking me ? We 'll have plenty of time to talk , sir . Hey ! Watch it ! What 's his problem ? - Do you see him ? - No , I lost him . It 's only a matter of time now . You put me in a cage within a cage . Why are you so afraid of me ? - I 'm not . - Yes , you are . You live in fear . That 's your whole life . You don 't know anything about me . I know everything about you . You think the miracles I perform are the extent of my power . You think you 're God . You 're a drone , a cataloger . Chattel . What you 're afraid of is , they 'll believe I am God . It doesn 't matter . Most of them have ceased to believe in God . Why ? Because God presents them with no miracles to earn their faith . You think when man ceases to believe in miracles , he rejects God ? - Of course . - You rule over them in God 's name . They don 't believe in Him , but they still fear Him . They 're afraid not to , because they 're afraid of freedom . And you give them happiness . We appease their conscience . Anyone who can appease a man 's conscience ... can take his freedom away from him . And if you can 't appease their conscience , you kill them . But you can 't kill them all . You can 't kill their love , which is what makes them who they are , makes them better than us , better than you . You talk . I 'm not one of you . No . All you want is to be a part of it , to be one of the commandants when the process begins . But you are wrong . Oh , am I ? Yes . You are dying of lung cancer . That 's a lie . You think it 's a lie ? You want to save your life . And you ? We had been hopeful , but there was substantial blood loss during the stroke event ... which had put a lot of pressure on the brain . - Will she regain consciousness ? - I know this is hard , but she may not . - I can be paged if you need me . - Thank you . [ Click ] You gonna smoke that , or you wanna smoke on this ? Are you giving me a choice ? I should shoot you right here , but they 'd probably save you . Do it . Do it , Agent Mulder . Or maybe put a bullet through your brain so you 'll be bedridden like my mother . - How is she ? - What do you care ? I 've known your mother since before you were born , Fox . I don 't care . I 'd gone to see her recently . Yeah , and I know what you were looking for . I wasn 't looking for anything . It 's what she was looking for , actually . - She contacted me . - You 're a liar ! I had information , possibly , on the whereabouts of your sister . Where is she ? Where is she ? It seems the man who had the information has disappeared . I have what you want . There 's nothing I want , Agent Mulder , except to see how your mother 's doing . How is Mrs. Mulder ? [ Beeping ] Do you have it ? - Do you have it ? - Yes . - Give it to me . - I can 't do that . - It 's of no value to you . - And to you ? When the time comes , when the truth is finally determined , its value will soar . - Why ? - I think you know why , Agent Mulder . [ Tires Screeching ] It 's a weapon , isn 't it ? Used to pierce the back of the neck . It 's the only way we can kill them . A simple gunshot won 't do . Why do you want it ? They will kill you for it , Agent Mulder . That 's a fact . They 'll stop at nothing for it , nothing . Even if they have to martyr you and risk turning your work into a crusade . Let me get clear on something here . What we 're talking about is colonization . The date is set , isn 't it ? Give me the weapon , Agent Mulder . No . You shoot me and you 'll never find it . I ought to shoot you anyway . After everything I 've given you . I 'm walking away . You 're a dead man , Agent Mulder . One way ort he other . [ Dial Tone , Dialing ] [ Knock On Door ] - [ Knocking Continues ] - [ Beeps Off ] Who is it ? Jeremiah Smith . Please let me in . [ Hammer Cocks ] I want you to put your hands up where I can see them . Okay , I want you to keep your hands up . I 'm gonna unlock the door . I want you to count to five , come in , close the door and lock it behind you . Keep your hands up , please . I have important information for you , something your partner has been seeking . It concerns an elaborate plan- - a project- - and his sister . Why didn 't you tell me before ? I 've never spoken to you before . The man you spoke to was an impostor sent here to kill me . Who are you ? I 'll explain everything . [ Phone Rings ] [ Ringing Continues ] - Yeah . - Scully , it 's me . - Mulder , where are you ? - I 've been up with my mother . Listen to me- - Mulder , listen to me . There 's somebody here you need to talk to . - Who ? - Jeremiah Smith . Get out of your apartment . They 're looking for him . I want you to meet me . - Where ? - Off the l-95 . Bond Mill Road . [ Mulder ] Scully ! Scully , move away from him . Come stand behind me . I 've come to you at great risk . I mean you no harm . I have a long and complicated story to tell you . - He knows about your sister . - How do I know you 're for real ? - I was at that restaurant . I healed those people . - Yes , but how ? I can explain everything to you . First I want you to come somewhere with me . Come with me to see my mother .

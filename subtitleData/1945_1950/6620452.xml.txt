Kobe Yamanote Nakazato Nakazato Chemical Laboratory Dr. Kenzo Nakazato , Director If an object were completely black , it wouldn ´ t reflect light , - so it wouldn ´ t be visible to the naked eye . - But we can see black objects . That ´ s because they ´ re not completely black . If you could manipulate the color to make it truly black , you wouldn ´ t be able to see it . Hold on , you ´ re forgetting the most important thing . - Really ? What is it ? - The shadow . Even if an object were not visible , so long as it didn ´ t allow light to pass through , it would still cast a shadow . Mind your own business . Soon , I ´ ll be able to make anyone invisible . - l ´ m working on a black paint . - Good luck . I ´ m on the verge of success in research diametrically opposed to yours . Diametrically opposed ? Yes , to render an object invisible . A method that allows light to pass through so that ... the object is not visible , and furthermore , does not cast a shadow . You can ´ t make everything invisible . And yet I can . Not that you ´ d understand . - What did you say ? - Didn ´ t you hear me ? Don ´ t argue . Dr. Segi , you and Dr. Kurokawa are my top proteges . Both of your research has merit . What can I do if you ´ re going to be rivals ? I know , I ´ ll give the Nakazato Award to the one who completes his research first . You ´ re willing to give us the award ? Is there something you ´ d rather have instead ? - Sir . - Sir . There is nothing I would cherish more than to marry your daughter . My daughter ? - I also have deep feelings for Machiko . - You , too ? Which of them do you like ? Dr. Segi , but Dr. Kurokawa isn ´ t bad either . Good grief , you might want to make up your mind . Both of them asked at the same time . I ´ m not ready to answer either of them yet . So you turned them both down ? Yes . I think it ´ s for the best for all concerned . I suppose your right . I met President Kawabe . Hurry up and get ready . - Where is he going to take you ? - We ´ re going to see the Takara Revue . - lsn ´ t that nice . - That ´ s why I like him . I see , those two must be really competitive . You can ´ t imagine . In any event , it was interesting that Dr. Kurokawa ´ s research matched my own . - What did he say when you told him ? - I haven ´ t told him . I ´ ve been secretly conducting research to ... render objects invisible for over 1 0 years . Is such a thing possible ? Yes , of course . I ´ ve already completed the experimental agent . Really ? - Stop jerking my chain . - l ´ m not joking . You professors have a strange sense of humor . I would be happy to show you in private . Don ´ t bother . Mr. Kawabe . You thought I was fooling . Take a look . All right . I named this agent the atomina invisibilitator . It ´ s an invisible element . It synthesizes with other materials to make them invisible . What do you think ? Indeed , it is invisible . Next , I ´ ll try it on a living specimen . What kind of a living specimen ? Here , touch it . Sure enough , it ´ s still there . This is weird . Have you tried it on a human specimen ? I believe it is possible . However , it unfortunately has not proved successful yet . Why not ? I don ´ t have an agent to restore the individual ... a reducing agent . Furthermore , it has rather alarming side effects . - So this drug is worthless ? - No , it ´ s very valuable . - lt ´ s just a matter of time . - lsn ´ t this grand ? Professor , you must grant me the rights to this discovery . Not a chance . Who knows what could happen if this discovery fell into the wrong hands ? Please leave such concerns to me . - No way . - I see . How disappointing . I would very much like to try it on a human subject . Yes , it ´ s very tempting . I ´ ve often thought that if I couldn ´ t find a suitable subject , I ´ d try it on myself . I can only imagine . Mr. Kawabe , hurry up . We ´ re both waiting . Well , then , shall we go ? Takara Revue Ryuko Mizuki seems extremely popular . She ´ s Dr. Kurokawa ´ s little sister . Really ? We should have invited him , and we could all have dinner together . Great , then I ´ ll telephone him . I ´ m ashamed to say that I ´ ve never actually seen her show . You should be ashamed . You should come to the show tomorrow . If I can find the time . You make the effort . Everyone loves her . - lsn ´ t that right , Machiko ? - Yes . I ´ m so happy for her . Hey , Mizuki , look at this . You have a lot of autographs to sign . Dr. Kurokawa , you ´ ll be famous one day , thanks to your research . I hope so . I have great hopes for your success . Thank you . Machiko , we should give Ryuko a broach or something to commemorate the occasion . That ´ s a fine idea . Tenpodo Jewelers - May I help you ? - l ´ m looking for a broach . How about something like this ? - lt ´ s all right . - How about this one ? What do you think ? I see . I can give you $ 5 million for it . Really ? Hatanaka , I ´ m not sure about this . Madam , I ´ m afraid we can ´ t part with it for that price . - From where we ´ re sitting , it ´ s a very reasonable ... - Please sir , This piece is called ´ Amour Tears ´ . It ´ s belonged to a famous dynasty ... Please call the owner to look at it . Unfortunately , he ´ s unavailable . I ´ ll summon the executive manager . Please wait just a moment . Who are you ? ! . Machiko , I heard the cat meowing . Really ? I haven ´ t seen him around . Me neither . I wonder where he went . That ´ s his voice . Isn ´ t it ? Yes , he ´ s somewhere around here . - I don ´ t see him . - I can hear him in this room . Mom ! Mom ! - Hurry ! - What ´ s the fuss ? Look ! What ´ s happening ? Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Mom , something ´ s wrong ! Mice I see ... They can ´ t be seen . These animals are invisible . Now I understand . - Kurokawa . - What ? I guess the victory goes to you . I had no idea that your hypothesis was backed by Dr. Nakazato ´ s research . You win . No , I wouldn ´ t regard this level of experimentation as success . I assumed that the goal was to get it to work on a human being . Mom ! Somebody left this letter at the door . This is your father ´ s handwriting . Machiko , please read it . " l ´ m sure that you must be surprised about my sudden disappearance . " ln order to test the effects of the invisibility agent ... " l am following my own course of action . " l ask that you don ´ t worry and remain calm . " l ´ ll be home in two or three days . " l ask that you refrain from contacting the police . " - Your father . " ´ If we can find who brought the letter , we ´ ll know where your father is . Did you see anyone come by just now ? - No , I didn ´ t . - Can I borrow your car ? - Go ahead . - Thanks . - Straight ahead . - OK . Mr. Segi , what happened ? It ´ s no good . We couldn ´ t find him . I do hope father is all right , being involved in those experiments . The professor said that he was willing to sacrifice himself for the experiment . - He said , " Sacrifice " ? - Yes . It ´ s the conscience of an academic , I presume . - Can ´ t we do anything , Mom ? - I don ´ t know . If there was a human subject other than himself that he ... could use the invisibility agent on , he would have done so . I ´ d trade places with him if I could . Mr. Kurokawa , the professor said that your research was the same as his . Yes , it is . I ´ ll be back . Mr. Kurokawa . This would seem to be a perfect chance to win Machiko ´ s heart , if you could rescue her father . Chin up , I ´ m on your side . Mr. Kawabe . Just between you and me , Dr. Nakazato developed the invisibility drug in secret . Really ? I had no idea . There ´ s nothing I can do by myself . I understand . But everyone ´ s on pins and needles , so you should tell everyone that you know where he probably went . How about it ? Take a vacation for a couple of days . I ´ ll pay . Thank you . Mr. Kurokawa . There ´ s someone here to see you . Please go in . - You ´ re Mr. Kurokawa ? - Yes . Dr. Nakazato sent me here secretly . - The doctor ? - Yes . He wants to see you as soon as possible . Let ´ s go right now . Konan Apartments Professor , I ´ ll meet you as promised . Kenzo Nakazato Dr. Nakazato , I presume . I ´ m the store manager , Mr. Tanimoto . I apologize that the owner is away . Please sit down . So ... what can I do for you today ? I ´ m looking for a diamond necklace . I want you to give me the Amour Tears . Oh , yes . The necklace ... We decided not to buy it , so the lady took it home . Then , show me your safe . The safe ? You must be joking ! Show me the safe ! Are you threatening me ? Get out , before I call the police . This is no idle threat . Don ´ t underestimate me . You talk pretty tough . Maybe you want to be arrested . Try it . I ´ ve had enough . Get out . All right , look at me ! Show me the safe or I ´ ll kill you ! I will . I will ! Help ! Hurry , call the police ! Oh , fudge ! I ´ m leaving , but I ´ ll be back ! Nakazato Although all evidence points to Dr. Nakazato , it ´ s difficult to explain why the criminal would leave behind so much evidence . Suzuki , go to Dr. Nakazato ´ s home and see if anything has been stolen . - Also , find out what he ´ s been up to . - Yes , sir . It ´ s curious that he was only interested in one particular piece ... of jewelry and didn ´ t just rob the place . Tanaka , go to the Sannomiya Hotel ... - and check on the woman who was trying to sell the jewelry . - Yes , sir . By the way , Mr. Tanimoto , is it possible that ... the disappearance of the perpetrator was a hallucination on your part ? Impossible ! Watch where you ´ re going , mac ! What do you have to say for yourself ? - Give me your clothes ! - What are you talking about ? Take off your clothes and give them to me ! Thanks ! Hey ! Ouch ! What are you doing ? ! Say something ! Say something ! Excuse me , where are you going , sir ? Are you talking to me ? Thank you for asking . Mysterious Invisible Man Appears in Kobe ! Mystery of the Century : . The Invisible Man Appears ! Is Missing Dr. Nakazato the Invisible Man ? . - That ´ s all . - I see . Segi . Your boss was quite a clever fellow . Look ... Pay attention . Wow , a secret opening . Don ´ t touch , we have to dust for fingerprints . I see . I can ´ t read it . This is your specialty . " Should I die , I bequeath all rights to my findings to Ichiro Kawabe . " ´ This could be useful . Wait , that belongs to the doctor . We need to have his handwriting analyzed . What ´ s in his notebook ? It records the results of the atomina invisibilitator trials . - Does it say how to make it ? - No . - I wouldn ´ t have expected it to . We ´ d have to ask Dr. Nakazato directly . " Unfortunately , it is not possible for animals that have ... " been rendered invisible to return to their former state . " Animals made invisible remain that way until they die . " This is the first reason why I would hesitate to use this research on a human subject . " The second reason is that this agent has the side effect of progressive abnormalities ... " to the nervous system , and subjects become extremely violent within two or three days . " ´ Segi , this is serious . The city is being ripped apart by crimes committed by an invisible man . Then , he stood up like this and took off his bandages . He had no face , no neck ... I was terrified . And also ... It ´ s the cat . You ´ re really rattled over this invisible man . You can laugh because you didn ´ t see him . I ´ d be happy to meet him once , if it would put your mind at ease . So you want to meet me ? ! You do want to meet me ? Damn ! Are you all right ? Tell him nothing ´ s wrong . It ´ s all right . I was just playing around . Tell him everything is all right ! Everything ´ s all right in here . OK . Good . You did well . Where ´ s the diamond necklace ... the Amour Tears ? I ´ ll tell you . I ´ ll tell you ... Sannomiya Hotel , room 26 . Thank you for your inquiry , I ´ ll get back to you shortly . - Please excuse me . - Thank you for coming . Hatanaka , - maybe we should settle for their offer . - No , ma ´ am . If we hold out a little longer , I ´ m sure we can get $ 7 million . Will $ 1 million do ? Who ´ s there ? Give me that necklace ! It ´ s the invisible man ! Give me the Amour Tears ! Ma ´ am , stand over here ! Damn you ! Damn you ! You ´ re not going to stand in my way ! - Miss Mizuki , help me . ! - What ´ s wrong ? - The invisible man is in my room ! - This way , hurry ! Open up ! You ´ re dead meat ! Hello , please connect me to the police . The invisible man is here ! Fool ! Trifle with me , will you ? ! Please hurry . We ´ re in room 25 . Please ! Ryuko Mizuki . Invisible man strikes again ! City in Fear of Invisible Man ! Professor ´ s Discovery Sold to the Devil ! What is the True Identity of the vil Invisible Man ? . Various Sources Name Dr. Nakazato As the conservator of Dr. Nakazato ´ s research , I regard the situation as a tragedy . The professor is a gentle man , and even with the drug , I don ´ t believe that he is capable of robbery and murder . I don ´ t know what to do . We have to do something to locate the professor , and discover the identity of the invisible man . Oh , please do , Mr. Segi . You ´ re the only one I can count on . Machiko , cheer up . OK ? Thank you , Dr. Segi . It ´ s only me ! I ´ m not the invisible man . You gave me a start . I ´ m sorry . Please forgive me . Actually , Machiko , I discovered something very surprising about Dr. Kurokawa . - Kurokawa ? - Yes . He appears to have been kidnapped that evening . What are you talking about ? How do you know about this ? I hired a private dick . Kurokawa appears ... to have known the identity of the invisible man and therefore posed a threat . By the way , Dr. Segi , it ´ s my understanding that you and Dr. Kurokawa were in some kind of competition , and the winner would have Machiko ´ s hand in marriage ? Oh , yes . That ´ s true . Then it must have been frustrating when you learned that you lost . Yes . Kurokawa must be quite satisfied . He bested you both in his research and in love . You ´ ll have to excuse me . Segi . Don ´ t be so discouraged . I ´ m on your side . But you have to stay away from Machiko , don ´ t arouse suspicious , and just lay low . Kobe Police Station Professor , please take care of Ryuko Mizuki . The invisible man must be nuts for jewels . This is a famous piece , he must want it bad . His obsession with it is frightening . - l ´ m worried sick . - l ´ ve got it ... Until you can sell it , I ´ ll take full responsibility for its safekeeping . It ´ s no good . Yes ? Who ´ s there ? Ryuko , it ´ s Segi . Please come in . I ´ m sorry to intrude . Ryuko , it ´ s about your brother . Will you take me to his apartment ? He said he was going to pack for a trip . He returned to the room and left shortly thereafter . He left with another man . Did anyone visit Mr. Kurokawa after that ? Nope , just you . I figured as much . - Thank you . - Take as much time as you like . Kawabe knew that that your brother had been kidnapped , - even without having checked into it . - Really ? He might know the whereabouts of your brother and the professor , and even the identity of the invisible man . - Do you think he knows so much ? - Yes . Ryuko , I talked to lnspector Matsubara , and he wants your help to catch Kawabe red-handed . All right . I ´ ll do whatever I can to help . Don ´ t you think ? It ´ s a fine piece . It ´ s flawless . Mr. Kawabe , would you like to make an offer ? I ´ m happy to have the chance to buy it . How does $ 8 million sound ? You ´ ll buy it ? That ´ s wonderful . Thank you very much . But are you sure you want to buy it ? It ´ s not like you were looking for it . If Machiko likes it , I am definitely interested . Well , isn ´ t that romantic . I ´ ll telephone and have a check drafted . Give this to lnspector Matsubara . It ´ s the invisible man ! Darn it ! You must be Ryuko Mizuki . Give me the diamond necklace . Give it to me , if you value your life ! Professor . Professor Nakazato , why do you want the necklace ? Shut up ! Go ! Get out ! - Darn it ! - Freeze ! - After him ! Stop ! Nakazato Chemical Laboratory - Who ´ s there ? - Segi , it ´ s me . Kurokawa . Kurokawa ? You ´ re the invisible man ? Yes , it was me . I knew it wasn ´ t Dr. Nakazato . Dr. Nakazato betrayed me . I hate him . - No , you got it all wrong . - Why ? You ´ re being tricked . Talk to me , tell me what happened after Dr. Nakazato disappeared . OK , we ´ ll talk . Please listen . Can I have a cigarette ? Thank you . The professor sent a man to meet me in front of my apartment We got in the car ... I ´ m sorry for the inconvenience . We ´ re under strict orders . This is necessary to maintain secrecy . We ask for your cooperation . Finally , when they removed the blindfold , I was in a basement room and I could vaguely hear the sound of ocean waves . Dr. Nakazato is going to take the invisibility agent . He wants to use it on a human subject to observe the side effects . He said that he wants you to watch and get your feedback . This is bad ... Please use the drug on me instead of Dr. Nakazato . - You want to take it instead of the professor ? - Yes . Really ? You ´ re very selfless . Please come this way . Dr. Nakazato either honored my offer or pushed me to do it . Mr. Kurokawa , the professor is waiting in the next room . He wants to try to talk you out of it before you take the invisibility drug . Please just tell him that you want to do it . Dr. Nakazato . Dr. Nakazato . Dr. Nakazato . It ´ s Kurokawa . Kurokawa , you ´ ve come to rescue me ? . Thank you . Don ´ t worry , sir . I ´ m counting on you . Hurry , while there ´ s still time . All right . I ´ ll do it immediately . Mr. Kurokawa , shall we begin ? Have a seat . The doctor betrayed me . He turned me into the invisible man , but he wouldn ´ t restore me to visibility . Mr. Kurokawa , the professor said that he was a man of few sympathies . He wants to observe the side effects of the subject becoming extremely violent . He ´ s grateful that you volunteered to do this . Please feel free to indulge your violent impulses . Please ask the professor , I want to be turned back to normal ! Is that what you really want ? Yes , it is . Please . So you ´ re willing to do anything to be visible ? Yes , anything ! Anything for the reducing agent . It ´ s a deal . I ´ ll tell you the terms . He ordered me to get the Amour Tears necklace . I was left to my own devices on how to get it . I ´ ve been struggling to suppress my increasingly violent instincts . Now , my sister , Ryuko , has become my enemy in my quest for the necklace . I can ´ t take it . Segi , you have to help me . Please , get the reducing drug . Please save me ! Please ! I know you can get it . Make me visible again ! " Unfortunately , it is not possible for animals that have been rendered invisible ... " to return to their former state . Animals made invisible remain that way until they die . " ´ Please help me . Please . I ´ ll figure it out . Don ´ t worry . I thought I heard you talking . I guess you were just talking to yourself . I was agitated because my research isn ´ t going well . - Is that why you said , " l ´ ll figure it out " ? - Yes . Please forget about any competition you had with Kurokawa , and just do good work . I ´ m sure I ´ ll be able to develop the invisibility agent . That ´ s wonderful . My prayers are with you . Thank you . I hope that you end that competition you have with Kurokawa . That was just between the two of us . No , when I first heard about it , I realized that I would marry one of you , and the other would be out of luck . I didn ´ t want any part of it . Now I realize that I was wrong . Oh , really ? The one I really want to marry is you , darling . Just a second now . You don ´ t have to make a decision . - You ´ re the man for me . - You mustn ´ t say that . You never wanted to marry me , did you ? I understand . I don ´ t care . Son of a gun ! I ´ ll get you for this . Who put you up to this ? Tell me ! Please , don ´ t make me tell you his name . He ´ ll kill me . Don ´ t worry . No one ´ s going to say that it was you who told us . Tell us at the police station . Please , my life ... I don ´ t want to die ! What ´ s got you so spooked ? Is the invisible man really so scary ? You were dressed up as the invisible man and tried to steal this necklace . Calm down ! Let ´ s go downtown . You can tell us everything there . I have the Amour Tears . Give me the antidote . Hey , you finally got it . Let ´ s have a look . It ´ s beautiful . Is this some kind of joke ? This is a fake . That ´ s impossible . No , it ´ s very possible . These are glass beads . Gimme a break ! It ´ s fake ! What a laugh , he took the fake and left . What a dope . - l ´ m glad everything worked out . - I thought he had really stolen it . That was Miss Mizuki ´ s idea . Mr. Kawabe , what do you think of my scheme ? Yes , well , thanks to your clever planning , I can still buy it and give it to Machiko . How true . What do you think , Machiko ? Do you like it ? It ´ s beautiful . It looks good on you . I wonder why the check hasn ´ t arrived yet . Hey , the necklace was a fake . Drat . They outfoxed us . Given the circumstances , I ´ ll take Machiko to my villa in Suma , and we ´ ll get the invisible man to steal it . There ´ s no time to waste . I ´ d like to see Mr. Segi . - l ´ ll take you to the lab . - Please excuse me . I have some good news . My private dick found the professor and he took him to my villa in Suma . - Mom ! - That ´ s a relief . I ´ ll go tell everyone . Machiko , wait . I have an idea . I ´ d like your permission to go with Machiko and bring the professor back secretly . Oh , that ´ s no problem . Machiko , let ´ s hurry up and meet your father . Let ´ s go . Get in . - See you later . - Please look out for her . Gadzooks , it ´ s the cops ! Let ´ s go ! Ma ´ am , Mr. Kawabe is using your husband as a ruse to kidnap Machiko . What should we do ? She ´ s also wearing the Amour Tears necklace . This looks bad . Mom , Machiko is in danger . He took Machiko to his villa in Suma . This is my chance . It ´ s the invisible man ! After him ! Mr. Segi , we finally discovered ... the criminal ´ s identity from fingerprints and the professor ´ s notes . Oh , good . - lnspector , Mr. Kawabe just left with Machiko . - Mr. Kawabe ? Sir , the invisible man just escaped on a police motorcycle . The invisible man ? I ´ ve got it , the invisible man heard us talking and headed for Suma . He ´ s angry with Machiko . Who knows what mischief he ´ s up to ? Right . In any event , this is going to be wrapped up at Kawabe ´ s villa . Hello , police headquarters . The invisible man ... was just spotted on a motorcycle bound for Suma . We ´ re here . Where ´ s my father ? In a hurry to see him ? I ´ ll show you . - What are you doing ? - You needn ´ t worry . I wouldn ´ t dream of doing anything to hurt you . Mr. Kawabe , just what are you up to ? Well , I ´ m the kind of man who ... will do whatever it takes to get what he wants . So the story about my father was a lie ? No , actually he ´ s in the basement . Then let me see him . - Of course I will . - Now . What ´ s the rush ? Please let me see him . Hey , Yamaguchi . Did everything go all right ? That ´ s good . Could you stand guard for a while ? The keys are over there . Professor ! Professor ! I ´ m here to save you . I see . Thank you . - They fooled you . - That guy wasn ´ t him . - I think Yamaguchi got pinched . The invisible man is at Kawabe ´ s villa on the coast ... in Suma . Surround Kawabe ´ s villa . No , stop . Please , Machiko , understand my affection for you . I can ´ t . I want to see my father ! I will . So , Machiko , please ... No ! Stop ! What are you doing to Machiko ! It ´ s the invisible man ! Machiko ! You ´ re ... Kurokawa ! ? Give me the necklace ! I can ´ t , it belongs to Ryuko . You won ´ t give it to me ? ! - You betrayed Yamaguchi . - Who the hell are you ? ! You ain ´ t the invisible man ! Who are you ? ! Break it up ! Cuff ´ em . The Amour Tears ! I can finally get the antidote ! I ´ ll be visible again ! Let me go ! Please , Kurokawa ! You ´ re the devil ! The devil ! You call me the devil ? ! I became the devil for you and your father ! What you ´ re talking about ? I ´ d rather kill you than see you marry Segi ! Help ! Help ! Let me go ! Let me go ! - Machiko ! - Segi ! - You ´ re safe now . That couldn ´ t have gone better . Once we get our hands on the Amour Tears , We ´ ll get the invisible man to kill the professor , and then we ´ ll make the invisible man REALLY disappear . - Evil washes out evil . - Well put ! Give me the antidote ! The reducing agent ! Give me the reducing agent ! I want the antidote ! I want the antidote ! Take the Amour Tears . It ´ s beautiful ! I ´ ve never seen anything like it ! The Amour Tears ! The antidote ! I want the reducing agent ! Kurokawa , the truth is that the professor tricked you . There is no restorative agent . You ´ re going to be the invisible man for the rest of your life . I don ´ t believe it ! You can ask the professor yourself - he ´ s in the basement . For the love of God ! Thank you ... But who are you ? It ´ s you . Yes . It ´ s me , Mizuki . I had no idea . Professor ! The antidote ! I want the reducing agent ! That ´ s Kurokawa ´ s voice . So my brother is the invisible man ? ! Professor ! The antidote ! Give me the restorative agent ! Professor ! Hey , get out of here ! Kawabe , the jig is up . Being a CEO was just a front . You ´ re a gem dealer . I have no idea what you ´ re talking about . You collect rare and unusual diamonds . You stole the professor ´ s invisibility agent ... to use it for the purpose of grand larceny . You kidnapped Kurokawa and the professor to create the invisible man . You used Kurokawa ´ s desperation for the antidote ... to get him to steal the Amour Tears for you . You made it seem as if Professor Nakazato had committed the crimes . Inspector Matsubara , you have an active imagination . You will stand trial to pay for the crimes of all the people ... you have harmed . You can ´ t escape . Yes , I can ! Freeze ! Don ´ t let him get away ! Doggone it ! Kawabe ! I ´ ll never be normal again ! It ´ s all your fault ! Now , I ´ ll make you disappear . I ´ ll rub you out ! Kurokawa , regrettably you ´ ve committed quite heinous crimes . Just try to catch me , copper . Forget it , you can ´ t . Please , you can ´ t commit any more crimes . I beg you , please ! You ´ re my brother ! No way ! Even if I can ´ t be seen , I ´ m still alive ! I will get my revenge ! Stop , you can ´ t ! Even if you can ´ t be seen , you ´ re still human ! Don ´ t lose your soul too ! - Shunji ! Shunji ! - Blast it ! Shunji ! Don ´ t shoot ! Don ´ t shoot ! I want him alive . I ´ m all right ! Mr. Matsubara , shoot him ! He ´ s my brother , but he ´ s crazy ! Shoot him ! Please shoot him ! Give yourself up or we ´ ll shoot ! No friggin ´ way ! Shunji , you died never having seen my show . I can ´ t forgive you . I can ´ t forgive you . Ryuko . Although it wasn ´ t intended to be used in the service of evil , I invented something without due consideration , and it was used to the detriment of society . There ´ s nothing I can say to apologize . I accept full responsibility for this calamity . There is no good or evil in science , but it can be used for good or evil purposes .

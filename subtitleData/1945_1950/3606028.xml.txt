 Hello . Who 's there ? I say , who 's there ? Who is at the gate ? Please answer . Michael , where have you been ? Did you hear that shot ? Harper , you 're a suspicious fool . If it weren 't for me , you 'd have no notes at all . I like you , Meeker . You do your job well . You 're honest . That 's why I like you . I like your work , Harper ... but otherwise , I detest you as much as anyone else in this house . Absent-minded as usual . You forgot to make your notes . - Yes , Roth ? - I must see you , sir . There 's a murderer about the place . One of your relatives , no doubt . Coming , Roth . What 's this about a murderer ? Wait . Go on , Meeker , we 're through for the night . Subtle as a blast of TNT , isn 't he ? What was it this time ? Someone shot at me from the gate . Was everyone at home here ? No , Michael was outside , working in the garage . None of them are going to get what they 're after . Let 's go and see if anyone 's been tampering . Strange safety vault , eh , Roth ? Both doors wide open to anyone finding that panel in the hall . Like a spider 's web , sir . Easy to get into , impossible to get out of . And I 'm the spider ? No , nobody 's tried to steal it yet . What in blazes is that new word combination ? Can you hear me ? Did you call , sir ? Yes , of course . Will you ... Never mind , I remember . Works beautifully , Roth . Any thief who enters there will die within an hour . If he has a gas mask , he 'll die of starvation before I let him out . Of course , sir , you would . Only we know the word combination , Roth . And even you can 't rob me ... because the words have to be spoken in my voice . Yes , sir . You think of almost everything . About the shot fired at me , shall I call the police ? I 've told you before , I don 't want police here . Yes , sir , but I like police , especially when there 's a murderer about . Don 't let them come into the house . I don 't trust police any more than I trust my own relatives ... or my servants . Hello . Who is there , please ? - Police . Open the gate . - Police ? But no one called you here . No , but I want to see someone in there . Open up . Who 's there ? Hold on . Who are you ? What are you doing in there ? Police ! Open the door . Why were you so long coming from the gate ? - I thought I saw a prowler in the grounds . - Inside ? No one could get inside ! However , there is someone outside with a gun . - Come on , open the door . - Mr. Harper wants no one inside . - You should look around outside the gates . - Okay , I 'll do that . - Ready to go ? - Yeah . Is that you , Roth ? Who 's there ? Answer me , who 's there ? Mr. Chan , it sure is good that you 's a big detective . You sure carries a lot of weight . My personality always count in end . Your personality is all right , but just ain 't enough of it to close this bag . Eddie , remove nose from book and come over here . Please call me Edward , Father . Eddie is so juvenile . Number four son , Eddie ... is very expensively educated bookworm . Please , forget brain and use brawn . Very well , but your modus operandi is all wrong . According to the science of gravity ... the pressure of the weight of a solid body is useless ... unless directed solely at a single point . His language is strictly stratospheric ... too high-flown for me . Allow me to demonstrate . Pardon me . There you are . Charlie Chan speaking . Good evening , Inspector Godfrey . Charlie , I 'll pick you up in five minutes . Murder case . Murder ? I 'm very sorry , Inspector ... but I 'm not interested in murder now . I 'll second the motion in a hurry . But please , I must be back in Washington , D.C. tomorrow . I 've contacted Washington , Charlie . They want you on the case ... because the victim was working on something the government 's interested in . That is new look on old business . Will be ready to leave for Harper house ... on Cove Road immediately . Mr. Chan , you changed your mind and ruined my peace of mind . Pardon my exuberance , Pop , but let 's go . Excuse , please . Name on police invitation mine , not yours . Goodbye . - Can you beat that ? - That 's just what I want to do , beat it . Why , he 's on another one of them murder things . You know , Charlie , it takes nature two million years to make coal . Scientists now perform the same process in two hours . Harper , working along similar lines , has a gas process ... that hardens wood to the toughness and durability of metal . Such process extremely valuable to any nation ... in war or peace . That 's why the government wants you on the scene . Harper 's home is out of my jurisdiction . Sheriff Mack in charge of the case phoned me to bring him a good man . - Evening , Sheriff . - Evening , Inspector . - Where 's the body ? - Yeah , that 's what keeps me worrying , too . Roth here says it 's murder , but so far I ain 't seen no victim . It must be murder . I was in my room , ready to retire . Then the buzzer sounded . - It was Mr. Harper in the gas chamber . - What did he say ? He was gasping as if choked and said : " Roth , I 've been murdered . It was ... " Then there was silence . I telephoned the Sheriff and got dressed . When I came down , Sheriff Mack had arrived . I let him in . - We went into the gas chamber ... - And found nothing , not even Harper . - We woke everyone and searched the house . - Still nothing . - We searched the grounds . - Same thing , nothing . Seems as if question to be ... was Mr. Harper alive or dead when he so strangely disappeared ? Yeah , seems as if . - That is gas chamber ? - Yep , that 's it . Wait . Be careful . You need a mask to go in there . Gas is deadly ? No , but it causes painful nausea after half an hour . Thank you . You are ... Walter Meeker , laboratory assistant to Mr. Harper . Thank you so much . You have questioned all of these people , Sheriff ? Well , now that you mention it , that 's just what I was gonna do . Well , now , I want to know who you are , what you are ... what you 're doing and what you been doing . Stands to reason we got to know . - Does that cover the ground ? - Most thoroughly , Sheriff . You know me , Mack . Socially , yes , but this is business , so speak up . I 'm Louise Harper , sister to the dead ... - the missing man . - Sister ? And yet you wear uniform of housekeeper . I 'm his orphan niece , and he made me his housemaid . - I 'm Jean Kent . - And you ? - You refuse to speak ? - He can 't speak , sir . He 's Michael Strong , chauffeur , handyman , and a mute . I 'm Stella Graham . I was assisting Mr. Harper in experiments with puppets . - Experiments with puppets ? - And ventriloquist and display dummies . Mr. Harper had an idea for a toy robot for children . Seems Mr. Harper have many irons in same fire . - You are butler , Mr. Roth ? - Yes , sir . I 've been with Mr. Harper for 15 years . In serious moment , you think of something funny ? If something has happened to Mr. Harper , Roth just admitted he 's your chief suspect . Explain , please . Anyone who had to be near Harper disliked him , even hated him . Roth has been with him years longer than anyone else . So , Roth hated him more than any of us possibly could . Is what gentleman say true , Mr. Roth ? No one knows my opinion of Mr. Harper except myself . And no one else ever will know . When you rouse household ... all inmates have retired ? Everyone . Except Mr. Meeker . I was just retiring . When I went upstairs , I left Harper with Roth . By the way ... since you let everyone in and out of here , what about that policeman I saw upstairs ? He came up to the door , then he left the grounds . Oh , no ! He was inside . Jean and I saw him . No , Stella 's wrong . I saw no policeman at all . But you did . We both saw him at the same time in the hall . I 'm sorry , but Miss Graham must be mistaken . - Policeman from city force ? - Must have been . I got none . Must have been Jim Kimball . He 's nearest here . I 'll check . You folks stay here until we want you again . The way I packed , things are liable to pop when I open this bag . So look out , you 're liable to see a barrage of haberdashers popping out . Hey , you didn 't go and buy a new bag ? You know I only got two hands . - Well , these are for the people moving in . - Moving in ? But we haven 't moved out ! Oh , that 's what you think . Mr. Chan checked out today . There 's not another room in the whole hotel ! Well , no matter what Pop says , he can 't keep me from murder now . Murder ? Hey , now wait , fellas , wait a minute . It 's not my fault you lost your rooms . Really it isn 't . Murder ! Now what do you suppose is the matter with him ? - You said , " murder , " didn 't you ? - Sure . Don 't use that word ! You know what it does to me . Oh , don 't be silly , Birmingham . Come on , let 's go . Well , move over , trouble , here we come again . This looks like an excellent place for murder . That 's what I thought , but now by you agreeing with me , don 't make me happy . Oh , me ! Hey , did you hear that echo ? That wasn 't an echo . It was a foghorn . A man can 't blow no horn that loud . - The horn blows itself . - The horn blows itself , that 's all . - I 'm departing . - No . We 're going in this place if I can open the gate . All right . Oh , me ! There 's that echo again . Forget the echo . Come on , look around . Radio dispatcher can 't locate Officer Kimball . Says he wasn 't sent here . Since I 'm unaccustomed to murder , Mr. Godfrey ... - I thought you 'd bring me a good detective . - I did , Sheriff . This gentleman right here . Detective ? You 're awful quiet for one . I always reckoned a homicide detective went around growling like a truck with a colic . Sheriff Mack , this is Inspector Charlie Chan . Famous Honolulu detective . - Very great pleasure . - The pleasure is all mine ... seeing as how even the idea of solving a murder brings a misery into my mentality . But we 're not sure it is murder . Why , Mr. Harper told Roth he was murdered . Seems to me if anybody knowed about a murder , it 'd be the victim . Well , I 'm having my men make a thorough search of the grounds . Most excellent . In meantime , will continue search of interior . I 've done both them things already . No barber shave so close but another barber find some work to do . Reckon what he says is what you might call a cutting remark . Well , ain 't nobody home but echoes . Thank goodness . Who 's there , please ? Now the echoes will start asking questions . Who is at the gate ? Who wants to know ? Let me talk , Roth . - What sort of a gadget is this ? - You askin ' me ? Now you , outside , who 's there ? Edward Chan and Birmingham Brown . Chan ? Yes , assistant to Charlie Chan , world-famous detective . Looks like I got more than one helper , Mr. Godfrey . That 's telling them , Eddie . Beg your pardon , I mean Edward . - Get Chan , Mr. Roth . - Yes , sir . You outside , come in . But the gate 's locked ! Press that other button , Inspector . Hey , look ! Come in . Yes . Yes , sir . Are you inside ? Why , I believe so , sir . Did you see that ? Now ain 't that something ? Echoes that ask questions , boxes that talk ... opening and shutting gates . Why , we should knock on wood faster than a woodpecker ! Don 't be absurd . By using forensic logic , we can explain everything away . Do you see what I see ? Go ahead now with your logic and explain this away from my nose . All right , boys , get going . - Yes , sir . - Yes , sir . But gladly . - Someone coming to see you , Mr. Chan . - See me ? Must be mistake . Greetings , Father . I am right . It is mistake . Intruder is number four son , Edward ... who stopped becoming college student to become social problem . Also , his assistant , Birmingham Brown . Excuse , please . Will see you gentlemen in puppet room in few minutes . Now , will you explain why you butt in here like goat ? Because you checked us all out at the hotel . We have no place to stay . Oh , my mistake . Very bad one . Now that I 'm here , Pop , what type of murder have we got ? And how soon do you wish me to produce the murderer ? Every time you open your mouth you put in more feet than centipede . Remain here , and produce nothing but silence . Desire to ask questions . Was there any place Mr. Harper might go when he wished to be alone ? Where does Harper hide his process and formula notes ? He disappears every so often . I bet he goes there . Ask Roth . He should know , if anyone does . I know of no such place . Oh , you ... Yes ? Excuse me , please . I don 't know why I said that ... Very strange household . Head of house is missing , yet no one seems sorry . Believe someone pulled string to make Mr. Harper disappear . Charlie Chan will now pull string . Someone finally did it ! Harper 's dead at last . There is missing man . Must now find murderer . - Can you remember notes so far ? - What ? Yes , most of them . The important thing is to keep all data on the pieces tested to date . Government will appreciate your efforts , Mr. Meeker . I only want to finish the job . But the supply of gas in the tanks downstairs will only last a month . I know the process for the use of the stuff , but the whole thing will be a total loss ... unless you find Harper 's formula for the composition of the gas . Once I find killer , will find formula . Good . Good . No possible chance I might arrest you as murderer ? Walter Meeker never did and never will kill a man . Not worth the trouble . Yet you say everyone in house , including yourself , hate Mr. Harper . Just one happy family with murderer in center . The law can 't drop this case just because you got your eyebrows up . But I tell you no one should be allowed in that gas chamber . That ain 't what Mr. Chan thinks . Why were you in there ? Have told Mr. Meeker to continue important work begun by Mr. Harper . You told him ! What business is it of yours ? It is government business . I am humble representative of government . Reckon now you better answer our questions ... instead of upsetting yourself by making wild guesses as to why we 're asking them . Desire to know where Mr. Harper keep gas formula , please . If anyone knew where the formula was kept , I would . But I know nothing about it at all . To get information from him is like putting empty bucket into empty well . Yeah , he is kind of dried up . Note many life masks of household about place . Why ? Mr. Harper made them . If anyone here stole something ... the masks would be of great assistance to the police in tracking down the criminals . We must remember that . Something has occurred ? No , sir . Nothing occurred at all , but something happened . - We just took our baggage upstairs , Pop . - Only we didn 't . One moment . You take up , you ... You will explain , please ? You see , Mr. Chan , them four suitcases was awful heavy to lug upstairs . You have difficulty in carrying them ? No , sir , no difficulty at all . We just couldn 't do it . - But Miss Graham came along ... - Yes , and she picked up not one , not two ... but all four of them bags , and carried them upstairs just like wasn 't nothing to it ! Miss Graham ? Seems like astounding feat of strength for a woman . Nothing astounding at all . Besides being a puppeteer and ventriloquist ... Miss Graham was also a strong woman in vaudeville . I 'll answer that . Yeah ? Oh , hello , Doc . Dead ? You sure , Doc ? You wait there . I 'll be over , with company . Bye . Doc Peabody . Coroner . He just made a tour of the victim 's interior . You know , autopsy . He says that Harper wasn 't murdered at all . - Coroner say victim not murdered ? - No . He says that he died of natural causes . Very sorry , but humble opinion is murder . Peabody 's a good man . He says it ain 't so . Will visit doctor , but I 'm certain it was murder . It must have been . Yeah ? Oh , hello , Inspector Godfrey . What ? Oh , yeah , I see . No , I mean I don 't see ! But I 'll ask Mr. Chan and see what he sees of it . Yeah . This thing has got my brain running around like a scalded cat . Inspector Godfrey said Officer Kimball wasn 't located last night ... and today he 's missing entire . Seems like some motorist saw Kimball near the Harper house last night . The Inspector says as how he thinks Kimball 's mixed up in the Harper killing . Possibility to be considered . You 're right , Mr. Chan . This poison dart killed Harper . Found it embedded in the back of his throat . How can you shoot a man inside the mouth ? When mouth open , just like yours . Ever so often , and sometimes oftener ... I get the feeling I ought to be in some other business . How did you know it was there , Mr. Chan ? You study medicine ? No , Dr. Peabody , but I study crime a great deal . This is beyond me . Glad to have your company in my misery , Doc . As my grandpa used to say : It 's wonderful what doctors know . It 's what they don 't know that 'll kill you . - Now look here ... - Gotta go now . Excuse , please . Come on , speak up . When it comes to talking , you people just don 't enter into the spirit of the thing . I 've already told you . The policeman came to the door , then he left the grounds . - Policeman was Mr. Kimball ? - I didn 't know the officer . - But he did not get in ! - But he did ! I saw him ... Please . All may go except Miss Graham and Miss Kent . I 'll not leave this frightened girl alone with you men . Miss Graham , you see policeman inside house last night ? Yes , I did , in the hall . Jean saw him at the same time . Thank you . You may go . Officer Kimball was perhaps young , good-looking ? My wife thinks he is . Your wife undoubtedly correct . Perhaps he come to see young , good-looking girl . Jim Kimball came to see me . What in the name of tunket would he want to see you for ? Jim , Officer Kimball , was coming to see me . Go on . He was to come to the gate at 9 : 00 p.m. I was to let him in and then we would meet in the grounds . But at 9 : 00 p.m. Roth was at the front door and I couldn 't open the gate . Miss Graham and Mr. Meeker say policeman come later . Yes , that 's right . - I thought it was Jim , but now I 'm not sure . - Murder made you change your mind ? Yes . Now I 'm sure the policeman I saw was not Jim Kimball . Officer Kimball only policeman near here . I don 't care . Jim didn 't come last night . But there was a policeman here . Why did you say you didn 't see one ? Because I was afraid for Jim . Excellent reason . You may go now . Hey , Pop , the police found a motorcycle in the bushes down by the gate . - Officer Kimball machine ? - The man said that . What became of Kimball ? You think he 's the murderer ? That is question deserving much thought . Gentlemen , in this matter of thought , I 'm sure that I can assist the both of you . He reach oversize decision with undersize brain . Relax . You know what , Eddie ? I got a theory on this murder . - That 's something I 'd like to hear . - Yeah ? Well , listen . Now , the way I figure this thing out , the murderer must be on the inside . - So , what we got to do is ... - What ? - Stay outside . - No . - We stay here till the case is finished . - Stay here ? I thought you 'd say that . Oh , me ! - Find anything more , Sheriff ? - No . Motorcycle 's all I found . Kimball 's still missing . Very strange . Miss Graham , Miss Kent , Mr. Meeker ... say policeman inside house last night . Yet Mr. Roth , he ... Mr. Roth ? One moment . Believe you have not told us all you know . - I 'm sure of that , sir . - Oh , you are ? - Well , you 'd better speak up right now . - No , not yet . - Give me five minutes . - Why you wish time ? In five minutes , I 'll tell you who murdered Mr. Harper . - Whom you suspect ? - That 's my affair . Someone here tried to make me out a killer . I 'll clear myself of suspicion and do it alone . - We go with you . - No ! I do this myself or not at all . Five minutes . - Five minutes already up . - And Roth ain 't back yet . We see what happened to mysterious gentleman . Mr. Chan ? There 's Mr. Roth down there . But Roth went upstairs and there 's only one way up or down . Well , all the same , there he is down there . - Something happened to him . - Yes ? Mr. Roth is dead . Dead ? Now he can 't tell us who he suspected . You know , Mr. Chan , I can 't figure out how Roth got downstairs and got his feet wet . Strange part is how man with wet feet ... make tracks beginning only in middle of passageway . No . Don 't touch . Any of you seen Mr. Roth lately ? Roth ? Why , no . - What 's the congregation for ? - To find a murderer . You won 't find Harper 's killer by questioning . Now seek murderer of Mr. Roth . Questions will begin immediately in living room . All right , everybody . Inside , please . You will telephone Dr. Peabody to perform immediate autopsy . You see ? That 's the way to solve crimes . Fast work , especially fast questioning . If anybody want to live around here , they got to do some fast running . Two men are murdered . Yet everyone here have perfect alibi . Is that strange ? Sounds strange to me , but maybe I 'm a little particular . Remain where you are for present , all of you . - You telephone doctor ? - Yes . He 's on his way here , Pop . Good . Stay here . Watch door , let doctor in when he comes . - Birmingham , remain here and watch body . - Yes , sir . Ain 't that something ! This place is jumping with live people ... and I got to stay here and keep company with a body . Oh , me ! Why , Miss Harper , what you do here ? - Well , I thought that ... - Something wrong ? Yes , I came to get the vase . - Vase ? - Mr. Roth always liked flowers . It 's gone ! - This missing vase ? - Yes . Things misplaced sometimes furnish very good clues . Return downstairs , Miss Harper . I 'm the head of the house now . And I have a right to know what you do . You think perhaps Mr. Harper , in his will ... leave you house and gas formula ? I don 't know , but I am his sister . Please return downstairs . You don 't think she killed him ? Her own brother ? Murder know no law of relativity . - Recording Dictaphone . - What 's that got to do with us ? Why is machine still running ? And let no one out , not even my sister , Louise , or my niece , Jean ... Murder ! Here . Here . " Murder . Here , here . " What did Roth mean ? Soaking wet . Roth , in falling , knock over vase of flowers and get shoes wet . Roth die right here . But he was downstairs walking around . Both the boys saw him . Roth dead when he walk downstairs . But dead men don 't walk . This dead man both walk and talk . This is a way beyond me . Seems to me when folks asked me to run for sheriff ... I missed a fine chance to keep quiet . Strange combination of light ... and bell . Must find how same works . Yep , I missed an elegant chance to keep my mouth shut . Same type murder , except this dart got Roth in the back of the neck . He arrived a few minutes ago , Pop , to see Harper . - Where is Harper ? I want to talk to him . - Why , please ? To get back this house and the gas formula he stole from my father . He stole from your father ? What 's your name ? Lloyd Archer . Harper 's my stepfather . - Very sorry . Mr. Harper dead . - Yep . Murdered . Really ? Too bad someone else had the pleasure of killing him ... because I meant to do it the first time I got close enough to him . Where 's Harper ' s will and the gas formula ? - Why ... - Government also looking for same . - The government ? - I represent government . Well , I 'm staying right here to protect my interests . Certainly . Would not think of allowing you to depart , Mr. Archer . Through investigating , Pop ? Almost through investigating forever because you fall asleep and forget to watch . - Something happen ? - Someone try to kill me . Why don 't we pursue whoever it was ? No . Cannot run with poison dart in clothing . - One scratch in skin and I 'm very dead man . - Wait . I see it , Pop . - Who did it , Pop ? - Might know if you awake . But now everyone in house will be in bed with slumber alibi , just like you . I 'm sorry , Pop . But the association of ideas ... Well , you know , wearing pajamas made one sleepy . Please eliminate scientific analysis . In future , when I put you on job to watch something ... you associate ideas with job at hand . Understand ? - Miss Harper . - Oh ! I thought you were ... - You thought I was dead ? - No , I ... I meant I , I thought you were asleep . Unfortunately only one asleep was lazy assistant . You frightened , Miss Harper ? Well , who wouldn 't be , knowing there 's a murderer in the house ? - Strange architecture here . - Yes , I noticed that also . Please , pajamas loud enough without you make extra noise . Large surface contain four walls with no opening . My brother rebuilt this part of the house . - He had it done while he was alone here . - You know why ? My brother never told people why he did things . Perhaps excellent place to contain secret papers . That 's possible . Wall space paneled . Perhaps panel contain secret door . Is that why you came ? I was making my usual last-minute rounds of the house . May I go now ? Pop , if there is a secret panel here , you just relax . I 'll find it for you . My boy , if silence is golden , you are bankrupt . You want to talk with Archer , too ? I 'm curious to learn how Mr. Roth walked downstairs after being killed upstairs . Well , speaking wide-flung and unrestrained ... I can 't see how it was done unless Roth was a zombie . One of them corpses that don 't know enough to stay parked in their coffin . - Think we find simpler solution . - I sure hope so . Because right now my mind is as uneasy as corn in a popper . A zombie . Now we 're cooking with spirit oil . Come on , we 've got to see what happens . I ain 't curious about seeing no zombies . Oh , come on ! Curiosity never killed a Chan . No , but the Chans ' curiosity almost killed me . I don 't know how I get into all of this trouble . I get a job , I must ... I got to have my brains examined . Birmingham , wait a minute . Where are you going ? You know , I 'm interested in how you 're gonna figure on Roth 's walking around . Mr. Roth say he knew identity of killer . Unfortunately , Mr. Roth speak truth , so he die . Here . Possibly we find solution of both murders here . - Now what do you suppose this is ? - An electric light , I reckon . Who turn on strange lamp ? No one . It just lit up and rang when I picked it up . - That is alarm lamp . - Alarm ? What for ? Alarm for ... Downstairs , quick ! Hurry ! You see anyone go through that passageway recently ? That housekeeper lady . She went through there a few minutes ago . Look , Pop , there is a secret panel . There 's someone in there . I heard ... - Who is there ? - I don 't know . Excuse me . Who is inside ? I hear sound like gas escaping . How you open this ? Only my brother and Roth knew how to open that panel . Maybe the killer 's in there . If killer there , gas will kill him . Don 't want that . You know nothing of mechanism ? Roth told me it could be opened only by a combination of spoken words . You mean that door will open if you speak to it ? There 's an electrical microphone in the panel . Microphone changes sound into vibration which work lock ? - Yes , but only if ... Oh ! - Something wrong ? That panel opens only if the right words are spoken ... - by my brother 's voice . - And Harper 's dead . One moment , please . Your brother very absent-minded ? Perhaps Mr. Roth might know his secrets ? I 'm sure he did . My brother had to have someone to remember things for him . Eddie , go to Mr. Roth room , bring down recording Dictaphone and all records . Hurry ! Yes , Father . Can produce Mr. Harper 's voice . That 's right . We heard it on the machine upstairs . But you must have only the correct words . If correct words not on record , person in there must die . - See any more records ? - Not in sight . We 'll take this down , then come back and look around . Let 's hurry up and get out of here . Hook it up . - We 'll look for more records upstairs , Pop . - Okay . Roth , write Huntrey that rubber dissolves under my gas processes . Won 't work . From now on , Roth , I want the house and grounds locked up every night at 7 : 00 p.m. Let no one out , not even my sister , Louise , or my niece , Jean . Murder . Here . Here . That 's all on that one . Hold , please . These two blank . No good . No more records up there , Pop . Then these are last two . Hold , please . Roth , check gas gauges on the chamber and vault . Do it today . Let me have other record . - You do that on purpose ? - No . No , I was nervous , I ... Roth , I 'm changing the word combination . Tell it to you later . Here 's the new word combo , Roth . Don 't forget it . Thirty days hath September , July and August . - Mr. Chan , it 's a woman . - Jean ! It 's Miss Graham . She 's not dead . Get doctor ! Eddie . Sheriff . No , please . You will go with others . But my brother 's things are in there . They belong to me . - Government will decide that . - But ... Please , if you have complaint to make ... you will refer to Secret Service , Washington D.C. Outside . You insist you saw wall panel open in rear hall ? Yes , I 've told you and told you . All the doors were open to that horrible room where the desk is . Then why did you go back there in the first place ? Because I thought I heard someone back there . - You were looking for Mr. Harper 's formula ? - No ! I saw the desk and lifted the top . Then I was locked in and gas pouring on me . I didn 't touch a thing inside that desk . You may go now . She seems fully recovered . But another 10 minutes in that gas and nothing could have saved her . And she didn 't even say thanks . Bet you she 's our murderer . Hey , Pop , we 've solved the case . You solve case ? Yes , we 've been talking to Michael and he wrote notes . He says he 's bringing something that will expose the murderer . Michael , you have something to show me ? Doctor ! Looks like he 's dead . - Murder ? - We 'll soon find out . You notice all life masks strangely missing from walls ? Say , that 's so , too . While we with Dr. Peabody , someone enter this house and remove masks . Why 'd anyone do that ? To prevent us from knowing which mask Michael had ... because that mask would convict killer . Then Archer wasn 't the killer . Them masks were from people inside the house . This is ear from broken mask which Michael possessed . Good . We 'll match it up with the ears of the people in the house . But this ear is from mask made from dead man . Dead ? Don 't know which way to turn . Like the fella with the short blanket . Stayed up all night wondering whether to pull it up and freeze his feet ... or pull it down and die of pneumonia . We 'll soon end suspense . Bring all suspects down to living room . See if anyone in gas chamber . Three men killed already . If it keeps up , there won 't be none of us left . Say , what are we staying here for ? We 're supposed to look around . So come on . Look around . That 's all you always talking about . " Look around . See something . Watch me . " Why don 't you get a Seeing Eye dog or something , somebody to help you ? Wonder what is this ? This is a cabinet . Always telling somebody to be watching and looking for something . Good evening , Officer . Hey , Eddie , I ain 't nervous no more now . Why not ? I just saw an officer in there . And any time an officer is around , I ain 't nervous . Good . - It is a policeman . - Yeah , but he 's dead . Mr. Chan , come quick ! In there . It 's Jim . Jim Kimball . Has been dead for many hours . At last pieces of murder puzzle begin to fit in place . Where 's Archer ? He 's your killer . Will locate Mr. Archer when I require him . Three men are murdered by poison darts . Dart fired by some strange kind of air gun . Air gun ? Then the case is solved . Miss Kent had that air pump in her hand when Michael was killed . Yes , but I didn 't kill Michael . You use air pump for slow leak in tire . Please forget fast leak from there . Tire pump not deadly weapon . Then what was used ? Something else was carried in hands among those present . - This . - Oh , yes . Archer had that . Ventriloquist 's dummy . When dummy 's mouth opens ... ventriloquist 's voice usually issues forth . But when this dummy 's mouth open ... something more deadly emerge . Observe . Very fine air gun concealed within mechanism of this figure . That 's why we can 't find Archer . He 's the killer . Excuse , please . Mr. Roth , dying , tried to leave important clue . Yeah , he said into that Dictaphone thing : " Murder . Here , here . " No . Believe Mr. Roth trying to say : " Murderer ... " ear ... " ear . " Meaning this ear . Why , that 's from the mask Michael had . Michael , like Roth ... see in this important clue . Well , whose life mask is the ear from ? From mask of murdered man . Will now demonstrate how dead man can walk . Come this way , please . Does he mean Archer is the murderer ? - Of course . - I ain 't saying . But any gent with notions on the subject can 't speak up too quick . - The ladies are welcome to talk , too . - Oh , look ! As Pop says , that proves dead men can walk ... only when they have lots of help . So Roth 's corpse had to have crutches to walk ... which proves that Chan was right when he said it was an inside job . But Archer was an outsider . Mr. Roth , now dead ... made to appear to walk downstairs by someone upstairs who need alibi . Must have been a strong person to do the trick . Also someone familiar with handling puppets by means of strings . Then she did it . She 's a master puppeteer and she 's stronger than a man . It 's not true . I didn 't kill Roth . I killed no one . You commit no murder . But you do make dead man appear to walk . - No , you 're wrong ! - You are accomplice of murderer . This ear will convict killer . Both Roth and Michael recognize what police already know : that like fingerprints , no two human ears are exactly alike . This ear taken from mask of murdered man . Man named ... Meeker . Me , murdered ? You 're crazy . Will prove sanity by comparing this ear with your own . If you are Meeker ... this will exactly match your right ear . - Grab him , Birmingham . - I 've got him ! Will now prove , Mr. Meeker , you are not even yourself . Why , it 's Archer . Mr. Archer been in this house ever since he kill Mr. Harper . - Where 's the real Meeker ? - Try and find out , farmer . Don 't tempt me . It might be a pleasure . Where 's Meeker ? Perhaps Miss Graham could tell us . I ? I know nothing . Roth died by accident . Excuse , please . This mask prove all murders in this house premeditated . I know nothing . - You not know he try to murder you ? - Me ? He show you way into secret vault . He not tell you secret vault is death trap , which he knew . - You knew that ? - Stop talking . - Why , you 're insane . - Insane ? I 'm the only sane person in this house . Meeker 's body is in the basement . He died right after Harper . You know him before you come here ? We were in vaudeville together . He was a quick-change artist and impersonator . He can imitate anyone . That 's right . Haven 't I been fooling you all along ? Do I sound like Meeker now ? You see ? He got me the job here somehow . Why you continue to help him after murders began ? He 's my husband . I 'll hand these two over to the police at the gate . See you later , Mr. Chan ? At your office , Sheriff . Fog of murder will soon lift and household be happy again . Thanks to you , Mr. Chan . You know , at first I didn 't like you , but I 've changed my mind . This is gas formula . Government very interested in same . You take charge of it . - You staying till morning ? - lf you will permit . - Glad to have you . - Thank you . Well , Pop , that 's another case we 've solved . You have been of very great assistance . At moment , I cannot remember how ... but it was excellent . However , case not finished . Must visit basement to locate body of final victim : Mr. Meeker . - Mr. Chan ? - Yeah ? - Is you all going thataway ? - Yes . I 'm going this way . Good night . Hey , Sheriff , is this the right road to the city ? Yes , it is . About three miles straight ahead . I didn 't know my car had stopped . It didn 't . I just slowed down . Goodbye !

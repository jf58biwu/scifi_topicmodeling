 It happens every spring The world is young again Where children on an up-sa-daisy swing A carousel with horses freshly painted Let 's get acquainted . hello . Remember me ? I was the lucky stiff married to Linda Darnell in The Letter to Three Wives . You just caught me thinking about the time I was a radio announcer . mostly . There was a guy in those days the nuttiest story I ever heard He was a screwball named Vernon . And he invented a baseball nobody could hit . Astonishing . Screwball that he was he certainly could pick dames . Dames with curves nobody could miss . Isn 't he wonderful ? into the sweet and wonderful romance refined gentlemen I know . Me . Now this Vernon takes the ball nobody can hit and parley 's it into the most hilarious dipsy-doodle adventures that ever amazed an ape . It happens every spring but he can pick dames . I could fall in love with you myself very easy . Debbie . That 's why I can 't say anything . he doesn 't have the right to say anything until he can be serious . what are you talking about ? It happens every spring Your dad rolls up his sleeves to clean the attic . Your sixteen-year-old sister goes dramatic . It happens . it happens . It happens . It always happens . It happens every spring ! It happens every spring The world is young again Where children on an up-sa-daisy swing A carousel with horses freshly painted Let 's get acquainted . What is that cheer I heard ? A fellow stealing third Your neighbor 's boy became a home-run king Your dad rolls up his sleeves to clean the attic Your sixteen-year-old sister goes dramatic it happens It happens every spring Debbie . Maybe he 's never thought about it . Why don 't you drop him a few hints ? I 've tried that . But Vernon just doesn 't get hints . I 'll see ya . Bye ! Miss Collins . Is Dad busy ? Very . Professor Forsythe is in there now . Chemistry Forsythe ? I bet they 're talking about Vernon . I have no idea what they 're talking about . I 'll have to find out later . Vernon 's waiting for me . will you ? Tell him I said not to be so nosey . [ Phone rings ] Hello ? Mr. Jack Bell ? please . Will you talk to Mr. Jack Bell ? Excuse me . Jack ! yes I got your letter . of course I won 't speak . not glorify them . Alfred . but one man we 've invited might give you some dough for that new laboratory . Jack . I 'd like to meet him . not at a football dinner . [ indistinct crowd noise ] goodbye . that 's what I want to talk to you about . What do you mean ? Debbie ? Simpson . Vernon Simpson . what about him ? Joe . I want to know all about him . Vernon is a fine young man . energetic . And his background ? He comes from upstate somewhere . Has a widowed mother who 's as poor as a church mouse . Alfred ? you saw why just now . Debbie seems to have taken quite a fancy to him . vice-versa . Debbie couldn 't have picked a better lad . he 's my candidate for director of the research labratory . Simpson ? I intend to submit his name to you and the board . as soon as he completes his doctorate . Joe . He should 've had his PhD years ago . he spent 3 years in the South Pacific . Chemical warfare . And before that he worked on a number of other ideas . well he 's just had bad luck Joe ? Are you sure there 's nothing else ? but ... What is it ? Women ? no . It 's just these phases that he goes through . phases ? and an excellent teacher . But every spring he seems to undergo a peculiar change . He becomes absent-minded to a degree . only it lasts all summer . He 's been around our house quite a bit lately . I haven 't noticed these symptoms . It 's past the middle of April now . Alfred . this is just the time of the year . I 'm expecting it to hit him almost any time . It happens every spring . Continuing our study of the general group know as acids we are now coming to a very important classification . The most striking difference between the various acids containing the carboxylate group lies in their acidic strength . we might say they are ionization constants . while others ... are quite inert . Oh ! HAHAHAHAHAHA ! To illustrate - I have in this test tube acetic acid . it 's a rather weak acid of low Ka value . you 'll notice the bright pink color . is decidedly ... ... coming home . Another run for Chicago . is decidedly ... ... second inning . First home game of the season here in St. Louis . Lauren gets a signal from Madigan . He takes a strike . He throws . Ball one on Hardeman . Manager Dolan looks worried . Here he comes out of the dugout . He doesn 't wanna lose this game . D-d-d-decidedly an acid as your knowledge [ Bell rings ] I 'm afraid I 'll have to continue this discussion the next time . What is it Vernon ? Don 't you feel well ? just fine . I ... what was it ? You acted so strangely . You suddenly looked as if you were a thousand miles away . only 68 . I mean I was only thinking about something else . Vernon ? no . Vernon . Yes ? I was thinking about it while you were lecturing . and I 've tried to make allowances . But ... But what ? don 't you understand ? I guess I know how you feel . But just guessing isn 't very satisfying . well - you 're so terribly vague . Debbie . I 'm not a bit vague . I 'm very definite about you . Why you 're almost everything I ever think about . Almost . What else can I say ? Vernon . Something positive . but that 's been out of the question up until now . I hardly make enough at my job to live on . for instance . He 's made it quite clear that for anyone in my present financial situation to even discuss the - Vernon - Debbie . he doesn 't have the right to say anything until he can be serious . what are you talking about ? I 'm talking about 3 hours from now . Maybe sooner . Maybe any minute . And what 's going to happen 3 hours from now ? In less than 3 hours I 'll know about my experiment . You mean you 've done it ? Just about . darling ! I 'm so happy ! I haven 't told you the best part . I just heard about it myself yesterday . My nydrocyclohexene compound was a great commercial value . maybe even own a car . that 's wonderful . But who 's going to pay you all this money ? The Norworth Labratories . trying to develop a substance that will keep insects or any living matter away from wood . they call it . And they seem to think that my compound is the very thing they 're looking for . Vernon Simpson . The man who discovered the biophobic . but that 's just routine . let 's not just stand here talking about it . Let 's go find out . Can 't expect any positive results right away . but we can look ! there it is ! The white precipitant . there it is . Vernon ! my notebook . My notebook ! [ CRASH ] Oh . There goes everything . Just when I had it . Vernon . Little brats . No degree . No job . No nothing . You still have your notes and everything . It can 't take long . Long ? Debbie . One of those compounds alone and they 're all in sequence . I can 't make the second until I finish the first . And look at these notes . You might get some idea of the time and work it took . I ran some of those reactions six and eight times before I got enough stuff to make the next step . Now I 'm going to start from scratch . step by step . It 'll take months . That wonderful precipitate . It 's all there in the sink . Isn 't there any way you can filter it out and save it ? that 's just a hodge-podge of compounds and ice and everything else now . let alone filter anything out . I suppose I better clean up this mess . Can 't I help ? you just run along . Vernon ... and there 's nothing I can say . Vernon . This hasn 't changed anything as far as we 're concerned . You know that . It 's changed everything . you mustn 't feel that way . Let me talk to you . right now - All right . I 'll see you later . [ water running ] And that puts Chicago out front 4 to nothing . And here comes Hank Rubella . He 's the 3rd pitcher Dolan 's used today . Jimmy doesn 't look happy out there . Pitchers are his big headache . St. Louis has a great team . Good hitting and fielding . With one more top-notch pitcher Dolan might cop that pennant . Owner Edgar Stone would like to too . But first class pitchers are scarcer than hen 's teeth this year . Stone can 't buy one for love nor money . Astonishing . Sir . You sent for us ? yes . so I did . You gentlemen are doing rather sadly in organic chemistry . I suppose you 're aware of that . sir . I don 't like to flunk you . so - I had assigned some special reading . But instead I thought I might be able to see if we can 't improve your grades . that 's mighty decent of you sir . I was wondering if you 'd and keep it strictly confidential ? we 'd be glad to Mr. Simpson . sir . Good . Will you meet me at the baseball field at the batting cage with your uniforms and equipment at five o ' clock ? [ Both ] Five o ' clock ? In the morning . we 'll get started . Now you 're basic trouble is that you haven 't learned the meanings of technical terms . So let 's get clear what we mean by propyl ... Perhaps I 'd better warm up a bit first . Professor . here we go . Right in here . so he could play pitcher . or they wouldn 't let him teach . anyway . now . We gotta humor him . that 's a good one ! Mr. Isabell . Mr. Simpson . now let 's go in there . and butyl on that ball ! hey ! Whoa . we 'll get him on this next one . Here we go ! [ Smack ] [ Smack ] Too bad I didn 't have an outfielder in my class . I think I 'll try just a few more . Mr. Simpson . will you Tommy . Bunt one . okay . [ Whoop ] Wow ! Did you see the hop on that ball ? That 's a regular dipsy-doodle you got there Professor . How 'd ya do it ? The result of a great deal of scientific research . now here we go . That 's the old pepper in there . Right down the old groove here . Here we go . [ Whoop ] old boy . he 'll think you 're faking . I ain 't missing them on purpose . now . I 'm sure you 've had enough . then you missed three in a row . I 've obtained all the information possible . I pitch several hundred more balls . Statistics . He got us up at 5 : 00 in the morning for statistics . Is Dr. Greenleaf up yet ? but I ... but I have to make the 7 : 14 . Vernon ? sir . a death in the family ? sir . Not that kind of an emergency . what kind is it ? Dr. Greenleaf . but I 'd like a leave of absence starting immediately . and Miss Brinkhoffer can take over my lab periods . Leave of absence ? For how long ? sir . Indefinitely ? You mean you want an emergency leave of absence to last indefinitely ? Vernon . sir . but scientifically I can 't explain it at all . You mean it has something to do with your experiment ? sir . But unless I get a chance to demonstrate it - lectures of some kind ? not exactly . what are you going to do ? Take it to some commercial labratory like the one you mentioned ? What was it ? Norworth Laboratories . why is the time indefinite ? Dr. Greenleaf ? I 'll miss my train . Vernon . I don 't suppose we should stand in your way . Vernon . Catch your train . I 'll talk to Forsythe . sir . is Debbie still asleep ? I presume so . that she 'll hear from me soon ? sir . All Aboard ! [ Train chugging ] [ Typing ] Morning . please . He won 't see anybody on game days . but this is urgent . I know . Everybody 's urgent . What do you want to see him about ? it 's a personal matter . he doesn 't have anything to do with the concessions . Mr. Dolan . Good morning . Mr. Dolan ! I wanna talk to you . - Not today . Mr. Dolan . This could mean a great deal to you . You heard what I said . Run along . I 'm busy . Ms. Manglestein - Mr. Dolan . I 'm trying to do you one . Then do it . Get out of here . Mr. Terry wants to know - Not this morning . I 've gotta go right down to batting practice . This wire from Denver . [ Phone rings ] Hello . yeah . I 'll be right down . Chop Suey or whatever his name is - Cop Suley . yeah well wire them I want him . Just a minute . Before you send this wire - Will you get out of here ! I will not . send for one of the cops . and you need one very badly . I can win the pennant for you another crackpot . and that 's no idle boast . mathematical fact . Mister . But we don 't hire ball players that way . Now if you 'll just - but the circumstances are rather unusual . I can win thirty games for you . Thirty games . Is that all ? thirty is the minimum . you 're not very screwy . Do you know there ain 't more than a dozen pitchers ever won thirty games in a season ? and I can give you their names if you like . Never mind . all I want to do is to show you . What can you lose ? My lunch is all . Where is that cop ? take this guy away . sir . Don 't hurt his arm . He thinks he 's Walter Johnson . Mr. Dolan . With the chance to win the pennant right in your lap . Get him outta here ! pal . You 're annoying Mr. Dolan . You know if you would shout less and think more - Jimmy ? thinks he 's a pitcher . Thinks he can win thirty games . are Mr. Stone ? I appeal to your intelligence as an executive . I 'm perfectly rational and willing to prove the truth of anything I may say . All I want is a chance to demonstrate . Mac . - Come on . - How do these characters get in here ? Mr. Stone . But I 'm about to walk out again without a police escort . the pennant walks right out the door with me . Sonny . take your pennant and trot along . Take a good look at me Mr. Stone . All the other owners can 't be pigheads . You 'll see me later in the season . young man . am I ? You walk in off the street and think you can win thirty games . Mr. Stone . I know it . Know it ? I have never met such bland conceit . I told you . He 's a crackpot . No he 's not . He 's just a conceited jackass . you talk to him . I 'm going to batting practice . eh ? I think we oughta teach this whipper-snapper here a lesson . but let me go . not in my office . Down on the field . Let him pitch to the boys . OK . It 's your ball club . If you wanna run a kindergarten for crackpots . you 're going to have your wish . And you 're going to get the humiliation of your arrogant young life . And I 'm coming down to see it . I was hoping you would . nuisance . Jimmy . Mr. Stone . And we 'll lay a red plush carpet for him from the dugout to the pitcher 's box . just a moment . There 's the question of terms . - Terms ? - Yes . I gotta hand it to you . Thank you . 000 a game for every game I win . not a cent . I 'm to be paid promptly . Now I have heard everything . but I 'm sure we can fix that up in the contract . Take him down there right away . And don 't let him pitch to any weak hitters . Put the top of the batting order up . I 'm really going to enjoy this . busher . [ Indistinct chatter ] Monk . another Dizzy Dane ? Jimmy . huh ? I thought so . don 't waste anymore time . - Okay . Come on in . [ sigh ] kiddo . This baseball racket ain 't so hotsy like you read about . too . Dirty trains all the time . Cheap hotels . though . I 'm looking forward to it . don 't . see ? Things don 't always work out - Jimmy ? Yeah ... Jimmy ! What about our genius ? Can he throw as far as the plate ? This is your idea . I 'll show ya . Get in there now and pitch . not mine . Jimmy . Catch what ? They 're gonna hit every pitch . Remember - put the top of the batting order up . The top of the batting order ! White . I 'll catch this guy . kid . Let 's show ' em whatcha got . [ Whoop ] Must 've been an optical illusion . Lemme see you throw that one again . [ Whoop ] anyway ? I don 't know . He didn 't have nothin ' before . Now he 's got a hop like Barnum 's flea . boys . and you guys is fanning ' the air . Okay ! bring that guy over here . alright . Jimmy . That 's what makes baseball the greatest game in the world . Everybody plays it all over the country . You may find a new star anywhere . or Brooklyn . Or he may walk right into your office the way this boy did . we haven 't got a star here yet . Not by a long shot . Jimmy . He don 't look like a pitcher . He don 't throw like a pitcher . But he strikes them out . Yeah . He strikes them out in practice . can he stand up in big time competition ? come here . anyway ? I hadn 't thought of it . you hadn 't . Well try hard . it 's Kelly . eh ? that 's the first encouraging thing you 've said . kid . Let 's take care of that flipper . [ Indistinct chatter ] Ball ! cheer ] And it looks like Chicago is staging another rally . They 're whittling down St. Louis ' lead . so let 's see what 's gonna happen . Chew ? No thanks . Crosby better tighten up . He ain 't got this game on ice yet . cheer ] put the new man in . Yes . Kelly . Warm up . Me ? you . kid . This may be it . cheer ] baby . I got a feelin ' we ain 't gonna have much time . cheer ] Kelly . Get in there and pitch . Mr. Dolan - I 'd like to get it straight about my contract . it counts for me . I expect to get paid . I don 't pay you . Go talk to Stone . Now ? no . There 's a ball game going on . Get in there and pitch . sir . sir . What 's this ? Another Al Schacht ? sweetheart . Guy 's name is Kelly . pitching for St. Louis . Lannigan catching . [ On loudspeaker ] Kelly 's now pitching for St. Louis . Lannigan catching . he isn 't even on the scorecard . there 's a scared looking rookie if I ever saw one . I wonder where Dolan ever got the courage to put him into a spot like this . [ Crowd booing ] That puts the tying run on second . And O 'Leary 's up . He 's gotten 3 hits for 3 tries this afternoon . kid . Just take it easy . Try and get ' em over . and they don 't let me use no stepladder . Where 'd you find that hooligan ? Jump-In Junior High ? and then make with the jokes . Ball ! Strike ! Ball ! Strike ! It 's 3 and 2 on O 'Leary . A hit will tie up this ballgame . Here 's your chance to be a hero . This one 's gotta be good . [ Whoop ] you 're out ! Wow ! What kind of a ball was that ? tell me that joke about the high school kid . Rookie hero . boy . I guess . me an ' you . Nice goin ' . Thank you . Jimmy ? He 's just what you was lookin ' for . but that 's what I got . Headache ? A guy with a hop like that ? and they do anything . You 're going to have to keep your eye on him night and day . great . I knew you had it all the time . Glad to have you with us . We 'll have that contract for you first thing in the morning . sir . be sure and let me know . Mr. Stone - There is one thing . What ? Well - Could I have a uniform that fits ? sure . Dolan . Dolan ! [ Knocking at door ] Come in . Kelly ! kid . Your troubles are over . I 'm movin ' in with ya . You 're what ? thinking of you up here all alone day after day . Monk . I don 't . Kelly - I took a shine to ya . the sky 's the limit . I 'm payin ' for everything - meals . It ain 't gonna cost you a cent . Monk . too . baloney . really . I 'll break down and tell ya . I ain 't one of those big-hearted Charlies like you think . It 's sort of a deal between me and the club . It 's a what ? they pay all the bills . They sorta want me to keep my eye on ya . They do ? Why ? Dolan thinks you 're somewhat of a screwball or something . Kelly ? quite the opposite . Everything I do is perfectly logical . she is hot stuff . [ Wolf whistle ] too . What 's her name ? you wouldn 't know her . eh ? Well I 'll just call her Madame X. What 's in the bottle ? Oh that ? That 's hair tonic . It 's a special prescription . Seems to have done you good . indeed . Analytical mechanics . and neb ... u Nebulae . Theoretical ballistics . Jumpin ' Jupiter . Do you read this stuff ? it 's that hop I get on the ball - and I 'm attempting to investigate it . You mean you learn how to pitch out of scientific books ? no . Not exactly . Jimmy was right . kid ? Why all the mystery ? it 's her father . I 'll lose my girl and my job and everything . Finds out what ? What I 'm doing . but I am . And what I 'm doing isn 't what he thinks I 'm doing at all . Come again ? you see . Kelly . Quit trying . the more mysterious it gets . maybe it 's just as well . [ Phone rings ] Hello ? I 'm trying to locate a party by the name of Lannigan . Monk . checking up . [ Sigh ] Mabel . just like I said . [ Woman talking ] only he happens to be with the club . And St. Louis don 't have no lady pitchers this season . continues ] have you Kelly ? No . continues ] Mabel . you oughta read this article here . Some professor says there 's gold on the planet Mars . Here - continues ] I 'm glad I read this . I 'm gonna send a telegram . A telegram ? Tommorow 's ? but I can 't do that . The guy is nuts . But I gotta do something . I 've gotta think of some way to - Kelly . You listen to me . You 're gonna stay right here and pitch . You ain 't going after no gold on Mars . Kelly ! Kelly ! continues ] I 've been listening to every word . continues ] I wish you 'd come with us . The concert will do you good . really . Well you can 't spend the rest of your life sitting home because of Vernon . She won 't go ten feet away from that telephone . [ Door buzzer ] Miss Deborah Greenleaf ? I 'll take it ! I 'm Miss Greenleaf . please . Thank you . Mother ! It 's beautiful . It 's from Vernon . Vernon ? But that 's impossible . Something wrong somewhere . He couldn 't have come by it honestly . You 've no right to say that . You don 't know anything about it . I know he acted very strange the day he left . He was vague and evasive . There must have been a reason . Alfred . - And what does it say ? - Now that 's none of our business . Poor Vernon . He 's really sweet . He 's so upset because he didn 't get to say goodbye to me . What 's he doing ? I know that you will have faith in me and do what I ask without asking why I ask it . That 's Vernon . He even writes double talk . and I haven 't disappeared . But he has ! and tell them to stop their search at once . I cannot overemphasize the urgency of this . Why that in itself is suspicious . and their peculiar skill is a constant source of astonishment . Skill at what ? How should I know ? but the financial rewards are quite fantastic . they must be . isn 't that rather unusual for scientific demonstrations ? It 's not unusual . Whatever he 's doing is not legitimate . I don 't know whether I have chosen wisely in casting my lot with this particular group . the die is cast . doesn 't it ? Certainly does . I 'm sure there 's some explanation . the explanation 's very simple . He 's mixed up with some kind of a racket . you 've no right to assume that . Well he certainly got his leave of absence under false pretenses . I can 't forgive him for that . Alfred . I 'm sure he 'll clear it all up very soon . He says I won 't hear from him for several months . Well why not ? He says it 'll be too risky . I - but your father 's perfectly right . It all sounds very strange and frightening . only glass . of course it 's real . The box is from Mark 's . and I 'll - - No you 're not . - Why not ? Because I don 't care if it 's glass or not . I 'm going to wear it . [ Crowd noise and bell ringing ] You just about made it . What were we expected to do ? Get here early and polish the engine ? Tobacco ? thank you . He 's getting old . He can 't steal anymore . and poor old Bush last week . The bums knocked him all over the lot . Yeah ? I 'm layin ' for him . We 'll kill him . boys . Let 's get on the train . Debbie ? I 've just seen Vernon . He was taking a train for Chicago . He was with a lot of men . all of them . you know - like gangsters . Mother . Gangsters ? How do you know ? Know ? You should 've heard what they said ! Mother . but I know it couldn 't be Vernon . [ Indistinct chatter ] You 're out ! [ Crowd cheers ] Kelly 's bearing down . Every pitch counts now . Last half of the ninth . One out . One more out is all Kelly needs to reach the heights . I won 't tell you what those heights are . That 'll jinx him . You know the ol ' baseball superstition . Nobody ever mentions what Kelly is trying to do . But the score is one to nothing for St. Louis . Slugging Sammy Lee is up . The tension among the crowd is terrific . They 're going wild . Here comes the pitch . Strike one ! [ Crowd cheers ] Strike one is called . but tonight he 's trying for every pitcher 's dream . But Lee means business . A hit here could break up this ballgame . and neither is Kelly . Strike two . This is it . One more like that is all Kelly needs . [ Whoop ] You 're out . He 's done it ! Kelly 's done it ! no-run game . sweetheart . Let 's celebrate . Monk . And my arm 's pretty sore . kid . This is our big night . Jimmy says we can have a glass of beer . Alright . Here he comes . Kelly . Kelly ! whoa . please . Who does he think he is ? wait . Now don 't get him wrong . Kelly 's a great guy . He 's just tired . that 's all . He 'll talk to you . Wait . Kelly - You gotta talk to those guys . Square yourself . They can ruin ya . and I 'm - see ? But ya gotta talk to ' em . All right . boys . Kelly 's waitin ' . see . No pictures . Kelly ? Kelly ? Where 'd you pitch last year ? one at a time . Kelly ? what about it ? yes . I was in the service . it was there that I developed my ability to pitch . I was stationed on a small island mostly baseball gear . and hardly enough flat ground to put three shacks on . I spent months pitching to another lad on a narrow strip of beach . And of course you know if you spend that much time doing anything you 're bound to become quite skillful at it . What about before the war ? Yeah . Before the war . my life was extremely colorless and dull . if you 'll excuse me I 'll say goodnight - now . Let 's go . Kelly . sweetheart . I sure gotta give it to ya . Thanks . it happens to be true . Monk . You 're wanted on telephone . Long distance . That 's Mabel . [ Crackling noise ] [ Crackling ] [ Crackling ] kid ? Monk . I told you not to walk around with your arm bare like that after I rubbed it . You gotta keep it warm . I 'm gonna shave ! You 're gonna put a sweater on right now . I don 't own one . see ? put it on . Go on . Get into it . you silly cluck . I know . If I don 't suffocate first . I don 't know . today 's the second . I forgot . I 've gotta go downtown . - We 'll stop on the way to the field . - No . This is something personal . I 'll see you down at the field . Foo-man-choo . [ Phone rings ] Mabel . Mabel . Here 's your receipt for the balance . Did the lady like the ring ? I don 't know . I hope so . Would you care to look at some wedding rings ? thank you . Not ' til the end of the season . Debbie ! Vernon . Look at you . I must apologize for my appearance . What are you doing inside there ? no . Don 't tell me . I know . Vern . You did ? You 're not going to try the same thing here . You can 't right on Locust . They 've got guards and police . what are you talking about ? don 't pretend you 're so innocent . I 'm not a child . have you seen Kelly ? Kelly who ? Not Kelly Who . King Kelly the pitcher . [ Crackling ] boss . I needs a drink . You can 't expect me to keep on worrying about you . Not knowing where you are or what you 're doing . But there 's no need to worry . You asked me to trust you and believe in you . Well that works both ways . I think we better call it quits right now . Alright . Debbie . I 'll tell you . I suppose I should have told you in the first place . I 'm - if you must know I 'm a baseball player . Vernon . Tell me the truth . I told you the truth . I 'm a baseball player . That 's not very funny . say so . But I told you . Read all about it - Look . That 's me . Kelly . Kelly pitches for today 's game . Get your lineup for today 's game . and I 'm pitching this afternoon . you are ? and I 'm going to sell your secret to the highest bidder . Kelly . Fancy meeting you here . Dr. Greenleaf ? I can 't say I am . It 's the first game I 've seen in years . just sit back and relax . Enjoy yourself . It 'll do you good . and then we can all relax . Strike two ! I 'm afraid this is going to be an expensive afternoon . Mr. Stone . That 's three up and three down again for Kelly . He 's got that ol ' hop ball hoppin ' in there today alright . and he 'll rack up another victory . And he doesn 't act like a ball player at all . I 'd like you to meet him . Hey Kelly ! come here . didn 't he ? He 's very shy . though . I didn 't get a very good look at him . But you can 't walk out in the middle of the game . That 's mutiny . Kelly ? Suddenly you 're a prima donna . You been reading the newspapers ? Jimmy . that 's all . baddest fine on you in history . Jimmy . But it won 't make any difference if you do . warm up . He won 't get away with this . I 'll - Jimmy . but he ain 't no prima donna . I don 't care what he is . there 's no tellin ' what he 'll do . and he 's our only chance for the pennant . Kelly is not indispensable . but we can 't get along without him . Lemme go talk to him . Lemme see what it 's all about . fellas . Come on now . now pitching for St. Louis . Jimmy . he quit . He picked up his toys and went home . - Where is he ? - In the locker room . I wanna see him right now . to walk off the mound in the middle of a game . Especially an important one . Pitchers ain 't supposed to go home until they 're invited to . Monk . I had to . I saw someone in the stands . You mean a copper or somethin ' ? no . Someone I knew . Someone who knew me before I even joined the club . kid . It was liable to happen any time . and when it does I 've gotta do exactly what I did today . Now wait a minute . Be reasonable . Kelly ! Hey Kelly ! Where 's Kelly ? He 's gone . I 'm standin ' here talkin ' to him and he 's gone . Gone ! Gone where ? What 's the matter with him ? boss . He wanted the afternoon off to go to his grandmother 's funeral . How do I know what 's the matter with him ? Monk ? Where you been ? Here . Why ain 't you asleep ? I been with Stone and Dolan . They had me on the carpet so long I got fallen arches . and I get bawled out . though . You can thank your Uncle Monk for it . I talked myself blue in the face . they 're really gonna give it to ya good . ain 't you even interested ? it doesn 't matter . I 'm through anyway . Through ? You mean you 're gonna quit ? You ain 't gonna pitch no more ? There 's no point now . No point ? In winning the pennant ? You can 't quit now . You gotta keep pitching ' . kid ? Was it that guy in the stands ? He didn 't recognize ya . it 's only part of it . I 'm worried about my girl . So it was Madame X you met . I think she 's gonna find out too . Why ? Why should she ? Because I told her . but you think she 's gonna find out . and so is her father . Her father ? If he ever learns the truth I 'm really finished . He 'll never take me back . And I can 't say I blame him after what I said . What 'd ya say ? I was desperate . I certainly gave him a false impression . how serious it was . He thought I was doing something entirely different . That 's the only reason he let me go . Let you go ? Where 'd he have ya ? it doesn 't matter . It 's all finished . so there 's no use going on . Kelly . You gotta wait and see . Wait and see what ? what 'll she do ? see it for herself . doesn 't it ? Monk . That 's just why I 'm not gonna pitch . why did I say that ? I 'm makin ' it worse and worse . You gotta keep pitching ' . You can 't quit now . you know . You gotta give us a break . We got a chance to win a pennant in a World Series . That means somethin ' too . Yeah . I suppose so . Suppose so ? [ Phone rings ] [ Woman talking ] Mabel . Now neither of us gets any sleep . [ Woman continues talking ] but would you mind telling me what you 're doing ? Oh ! Father . reading the sports page with a magnifying glass . I was interested in a wild statement someone made . are you ? I don 't think so . There 's just an outside chance ... Is that Kelly pitching ? Yeah . Two out . Hank Moore at bat . Kelly ! Strike two . [ Cheering ] play ball . a process server ? I 'm lookin ' for a dame . I gotta talk to her first . A dame ? Ain 't you gettin ' pretty old for that ? crowd cheers ] Strike three ! You 're out . Yes ! I saw him . It 's really Vernon . lady . He 's Kelly . So did he . But I didn 't believe him . That 's certainly a blow for Jimmy Dolan . Lannigan is the only catcher that 's worked with Kelly all season . there 's no telling what may happen . Doc ? he 'll be alright . don 't - they just told me . - Do you have to use those splints ? - What else ? do they have to be wood ? What do you want ' em made of ? Mother of pearl ? I don 't think you better try to - will ya ? This ain 't the first clipped finger I ever had . but those splints . you worry about the pitching ' . I 'll worry about the catching ' . cheer ] You 're out ! why not let somebody else catch ? kid ? Come on . Foul ! I 'm seein ' things . it 's me eyes . Foul ! Cock-eyed son of a sea cook . Monk . but Jimmy - You can 't even pick ' em up after you drop ' em . Jimmy - he 'll get his purple heart later . Monk . Calahan catching . Calahan catching for St. Louis . [ Crowd booing ] I 'd like to see Mr. Kelly . I 'm a friend of his . lady . You won 't be able to go up there . All the boys 'll be in the shower . Oh . Well . I 'll wait . 'Night . you 're Madame X. ain 't ya ? Yes . I want to see him . sister . honey . Just get outta here . Come on . honey . and the last thing every night . You do ? Kelly 's got your picture right in the middle of the dresser . and everything else . Also his pal . see ? That 's why I shanghaied ya . I don 't quite understand . if he knew you or anybody else was watchin ' him he 'd walk right out of the ballpark . He done it the other day . Oh . Well that must 've been the day dad was there . He 's liable to walk out altogether . we 're dead and so is he . You don 't wanna hurt the guy just when he 's right on top . Or do ya ? no ! Of course not . see ? Bring your friends . I 'll even send ya passes only don 't let Kelly see . I 'll sit way up in the farthest corner . You 're not sore at the guy ? no . and have him turn out to be a big league pitcher . a professor . I 'll be . Are you surprised ? because that 's exactly what I thought he was . You know it seems so fantastic . I only came to the game today to make sure . I found myself rooting for Vernon like mad . I think it 's wonderful . so that 's what his name is ? Maybe I shouldn 't have told you . no . you and me . All right . but he can pick dames . I could fall in love with you myself very easy . [ Crowd cheering ] Kelly ! Isn 't he wonderful ? lady . One run and we have the pennant . Only we 're not gonna get it this inning . Why not ? Because the tail end of the batting order is up . and then Kelly . kid . I 'm gonna win this one for ya . Monk ! you gotta do it ! Strike one ! crowd cheering ] It 's a homer ! Lannigan 's hit a homer ! folks . And the pennant for St. Louis . where have you been ? St. Louis . Again ? I can 't help but worry . if you promise not to tell - Yes ? Both managers are starting their ace pitchers for the first game of the series . Here are the batteries . It 's Keets and Topina for New York . St. Louis - Kelly and Lannigan . It seems so incredible . I can hardly believe it . Joe ? I think it 's outrageous - that he never pitched on the varsity . and it 's still anybody 's series . how about this one ? First of the ninth - St. Louis has a two run lead . Steiner 's up . Kelly stretches . Steiner swings and misses . Strike one ! Kelly ! Professor . Professor ? don 't you know who Kelly is ? And Steiner goes down swinging . folks . Kelly 's done it again . [ Cheering ] Vernon 's won again ! Who ? Daddy . Vernon is King Kelly . What ? time to get up . [ Groan ] [ Crackling ] [ Crackling and groaning ] Monk . Have you been using my hair tonic ? Hair tonic ? Oh yeah . I 'm growin ' a whole new crop Ain 't ya noticed ? Did you take the bottle out of my suitcase ? Oh yeah . I meant to tell ya . I seen it in there last week . I didn 't think you 'd mind . It 's my last bottle . What did you do with it ? ya know . I gotta go get it . What for ? You 're wearing a cap . [ Door slams ] Jumpin ' Jupiter . What a character . [ Crackling ] [ Crackling ] [ Crackling ] [ Knocking at door ] Come in . but uh - Kelly . [ Crackling ] [ Crackling ] [ Crackling ] the way my hair 's behaving ' . Jimmy . What 's on your mind ? Well it 's the hair tonic . What ? The hair tonic . Did Monk give you a bottle of my hair tonic ? Oh yeah . I just tried it . I was losin ' a few . Monk said it 'd grow hair on a billiard ball . Kind of an insult . and I can 't duplicate it . I 'm willing to pay for it . How much do you want ? no . It isn 't that . and I need it . You need it ? What for ? You gonna play for the House of David ? no - it 's a little ideosyncrosy of mine . you know ? but hair tonic - that 's a new one . Jimmy - Have you got it ? yeah . Where did I put it ? here it is . On the top shelf . [ weakly ] Oh - [ Crowd cheering ] fans . St. Louis still trailing 6 to 5 . Something 's happened to Kelly . He 's not himself today . Maybe it 's the strain . this game means the series . but those St. Louis boys have come back strong . crowd cheers ] I can 't understand it . What 's happened with Vernon ? and Marconi scores . St. Louis 5 but Kelly 's in real trouble again . kid ? Monk . It 's gone . steady down . Let ' em hit a few . There 's seven men behind you . They can handle it . They 're a great ball club . they better be . And he 's out . and New York has a two run lead . [ Clapping ] crowd cheers ] Quit worrying ' . This ball game ain 't over yet . I wish it were . your hop ain 't workin ' . but them batter 's don 't . You gotta use psychology . It 's gonna take more than psychology . kid . You gotta keep bluffing ' all the time . you gotta go out there lookin ' as cocky - Louie . I 'd go to Jimmy and ask him to relieve me . But I 'm not gonna do it . I hope he lets me stay . Kelly . Now you 're talkin ' . crowd cheers ] And Tony gets a beautiful double . St. Louis is still in this old ballgame . The tying run is on second . but I 'm gonna go down trying . And even if we do lose - Will you quit talkin ' about losin ' . We got two men on . crowd cheers ] crowd cheers ] It 's another two-bagger . too . And St. Louis is ahead again . Eight to seven . Kelly ? Monk . crowd cheers ] And Davis is out at first . That 's two down for St. Louis . And Stevens is up . crowd cheers ] Come on . Let 's go . Atta boy . I 'm leavin ' you in . It 's your game to win or lose . All you gotta do is hope . kid . sir ? - You 're leaving him in ? - Yeah . Gonna gamble . Jimmy 's gonna leave him in . He 's gambling everything on King Kelly . and Kelly is facing the top of the New York batting order . You mean to say St. Louis is ahead again ? Mother . Eight to seven . Now if Vernon can only hold ' em . [ Whoop ] Strike one ! [ Crowd cheers ] [ Crack ] That 's one man out . the game is over . But that 's an awful big if right now . crowd cheers ] ladies and gentlemen . What a game . and Aaron is up . crowd cheers ] It 's a beautiful catch . ladies and gentlemen . but he 's grimly hanging on to that one run lead . There 's two out now . Man on second . And blockbuster Marx comes to bat . He 's gotten three hits off Kelly this afternoon . folks . crowd cheers ] He did it ! He caught it ! [ Crowd cheers ] and Kelly 's won his own game . [ Raucous yelling ] we 're the World Champions ! when you walked into my office that day I called you a crackpot . I wish I had a dozen crackpots like you . Jimmy . Thank you . that hand looks bad . How 's it feel ? Well it 's rather painful . I thought so . Come on . We 'd better get that X-rayed . I 'm gonna crown ' im . Doc ? I 'm afraid it 's serious . Serious ? It can 't be . Can 't you do something ? Doc . This kid 's the greatest pitcher in baseball . Just as I feared . extending into the joint . Doc ? Can 't you say it in English ? It means he 's through . huh ? Yes . kid ? it 's not too bad . What about the X-rays ? the Doc - he made up with a lot of mumbo jumbo . You know how those guys are . What did he say ? Kelly . I wanna tell you something . and what 's it got me ? it 's what you do . Monk . Kelly . kid . A season like nobody ever had before . but - Lucky ? and don 't let nobody ever tell you different . and I know . You could pitch for twenty years and never do no better . kid . you got nothin ' to look forward to . What 's this all about ? So what 's it matter if you pitch for one year or for twenty ? None of us is indestructible . We all gotta quit sometime . Monk ? that 's what I 'm tryin ' to tell ya . kid . He said you ain 't gonna pitch no more . He did ? I never dreamt my career would end this way . kid . And I ain 't never gonna forget it . I 'm gonna spend the rest of my life goin ' around bragging ' that King Kelly was my roommate . I 'm gonna throw it in the pound . eh kid ? Monk . I hope so . what do you say ? of course . kid ? I dont ' know . I - but I don 't think there 's much chance of that . huh ? Not after the way I left and what I 've been doing since . I suppose the best thing that I should do is go back and make a clean breast of the whole thing . And when I do - you ain 't murdered nobody or nothin ' . All you done was play ball . I know . I only did it to get enough money to marry my girl . I haven 't much hope . But they oughtta know that . I don 't get it . It don 't make no sense to me . Monk . I was a chemistry teacher . I can tell you that now . And the sum of money I received for teaching science to the youth of this state for an entire year was a little less than I got in a single afternoon for tossing a five-ounce sphere past a young man holding a wooden stick . Kelly . everybody 'd turn out to be dumb clucks . - All aboard ! Like me . You did alright . I hope you keep on . kid . I guess I 'd better be moving . guess you better . kid ? just fine . I - and you 've been a real one . and I and I just wanted to say that - I just don 't know how to say what I want to say . Neither do I. Leave us not try . uh - I 'll get in touch with you as soon as I get things straightened out . Kelly . kid . I hate to see you goin ' . Me too . Kelly . so long . Say hello to Mabel . Yeah . [ Train whistle blows ] Mister - This is your stop . - What ? - This is where you get off . We 're coming in now . oh thank you . Come on ! [ Cheering and band music playing ] Darling ! you 're wonderful ! I 'm so proud of you . You mean you know ? Everybody knows ? of course ! And we 've all been rooting for you like mad . oh - your hand . Does it hurt very much ? no . it 's terrible . Monk said you 'd never pitch again . he called . Vernon . He even got us tickets for the game . what about your father ? I suppose he knows too . Vernon . I know all about it too . Vernon . We all know . about my old job . Do you think there 's any chance - Vernon . That 's what I thought . Mr. Stone has given us the money for the research labratory . You 're the only man he 'll let us put in as director . Mr. Kelly . You were terrific . professor . You sure put that and butyl on that ball . [ Cheering ] Dad ! and Sage 2009

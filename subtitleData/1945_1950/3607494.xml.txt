 [ alarm buzzing ] Hello . Who 's there ? I say , who 's there ? Who is at the gate ? Please answer . [ gun firing ] Michael , where have you been ? Did you hear that shot ? Harper , you 're a suspicious fool . If it weren 't for me , you 'd have no notes at all . I like you , meeker . You do your job well . You 're honest . That 's why I like you . I like your work , harper , But otherwise , I detest you as much as anyone else in this house . [ intercom buzzing ] Absent-minded as usual . You forgot to make your notes . Yes , roth ? ( roth ) I must see you , sir . There 's a murderer about the place . One of your relatives , no doubt . Coming , roth . What 's this about a murderer ? Well- - Uh , wait . Go on , meeker , we 're through for the night . Subtle as a blast of t.N.T. , isn 't he ? Well , what was it this time ? Someone shot at me from the gate . Was everyone at home here ? No , michael was outside , working in the garage . Michael , huh ? Well , none of them are going to get what they 're after . Let 's go and see if anyone 's been tampering . [ buzzer buzzing ] Strange safety vault , eh , roth ? Both doors wide open to anyone finding that panel in the hall . Like a spider 's web , sir . Easy to get into , impossible to get out of . And I 'm the spider , huh ? [ laughs ] No , nobody 's tried to steal it yet . [ buzzer buzzing ] What in blazes is that new word combination ? Oh , roth ! Can you hear me ? Roth ! Did you call , sir ? Yes , of course . Will you- - Oh , never mind , I remember . [ buzzer buzzing ] Works beautifully , roth . Any thief who enters there will die within an hour . And if he has a gas mask , He 'll die of starvation before I let him out . Of course , sir , you would . Only we know the word combination , roth . And even you can 't rob me Because the words have to be spoken in my voice . Yes , sir . You think of almost everything . [ chuckles ] [ buzzer buzzing ] About the shot fired at me , shall I call the police ? I 've told you before , I don 't want any police around here . Yes , sir , but I like police , Especially when there 's a murderer about . Well , uh , don 't let them come into the house . I don 't trust police any more than I trust my own relatives , Or my servants . [ alarm buzzing ] ( roth ) hello . Who is there , please ? Police . Open the gate . Police ? But no one called you here . No , but I--I want to see someone in there . Open up . [ gates creaking ] [ rustling ] Who 's there ? Hold on . Who are you ? What are you doing in there ? Police ! Open the door . Why were you so long coming from the gate ? I , uh , thought I saw a prowler in the grounds . Inside ? But no one could get inside ! However , there is someone outside with a gun . Come on , open the door . Mr. Harper wants no one inside . You should look around outside the gates . Ok , I 'll do that . [ engine revving ] Ready to go ? Yeah . [ engine starting ] [ engine revving ] [ gates creaking ] [ key turning in lock ] [ door closes ] Is that you , roth ? Who 's there ? Who 's there ? Answer me , who 's there ? Mr. Chan , it sure is good that you 's a big detective . You sure carries a lot of weight . My personality always count in end . Uh , your personality is all right , But just ain 't enough of it to close this bag . Eddie , remove nose from book and come over here . Please call me edward , father . Eddie is so juvenile . Number 4 son , eddie Is very expensively educated bookworm . Please , forget brain and use brawn . Very well , but your modus operandi is all wrong . According to the science of gravity , The pressure of the weight of a solid body is useless Unless directed solely at a single point . His language is strictly stratospheric , Too high-flown for me . Allow me to demonstrate . Pardon me . There you are . [ phone ringing ] Charlie chan speaking . Oh , good evening , inspector godfrey . Charlie , I 'll pick you up in 5 minutes . Murder case . Murder ? Oh , I 'm very sorry , inspector , But I 'm not interested in murder now . I 'll 2nd the motion in a hurry . But please , I must be back in washington , d.C. Tomorrow . I 've contacted washington , charlie . They want you on the case because the victim was working On something the government 's interested in . Oh , that is new look on old business . Will be ready to leave for harper house On cove road immediately . Mr. Chan , you changed your mind and ruined my peace of mind . Pardon my exuberance , pop , but let 's go . Excuse , please . Name on police invitation mine , not yours . Goodbye . Can you beat that ? Boy , that 's just what I want to do , beat it . Why , he 's on another one of them murder things . You know , charlie , It takes nature 2 million years to make coal . Scientists now perform the same process in 2 hours . Harper , working along similar lines , has a gas process That hardens wood to the toughness and durability of metal . Such process extremely valuable to any nation In war or peace . That 's why the government wants you on the scene . [ chuckles ] Harper 's home is out of my jurisdiction . Sheriff mack in charge of the case Phoned me to bring him a good man . Evening , sheriff . Evening , inspector . Where 's the body ? Mmm , yeah , that 's what keeps me worrying , too . Roth here says it 's murder , But so far I ain 't seen no victim . But , gentlemen , it must be murder . An hour ago , I was up in my room , ready to retire . Then the buzzer sounded . It was mr . Harper calling me from the gas chamber . What did he say ? He was gasping as if choked and said : " roth , I 've been murdered . It was ... " Then there was silence . I telephoned the sheriff and got dressed again . When I was dressed and came down , sheriff mack had arrived . I let him in . We went into the gas chamber where mr . Harper had called from- - And found nothing , not even harper . Then we roused everyone and searched the house . Still nothing . Then we searched the grounds . Same thing , nothing . Seems as if question to be Was mr . Harper alive or dead When he so strangely disappeared ? Yeah , seems as if . Hmm . That is gas chamber ? Yep , that 's it . Wait . Be careful . You need a mask to go in there . Gas is deadly ? No , but it causes painful nausea after half an hour . Thank you . You are ... Walter meeker , laboratory assistant to mr . Harper . Thank you so much . You , uh , have questioned all of these people , sheriff ? Uh , well , now that you mention it , That 's just what I was gonna do . Well , now , I want to know who you are , what you are , What you 're doing and what you been doing . Stands to reason we got to know . Does that cover the ground ? Most thoroughly , sheriff . You know me , mack . Socially , yes , but this is business , so speak up . I 'm louise harper , sister to the dead ... The missing man . Sister ? And yet you wear uniform of housekeeper . Well , I 'm his orphan niece , and he made me his housemaid . I 'm jean kent . And you ? You refuse to speak ? Well , he can 't speak , sir . He 's michael strong , chauffeur , handyman , and a mute . I 'm stella graham . I was assisting mr . Harper in experiments with puppets . Experiments with puppets ? And ventriloquists and display dummies . Mr. Harper had an idea for a toy robot for children . Seems mr . Harper have many irons in same fire . You are butler , mr . Roth ? Yes , sir . I 've been with mr . Harper for 15 years . [ meeker laughing ] In serious moment , you think of something funny ? ( meeker ) if something has happened to mr . Harper , Roth has just admitted he 's your chief suspect . Explain , please . Anyone who had to be near harper disliked him , Even hated him . Roth has been with him years longer than anyone else . So , roth hated him more than any of us possibly could . Is what gentleman say true , mr . Roth ? No one knows my opinion of mr . Harper except myself . And no one else ever will know . When you rouse household , uh , All inmates , uh , have retired ? Everyone . Except mr . Meeker . I was just retiring . When I went upstairs , I left harper with roth . By the way , Since you let everyone in and out of here , What about that policeman I saw upstairs ? The policeman came up to the door , then he left the grounds . Oh , no ! He was inside . Jean and I saw him . No , stella 's wrong . I saw no policeman at all . ( stella ) but you did . We both saw him at the same time in the hall . I 'm sorry , but miss graham must be mistaken . Policeman from city force ? Must have been . I got none . Must have been jim kimball . He 's nearest here . I 'll check . You folks stay here until we want you again . You know , the way I packed , Things are liable to pop when I open this bag . So look out , you 're liable to see A barrage of haberdashers poppin ' out . Hey , you didn 't go and buy a new bag ? You know I only got 2 hands . Well , these are for the people moving in . Moving in ? But we haven 't moved out ! Oh , that 's what you think . Mr. Chan checked out today . [ laughs ] There 's not another room in the whole hotel ! Well , no matter what pop says , He can 't keep me from murder now . Murder ? Murder ? Hey , hey , now wait , fellas , wait a minute . It-it 's not my fault you lost your rooms . Really it isn 't . [ thudding ] M-m-murder ! Now what do you suppose is the matter with him ? You said , " murder , " didn 't you ? Sure . Don 't use that word ! You know what it does to me . Oh , don 't be silly , birmingham . Come on , let 's go . Well , move over , trouble , here we come again . Ah , this looks like an excellent place for murder . That 's what I thought , But now by you agreeing with me , don 't make me happy . Oh , me ! [ foghorn blaring ] Hey , did you hear that echo ? That wasn 't an echo . It was a foghorn . Oh , a man can 't blow no horn that loud . The horn blows itself . Oh , the horn blows itself , that 's all . Hmm ? I 'm departing . No , no . We 're going in this place if I can open the gate . All right . Oh , me ! [ foghorn blaring ] There 's that echo again . Forget the echo . Come on , look around . Radio dispatcher can 't locate officer kimball . Says kimball wasn 't sent here . Being as how I 'm unaccustomed to murder , mr . Godfrey , I thought you 'd bring me a good detective . Well , I did , sheriff . This gentleman right here . Detective ? You 're awful quiet for one . I always reckoned a homicide detective Went around growling like a truck with a colic . Sheriff mack , this is inspector charlie chan . Famous honolulu detective . Very great pleasure . The pleasure is all mine Seeing as how even the idea of solving a murder Brings a misery into my mentality . But we 're not sure it is murder . Why , mr . Harper told roth he was murdered . Seems to me if anybody knowed about a murder , it 'd be the victim . Well , I 'm having my men make a thorough search of the grounds . Most excellent . In meantime , will continue search of interior . I 've done both them things already . No barber shave so close But another barber find some work to do . Reckon what he says is what you might call a cutting ' remark . [ alarm buzzing ] Well , ain 't nobody home but echoes . Thank goodness . ( roth ) who 's there , please ? [ foghorn continues blaring ] Now the echoes are starting to ask some questions . ( roth ) who is at the gate ? Who wants to know ? Let me talk , roth . What sort of a gadget is this ? You askin ' me ? Now you , outside , who 's there ? ( edward ) edward chan and birmingham brown . Chan ? Yes , assistant to charlie chan , world-famous detective . Looks like I got more than one helper , mr . Godfrey . That 's telling them , eddie . Beg your pardon , I mean edward . Get chan , mr . Roth . Yes , sir . ( inspector ) uh , you outside , come in . ( edward ) but the gate 's locked ! Push that other button , inspector . Oh . Hey , look ! [ gates creaking ] ( inspector ) come in . Uh , yes . Yes , sir . Are you inside ? Uh , why , I believe so , sir . Did you see that ? Now ain 't that something ? Echoes that ask questions , boxes that talk , Opening and shutting gates . Why , we should knock on wood faster than a woodpecker ! Don 't be absurd . By using forensic logic , We can explain everything away . Hmm . Oh ! Do you see what I see ? Go ahead now with your logic And explain this away from my nose . ( policeman ) all right , boys , get going . Yes , sir . Yes , sir . But gladly . Someone coming to see you , mr . Chan . See me ? Must be mistake . [ knocking on door ] Ah , greetings , father . I am right . It is mistake . Intruder is number 4 son , edward , Who stopped becoming college student to become social problem . Also , his assistant , birmingham brown . Uh , excuse , please . Will see you gentlemen in puppet room in few minutes . Now , will you explain why you butt in here like goat ? Because you checked us all out at the hotel . We have no place to stay . Oh , my mistake . Very bad one . Now that I 'm here , pop , what type of murder have we got ? And how soon do you wish me to produce the murderer ? Every time you open your mouth You put in more feet than centipede . Remain here , and produce nothing but silence . Desire to ask questions . Was there any place mr . Harper might go when he wished to be alone ? Where does harper hide his process and formula notes ? He disappears every so often . I bet he goes there . Ask roth . He should know , if anyone does . I know of no such place . Oh , you- - Yes ? Oh , excuse me , please . I--I don 't know why I said that- - I- - Very strange household . Head of house is missing , yet no one seems sorry . Believe someone pulled string to make mr . Harper disappear . Charlie chan will now pull string . [ screams ] Someone finally did it ! Harper 's dead at last . There is missing man . Must now find murderer . Can you remember notes so far ? What ? Yes , most of them . The important thing is to keep all data on the pieces tested to date . Government will appreciate your efforts , mr . Meeker . I only want to finish the job . But the supply of gas in the tanks downstairs Will only last a month . You see , I know the process for the use of the stuff , But the whole thing will be a total loss Unless you find harper 's formula For the composition of the gas . Once I find killer , will find formula . Good . Good . No possible chance I might arrest you as murderer ? Walter meeker never did and never will kill a man . Not worth the trouble . Yet you say everyone in house , Including yourself , hate mr . Harper . Just one happy family with murderer in center . The law can 't drop this case Just ' cause you got your eyebrows up . But I tell you no one should be allowed in that gas chamber . That ain 't what mr . Chan thinks . Why were you in there ? Have told mr . Meeker To continue important work begun by mr . Harper . You told him ! What business is it of yours ? It is government business . I am humble representative of government . Reckon now you better answer our questions Instead of upsetting yourself By making wild guesses as to why we 're askin ' them . Desire to know where mr . Harper keep gas formula , please . If anyone knew where the formula was kept , I would . But I know nothing about it at all . To get information from him Is like putting empty bucket into empty well . Yeah , he is kind of dried up . Note many life masks of household about place . Why ? Mr. Harper made them . If anyone here stole something , The masks would be of great assistance To the police in tracking down the criminals . We must remember that . Mr. Chan . Something has occurred , birmingham ? No , sir . Nothing occurred at all , but something happened . Yes , we just took our baggage upstairs , pop . Only we didn 't , sir . Uh , one moment . You take up , you ... You will explain , please ? You see , mr . Chan , Them 4 suitcases was awful heavy to lug upstairs . Oh , you have difficulty in carrying them ? No , sir , no difficulty at all . We just couldn 't do it . But miss graham came along- - Yes , sir , and she picked up not one , not 2 , But all 4 of them bags , and carried them upstairs Just like wasn 't nothing to it ! Miss graham ? Seems like astounding feat of strength for a woman . Nothing astounding at all , sir . Besides being a puppeteer and ventriloquist , Miss graham was also a strong woman in vaudeville . [ phone ringing ] I 'll answer that . Yeah ? Oh , hello , doc . Dead ? Hmm . Huh ? You sure , doc ? Hmm . You wait there . I 'll be over , with company . Bye . Doc peabody . Coroner . He just made a tour of the victim 's interior . You know , autopsy . He says that harper wasn 't murdered at all . Coroner say victim not murdered ? No . He says that harper died of natural causes . Very sorry , but humble opinion is murder . Peabody 's a good man . He says it ain 't so . Will visit doctor , But I 'm certain it was murder . It must have been . [ phone ringing ] Yeah ? Oh , hello , inspector godfrey . Hmm ? What ? Oh , yeah , I see . No , no , I mean I don 't see ! But I 'll ask mr . Chan and see what he sees of it . Yeah . Phew ! This thing has got my brain running around like a scalded cat . Inspector godfrey said officer kimball wasn 't located last night And today he 's missing entirely . Seems like some motorist saw kimball Near the harper house last night . Inspector godfrey says how he thinks Kimball 's mixed up in the harper killing . Possibility to be considered . You 're right , mr . Chan . This poison dart killed harper . Found it embedded in the back of his throat . How can you shoot a man inside the mouth , huh ? When mouth open , just like yours . Ever so often , and sometimes oftener , I get the feeling I ought to be in some other business . How did you know it was there , mr . Chan ? You , uh , study medicine ? No , dr . Peabody , but I study crime a great deal . This is beyond me . Glad to have your company in my misery , doc . As my grandpa used to say : It 's wonderful what doctors know . It 's what they don 't know that 'll kill you . Now look here- - gotta go now . Excuse , please . Come on , speak up . When it comes to talkin ' , You people just don 't enter into the spirit of the thing . But I 've already told you . The policeman came to the door , then he left the grounds . Policeman was mr . Kimball ? I didn 't know the officer . But he did not get in ! But he did ! I saw him- - Please . All may go except miss graham and miss kent . I 'll not leave this frightened girl alone with you men . Miss graham , You see policeman inside house last night ? Yes , I did , in the hall . Jean saw him at the same time . Thank you . You may go . Officer kimball was perhaps young , good-looking ? Oh , my wife thinks he is . Your wife undoubtedly correct . ( chan ) perhaps he come to see young , good-looking girl . Jim kimball came to see me . What in the name of tunket would he want to see you for ? Jim , officer kimball , was coming to see me . Go on . He was to come to the gate at 9 : 00 . I was to let him in and then we would meet in the grounds . But at 9 : 00 roth was at the front door and I couldn 't open the gate . Miss graham and mr . Meeker say policeman come later . Yes , that 's right . I thought it was jim , but now I 'm not sure . You mean , murder made you change your mind ? Yes . Now I 'm sure the policeman I saw was not jim kimball . Officer kimball only policeman near here . I don 't care . Jim didn 't come here last night . But there was a policeman here . Then why did you say you didn 't see one at first ? Because I was afraid for jim . Hmm . Excellent reason . You may go now . [ knocking on door ] Hey , pop , the police found a motorcycle In the bushes down by the gate . Officer kimball machine ? That 's what the man said . What became of kimball ? You suppose he 's the murderer ? Oh , that is question deserving much thought . Gentlemen , in this matter of thought , I 'm sure that I can assist the both of you . He reach oversize decision with undersize brain . Relax . [ laughing ] You know what , eddie ? I got a theory on this murder . Ha ! That 's something I 'd like to hear . Yeah ? Well , listen . Now , the way I figure this thing out , The murderer must be on the inside . So , what we got to do is- - What ? Stay outside . No . We stay here till the case is finished . Stay here ? Mmm , I thought you 'd say that . [ knocking on door ] Oh , me ! Oh , find anything more , sheriff ? No . Motorcycle 's all I found . Kimball 's still missing . Very strange . Miss graham , miss kent , mr . Meeker Say policeman inside house last night . Yet mr . Roth , he ... [ footsteps approaching ] ( chan ) mr . Roth ? One moment . Believe you have not told us all you know . I 'm sure of that , sir . Oh , you are ? Hmm . Well , you 'd better speak up right now . No , no , not yet . Give me 5 minutes . Why you wish time ? In 5 minutes , I 'll tell you who murdered mr . Harper . Whom you suspect ? That 's my affair . Someone here tried to make me out a killer . I 'll clear myself of suspicion and do it alone . We go with you . No ! I do this myself or not at all . 5 minutes . 5 minutes already up . And roth ain 't back yet . We see what happened to mysterious gentleman . Uh , mr . Chan ? There 's mr . Roth down there . But roth went upstairs and there 's only one way up or down . Well , all the same , there he is down there . Uh-oh . Something happened to him . Yes ? Mr. Roth is dead . Dead ? Hmm . Now he can 't tell us who he suspected . You know , mr . Chan , I can 't figure out How roth got downstairs and got his feet wet . Strange part is how man with wet feet Make tracks beginning only in middle of passageway . [ footsteps approaching ] No . Don 't touch . Any of you seen mr . Roth lately ? Roth ? Why , no . What 's the congregation for ? To find a murderer . [ laughs ] You won 't find harper 's killer by questioning . Now seek murderer of mr . Roth . Questions will begin immediately in living room . All right , everybody . Inside , please . You will telephone dr . Peabody To perform immediate autopsy . You see ? That 's the way to solve crimes . Fast work , especially fast questioning . If anybody want to live around here , They got to do some fast running . 2 men are murdered . Yet everyone here have perfect alibi . Is that strange ? Sounds strange to me , But maybe I 'm a little particular . Remain where you are for present , all of you . You telephone doctor ? Yes . He 's on his way here , pop . Good . Stay here . Watch door , and let doctor in when he comes . Birmingham , you remain here and watch body . Yes , sir . Hmm ? Ain 't that something ! This place is jumping with live people And I got to stay here and keep company with a body . Oh , me ! Why , miss harper , what you do here ? Well , I thought that- - Something wrong ? W-well ... Oh , yes , I came to get the vase . Vase ? Mr. Roth always liked flowers . Why , it 's gone ! This missing vase ? Yes . Things misplaced sometimes furnish very good clues . Return downstairs , miss harper . I 'm the head of the house now . And I have a right to know what you do . You think perhaps mr . Harper , in his will Leave you house and gas formula ? Well , I don 't know , but I am his sister . Please return downstairs . [ door closing ] You don 't think she killed him ? Her own brother ? Murder know no law of relativity . [ dictaphone whirring ] Recording dictaphone . What 's that got to do with us ? Why is machine still running ? ( harper ) and let no one else , Not even my sister , louise , or my niece , jean ... ( roth ) murder ! Here . Here . " murder . Here , here . " what did roth mean ? Soaking wet . Roth , in falling , knock over vase of flowers and get shoes wet . Roth die right here . But he was downstairs walking around . Both the boys saw him . Roth dead when he walk downstairs . But dead men don 't walk . This dead man both walk and talk . This is a way beyond me . Seems to me when folks asked me to run for sheriff , I missed a fine chance to keep quiet . Strange combination of light [ tinkling ] And bell . Must find how same works . Yep , I missed an elegant chance to keep my mouth shut . Same type murder , except this dart Got roth in the back of the neck . He arrived a few minutes ago , pop , to see harper . Where is harper ? I want to talk to him . Why , please ? To get back this house and the gas formula he stole from my father . He stole from your father ? What 's your name ? Lloyd archer . Harper 's my stepfather . Very sorry . Mr. Harper dead . Yep . Murdered . Really ? Too bad someone else had the pleasure of killing him , Because I meant to do it the first time I got close enough to him . Where 's harper ' s will and the gas formula ? Why- - Uh , government also looking for same . The government ? I represent government . Well , I 'm staying right here to protect my interests . Certainly . Would not think of allowing you to depart , mr . Archer . Hey . Through investigating , pop ? Almost through investigating forever Because you fall asleep and forget to watch . Something happen ? Someone try to kill me . Why don 't we pursue whoever it was ? No , no . Cannot run with poison dart in clothing . One scratch in skin and I 'm very dead man . Wait . I see it , pop . Who did it , pop ? Might know if you awake . But now everyone in house will be in bed With slumber alibi , just like you . I 'm sorry , pop . But the association of ideas ... Well , you know , wearing pajamas made--made one sleepy . Uh-uh , please eliminate scientific analysis . In future , when I put you on job to watch something , You associate ideas with job at hand . Understand ? [ door closes ] Miss harper . Oh ! Oh ! I thought you were ... You thought I was dead ? No , I ... I meant I--I thought you were asleep . Unfortunately , only one asleep was lazy assistant . You frightened , miss harper ? Well , who wouldn 't be , Knowing there 's a murderer in the house ? Strange architecture here . Yes , I noticed that also . Please , pajamas loud enough without you make extra noise . Large surface contain 4 walls with no opening . My brother rebuilt this part of the house . He--he had it done while he was alone here . You know why ? My brother never told people why he did things . Perhaps excellent place to contain secret papers . That 's possible . Wall space paneled . Perhaps panel contain secret door . Is that why you came ? I was making my usual last-minute rounds of the house . May I go now ? Pop , if there is a secret panel here , You just relax . I 'll find it for you . My boy , if silence is golden , you are bankrupt . Uh , you want to talk with archer , too ? I 'm curious to learn How mr . Roth walked downstairs after being killed upstairs . Well , speaking wide-flung and unrestrained I can 't see how it was done unless roth was a zombie . You know , one of them corpses That don 't know enough to stay parked in their coffin . Think we find simpler solution . I sure hope so . Because right now my mind is as uneasy as corn in a popper . A zombie . Now we 're cooking with spirit oil . Come on , we 've got to see what happens . Mmm-mmm , I ain 't curious about seeing no zombies . Oh , come on ! Curiosity never killed a chan . No , but the chans ' curiosity almost killed me . I don 't know how I get into all of this trouble . I get a job , I must- - I got to have my brains examined . Oh , birmingham , wait a minute . Where are you goin ' ? You know , I 'm interested In how you 're gonna figure on roth 's walkin ' around . Mr. Roth say he knew identity of killer . Unfortunately , mr . Roth speak truth , so he die . Here . Possibly we find solution of both murders here . Now what do you suppose this is ? An electric light , I reckon . [ ringing ] Who turn on strange lamp ? No one . It just lit up and rang when I picked it up . That is alarm lamp . Alarm ? What for ? Alarm for ... Downstairs , quick ! Hurry ! Birmingham , You see anyone go through that passageway recently ? That housekeeper lady . She went through there a few minutes ago . Look , pop , there is a secret panel . There 's someone in there . I heard- - [ thudding ] Who is there ? I don 't know . Excuse me . Who is inside ? I hear sound like gas escaping . How you open this ? Only my brother and roth knew how to open that panel . Maybe the killer 's in there . If killer there , gas will kill him . Don 't want that . You know nothing of mechanism ? Roth told me it could be opened Only by a combination of spoken words . You mean that door will open if you speak to it ? There 's an electrical microphone in the panel . Microphone changes sound into vibration which work lock ? Yes , but only if- - oh ! Something wrong ? That panel opens only if the right words are spoken By my brother 's voice . And harper 's dead . One moment , please . Uh , your brother very absent-minded ? Perhaps mr . Roth might know his secrets ? Oh , I 'm sure he did . My brother had to have someone to remember things for him . Eddie , go to mr . Roth room , Bring down recording dictaphone and all records . Hurry ! Yes , father . Can produce mr . Harper 's voice . That 's right . We heard it on the machine upstairs . But you must have only the correct words . If correct words not on record , Person in there must die . See any more records ? Not in sight . We 'll take this down , then come back and look around . Let 's hurry up and get out of here . Hook it up . We 'll look for more records upstairs , pop . Ok . ( harper ) roth , write huntrey that rubber dissolves Under my gas processes . Won 't work . From now on , roth , I want the house and grounds locked up every night at 7 : 00 . Let no one out , not even my sister , louise , or my niece , jean . ( roth ) murder . Here . Here . That 's all on that one . Hold , please . These 2 blank . No good . No more records up there , pop . Then these are last 2 . Hold , please . ( harper ) roth , check gas gauges on the chamber and vault . Do it today . Let me have other record . You do that on purpose ? No . No , I--I was nervous , I ... Roth , I 'm changing the word combination . Tell it to you later . Here 's the new word combo , roth . Don 't forget it . 30 days hath September , July and August . [ buzzer buzzing ] Mr. Chan , it 's a woman . Jean ! [ gasps ] It 's miss graham . She 's not dead . Get doctor ! Yes , sir . Eddie . Sheriff . No , please . You will go with others . But my brother 's things are in there . They--they belong to me . Government will decide that . But- - Please , if you have complaint to make , Uh , you will refer to secret service , washington d.C. Outside . You insist you saw wall panel open in rear hall ? Yes , I 've told you and told you . All the doors were open to that--that horrible room where the desk is . Then why did you go back there in the first place ? Because I thought I heard someone back there . You were looking for mr . Harper 's formula . No ! I saw the desk and lifted the top . Then I was locked in and gas pouring on me . I didn 't touch a thing inside that desk . ( chan ) you may go now . She seems fully recovered . But another 10 minutes in that gas And nothing could have saved her . And she didn 't even say thanks . Bet you she 's our murderer . [ knocking on door ] [ knocking on door ] Hey , pop , we 've solved the case . You solve case ? Yes , we 've been talking to michael and he wrote notes . He says he 's bringing something That will expose the murderer . ( chan ) michael , you have something to show me ? Doctor ! Looks like he 's dead . Murder ? We 'll soon find out . You notice all life masks strangely missing from walls ? Say , that 's so , too . Hmm . While we with dr . Peabody , Someone enter this house and remove masks . Why 'd anyone do that ? To prevent us from knowing which mask michael had , Because that mask would convict killer . Then archer wasn 't the killer . Them masks were from people inside the house . This is ear from broken mask which michael possessed . Good . We 'll match it up with the ears of the people in the house . But this ear is from mask made from dead man . Dead ? Don 't know which way to turn . Like the fella with the short blanket . Stayed awake all night Wondering whether to pull it up and freeze his feet , Or pull it down and die of pneumonia . We 'll soon end suspense . Bring all suspects down to living room . See if anyone in gas chamber . 3 men killed already . Mmm-hmm , if it keeps up , there won 't be none of us left . Say , what are we staying here for ? We 're supposed to look around . So come on . Let 's look around . Look around . Look around . That 's all you always talkin ' about . " look around . See something . Watch me . " Why don 't you get a seeing eye dog or something , Somebody to help you ? Wonder what is this ? Huh ! This is a cabinet . Always telling somebody to be watching and looking for something . Good evening , officer . Hey , eddie , I ain 't nervous no more now . Why not ? Well , I just saw an officer in there . And any time an officer is around , I ain 't nervous . Good . It is a policeman . Yeah , but he 's dead . ( birmingham ) mr . Chan . Mr. Chan , come quick ! In there . It 's jim . Jim kimball . Has been dead for many hours . At last pieces of murder puzzle begin to fit in place . Where 's archer ? He 's your killer . Will locate mr . Archer when I require him . 3 men are murdered by poison darts . Dart fired by some strange kind of air gun . Air gun ? Then the case is solved . Miss kent had that air pump in her hand when michael was killed . Yes , but I didn 't kill michael . You use air pump for slow leak in tire . Please forget fast leak from there . Tire pump not deadly weapon . Then what was used ? Something else was carried in hands among those present . This . Oh , yes . Archer had that . Ventriloquist 's dummy . When dummy 's mouth opens , Ventriloquist 's voice usually issues forth . But when this dummy 's mouth open , Something more deadly emerge . Observe . Very fine air gun concealed within mechanism of this figure . That 's why we can 't find archer . He 's the killer . Excuse , please . [ inaudible ] Mr. Roth , dying , tried to leave important clue . Yeah , he said into that dictaphone thing : " murder . Here , here . " No . Believe mr . Roth trying to say : " murderer ... " ear , Ear . " Meaning this ear . Why , that 's from the mask michael had . Michael , like roth See in this important clue . Well , well , whose life mask is the ear from ? From mask of murdered man . Will now demonstrate how dead man can walk . Come this way , please . Does he mean archer is the murderer ? Of course . I ain 't sayin ' . But any gent with notions on the subject can 't speak up too quick . Uh , the ladies are welcome to talk , too . Oh , look ! As pop says , that proves dead men can walk , Only when they have lots of help . So roth 's corpse had to have crutches to walk , Which proves that chan was right When he said it was an inside job . But , uh , archer was an outsider . Mr. Roth , now dead , Made to appear to walk downstairs By someone upstairs who need alibi . Must have been a strong person to do the trick . Also someone familiar With handling puppets by means of strings . Then she did it . She 's a master puppeteer and she 's stronger than a man . It 's not true . I didn 't kill roth . I killed no one . ( chan ) you commit no murder . But you do make dead man appear to walk . No , you 're wrong ! You are accomplice of murderer . This ear will convict killer . Both roth and michael recognize What police already know : That like fingerprints , no 2 human ears are exactly alike . This ear taken from mask of murdered man . Man named Meeker . Me , murdered ? You 're crazy . Will prove sanity by comparing this ear with your own . If you are meeker , This will exactly match your right ear . Grab him . Grab him , birmingham . ( birmingham ) I 've got him ! I 've got him ! Will now prove , mr . Meeker , you are not even yourself . Why , it 's archer . Mr. Archer been in this house ever since he kill mr . Harper . Where 's the real meeker ? Try and find out , farmer . Don 't tempt me . It might be a pleasure . Where 's meeker ? Perhaps miss graham could tell us . I ? I know nothing . Roth died by accident . Excuse , please . This mask prove all murders in this house premeditated . I know nothing . You not know he try to murder you ? Me ? He show you way into secret vault . He not tell you secret vault is death trap , which he knew . You knew that ? Stop talking . ( stella ) why , you 're insane . Insane ? I 'm the only sane person in this house . Meeker 's body is in the basement . He died right after harper . You know him before you come here ? We were in vaudeville together . He was a quick-change artist and impersonator . He can imitate anyone . That 's right . Haven 't I been fooling you all along ? Do I sound like meeker now ? [ mimicking meeker 's laugh ] You see ? He got me the job here somehow . Why you continue to help him after murders began ? He 's my husband . I 'll hand these two over to the police at the gate . See you later , mr . Chan ? At your office , sheriff . Fog of murder will soon lift and household be happy again . Thanks to you , mr . Chan . You know , at first I didn 't like you , But , uh , I 've changed my mind . This is gas formula . Government very interested in same . You take charge of it . You staying till morning ? If you will permit . Glad to have you . Thank you . Well , pop , that 's another case we 've solved . You have been of very great assistance . At moment , I cannot remember how , But it was excellent . However , case not finished . Must visit basement to locate body of final victim : Uh , mr .

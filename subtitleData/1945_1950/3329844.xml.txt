 What are you doing here ? Who are you ? I am the Baron Latos . - - I just ask for your help . - - It is 5 o 'clock in the morning ! Forgive my intrusion ... but I have great difficulty in travelling and I come very far . I do not understand . Perhaps you will understand after leads me to the cellar of the castle . It is a very strange request . You are my home . Do not worry , sir . If I could , I would have presented in the usual way . Well , it 's very unusual . I shall all before sunrise . Dr. Edelmann , do you believe in the immortality of the soul ? Of course , being religious . - - From body ? - - Medical science refutes this . Just as it denies the existence of vampirism . It does not contradict some physical aspects . Cases have been registered in which victims ... impelled by a desire abnormal ... really believed that the blood the other would keep alive ... and become murderers psychopaths to get it . These beliefs shocked probably their metabolism ... and inspired fixations , lascifs appetites . The whole affair is likely highly speculative ... particularly the supernatural aspect . Doutez you of the supernatural ? I find it hard to believe ... a human being can transform itself into bat ... or that feeding on the blood beings live , it can live forever . But what this discussion has to do with us , Baron Latos ? Maybe a lot , doctor . Are we going ? - - Dracula 's coat of arms . - - Yes , sir . I am Count Dracula . But the outside world knows me under the name of Baron Latos . You have before you a man who lives for centuries ... supported by blood innocent . - - You ask me to believe ? - - That 's why I come to you ... for me free of a curse suffering and horror ... I am powerless to tackle alone . According to legend , a vampire must go to his grave before dawn . If you stay here , how is this possible ? In this coffin is a layer land of my native country . This land is my tomb ... in which I must withdraw during the hours of the day . Because a single ray of sunshine falling on the vampire ... - - Destroy . - - Yes , sir . The door was locked . How did you come ? As you doubt the supernatural , let 's say you 've done wrong . The exterior door was not closed . You take a lot for granted , Baron ... assuming that I would accept to treat you . The reputation that you help Other assured me . You could heal me ? There maybe plea despite the dangers it involves . This would be a challenge for medical science . Take this challenge , doctor . But decide quickly . The dawn . - - Hello , Nina . - - Hello , doctor . Make a levy blood , please . Baron Latos will come tonight . I receive immediately . - - Things are progressing ? - - Beautifully , doctor . It was a good idea increasing humidity . The spores multiply faster than ever . Yes , we are making progress , indeed . The operation carried on the leg deJohannes prove it . If we can produce mold in abundance ... Imagine what it will mean for thousands of people around the world . We will succeed , Nina . And then , the enthusiasm that you put This experience will be rewarded . You will be the first to benefit . Nina , make a culture and prepare an antitoxin as soon as possible . Okay , sir . I am the Baron Latos . Dr. Edelmann waiting for me . - - Baron Latos . - - Miss Morelle , what pleasant surprise . It is good to see you , Baron . You have just left Schvonheim as we were aware . I could not hardly refuse the chance to assist Dr. Edelmann . Now that we have this chance together , I hope to see you often . - - I live in a castle nearby . - - You 're not here as a patient . Unfortunately , the doctor considered better that I 'm treated here . Good evening , Baron . Enter . The baron will take Latos appointments in the evening . Yes , sir . - - Sit , baron . - - Thank you . It seems that I will maybe change my theories . An examination of your blood reveals the presence of a parasite strange ... a form that I am not at all familiar . It is possible that he something to see ... with your condition . Starting this hypothesis ... I am preparing an antitoxin so we can see . Your new theory being ... That pure culture of a parasite ... introduced in the bloodstream parent ... not only destroy its kind , but destroy itself . - - This sounds very promising . - - Maybe . But we must go slowly . These treatments will time ? Without doubt . In the meantime , your visits here should not be at intervals ... and the evening hours I appoint . - - Is it understood ? - - Absolutely . We will begin treatments tonight then . The transfusion . How long the doctor Will it be held ? A short time , I fear . I have to see now . I have come from afar . If you give him Just my name . Talbot . Lawrence Talbot . Maybe he will understand . I can not interrupt the doctor . It gives a transfusion . - - How long does it take ? - - One hour . Maybe more . I am sorry . You 'll have to wait . I can not wait ! I do not have time . I do not have time ! Your next appointment will be Thursday evening , Baron . - - Around the same time ? - - Yes . - - Good evening , sir . - - Good evening . - - Good evening . - - Good evening . Baron . Mr. Talbot has come to see you , sir . - - It was terribly upset . - - Talbot ? Lawrence Talbot . He seemed to think you reconnaîtriez the name . Lawrence Talbot ... No . There was something tragic home . He looked a man tormented by fear . He left hurriedly saying he could not wait . He had no time . Maybe he will return . Do not leave , I ask you . It is the inspector Holtz . Yes , inspector ? Oh ? Very well . I go immediately . You 'd better to accompany me , Miliza . Go home , you all . This does not apply to you . We do not have to return . We know our rights . The same is true for you , Steinmuhl . Whenever there was trouble , you are always in the front line . Good evening , sir . Enter , please . Go home ! If I find the person ... which launched the noise that there is a madman among us , I will confine . As matter of fact , Doctor , we have one . He came there is a time and asked me to incarcerate ... to prevent to commit a murder , he said . I did it for him pleasure . Then he began to delirium , and I saw it was serious and you 've called . A man otherwise . His name is Talbot . - - Talbot ? - - Remember , doctor . - - The young man whom I have spoken . - - Enter , sir . It is here . Who are these people ? Refer them ! I have not come here to make me show . Come on , go . Calm yourself . This is Dr. Edelmann . - - He has just help you . - - Dr. Edelmann ! Yes . You wanted to see me ? That is why I came to Visaria . In the hope that you can help me . It is too late now . What is your problem , my boy ? Do you believe that a man can transform itself into an animal ? I believe that anything can happen in the spirit of a person . It 's not in my mind . Doctor ... Have you ever heard of pentagramme ? The five-pointed star . The mark of the beast . When it comes full moon , I transformed into werewolf ... with only one desire at the top ... kill ! Listen to me , Talbot . There is no such thing a werewolf . It is a belief that there is that in your mind . Doctor , there is there nothing you can do ? Not before the morning when this will be past . Bring me the time . Place it under my care and I 'll do what I can for him . - - Oh , I 've not heard . - - The Doctor is ready to receive you . - - Do you think he can help me ? - - He did wonderful things . Why me he is waiting here all day then ? Does he not know that tonight ... I am sorry . I know he will everything he can for me . - - Good afternoon , sir . - - Sit down , Mr. Talbot . What do you say ? In your case , my boy , the diagnosis is extremely difficult . But the consideration that you have spent this morning , X-ray ? The review reveals a condition ... the pressure on some parts of the brain . This condition attached your belief ... that the moon can cause a change ... doing exactly that . During the period when your reason the transfer to the autohypnose ... glands that regulate your metabolism are out of control ... as a steam locomotive driving without balancing . So glands secrete surcroîit a certain hormones . At home , it causes change physical that you suffer . But the explanation does not help . What can you do ? Operate ? The operation to enlarge the cavity cranial is long and dangerous . There is nothing that you can do to help . Maybe if . Come here , my boy . In tropical conditions we tried to recreate here ... this plant hybrid clavaria Formosa ... produces a mold that we were able to distill ... Well , a substance which owns ... soften any hard structure composed of calcium salts . The bones , for example . With this substance , it may be possible without surgery ... to reshape the cranial cavity and eliminate the pressure . Can you do it now ? Can you ? Unfortunately , it will take time to produce them in sufficient quantity . The moon will be full again tonight . What can you do to help ? Just what you did yourself last night ... you lock . No , sir . No . I can not even go there . Talbot , listen . Talbot , come back ! Siegfried ! There are many caves dug by the tide along the coast . There is still a chance to save him . We must think of danger it poses for Dr. Edelmann . If Mr. Talbot was swept away in a cave by the wave ... it is still bewitched by the moon . We must wait until it goes down . And then , if still alive , it will try again to kill . That is why the doctor must choose the right time . If he can find when the crisis calms down and he returns to reason ... Perhaps he can persuade not to commit suicide . We work all night gréer for this boat ... and then he said wait a little . What 's happening here , I ask you a little ? Shhh ! This is the case Dr. Edelmann . It 's strange , I say unto you . Ok , push me . Get off me . Slowly . Enough ! I could kill you . Why me you followed so far ? For you back , my boy . In a life of suffering and despair ? I just wanted to die . You want to die , but you rather live ... because God in its divine wisdom ... led you the same thing which makes it possible assistance . Look around you . The temperature and humidity here are ideal ... to grow plants that produce the spores . Before the next full moon , we will have more than enough to help you . - - I wish I could believe it , doctor . - - You can , my boy . But you have to do your part . You want to live . The Frankenstein monster . It must be the skeleton Dr. Niemann ... which has revitalized there is the years . It is said that villagers have pushed into the swamp ... and they have sunk in the shifting sands . After all these years , mud brought them here . - - It is still alive . - - It is indestructible . The creation of Frankenstein is the challenge Human the laws of existence . Doctor , watching . There must be a way to go by the castle . The story mentions an old torture chamber . But his entry was sealed there is the years . It was little by little , piece by piece . The monster that does not die . The culmination Engineer Frankenstein . The heart that Frankenstein gave him is never dead . The spark of life is always , waiting to be revived . Dr. Edelmann , this thing Frankenstein destroyed . He caused the death of all those who tried to follow in his footsteps . Does this poor creature is responsible for what it is ? It is a creature of violence for whom death is an issue . The man can be judged of life and death ? The harm it creates , it can also destroy it . This would be murder . Think about what you do , sir . The worst to revive déchaînerait that the murder of humanity . This body is defenceless the responsibility of man . The responsibility of man east towards other men . You may be right , Nina . The Frankenstein monster must never cause havoc . - - I do not hear you 've come . - - Continue , please . It pleases you ? It makes the spirit of the night . It was played in the evening where we we have seen in concert . I had forgotten ... until I review . Maybe I wanted to remind you . I 've never heard this music before and yet I cheek . You create ... - - For me . - - It frightens me . It is beautiful . This is world music where I come from . It makes me see strange things ... people who died and yet are alive . My world does not know no need equipment . It concerns me , but I am afraid . The fear will dissipate as gravera music is in your mind . It will give you the desire to be there . Why stop ? Still play music . There is one thing that Dr. Edelmann ... told me to do . Raise your sleeve , please , baron . The music you will return . My world awaits you . Renounce the Cross to join me . Your world is approaching me . - - But I am afraid . - - It is a world without fear . It 's like music . It 's beautiful , beautiful . Oh , good evening , Baron . Thank you , Miliza . That is all . I think we do progress , Baron . This photomicrography your blood reveals a bizarre condition ... - - That I do not explain . - - What is it ? A different species antibody has appeared . Why worry if the treatments are successful ? If a doctor comes to heal , he wants to know how come there is ... This has little interest in the patient Once it is healed . - - After tomorrow ? - - At the same time . Good then , Doctor . Go to bed , Miliza . I 'll finish here . I think I 'll go there . Miliza , how 's it going ? The music brings my world , the closer . Baron Latos ... He has indeed left earlier tonight , n 'est-ce pas ? Around 20 am 30 . Why ? - - Miliza and I worked . - - Qu 'essayez you tell me ? It seemed terribly tired ... as a person in a trance . - - In a trance ? - - It left me without saying a word . I followed . She joined Baron Latos in the hall . They came out in the garden . And when it is past before the ice ... I did not see its reflection . I imagined it , n 'est-ce pas ? N 'est-ce pas ? No , Nina . Baron Latos is not reflected in a mirror . - - Then he ... - - That Count Dracula . In trying to save his life , I put our lives at risk . Take the Cross to join me . - - I must stop immediately . - - But how ? - - Build another transfusion . - - You can not repeat too early . Do what I say . If something should happen tonight ... go to the arms room in the cellar and burn what you 'll find . - - What , Doctor ? - - You will understand . You must destroy by fire . Go to your room . When you hear the music , I go to you . I was looking for you , Baron . You will recall that I was intrigued tonight by the new antibody ? - - Yes . - - I now know where they came from . They come from my blood . We are perhaps on the verge making a significant discovery . To check my theory , I will give you another transfusion . - - Now ? - - Immediately . It remains to be seen if this is the answer . It is gone . - - Miliza ? - - It is safe now . But him ? The harm that I brought here revivra never do more . They tried to kill you , but we did not . Frankenstein gave you eternal life ... a power that the time can not destroy ... the secret of immortality which will soon be mine . Will you about it . Leave me alone . - - I have coffee for you . - - Will you in , I tell you . Dr. Edelmann , let me in ! Doctor , you are sick . I have nothing . You 'll feel better . How concentrated spores do we have ? Do not worry . We are making good progress . Answer me . Y he enough for two operations ? No . There will not be enough for some time . - - But we have had enough for one ? - - I think . I have to operate then as soon as possible . - - But , Doctor ... - - You were right . I 'm sick . It is impossible to know that contains the future . Oh , go , go , Doctor . Do not speak in this way . J 'opérerai tomorrow , Nina . So you have to Mr. Talbot operate . This will soon be the full moon . We can not let it suffer . But you ... You wait for so long . I can wait a little longer . It will hardly any difference . You are exhausted . Why do not you relax ? I am well . I know who you think . Hopefully we will be ready in time . I can not bear the thought he still suffers the torment . Do not worry . We have enough . Oh , it 's wonderful , Dr. Edelmann . You 've done what is usually a very delicate operation . In this way , surgery presented no danger . We can expect a nervous shock . It must rest . Any effort could unravel what I hope I have done . We 'll know in a few days . One can only hope for now . And pray . We must believe that Nina . We must devote every moment to produce more concentrated for her . You are good nurse , Miliza . You know perfectly well Mr. Talbot should sleep . Sleeping ? I have a lifetime to sleep ... when I know what waiting for me . After what Dr. Edelmann has done for you ... is the happiness that awaits you . I wonder . Do not believe me ungrateful , I ask you . Time and again , we tried to help me . Time and again , it has failed . If this fails ... It n 'échouera not , Larry . You have to believe . I try , but when j 'affronte night ... Try to see at night as a beautiful thing . Until the full moon makes a thing of ugliness and horror . Soon you will see like everyone else sees . Reposante ... quiet and serene . Until then ... I live miles hopes , die a thousand times . It will never ugly for you , Larry . Believe me , I know . How do you know ? My heart told me . Hello , Siegfried . Edelmann Doctor ! Did you hear call you , Siegfried ? No , sir . I would arrested for you otherwise . I am sure . Do not worry , Siegfried . What he , Siegfried ? You do as if you were scared . Oh , no , sir . Why would I be afraid ? From the night , maybe . I am not afraid of the night . Your hands tremble , Siegfried . - - Really ? - - Siegfried . - - Yes , sir ? - - I think what you fear . - - Yes ? - - You 're afraid of me . - - From you , sir ? - - If you regarderiez me . You see , you 're afraid of me . You are going to get faster the village and tell the police . Why would I say anything to the police ? - - Afraid that I kill you . - - Kill me ? Doctor ! Yes . You 've seen what came to your old friend . He wants that person other than knowing him . No , Doctor ! I do not say ! True , Siegfried . You will never say never ! Help ! Help ! There he is ! There he is ! Over here ! Over here ! - - This is your brother Siegfried . - - Is it dead ? It goes on there ! - - Good evening , inspector . - - Sorry to bother you , doctor ... but I would like to see Mr. Talbot and everyone in the house . Certainly . - - There is a problem ? - - You will soon . Hurry . So inspector , what he ? Your Siegfried was murdered . Siegfried ? Killed ? For the person who came the village with him tonight . He had throat transpercée as a rabid animal . - - Of course , you suspect me . - - I have a good reason to do so . But it is not released the house for days . Whether you know , maybe . Have you been with him all night ? Until there is an hour . But the murder has been committed there are 20 minutes . And in the last five minutes ... we chased the murderer until this property . But this is impossible . Only the full moon affects Mr. Talbot . The moon is not full before tomorrow evening . Not only that , but Mr. Talbot underwent an intervention ... which prohibits any physical effort . Running over a short distance , and especially since the village ... lead serious complications . A cerebral hemorrhage , perhaps even his death . I respect your speech , but a murder was committed . - - We must search the premises . - - He is the man you 're looking for . Laisserez you Dr. Edelmann dissuade you ? Enough , Steinmuhl . Excuse me , Doctor ... but the man who killed his brother is in the vicinity . It is my duty to find it . I will keep you accountable these people until further notice . Yes ? What are you doing here , my boy ? You should not stand . Whatever , doctor . It 's you that I am concerned . You were with Siegfried tonight when he went to the village . I 've seen . I 've seen your return . Why you did not say the inspector Holtz ? After what you have done for me ? You tried to help me . - - And you want me now ? - - Inasmuch as I can , yes . Having suffered the torment j 'endure that now ... you will understand better than anyone what I 'll tell you . In trying to accomplish the miracle of medical science ... I failed . My blood was contaminated by the blood of Dracula . My soul and my spirit were seized a horror without a name ... a rage that transformed me in what has killed Siegfried tonight . If you want to help me , there is a way to do it . Do not say anything about what you know the inspector Holtz . Not to protect me , but for me save time . The time to do for Nina what I did for you . After this evil must be destroyed . You have my word it is , my boy . But if I am unable ... you 'll have to do for me . " Dr. Franz Edelmann . University of Bonn , cum laude . " - - Whats up here ? - - I went to your office . I want you to look at this . I found it in the left hand of Siegfried . Dr. Edelmann was killed . Shut up , Steinmuhl . You do not know what it means . Me neither . It is the police to deal with it . Is that clear ? It is clear that Dr. Edelmann killed my brother . Yesterday evening you thought it was Talbot . Tonight you say that this is a man that we respect for years . You are worse than old commère . Rentre chez toi ! Enter all of you . I 'm tired of it all . Come on , break . It goes something at Dr. Edelmann , I tell you . What Holtz says ? " It is the police to deal with the case . " It is up to us to see ... unless we wanted all be killed . He is right . I think that we have to see . - - Well , I do not know . - - I am your opinion . The moments to come we will give our response . It 's time that we expected all forward . Banish the fear of your mind ... confront the moon with the conviction that the past is behind you ... a new life is before you . A new life . Stay here , please . - - But Larry ... - - No ! Not before to be sure . Oh , Doctor , this is wonderful . Dr. Edelmann ? Doctor ! That 's it ! That 's it ! Now ! Now ! That 's it ! That 's it ! I 'll make you strong , harder than you did as ever . I will give you the strength a hundred men . No , Dr. Edelmann . No ! You promised . - - What are you doing here ? - - Well , I ... You m 'espionniez , n 'est-ce pas ? No . I just wanted to find you . I wanted to tell you that I have ... You would not have do that , Nina . I want to see Dr. Edelmann on the spot . You would not have come here . I do not like people who see they are not supposed to see . It has become insane . Good evening , Mr. Talbot . You have missed the promise you made me , n 'est-ce pas ? You talked to the police . I do not like people who lack their promises , Mr. Talbot . Get out ! The Frankenstein monster ! GB N

 Well , after all , you simply can 't miss your own senior prom , Debbie . Maybe he 's never thought about it . Why don 't you drop him a few hints ? I 've tried that . But Vernon just doesn 't get hints . Well , I 'll see ya . Bye ! Hello , Miss Collins . Is Dad busy ? Very . Professor Forsythe is in there now . Chemistry Forsythe ? I bet they 're talking about Vernon . I have no idea what they 're talking about . Well , I 'll have to find out later . Vernon 's waiting for me . Give Dad a message , will you ? Tell him I said not to be so nosey . [ Phone rings ] Hello ? Mr. Jack Bell ? Just a minute , please . Will you talk to Mr. Jack Bell ? Excuse me . Hello , Jack ! Yes , yes I got your letter . No , of course I won 't speak . I 'm trying to deemphasize athletics , not glorify them . I know , Alfred . I know I 'm waving a red flag in front of a bull , but one man we 've invited might give you some dough for that new laboratory . Well , that sounds very interesting , Jack . I 'd like to meet him . But , uh , not at a football dinner . [ indistinct crowd noise ] Well , goodbye . Now , that 's what I want to talk to you about . What do you mean ? Debbie ? No , Simpson . Vernon Simpson . Well , what about him ? Now that 's what I want you to tell me , Joe . I want to know all about him . Well , Vernon is a fine young man . Brilliant scholar , serious , energetic . And his background ? He comes from upstate somewhere . Has a widowed mother who 's as poor as a church mouse . Why do you want to know , Alfred ? Well , you saw why just now . Debbie seems to have taken quite a fancy to him . And , uh , vice-versa . Debbie couldn 't have picked a better lad . Incidentally , he 's my candidate for director of the research labratory . Simpson ? Yes , I intend to submit his name to you and the board . That is , as soon as he completes his doctorate . But , he 's no youngster , Joe . He should 've had his PhD years ago . Well , he spent 3 years in the South Pacific . Chemical warfare . And before that he worked on a number of other ideas . And he , uh , well he 's just had bad luck Are you being absolutely honest with me , Joe ? Are you sure there 's nothing else ? Yes , there is something , Alfred , but ... What is it ? Women ? No , no . It 's just these phases that he goes through . Phases ? What do you mean , phases ? Well , from October to April Vernon 's alert , conscientious , and an excellent teacher . But every spring he seems to undergo a peculiar change . He becomes absent-minded to a degree . It 's like spring fever , only it lasts all summer . He 's been around our house quite a bit lately . I haven 't noticed these symptoms . It 's past the middle of April now . Yes . Oh , he 's been fine all winter , Alfred . Only , this is just the time of the year . I 'm expecting it to hit him almost any time . It happens every spring . Continuing our study of the general group know as acids we are now coming to a very important classification . The most striking difference between the various acids containing the carboxylate group lies in their acidic strength . Or , we might say they are ionization constants . Some fairly active , while others ... are quite inert . Oh ! HAHAHAHAHAHA ! To illustrate - I have in this test tube acetic acid . Like many others of a similar type , it 's a rather weak acid of low Ka value . By adding methyl orange , you 'll notice the bright pink color . Which tells us that acetic acid though weak , is decidedly ... ... coming home . Another run for Chicago . is decidedly ... ... second inning . First home game of the season here in St. Louis . Lauren gets a signal from Madigan . He takes a strike . He throws . Ball one on Hardeman . Manager Dolan looks worried . Here he comes out of the dugout . He doesn 't wanna lose this game . D-d-d-decidedly an acid as your knowledge of domestic vinegar might , uh , [ Bell rings ] I 'm afraid I 'll have to continue this discussion the next time . What is it Vernon ? Don 't you feel well ? Oh , I feel fine , just fine . I ... Well , what was it ? You acted so strangely . You suddenly looked as if you were a thousand miles away . No . No , only 68 . I , I mean I was only thinking about something else . Was it me , Vernon ? No , no . Vernon . Yes ? I was thinking about it while you were lecturing . I know you 're shy and reserved and all , and I 've tried to make allowances . But ... But what ? Well , don 't you understand ? I guess I know how you feel . But just guessing isn 't very satisfying . I mean , well - well , you 're so terribly vague . Oh , but I 'm not , Debbie . I 'm not a bit vague . I 'm very definite about you . Why you 're almost everything I ever think about . Almost . What else can I say ? Something concrete , Vernon . Something positive . Oh , but that 's been out of the question up until now . I hardly make enough at my job to live on . And your father , for instance . He 's made it quite clear that for anyone in my present financial situation to even discuss the - But , Vernon - I 'm serious , Debbie . That 's why I can 't say anything , because if a man is really serious , he doesn 't have the right to say anything until he can be serious . Vernon , what are you talking about ? I 'm talking about 3 hours from now . Maybe sooner . Maybe any minute . And what 's going to happen 3 hours from now ? In less than 3 hours I 'll know about my experiment . You mean you 've done it ? Just about . Oh , darling ! I 'm so happy ! I haven 't told you the best part . I just heard about it myself yesterday . My nydrocyclohexene compound was a great commercial value . We can buy a house , maybe even own a car . Oh , that 's wonderful . But who 's going to pay you all this money ? The Norworth Labratories . It seems they 've been working along the same lines for years , trying to develop a substance that will keep insects or any living matter away from wood . A biophobic , they call it . And they seem to think that my compound is the very thing they 're looking for . Vernon Simpson . The man who discovered the biophobic . Of course , I 'd have to test its effectiveness on wood , but that 's just routine . Well , let 's not just stand here talking about it . Let 's go find out . Can 't expect any positive results right away . Oh , but we can look ! Hallelujah , there it is ! The white precipitant . Sure enough , there it is . Oh , congratulations , Vernon ! Oh , my notebook . My notebook ! [ CRASH ] Oh . There goes everything . Just when I had it . Oh , Vernon . Little brats . No degree . No job . No nothing . You still have your notes and everything . It can 't take long . Long ? You don 't understand , Debbie . One of those compounds alone took 5 weeks to crystallize , and they 're all in sequence . I can 't make the second until I finish the first . And look at these notes . You might get some idea of the time and work it took . Why , I ran some of those reactions six and eight times before I got enough stuff to make the next step . Now I 'm going to start from scratch . Do it all over again , step by step . It 'll take months . That wonderful precipitate . It 's all there in the sink . Isn 't there any way you can filter it out and save it ? Oh , that 's just a hodge-podge of compounds and ice and everything else now . You couldn 't even figure out what 's in there , let alone filter anything out . Well , I suppose I better clean up this mess . Can 't I help ? No , dear , you just run along . But , Vernon ... Darling , there 's nothing you can say , and there 's nothing I can say . Oh , Vernon . This hasn 't changed anything as far as we 're concerned . You know that . It 's changed everything . Darling , you mustn 't feel that way . Let me talk to you . Please , Dear , right now - All right . I 'll see you later . [ water running ] And that puts Chicago out front 4 to nothing . And here comes Hank Rubella . He 's the 3rd pitcher Dolan 's used today . Jimmy doesn 't look happy out there . Pitchers are his big headache . St. Louis has a great team . Good hitting and fielding . With one more top-notch pitcher Dolan might cop that pennant . Owner Edgar Stone would like to buy one for him , too . But first class pitchers are scarcer than hen 's teeth this year . Stone can 't buy one for love nor money . Astonishing . We 're Scmidtt and Isabell , Sir . You sent for us ? Oh , yes . Yes , so I did . You gentlemen are doing rather sadly in organic chemistry . I suppose you 're aware of that . Yes , we are , sir . Well , I don 't like to flunk you . You 're both on the baseball team , so - I had assigned some special reading . But instead I thought I might be able to give you some pointers , see if we can 't improve your grades . Say , that 's mighty decent of you sir . And , in return , I was wondering if you 'd do something for me , and keep it strictly confidential ? Sure , we 'd be glad to Mr. Simpson . Certainly , sir . Good . Will you meet me at the baseball field at the batting cage with your uniforms and equipment at five o ' clock ? [ Both ] Five o ' clock ? In the morning . Now , if you 'll just get some chairs , we 'll get started . Now you 're basic trouble is that you haven 't learned the meanings of technical terms . So let 's get clear what we mean by methyl , ethyl , propyl ... Perhaps I 'd better warm up a bit first . OK , Professor . Alright , here we go . Right in here . So this is why he got us up at 5 : 30 in the morning , so he could play pitcher . Yeah , but he can 't really be nuts , or they wouldn 't let him teach . Yeah , well , it 's one way of passing chemistry , anyway . Shut up , now . We gotta humor him . Hey , that 's a good one ! Now , if you 'll step up , Mr. Isabell . Just a minute , Mr. Simpson . OK , Mr. Simpson , now let 's go in there . Let 's have a little of this methyl , ethyl , propyl , and butyl on that ball ! Here we go , hey ! Whoa . Well , never mind , Mr. Simpson , we 'll get him on this next one . Here we go ! [ Smack ] [ Smack ] Too bad I didn 't have an outfielder in my class . Now if you don 't mind , I think I 'll try just a few more . Sure , if you want to , Mr. Simpson . Now , use your bean this time , will you Tommy . Bunt one . Okay , okay . [ Whoop ] Wow ! Did you see the hop on that ball ? That 's a regular dipsy-doodle you got there Professor . How 'd ya do it ? The result of a great deal of scientific research . Alright , now here we go . That 's the old pepper in there . Right down the old groove here . Here we go . [ Whoop ] Wow . That 's making them hop in there , Professor , old boy . Hit one this time , Tommy , he 'll think you 're faking . I ain 't missing them on purpose . Here we go , Professor , right in there , now . Thank you , gentlemen , I 'm sure you 've had enough . You hit three consecutive pitches , then you missed three in a row . Statistically , therefore , I 've obtained all the information possible . Unless , of course , I pitch several hundred more balls . Statistics . He got us up at 5 : 00 in the morning for statistics . Is Dr. Greenleaf up yet ? Why , yes sir , but I ... I 'm sorry to bother you so early , Dr. Greenleaf , but I have to make the 7 : 14 . Oh . Is it an emergency , Vernon ? Yes , sir . Illness , a death in the family ? No , sir . Not that kind of an emergency . Well , what kind is it ? Well , I have a wonderful opportunity , Dr. Greenleaf . It may not work out , but I 'd like a leave of absence starting immediately . Mr. Richardson can finish my classes , and Miss Brinkhoffer can take over my lab periods . Leave of absence ? For how long ? I don 't know , sir . Indefinitely ? You mean you want an emergency leave of absence to last indefinitely ? I don 't understand this , Vernon . Well , I 'm afraid I can 't explain it , sir . That is , I can , but scientifically I can 't explain it at all . You mean it has something to do with your experiment ? Yes , sir . But unless I get a chance to demonstrate it - Oh , you intend to give demonstrations , uh , lectures of some kind ? Well , no , not exactly . Well , what are you going to do ? Take it to some commercial labratory like the one you mentioned ? What was it ? Norworth Laboratories . Well then , why is the time indefinite ? Will you grant me the leave , Dr. Greenleaf ? If I don 't go now , I 'll miss my train . Well , I don 't know , Vernon . It 's most unusual right in the midst of a semester , but if this is really such an extraordinary scientific contribution , I don 't suppose we should stand in your way . Um , alright , Vernon . Catch your train . I 'll talk to Forsythe . Oh , thank you , sir . Oh , is Debbie still asleep ? Well , I presume so . Will you tell her I said goodbye , that she 'll hear from me soon ? Thank you , sir . All Aboard ! [ Train chugging ] [ Typing ] Morning . I wanna see Mr. Dolan , please . He won 't see anybody on game days . Oh , but this is urgent . I know . Everybody 's urgent . What do you want to see him about ? Well , it 's a personal matter . Well , he doesn 't have anything to do with the concessions . - Neither do I. - Good Morning , Mr. Dolan . Good morning . Oh , Mr. Dolan ! - Mr . Dolan , I wanna talk to you . - Not today . But listen to me , Mr. Dolan . This could mean a great deal to you . You heard what I said . Run along . I 'm busy . Ms. Manglestein - I 'm not asking for any money or any favors , Mr. Dolan . I 'm trying to do you one . Then do it . Get out of here . Mr. Terry wants to know - Not this morning . I 've gotta go right down to batting practice . This wire from Denver . [ Phone rings ] Hello . Yeah , yeah . I 'll be right down . About this pitcher , Chop Suey or whatever his name is - Cop Suley . Cop Suley , yeah well wire them I want him . Just a minute . Before you send this wire - Will you get out of here ! No , I will not . Ms. Manglestein , send for one of the cops . I 'm a pitcher , Mr. Dolan , and you need one very badly . Now , I can win the pennant for you Oh , that 's all I need this morning , another crackpot . I am no crackpot , and that 's no idle boast . It 's a simple , mathematical fact . Look , I heard what you said , Mister . But we don 't hire ball players that way . Now if you 'll just - I realize that , but the circumstances are rather unusual . I can win thirty games for you . Thirty games . Is that all ? Well , no , thirty is the minimum . Ah no , you 're not very screwy . Do you know there ain 't more than a dozen pitchers ever won thirty games in a season ? Of course I do , and I can give you their names if you like . Never mind . Look , all I want to do is to show you . What can you lose ? My lunch is all . Where is that cop ? Mac , take this guy away . Yes , sir . Don 't hurt his arm . He thinks he 's Walter Johnson . You know you 're very stupid , Mr. Dolan . With the chance to win the pennant right in your lap . Get him outta here ! Come on now , pal . You 're annoying Mr. Dolan . You know if you would shout less and think more - What 's all the rumpus , Jimmy ? I got another crank in here , thinks he 's a pitcher . Thinks he can win thirty games . You , I take it , are Mr. Stone ? Well , I appeal to your intelligence as an executive . I 'm perfectly rational and willing to prove the truth of anything I may say . All I want is a chance to demonstrate . Mac . - Come on . - How do these characters get in here ? I walked in , Mr. Stone . But I 'm about to walk out again without a police escort . And when I do , the pennant walks right out the door with me . Come on , Sonny . Jim , take your pennant and trot along . Take a good look at me Mr. Stone . All the other owners can 't be pigheads . You 'll see me later in the season . Just a minute , young man . So I 'm a pighead , am I ? You walk in off the street and think you can win thirty games . I don 't think so , Mr. Stone . I know it . Know it ? I have never met such bland conceit . I told you . He 's a crackpot . No he 's not . He 's just a conceited jackass . Alright , you talk to him . I 'm going to batting practice . Batting practice , eh ? I think we oughta teach this whipper-snapper here a lesson . Then take him in your office and teach him anything you like , but let me go . No , not in my office . Down on the field . Let him pitch to the boys . OK . It 's your ball club . If you wanna run a kindergarten for crackpots . Now , young man , you 're going to have your wish . And you 're going to get the humiliation of your arrogant young life . And I 'm coming down to see it . I was hoping you would . Come on , nuisance . Get him a uniform , Jimmy . Yes , Mr. Stone . And we 'll lay a red plush carpet for him from the dugout to the pitcher 's box . Oh , just a moment . There 's the question of terms . - Terms ? - Yes . Mister , I gotta hand it to you . Thank you . Now I want $ 1,000 a game for every game I win . Otherwise , not a cent . And when I win a game , I 'm to be paid promptly . Now I have heard everything . Of course I realize there 's some rule about minimum salary , but I 'm sure we can fix that up in the contract . Take him down there right away . And don 't let him pitch to any weak hitters . Put the top of the batting order up . I 'm really going to enjoy this . Hurry up , busher . [ Indistinct chatter ] Monk . What is he , Monk , another Dizzy Dane ? He ain 't got a prayer , Jimmy . Just dizzy , huh ? I thought so . - Well , don 't waste anymore time . - Okay . He says , " Come on in . " [ sigh ] Let me tell you , kiddo . This baseball racket ain 't so hotsy like you read about . It 's got its crummy side , too . Dirty trains all the time . Cheap hotels . It 'd be a change , though . I 'm looking forward to it . Well , don 't . You might be in for a letdown , see ? Things don 't always work out - You wanna talk to him , Jimmy ? Yeah ... Hey , Jimmy ! What about our genius ? Can he throw as far as the plate ? This is your idea . I 'll show ya . Get in there now and pitch . If he gets hurt , it 's Stone 's fault , not mine . I better catch for him , Jimmy . Catch what ? They 're gonna hit every pitch . Remember - put the top of the batting order up . The top of the batting order ! Roll the cage in , White . I 'll catch this guy . Come on , kid . Let 's show ' em whatcha got . [ Whoop ] Must 've been an optical illusion . Lemme see you throw that one again . [ Whoop ] What 's this guy got , anyway ? I don 't know . He didn 't have nothin ' before . Now he 's got a hop like Barnum 's flea . This is gettin ' monotonous , boys . Me and the kid is playing catch , and you guys is fanning ' the air . Okay ! Monk , bring that guy over here . Well , you sure taught him a lesson , alright . No , he taught us a lesson , Jimmy . That 's what makes baseball the greatest game in the world . Everybody plays it all over the country . You may find a new star anywhere . In the swamps of Louisiana , or the Rockies , or Brooklyn . Or he may walk right into your office the way this boy did . Aw , we haven 't got a star here yet . Not by a long shot . But the boy is a natural , Jimmy . He don 't look like a pitcher . He don 't throw like a pitcher . But he strikes them out . Yeah . He strikes them out in practice . But the big question is , can he stand up in big time competition ? Hey you , come here . Say , what 's your name , anyway ? Oh , I hadn 't thought of it . Oh , you hadn 't . Well try hard . Well , it 's Kelly . Kelly , eh ? Well , that 's the first encouraging thing you 've said . Come on , kid . Let 's take care of that flipper . [ Indistinct chatter ] Ball ! [ Smack , cheer ] And it looks like Chicago is staging another rally . They 're whittling down St. Louis ' lead . But , Dolan 's leaving Crosby in , so let 's see what 's gonna happen . Chew ? No thanks . Crosby better tighten up . He ain 't got this game on ice yet . [ Smack , cheer ] Jimmy , put the new man in . Yes . Kelly . Warm up . Me ? Yeah , you . Come on , kid . This may be it . [ Smack , cheer ] Start steepin ' ' em in , baby . I got a feelin ' we ain 't gonna have much time . [ Smack , cheer ] OK , Kelly . Get in there and pitch . Oh , Mr. Dolan - I 'd like to get it straight about my contract . If I win this game , it counts for me . I expect to get paid . I don 't pay you . Go talk to Stone . Now ? No , no . There 's a ball game going on . Get in there and pitch . - You talk to him later . - Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . What 's this ? Another Al Schacht ? We don 't need no more comics with you around , sweetheart . Guy 's name is Kelly . Kelly , pitching for St. Louis . Lannigan catching . [ On loudspeaker ] Kelly 's now pitching for St. Louis . Lannigan catching . Why , he isn 't even on the scorecard . Well fans , there 's a scared looking rookie if I ever saw one . I wonder where Dolan ever got the courage to put him into a spot like this . [ Crowd booing ] That puts the tying run on second . And O 'Leary 's up . He 's gotten 3 hits for 3 tries this afternoon . Look , kid . Just take it easy . Try and get ' em over . I 'm all alone back there , and they don 't let me use no stepladder . Where 'd you find that hooligan ? Jump-In Junior High ? First get a hit off , and then make with the jokes . Ball ! Strike ! Ball ! Strike ! It 's 3 and 2 on O 'Leary . A hit will tie up this ballgame . Here 's your chance to be a hero . This one 's gotta be good . [ Whoop ] Strike , you 're out ! Wow ! What kind of a ball was that ? Now , tell me that joke about the high school kid . Rookie hero . Way to fire that , boy . Just lucky , I guess . We 're a great team , kid , me an ' you . Nice goin ' . Thank you . The kid 's a gold mine , ain 't he , Jimmy ? He 's just what you was lookin ' for . I wasn 't lookin ' for a headache , but that 's what I got . Headache ? A guy with a hop like that ? He 's a screwball , Monk , and they do anything . You 're going to have to keep your eye on him night and day . Good work , young fellow . Great , great . I knew you had it all the time . Glad to have you with us . We 'll have that contract for you first thing in the morning . Thank you , sir . And if there 's anything I can do , be sure and let me know . Oh , Mr. Stone - There is one thing . What ? Well - Could I have a uniform that fits ? Sure , sure . Dolan . Dolan ! [ Knocking at door ] Come in . Hiya , Kelly ! Congratulations , kid . Your troubles are over . I 'm movin ' in with ya . You 're what ? I couldn 't stand it , thinking of you up here all alone day after day . Well , I don 't mind , Monk . Really , I don 't . Listen , Kelly - I took a shine to ya . It doesn 't happen often , but when it does , the sky 's the limit . I 'm payin ' for everything - room , laundry , meals . It ain 't gonna cost you a cent . Why , that 's wonderful , Monk . I 'd be glad to share the room with you , but I want to share the expenses , too . Ah , baloney . I mean it , Monk , really . All right , I 'll break down and tell ya . I ain 't one of those big-hearted Charlies like you think . It 's sort of a deal between me and the club . It 's a what ? A deal . I move in with you , they pay all the bills . They sorta want me to keep my eye on ya . They do ? Why ? Dolan thinks you 're somewhat of a screwball or something . Are you , Kelly ? Why , no , quite the opposite . Everything I do is perfectly logical . That 's your girl ? Wow , she is hot stuff . [ Wolf whistle ] Sweet lookin ' kid , too . What 's her name ? Oh , you wouldn 't know her . Oh , cagey , eh ? Well I 'll just call her Madame X. What 's in the bottle ? Oh that ? That 's hair tonic . It 's a special prescription . Seems to have done you good . Oh , yes . Yes it has , indeed . Analytical mechanics . Atoms , stars , and neb ... u Nebulae . Theoretical ballistics . Jumpin ' Jupiter . Do you read this stuff ? Well , you see , it 's that hop I get on the ball - It 's caused by some unique phenomenon , and I 'm attempting to investigate it . You mean you learn how to pitch out of scientific books ? Well , no . Not exactly . Jimmy was right . Where are you from , kid ? Why all the mystery ? Well ... well , it 's her father . If he ever finds out , I 'll lose my girl and my job and everything . Finds out what ? What I 'm doing . I didn 't think I could do it , but I am . And what I 'm doing isn 't what he thinks I 'm doing at all . Come again ? Well I 'm getting the one thing he wants me to have , by doing the one thing he 's most against , you see . Leave it go , Kelly . Quit trying . The more you talk , the more mysterious it gets . Well , maybe it 's just as well . [ Phone rings ] Hello ? I 'm trying to locate a party by the name of Lannigan . For you , Monk . It 's Mabel , checking up . [ Sigh ] Yes , Mabel . Yes , I 'm here , just like I said . [ Woman talking ] Yes , I know , Mabel . There 's lots of girls named Kelly , only he happens to be with the club . And St. Louis don 't have no lady pitchers this season . [ Woman talking , continues ] You never been married , have you Kelly ? No . [ Woman talking , continues ] Yes , Mabel . Hey , if you 're such a scientist , you oughta read this article here . Some professor says there 's gold on the planet Mars . Here - [ Woman talking , continues ] Oh , I 'm glad I read this . I 'm gonna send a telegram . A telegram ? Tommorow 's ? Oh , but I can 't do that . The guy is nuts . But I gotta do something . I 've gotta think of some way to - Now wait a minute , Kelly . You listen to me . You 're gonna stay right here and pitch . You ain 't going after no gold on Mars . Hey , Kelly ! Kelly ! [ Woman talking , continues ] Yes , Mabel , I 've been listening to every word . [ Woman talking , continues ] Debbie , dear , I wish you 'd come with us . The concert will do you good . I 'm not in the mood , Mother , really . Well you can 't spend the rest of your life sitting home because of Vernon . She won 't go ten feet away from that telephone . [ Door buzzer ] Miss Deborah Greenleaf ? Oh , I 'll take it ! I 'm Miss Greenleaf . Sign here , please . Thank you . Oh , Mother ! It 's beautiful . It 's from Vernon . Vernon ? But that 's impossible . Something wrong somewhere . He couldn 't have come by it honestly . You 've no right to say that . You don 't know anything about it . I know he acted very strange the day he left . He was vague and evasive . There must have been a reason . Vernon 's always vague , and I don 't think he meant to be evasive , Alfred . - And what does it say ? - Now that 's none of our business . Poor Vernon . He 's really sweet . He 's so upset because he didn 't get to say goodbye to me . What 's he doing ? I know that you will have faith in me and do what I ask without asking why I ask it . That 's Vernon . He even writes double talk . I 'm fine , and I haven 't disappeared . But he has ! Please call the police , and tell them to stop their search at once . I cannot overemphasize the urgency of this . Why that in itself is suspicious . My associates are rather rough and ready , and their peculiar skill is a constant source of astonishment . Skill at what ? How should I know ? The work is strenuous and exciting , but the financial rewards are quite fantastic . Yes , they must be . Well , isn 't that rather unusual for scientific demonstrations ? It 's not unusual . Whatever he 's doing is not legitimate . I don 't know whether I have chosen wisely in casting my lot with this particular group . But whether I have or not , the die is cast . Oh dear . That does sound rather ominous , doesn 't it ? Certainly does . I 'm sure there 's some explanation . Yes , the explanation 's very simple . He 's mixed up with some kind of a racket . Oh , Father , you 've no right to assume that . Well he certainly got his leave of absence under false pretenses . I can 't forgive him for that . Now , now wait , Alfred . I 'm sure he 'll clear it all up very soon . He says I won 't hear from him for several months . Well why not ? He says it 'll be too risky . Debbie , darling , I - I 've always liked Vernon , but your father 's perfectly right . It all sounds very strange and frightening . Of course it may not be a real diamond , only glass . Father , of course it 's real . The box is from Mark 's . Well , I 'm going into St. Louis tomorrow , I 'll take it in , and I 'll - - No you 're not . - Why not ? Because I don 't care if it 's glass or not . I 'm going to wear it . [ Crowd noise and bell ringing ] You just about made it . What were we expected to do ? Get here early and polish the engine ? Tobacco ? No , thank you . He 's getting old . He can 't steal anymore . Yeah , and poor old Bush last week . The bums knocked him all over the lot . Yeah ? I 'm layin ' for him . We 'll kill him . Come on , boys . Let 's get on the train . Hello , Debbie ? Debbie , I 've just seen Vernon . He was taking a train for Chicago . He was with a lot of men . Oh , they were very tough-looking , all of them . They looked like , well , you know - like gangsters . Oh , Mother . Gangsters ? How do you know ? Know ? You should 've heard what they said ! Oh , you must be wrong , Mother . It may have looked like him , but I know it couldn 't be Vernon . [ Indistinct chatter ] You 're out ! [ Crowd cheers ] Kelly 's bearing down . Every pitch counts now . Last half of the ninth . One out . One more out is all Kelly needs to reach the heights . I won 't tell you what those heights are . That 'll jinx him . You know the ol ' baseball superstition . Nobody ever mentions what Kelly is trying to do . But the score is one to nothing for St. Louis . Slugging Sammy Lee is up . The tension among the crowd is terrific . They 're going wild . Here comes the pitch . Strike one ! [ Crowd cheers ] Strike one is called . A few weeks ago , Kelly was unknown , but tonight he 's trying for every pitcher 's dream . But Lee means business . A hit here could break up this ballgame . He 's not giving away any presents , and neither is Kelly . Strike two . This is it . One more like that is all Kelly needs . [ Whoop ] You 're out . He 's done it ! Kelly 's done it ! He 's pitched a no-hit , no-run game . Come on , sweetheart . Let 's celebrate . Well , I 'm kinda tired , Monk . And my arm 's pretty sore . Ah , forget it , kid . This is our big night . Jimmy says we can have a glass of beer . Alright . Here he comes . Hey , Kelly . Howdy , Kelly ! Wait , whoa . No , no , please . Who does he think he is ? Wait , wait , wait . Now don 't get him wrong . Kelly 's a great guy . He 's just tired . He was a G.I. , see ? He had it rough , and them flash bulbs got him upset , that 's all . He 'll talk to you . Wait . Kelly - You gotta talk to those guys . Square yourself . They can ruin ya . Exactly , one recognizable picture in the paper , and I 'm - Look , kid - I 'll tell ' em no pictures , see ? But ya gotta talk to ' em . All right . Come on in , boys . Kelly 's waitin ' . But no flash bulbs , see . No pictures . Where did Dolan find you , Kelly ? What 's your hometown , Kelly ? Where 'd you pitch last year ? Gentlemen , gentlemen . Please , one at a time . Is it true that you 're an ex-G.I. , Kelly ? Yeah , what about it ? Yes , yes . I was in the service . As a matter of fact , it was there that I developed my ability to pitch . I was stationed on a small island off in the corner of the Pacific , and the Army supplied our outfit with all recreational equipment , mostly baseball gear . As a matter of fact , they sent enough for two full teams , although there were only ten of us on the island , and hardly enough flat ground to put three shacks on . So , out of sheer desperation and boredom , I spent months pitching to another lad on a narrow strip of beach . And of course you know if you spend that much time doing anything you 're bound to become quite skillful at it . What about before the war ? Yeah . Before the war . Well , before the war , you see , my life was extremely colorless and dull . And as a matter of fact , I 'm really very tired tonight , gentlemen , so , if you 'll excuse me I 'll say goodnight - Yeah , you boys got your story . Come on , now . Let 's go . Great game , Kelly . Hey , that sure was some yarn you handed them , sweetheart . I sure gotta give it to ya . Thanks . Strangely enough , it happens to be true . Hey , Monk . You 're wanted on telephone . Long distance . That 's Mabel . [ Crackling noise ] [ Crackling ] [ Crackling ] How 's the arm , kid ? Well , it 's still pretty sore , Monk . I told you not to walk around with your arm bare like that after I rubbed it . You gotta keep it warm . I 'm gonna shave ! You 're gonna put a sweater on right now . I don 't own one . Then you 'll wear mine , see ? Here , put it on . Go on . Get into it . You know , you 're pitching today , you silly cluck . Yes , I know . If I don 't suffocate first . How you expect me to shave with a turtleneck sweater , I don 't know . Hey , today 's the second . I forgot . I 've gotta go downtown . - We 'll stop on the way to the field . - No . This is something personal . I 'll see you down at the field . Hey , wait a minute , Foo-man-choo . [ Phone rings ] Yes , Mabel . Yes , Mabel . Here 's your receipt for the balance . Did the lady like the ring ? Oh , I don 't know . I hope so . Would you care to look at some wedding rings ? No , thank you . Not ' til the end of the season . Debbie ! Vernon . Look at you . Well , I must apologize for my appearance . What are you doing inside there ? - Well , if you must know , I - - No , no . Don 't tell me . I know . I read about Chicago , Vern . You did ? You 're not going to try the same thing here . You can 't right on Locust . They 've got guards and police . Debbie , what are you talking about ? Oh , don 't pretend you 're so innocent . After all , I 'm not a child . Hey , have you seen Kelly ? Kelly who ? Not Kelly Who . King Kelly the pitcher . [ Crackling ] 'Scuse me , boss . I needs a drink . You can 't expect me to keep on worrying about you . Not knowing where you are or what you 're doing . But there 's no need to worry . Look , You asked me to trust you and believe in you . Well that works both ways . If you won 't trust me enough to tell me what this is all about , I think we better call it quits right now . Alright . Alright , Debbie . I 'll tell you . I suppose I should have told you in the first place . I 'm - Well , if you must know I 'm a baseball player . Oh , Vernon . Tell me the truth . I told you the truth . I 'm a baseball player . That 's not very funny . If you don 't want to tell me , say so . But I told you . Read all about it - Look . That 's me . Kelly . Kelly pitches for today 's game . Get your lineup for today 's game . I 'm Kelly , and I 'm pitching this afternoon . Oh , you are ? Well , I 'm Mata Hari , and I 'm going to sell your secret to the highest bidder . Well , Kelly . Fancy meeting you here . Are you a ball fan , Dr. Greenleaf ? I can 't say I am . It 's the first game I 've seen in years . Well , just sit back and relax . Enjoy yourself . It 'll do you good . If you want him to enjoy himself , let 's get it settled about this endowment , and then we can all relax . Strike two ! I 'm afraid this is going to be an expensive afternoon . Well , I certainly hope so , Mr. Stone . That 's three up and three down again for Kelly . He 's got that ol ' hop ball hoppin ' in there today alright . All he 's gotta do is just keep goin ' like this , and he 'll rack up another victory . And he doesn 't act like a ball player at all . I 'd like you to meet him . Hey Kelly ! Kelly , come here . He took off like a frightened rabbit , didn 't he ? He 's very shy . Nice-looking boy , though . I didn 't get a very good look at him . But you can 't walk out in the middle of the game . That 's mutiny . - I 'm sorry , but - - What is this , Kelly ? Suddenly you 're a prima donna . You been reading the newspapers ? No , it isn 't that , Jimmy . It 's just that I can 't go out there again , that 's all . I 'll slap the biggest , baddest fine on you in history . Well , I 'd rather you wouldn 't do it , Jimmy . But it won 't make any difference if you do . Brooker , warm up . He won 't get away with this . I 'll fine him , I 'll suspend him , I 'll - You got him wrong , Jimmy . He 's kinda whacky , but he ain 't no prima donna . I don 't care what he is . You get tough with him , there 's no tellin ' what he 'll do . He might sit down and never pitch again , and he 's our only chance for the pennant . Kelly is not indispensable . I know he ain 't , but we can 't get along without him . Lemme go talk to him . Lemme see what it 's all about . Go get ' em , fellas . Come on now . Brooker , now pitching for St. Louis . Hey , Jimmy . - Did you pull Kelly ? - No , he quit . He picked up his toys and went home . - Where is he ? - In the locker room . I wanna see him right now . You know this ain 't good etiquette , Kelly , to walk off the mound in the middle of a game . Especially an important one . Pitchers ain 't supposed to go home until they 're invited to . It wasn 't just a whim , Monk . I had to . I saw someone in the stands . You mean a copper or somethin ' ? No , no . Someone I knew . Someone who knew me before I even joined the club . You gotta take that chance , kid . It was liable to happen any time . I know , and when it does I 've gotta do exactly what I did today . Now wait a minute . Be reasonable . Kelly ! Hey Kelly ! Where 's Kelly ? He 's gone . I 'm standin ' here talkin ' to him and he 's gone . Gone ! Gone where ? What 's the matter with him ? Well I 'll tell you , boss . He wanted the afternoon off to go to his grandmother 's funeral . How do I know what 's the matter with him ? Monk ? Where you been ? Here . Why ain 't you asleep ? I been with Stone and Dolan . They had me on the carpet so long I got fallen arches . You take a walk , and I get bawled out . They 're gonna let you off this time , though . You can thank your Uncle Monk for it . I talked myself blue in the face . If you ever do it again , they 're really gonna give it to ya good . Say , ain 't you even interested ? Ah , it doesn 't matter . I 'm through anyway . Through ? You mean you 're gonna quit ? You ain 't gonna pitch no more ? There 's no point now . No point ? In winning the pennant ? You can 't quit now . You gotta keep pitching ' . Whatsa matter ? What happened , kid ? Was it that guy in the stands ? He didn 't recognize ya . Oh , it 's only part of it . I 'm worried about my girl . So it was Madame X you met . I think she 's gonna find out too . Why ? Why should she ? Because I told her . You told her , but you think she 's gonna find out . She wouldn 't believe me , but she 's bound to know , and so is her father . Her father ? If he ever learns the truth I 'm really finished . He 'll never take me back . And I can 't say I blame him after what I said . What 'd ya say ? Oh , I was desperate . I certainly gave him a false impression . I didn 't realize what I was doing , I mean , how serious it was . He thought I was doing something entirely different . That 's the only reason he let me go . Let you go ? Where 'd he have ya ? Oh , it doesn 't matter . It 's all finished . He 's gonna find out , so there 's no use going on . You mean because the girl will find out ? She may not , Kelly . You gotta wait and see . Wait and see what ? Well , if she gets any idea you ain 't ribbing ' her , what 'll she do ? She 'll come out for the first game , see it for herself . It figures , doesn 't it ? Yes , you 're right , Monk . That 's just why I 'm not gonna pitch . Oh , why did I say that ? I 'm makin ' it worse and worse . You gotta keep pitching ' . You can 't quit now . You gotta think of us too , you know . You gotta give us a break . We got a chance to win a pennant in a World Series . That means somethin ' too . Yeah . Yeah , I suppose so . Suppose so ? [ Phone rings ] [ Woman talking ] Mabel . Now neither of us gets any sleep . [ Woman continues talking ] Forgive me for being nosey , Debbie , but would you mind telling me what you 're doing ? Oh ! Just reading the paper , Father . Well , you 're certainly doing a thorough job of it , reading the sports page with a magnifying glass . Oh , I was interested in a wild statement someone made . You aren 't becoming a sports fan , are you ? No , I don 't think so . There 's just an outside chance ... Is that Kelly pitching ? Yeah . Two out . Hank Moore at bat . Come on ! Fan him , Kelly ! Strike two . [ Cheering ] Come on , Monk , play ball . What 're you looking for , a process server ? I 'm lookin ' for a dame . If she comes , I gotta talk to her first . A dame ? Ain 't you gettin ' pretty old for that ? [ Whoop , crowd cheers ] Strike three ! You 're out . Yes ! I saw him . It 's really Vernon . I told ya , lady . He 's Kelly . So did he . But I didn 't believe him . That 's certainly a blow for Jimmy Dolan . Lannigan is the only catcher that 's worked with Kelly all season . If he 's out of there , there 's no telling what may happen . Can you fix him up , Doc ? Sure , he 'll be alright . Look , Monk , don 't be foolish . If it 's too painful , don 't - Ah , didn 't ya hear ? It don 't hurt a bit , they just told me . - Do you have to use those splints ? - What else ? I mean , do they have to be wood ? What do you want ' em made of ? Mother of pearl ? Monk , look , I don 't think you better try to - Ah , quit worrying , will ya ? This ain 't the first clipped finger I ever had . I know , but those splints . Kelly , you worry about the pitching ' . I 'll worry about the catching ' . [ Smack , cheer ] You 're out ! Monk , why not let somebody else catch ? What , and let you down , kid ? Come on . Foul ! Jumpin ' Jupiter , I 'm seein ' things . - You see , Monk , I was afraid that - - It ain 't me finger , it 's me eyes . Foul ! Cock-eyed son of a sea cook . Get outta there , Monk . Ah , but Jimmy - You can 't even pick ' em up after you drop ' em . It isn 't his fault , Jimmy - Don 't worry , he 'll get his purple heart later . Go get that X-rayed , Monk . Calahan catching . Calahan catching for St. Louis . [ Crowd booing ] I 'd like to see Mr. Kelly . I 'm a friend of his . I 'm sorry , lady . You won 't be able to go up there . All the boys 'll be in the shower . Oh . Well . I 'll wait . 'Night . Hey , you 're Madame X. You 're Kelly 's girl , ain 't ya ? Yes . Wait , I want to see him . Oh no you don 't . Jumpin ' Jupiter , It 's lucky I seen ya . Come on , sister . - Why ? What 's the matter ? - Don 't ask no questions , honey . Just get outta here . Come on . I feel like you and me 's been livin ' together for a long time , honey . I see you the first thing every morning , and the last thing every night . You do ? Yeah , Kelly 's got your picture right in the middle of the dresser . I 'm Lannigan - Kelly 's catcher , roommate , bodyguard , and everything else . Also his pal . I 'm for the guy , see ? That 's why I shanghaied ya . I don 't quite understand . Well , if he knew you or anybody else was watchin ' him he 'd walk right out of the ballpark . He done it the other day . Oh . Well that must 've been the day dad was there . He 's liable to walk out altogether . And if he blows it quits , we 're dead and so is he . You don 't wanna hurt the guy just when he 's right on top . Or do ya ? Oh , no ! Of course not . Well , then come to the games , see ? Bring your friends . I 'll even send ya passes only don 't let Kelly see . I 'll sit way up in the farthest corner . You 're not sore at the guy ? Oh , no . But it is quite a shock to fall in love with a college professor , and have him turn out to be a big league pitcher . That 's what he is , a professor . Well , I 'll be . Are you surprised ? I certainly am , because that 's exactly what I thought he was . You know it seems so fantastic . I only came to the game today to make sure . But after I got over the shock , I found myself rooting for Vernon like mad . I think it 's wonderful . Vernon , so that 's what his name is ? Maybe I shouldn 't have told you . No , no , no . Leave us have no secrets , you and me . All right . This Kelly or Vernon is quite a character , but he can pick dames . You know , young lady , I could fall in love with you myself very easy . [ Crowd cheering ] That a boy , Kelly ! Isn 't he wonderful ? Yes , lady . One run and we have the pennant . Only we 're not gonna get it this inning . Why not ? Because the tail end of the batting order is up . Lannigan , and then Kelly . Relax , kid . I 'm gonna win this one for ya . Go , Monk ! Come on , you gotta do it ! Strike one ! [ Crack , crowd cheering ] It 's a homer ! Lannigan 's hit a homer ! That 's the game , folks . And the pennant for St. Louis . Debbie , where have you been ? St. Louis . Again ? Deborah , you 're not a child , but all these mysterious trips , I can 't help but worry . Mother , if you promise not to tell - Yes ? Both managers are starting their ace pitchers for the first game of the series . Here are the batteries . It 's Keets and Topina for New York . St. Louis - Kelly and Lannigan . It seems so incredible . I can hardly believe it . What do you think of it , Joe ? I think it 's outrageous - that he never pitched on the varsity . Now right at the end of the fifth game here in New York , and it 's still anybody 's series . Talk about a neck and neck and a tight race , how about this one ? The series is tied , two games all , First of the ninth - St. Louis has a two run lead . Steiner 's up . Kelly stretches . Steiner swings and misses . Strike one ! Atta boy , Kelly ! Nice going , Professor . Professor ? Sure , don 't you know who Kelly is ? And Steiner goes down swinging . That 's the game , folks . Kelly 's done it again . [ Cheering ] Vernon 's won again ! Who ? Vernon , Daddy . Vernon is King Kelly . What ? Monk , Monk , time to get up . [ Groan ] [ Crackling ] [ Crackling and groaning ] Hey , Monk . Have you been using my hair tonic ? Hair tonic ? Oh yeah . I 'm growin ' a whole new crop Ain 't ya noticed ? Did you take the bottle out of my suitcase ? Oh yeah . I meant to tell ya . I seen it in there last week . I didn 't think you 'd mind . It 's my last bottle . What did you do with it ? I give it to Jimmy . He 's gettin ' a little thin on top , ya know . Oh , I gotta go get it . What for ? You 're wearing a cap . [ Door slams ] Jumpin ' Jupiter . What a character . [ Crackling ] [ Crackling ] [ Crackling ] [ Knocking at door ] Come in . Oh , Jimmy , I 'm sorry to bother you , but uh - Oh , it 's you , Kelly . [ Crackling ] [ Crackling ] [ Crackling ] Must be a lot of electricity in the air , the way my hair 's behaving ' . Well I - I wanted to talk to you , Jimmy . What 's on your mind ? Well it 's the hair tonic . What ? The hair tonic . Did Monk give you a bottle of my hair tonic ? Oh yeah . I just tried it . I was losin ' a few . Monk said it 'd grow hair on a billiard ball . Kind of an insult . Well , you see , it 's a very rare solution , and I can 't duplicate it . Ok , I 'm willing to pay for it . How much do you want ? Well , no , no . It isn 't that . It 's my last bottle , and I need it . You need it ? What for ? You gonna play for the House of David ? No , no - it 's a little ideosyncrosy of mine . It 's sort of a superstition , and especially today , you know ? Now I 've heard of everything from a rabbit 's foot to an elk 's tooth , but hair tonic - that 's a new one . Please , Jimmy - Have you got it ? Yeah , yeah . Where did I put it ? Ah , here it is . On the top shelf . [ weakly ] Oh - [ Crowd cheering ] First half of the eighth , fans . St. Louis still trailing 6 to 5 . Something 's happened to Kelly . He 's not himself today . Maybe it 's the strain . After all , this game means the series . He 's been in trouble a couple of times , but those St. Louis boys have come back strong . [ Crack , crowd cheers ] I can 't understand it . What 's happened with Vernon ? It 's another hit for Hopkins , and Marconi scores . It 's New York 7 , St. Louis 5 There 's two out , but Kelly 's in real trouble again . Where 's the old hop , kid ? I haven 't got it anymore , Monk . It 's gone . OK , kid . Steady down , steady down . Let ' em hit a few . There 's seven men behind you . They can handle it . They 're a great ball club . Well , they better be . And he 's out . That ends the inning , and New York has a two run lead . [ Clapping ] [ Crack , crowd cheers ] Quit worrying ' . This ball game ain 't over yet . I wish it were . Alright , kid . Alright , your hop ain 't workin ' . You and I know it , but them batter 's don 't . You gotta use psychology . It 's gonna take more than psychology . No it ain 't , kid . You gotta keep bluffing ' all the time . See , you gotta go out there lookin ' as cocky - Atta boy , Louie . You know , if I was intelligent , I 'd go to Jimmy and ask him to relieve me . But I 'm not gonna do it . I hope he lets me stay . - because I wanna go out there and see if I can - - Atta boy , Kelly . Now you 're talkin ' . [ Crack , crowd cheers ] And Tony gets a beautiful double . St. Louis is still in this old ballgame . The tying run is on second . We might not win , but I 'm gonna go down trying . And even if we do lose - Will you quit talkin ' about losin ' . We got two men on . [ Crack , crowd cheers ] [ Crack , crowd cheers ] It 's another two-bagger . Richards scores and Bevins is coming in , too . And St. Louis is ahead again . Eight to seven . Hey , what 's eatin ' you , Kelly ? I 'm just rubbing your head for luck , Monk . [ Crack , crowd cheers ] And Davis is out at first . That 's two down for St. Louis . And Stevens is up . [ Crack , crowd cheers ] Come on . Let 's go . Atta boy . Kelly , I 'm leavin ' you in . It 's your game to win or lose . All you gotta do is hope . Good luck , kid . - Jimmy- - Yes , sir ? - You 're leaving him in ? - Yeah . Gonna gamble . Jimmy 's gonna leave him in . He 's gambling everything on King Kelly . It 's the first of the ninth , and Kelly is facing the top of the New York batting order . You mean to say St. Louis is ahead again ? Yes , Mother . Eight to seven . Now if Vernon can only hold ' em . [ Whoop ] Strike one ! [ Crowd cheers ] [ Crack ] That 's one man out . If Kelly can get two more men , the game is over . But that 's an awful big if right now . [ Crack , crowd cheers ] What a game , ladies and gentlemen . What a game . New York 's got the tying run on first , and Aaron is up . [ Crack , crowd cheers ] It 's a beautiful catch . What a game , ladies and gentlemen . Kelly 's is saved again , but he 's grimly hanging on to that one run lead . There 's two out now . Man on second . And blockbuster Marx comes to bat . He 's gotten three hits off Kelly this afternoon . And this is your game right here , folks . [ Crack , crowd cheers ] He did it ! He caught it ! [ Crowd cheers ] The series is over , and Kelly 's won his own game . [ Raucous yelling ] Boys , we 're the World Champions ! Kelly , when you walked into my office that day I called you a crackpot . All 's I can say is , I wish I had a dozen crackpots like you . Well , thank you , Jimmy . Thank you . Hey , that hand looks bad . How 's it feel ? Well it 's rather painful . I thought so . Come on . We 'd better get that X-rayed . If he says there 's anything wrong with Kelly 's pitching ' hand , I 'm gonna crown ' im . How is it , Doc ? I 'm afraid it 's serious . Serious ? It can 't be . Can 't you do something ? Listen , Doc . This kid 's the greatest pitcher in baseball . Just as I feared . There 's not only a fracture of the first phalanx of the second finger , but a linear fracture of the metacarpal bone , extending into the joint . What 's all this mean , Doc ? Can 't you say it in English ? It means he 's through . For good , huh ? Yes . How 's it feel , kid ? Oh , it 's not too bad . What about the X-rays ? Well , the Doc - he made up with a lot of mumbo jumbo . You know how those guys are . What did he say ? Listen , Kelly . I wanna tell you something . I 've been playin ' ball since Hector was a pup , and what 's it got me ? I mean , it don 't matter how long you 're up there , it 's what you do . Oh , you 've done alright , Monk . I 'm talking about you , Kelly . You had a season , kid . A season like nobody ever had before . Well , I guess I was lucky , but - Lucky ? You 're the greatest pitcher in baseball , Kelly , and don 't let nobody ever tell you different . I seen ' em all , and I know . You could pitch for twenty years and never do no better . You done it all , kid . You know , you got nothin ' to look forward to . What 's this all about ? So what 's it matter if you pitch for one year or for twenty ? None of us is indestructible . We all gotta quit sometime . What did the doctor say , Monk ? Well , that 's what I 'm tryin ' to tell ya . He says you 're all washed up , kid . He said you ain 't gonna pitch no more . He did ? Well , I never dreamt my career would end this way . You and me both , kid . And I ain 't never gonna forget it . I 'm gonna spend the rest of my life goin ' around bragging ' that King Kelly was my roommate . I 'm gonna throw it in the pound . Well , I guess this is goodbye , eh kid ? Oh , just for the time being , Monk . I hope so . I mean , we 'll be hearin ' from ya , Kelly , what do you say ? Oh sure , of course . What do you figure you 're gonna do , kid ? Well , I dont ' know . I - I 'd like to get my old job back , but I don 't think there 's much chance of that . There ain 't , huh ? Not after the way I left and what I 've been doing since . I suppose the best thing that I should do is go back and make a clean breast of the whole thing . And when I do - Jumpin ' Jupiter , you ain 't murdered nobody or nothin ' . All you done was play ball . I know . I only did it to get enough money to marry my girl . But even so , I haven 't much hope . But they oughtta know that . I don 't get it . It don 't make no sense to me . A lot of things don 't make sense , Monk . I was a chemistry teacher . I can tell you that now . And the sum of money I received for teaching science to the youth of this state for an entire year was a little less than I got in a single afternoon for tossing a five-ounce sphere past a young man holding a wooden stick . But that ain 't right , Kelly . If it weren 't for the professors teaching ' the kids , everybody 'd turn out to be dumb clucks . - All aboard ! Like me . You did alright . I hope you keep on . Thanks , kid . Well , I guess I 'd better be moving . Yeah , guess you better . How 's the hand , kid ? Oh , it 's fine , just fine . I - You know , I never had very many friends , Monk , and you 've been a real one . You 've done a lot for me , and I and I just wanted to say that - I just don 't know how to say what I want to say . Neither do I. Leave us not try . Right , uh - I 'll get in touch with you as soon as I get things straightened out . Yeah , do that , Kelly . I 'm gonna miss you , kid . I hate to see you goin ' . Me too . Well , go on . Get in the train , Kelly . Well , so long . Say hello to Mabel . Yeah . [ Train whistle blows ] Mister - This is your stop . - What ? - This is where you get off . We 're coming in now . Oh , oh thank you . Come on ! [ Cheering and band music playing ] Darling ! Vern , oh , you 're wonderful ! I 'm so proud of you . You mean you know ? Everybody knows ? Oh , of course ! And we 've all been rooting for you like mad . Vernon that catch was , oh - Oh , your hand . Does it hurt very much ? Oh , no , Debbie , no . Oh , it 's terrible . Monk said you 'd never pitch again . - Monk ? - Yes , he called . Oh , we 're pals , Vernon . He even got us tickets for the game . Well , what about your father ? I suppose he knows too . Yes , Vernon . I know all about it too . We all know , Vernon . We all know . Oh , Dr. Greenleaf . I wanted to talk to you , to explain , I mean , about my old job . Do you think there 's any chance - I 'm afraid not , Vernon . That 's what I thought . See , Mr. Stone has given us the money for the research labratory . You 're the only man he 'll let us put in as director . Atta boy , Mr. Kelly . You were terrific . Yes sir , professor . You sure put that methyl , ethyl , propyl , and butyl on that ball .

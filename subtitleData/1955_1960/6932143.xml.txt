Evil traitors . ─ I remember their trial . They confessed to being in Eurasia during Hate Week last year . That 's why the war went badly for two months afterwards . They were able to disclose a lot of secret information . What are they doing at liberty ? BB granted them a pardon . Don 't you remember ? He freed 25 prisoners in honour of the Mediterranean victory . Only BB could make a gesture like that . I imagine they spent some time at the Ministry Of Love . Oh yes . That 's why they 're here . They 're cured . Better not show that we 're interested . Two gins . Good . Thank you . Maybe we shouldn 't have stopped here . I get pretty uneasy when I 'm near people who aren 't ..

Then you know her ? Yes , she works in the Ministry Of Truth . In the fiction department there . They turn out books for the people . But you 've never spoken to her . No . She watches me .

I wondered if you might have anything else in which I 'd be interested . Do you mind if I look around ? ─ Not at all . What is this ? Oh , that 's coral that is . Yes . Probably came from the Indian Ocean . Look . They used to embed it in glass like that . Oh , it must be a hundred years old , or more . It 's a beautiful thing . Yes , it is a beautiful thing . Not beauty as we understand it today of course . It serves no useful purpose . But then .. I 'm an old man . How much is it ? I can let you have it for .. Fifteen shillings ? Have you change ? ─ Yes . Thank you . Oh .. there is another room upstairs . There is not much in it . Just a few pieces . Perhaps you would you care to see it ? Yes , I 'd like to . I 'll lead the way . We lived here until my wife died . I 'm selling off the furniture little by little . There is no telescreen here . Of course not . It 's a People 's Area . I know . But it seems strange . That 's an interesting picture . It was a church . Do you know that word ? Yes , there were two churches when I was a child . You must have been a grown man before I was born . You can remember what it was like in the days before the revolution . Yes . You can remember the oppression and the injustice and poverty back in the 50s . Vaguely . I 'm keeping your from your other customers . Yes . Well . You have a look around . Oh . Excuse me . Good evening . Good evening . I saw some things in the window and wanted to have a closer look . Anything in particular ? No . You seem to have some interesting things . I doubt if I have anything of interest to a young lady like yourself . I see .. do you have many customers ? Alas , no . The antique business is just about finished . Do many outer party members come here ? ─ Why should they come ? Ah , there you are . Your change . Thank you . Your paperweight . Who are you ? 6748 . Smith . W. Where do you work ? ─ In the Ministry Of Truth . Which department ? ─ The records department . What is your business in the People 's Area ? I had a headache . I thought if I got a little air . When did you leave work ? ─ 18 : 00 hours . It is now 22 : 00 . Report tomorrow morning at 08 : 00 hours to Administration . " 6748 . Smith . W. " You took a rather long walk , last night . Yes . Did it help your headache ? I don 't have one this morning . Perhaps you 've been working too hard . ─ I don 't think so . Do you find your work at the records department too exacting ? No . What do you do , Smith ? I revise history . That 's an unfortunate way of putting it . What you actually do is rectify speeches and wrongly reported incidents , isn 't it ? Yes . It shows the need to have Newspeak as the official language as soon as possible . When the new dictionary is issued . There will be less danger of calling things by their wrong names . Did you visit any of the shops in the People 's Area last night ? No . Did you speak to anyone ? ─ No . Did you see any other member of the Outer Party on your walk ? No .. You know the party disapproves of its members mixing with the people ? Yes . Do you consider that unreasonable ? No . 6748 . You are a member of the privileged class . Expected to accept restrictions as well as privileges . I hoped we might be able to deal with this matter here , in your own ministry . Your explanations are inadequate . This report will be forwarded to the Ministry Of Love for further action .

You haven 't given me your contributions . ─ Which one is that ? For Hate Week . ─ Oh , just a minute . We 're making an all-out effort . We 're going to put on a tremendous show .

These are the evil men . Whose ruthless lust for power threatens to destroy the civilized world . These men preferred war . But already they are beginning to learn the mistake they have made . As the encounter the might of Oceania . Our glorious army . Is sweeping back the invading hordes of Eurasians . The figures of prisoners taken , is the biggest since the war began . Raise your voices comrades . To let them hear the voice of Oceania ! There they are ! It 's the prisoners . ─ Down with the prisoners . Kill them .. kill them ! Can you hear me ? Sunday afternoon . Go to the south meadow from Central Station . Cross the bridge . Follow the river for half a mile and get to a fallen tree . Wait for me in the glade . I 'll get there by another way . Can you remember that ? Move away from me now . Kill the Eurasians ! Kill the Eurasians ! Hello . We 're alright . There 's no microphones here . It takes a little while to realize you 're not being overheard . Or watched . We can look at each other now and not be afraid . We can say whatever we like to each other . We can even touch each other . If we want to . You know , I don 't even know your name . It 's Julia . And yours is Winston . ─ How do you know that ? When I want to find something out , I have ways . It took me ages to get that message to you . I thought you were spying on me when you came into that shop . You said I was a good party member . Pure in word and deed . Ha . That 's why I was afraid of you . Do you know I hated you and I wanted to kill you . That 's what Big Brother has done to us all . He 's made us hate and fear each other . How did you know I wasn 't a good party member ? Something in your face . Somehow I knew you 'd be against them . It will be safe here once or twice again . Then we 'll have to go somewhere else . And eventually , they 'll find us out . I won 't let you take that risk for me . I 'm not doing it for you . I 'm doing it for myself . If you keep the big rules . It 's safe to break the little ones . You 've been here before , haven 't you . Yes . Does that shock you ? They are afraid of love . Because love makes a world they can 't control . And it 's a world worth taking risks for , isn 't it . Yes . Yes . " It 's more than two weeks since we have been able to meet .

I didn 't hear you coming . ─ You weren 't meant to . We are trained to be spies and to follow people silently . Why were you following me ? We are told to follow anyone who behaves suspiciously . What was suspicious about my behaviour ? It is suspicious coming here . I was working in my room on an article for Newspeak . A page flew out the window . I saw it flutter down here so I came to find it . I saw you pick up something . I dropped my cigarettes , that 's all . It 's dark now . I 'll have to look on my way to work tomorrow .

I know . If only there was somewhere where we needn 't be afraid all the time . Where we could be together longer . Julia . There is somewhere . That old shop . There is a room above it where no-one lives . There is no telescreen . I believe I could rent that room . The old man in the shop would have to know . Any time he wanted , he could report us . I don 't think he would . I 've talked with him . His only interest is his antiques . Renting the room will give him money , so he won 't have to sell all his treasures . You saw him yourself . Sooner or later , we 'll have to trust someone . I 'm going to do it . [ Siren ] Somehow they must have found out . We shouldn 't have stayed so long . It 's no use . It 's too late .

Since you were both last here , I 've managed to get you some pots and pans . And I took some of my old stuff downstairs . Oh , and everything in the kitchen works now . I 'm afraid it might not be as peaceful as you might like . I like it . I don 't hear much singing where I live . Oh , we do in this district . Popular songs , of course . The Party keeps us well supplied with those . Oh , this is perhaps the young lady now . Yes . Good afternoon . ─ Hello . Oh , well . I 'll be leaving you now . Should you require anything , I 'm just below . You 're late . What happened to you ? ─ The Anti-Sex League went on for ever . I thought those silly women would never stop talking . And I had to pick up some things . ─ I was afraid something might .. Keep you from getting here . You worry too much . Look what I have . Coffee . Real coffee . Real sugar . ─ How did you manage it ? It 's all Inner Party stuff . They have everything . Yes , but where did you get it ? A friend . ─ A friend ? A girlfriend . What else do you have in there ? ─ Nothing . I 'll make some coffee . [ Lady singing ] [ Lady singing ] Julia . Do you hear that woman singing ? I like that . I believe it 's people like her . Who will one day overthrow Big Brother and all he stands for . Julia . ─ Just a minute . It 's beautiful .. you are beautiful . Look at you .. look at you . If only some of those bloodless females could see you now . See what a woman can really look like . What is it ? ─ A rat .. a rat ! It 's gone now . I 've never seen you like this . The one thing I really hate . The one thing I 'm really afraid of . ─ Why ? When I was a child . Where I lived , there were swarms of them . One day my .. my sister . Forgive me . I didn 't mean to upset you . I 'll make some coffee . Will you help me ? Yes . Would you fill this with water . I 'm sorry . Put the sugar in the bowl . If only you didn 't have to wear these again . I wish you could stay always as you are now . That would be worth fighting for . There must be something we can do about it . If only I knew someone in The Underground . People who have anything to do with The Underground don 't live long . There is a man at the Ministry Of Truth called O 'Connor . But he 's a member of the Inner Party . ─ I think he 's against them too . Sooner or later , you 've got trust someone . You said so yourself . But I didn 't mean someone in the Inner Party . Someone who could have you vaporized by lifting his little finger . I don 't know . I think I could trust O 'Connor . The only people we can trust are ourselves . Do you remember Jones and Rutherford ? They were accused of being in Eurasia during Hate-Week last year . Well , they weren 't ! They were right here being honoured by Big Brother . Some weeks ago , I found a newspaper photograph . O 'Connor saw me with it . And he didn 't report you ? ─ If he had , I wouldn 't be here . It was a little scrap of evidence out of the past that they 'd forgot to destroy . And I had it right in my hands . Darling , you can 't fight them alone . If there is an underground . If it isn 't another of their inventions to keep people hysterical . I want to be part of it . One of these days , I 'm going to let O 'Connor know how I feel . Now , please ! Don 't worry . I won 't do anything stupid . I 'll wait until he gives me some sort of signal . Something that .. lets me know . " The Ministry Of Love issued new details today .

Smith . W. " Yes ? " What is in the briefcase ? " I brought some work home with me . I was about to write an article of the glamour of Newspeak . " Bring it to the screen and open it .

" The exclusive employment of words sanctioned by the party . To reduce the possibility of confusion and doublethink . Work is now progressing on the latest edition of the Newspeak dictionary . Which will replace all previous editions . You seem to take a scholarly interest in the new dictionary , Smith . Oh .. hardly scholarly . Have you seen any of the material we are using ? No . Syme told me about it . Syme ? ─ Yes , he works over there . Syme lo longer exists . The work has to be carried on of course . It seems to me you are more equipped to do it than anyone else . I 'd like you to look at that new material . Perhaps you can pick it up at my apartment . I 'll give you the address . I 'm usually in after 19 : 00 hours . Come along as soon as you can . I have reason to believe that you can be of great value to us . But I tell you , it 's the same handwriting . You mean he gave you his address and said he wants to see you at his home ? Things like that don 't happen . It would be too dangerous . He made some sort of excuse about the new dictionary . You know if you 're wrong , it will be the end of all this . Once they get hold of us .. There 's nothing , absolutely nothing that either one of us can do for the other . They can make us confess anything . But they can 't make us believe it . They can 't get inside of us . Who knows what they can do ? ─ Julia . I 'm convinced O 'Connor is a member of The Underground . He 's our one hope . I 'm going through with this . I have to . But there is no need for you . Whatever you 're going to do . I 'm coming with you . " Here is the news tonight . " " The production figures for this year . " " Already exceed those for corresponding dates for 1983 by over twelve percent . " Alright Martin . You can bring them in now . " In certain categories , this increase is even greater .

" " Shoelaces however , show only an increase of five percent . " " It is confidently predicted that this increased production .. " Come in . " The Ministry of Plenty is confident . " " That 1984 will demonstrate the complete success . " " Of Big Brother 's nine-year plan . " You can turn it off ? A few members of the Inner Party have that privilege . Well . Is that really off ? We 've come here because .. Because .. Because you both believe there 's a conspiracy . Some kind of organization working against Big Brother . Yes . We believe that you 're involved in it . We want to join it and work for it . That 's alright . Martin is one of us . Alright , Martin . Bring the drinks over here . We might as well sit and talk in comfort . I think it is fitting we should begin by drinking a toast . This wine . I 'm afraid not much of it reaches the Outer Party . What shall we drink to ? The triumph of Kalador ? The confusion of the Thought Police ? Down with Big Brother . Down with Big Brother . You can go now , Martin . But before you go , take a good look at these two comrade 's faces . You 'll be seeing them again . In general terms , what are you prepared to do ? You are of course prepared to give your lives ? Yes . You are prepared to commit murder ? Yes . Betray your country to a foreign power ? Yes . And prepared to separate and never see one another anymore ? No ! No . You did well to tell me . Of course you realize that you will be fighting in the dark . You will have nothing to sustain you except the idea . And when you are caught , you will get no help . I will send you a book which will teach you the nature of the society we live in . And the strategy we shall use to destroy it . But you get no information about your own organization . When you receive orders they will have come from me . I assume that you have some kind of hiding place ? Yes , a room over a junk shop . We go there Sundays when we can . That briefcase , do you always carry it ? As a rule , yes . Every day during Hate-Week , carry it empty . Now I 'm afraid it 's time for you to go . Even we are not allowed to turn that off as long as we would want . I used to be afraid there was no Underground . Perhaps The Party invented us . Oh , and Smith . If I were you , I would destroy that diary . Now then comrades . Big Brother is always merciful . He stands ever ready to welcome back to his love and protection . Those who have seen the error of their ways . Only one sin , one sin is unforgivable . The sin of treason ! Tonight . Tonight , the traitors Rutherford and Jones . Will speak to you themselves . Before they are taken away , to the deaths they so richly deserve . Let these two men .. Who have really come to see the error of their ways . Tell you for themselves . The grave crimes they have committed . In thoughts , words and deeds . Hear them for yourselves . I am here tonight to tell you of the grave crimes .. Which I have committed in thoughts , words and deeds . For which I am now truly penitent . I betrayed my country to our enemy the Eurasians . I conspired with the arch-traitor , Kalador . Excuse me , comrade . I think you 've taken the wrong briefcase . I conspired with the arch-traitor Kalador to overthrow Big Brother . Darling . I 've got it . Kalador 's book . Somebody stopped me in the square and gave me his briefcase . Look how like my own it is . It shows you how well organized The Underground is . Now listen . Not just now , darling . There may not be another chance for weeks . There is a rush at the records office . You know how it is during Hate-Week . The papers are full of mistakes and we 've got to put them right . Now listen . Kalador says .. the aim of the ruling class is to stay where it is . The aim of the middle class is to overthrow the ruling class . And the aim of the lower class . Is to create a society in which all classes are equal . Big Brother has so organized the Inner Party . That there is no danger of the ruling class being deposed . Darling .. aren 't you listening ? I 'd have liked to have had a child . I know . And that 's why this is so important . But it 's just words . No , Julia . This can make everything we want possible . Don 't you want to understand what we 're fighting for ? I found that out already . You are in this room . We 've got to fight to keep this happiness . I know . But it won 't be Kalador 's book or any underground that will defeat them . What , then ? Don 't you see ? There must be others in love like us . Who will rebel . They can 't stop that . That 's the real hope for the future . I wonder if it could happen in our lifetime . Maybe . But the important thing is that there is .. Hope for the world . All I know is . When we are together it 's wonderful to be alive . " You are the dead ! " " You are the dead . " The mirror ! It must be a telescreen . ─ It can 't be . They are all around the house . Don 't resist . " Stand in the middle of the room . " " Stand back to back . " " Don 't touch each other . " " Put your hands over your heads . " I think I warned you it wouldn 't be as peaceful here as you could like . Nothing is ever hidden from the Thought Police . Take them away . 6748 . Smith . Uncover your face . [ O 'Connor 's voice ] " Are you prepared to commit murder ? " " Yes . " " Betray your country to a foreign power ? " " Yes . " " And prepared to separate and never see one another anymore ? " " No ! " Julia ! ─ " Silence ! " Julia ! ─ " Silence , Smith ! " When a woman is arrested , what happens to her ? Where do they take the women ? Parsons . They won 't hang me , will they ? They know my record . Why have they arrested you ? There I was . Trying to do my bit . And never knowing I had any .. Bad stuff in my mind , of course . Do you know what they heard me say ? " Down with Big Brother . " I said that in my sleep . I said it over and over again , it seems . I 'm glad they got me before it went any further . Do you know what I 'm going to say when I go up before the tribunal ? " Thank you . " I 'm going to say .. " thank you " . " For saving me before it 's too late . " Who denounced you ? My little girl . She heard what I was saying . I don 't bear her any grudge for it . It shows I .. Brought her up in the right spirit , anyway . Room 101 . No . I 've told you everything . What else do you want to know ? There is nothing I won 't confess to . Nothing . Nothing ! ─ Right . What is Room 101 ? They wouldn 't hang me , would they ? For going off the track just once ? What is Room 101 ? O 'Connor . Take his badge . Don 't be in too much of a hurry to find out about Room 101 . You 'll find out in good time . What have you done with Julia ? She betrayed you , Winston . You tortured her . I 've watched over you for a long time . Now , I 'm going to help you . First there are preliminaries to be gone through . But after that you will be brought to me and .. we will talk . So the time has come , Winston . Do you know where you are , Winston ? The Ministry Of Love . Right . Do you know how long you 've been here ? Days . Weeks ? Months . It must be months . Do you know why we bring people to this place ? Yes . To make them confess . You don 't really believe that ? No . I suppose I don 't . You punish them . No . We bring them here to cure them . To make them sane . Nobody that we bring here ever leaves our hands un-cured . Why don 't you kill me ? The first thing you must understand about this place , Winston . Is that there are no martyrdoms . You remember the religious persecutions of the past ? They were failures . They set out to eradicate heresies , and they ended by perpetuating them . We do not make that mistake . We make them tell the truth . Why bother with me ? You .. are a flaw in the pattern , Winston . You are a stain which has to be wiped out . When finally you confess to us . It must be of your own free will . We do not destroy the heretic , we convert him . We capture his inner mind . We reshape him . We burn all evil out of him . We bring him over to our side not merely in appearance , but genuinely . The heart and soul . We make him one of ourselves . No-one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us . We will lead you , step by step . To the point at which there is no return . Never again will you be capable of love or friendship . Or joy of life , or laughter or courage or curiosity or integrity . You will be hollow . We will squeeze you empty and then we will fill you with .. ourselves . With love of Big Brother . Now , before we begin your cure are there any questions you would like to ask ? Where is Julia ? She is alive . Next question . Does Kalador exist ? Does the Underground .. exist ? That Winston , you will never know . But that question Winston , proves that you are mentally deranged . You have a defective memory . You are unable to remember real events . And you persuade yourself that you remember events that never happened . For example . Do you remember receiving a book supposedly written by Kalador ? Yes . Somebody gave it to me in Victory Square . Are you quite sure that the book ever existed ? I want the truth , Winston . Tell me what you think you remember . I had the book . Take him away . Let us take another delusion of yours . You believe you had in your hands a photo of the traitors Jones and Rutherford . I did have it . You believe it was documentary evidence proving their confessions were forged ? I remember telling you that the photograph did not exist . It did exist . It does exist . It is in my memory . I remember it . You remember it . I do not remember it . There is a Party directive dealing with the control of the past . Repeat it to me . Who controls the past .. Controls the future . Controls the present . Controls the past . And where do you suppose this " past " exists ? In records . The Party controls all records . In human memory . The Party controls all human memories . How can you control the memory ? You haven 't controlled mine . On the contrary . You haven 't controlled it . That is why you are here . You 've been lacking in humility . In self-discipline . You must make an effort of the will , Winston . And rehabilitate your mind . Then you will be sane . But first you must be humble . Do you remember writing in that diary of yours .. That freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four ? How many fingers am I holding out ? Four . And if the State says not four , but five .. How many ? Four . Take him . Now , how many fingers ? Four . Four . What else can I say ? Four . Point two zero . ─ " Point two zero . " " One . " " Two " . " Out . " How many fingers , Winston ? Four . Four . Point three zero . ─ " Point three zero . " " One . " " Two . " " Three . " Five .. five . Four .. five . Anything you like .. only stop it ! Stop it . Stop it ! That 's no use , Winston . You 're lying . You still think there are four . How can I help saying what 's in front of my eyes ? Two and two are four . Sometimes . We 've had all that out before . Sometimes they are four . Sometimes , if the State says so , they are five . How many fingers ? I 'm trying to see five . Which do you want ? To persuade me that you see five , or really to see them ? Really to see them . Point six zero . ─ Point " six zero . " " One .. two .. three .. four .. five .. " Again . How many fingers ? I don 't know . I don 't know . Four ? Five ? Six ? In all honesty , I don 't know . Better . Now Winston , without any persuasion . There are five fingers there . Do you see five fingers ? Yes . Look at me . Did you ever read a book by Kalador ? No . No such book ever existed , did it ? No . You see how the mind can be controlled . Washed clean . Even the traitors Jones and Rutherford , in whose innocence you once believed . In the end , we broke them down . When we had finished with them , there was nothing left in them except .. Sorrow for what they had done . And love for Big Brother . Stand up . Come over here . That 's enough . It 's a long time since you 've seen yourself , Winston . Look . What .. ? What have you done to me ? Can you think of a single degradation that has not happened to you ? No . [ O 'Connor 's voice ] " Are you prepared to separate and never see on another anymore ? " [ Julia 's voice ] " No ! " Julia . Julia ! I have not betrayed Julia . I have not betrayed Julia . No . No , that is perfectly true . You have not betrayed Julia . Come with me , Winston . Winston . You were once curious about Room 101 . It is not one room , but many . This one , for instance . You are going to find out what lies beyond that door , Winston . But to whet your curiosity , I will give you a hint . Room 101 . Is the worst thing in the world . Of course , that varies from individual to individual . It may be .. burial alive .. or .. Death by drowning .. or by fire . Or by impalement . Of fifty other deaths . Which death do you fear most in all the world , Winston ? You needn 't answer . You 've already told me . " A rat . " " A rat ! " " It 's gone now . " " I 've never seen you like this . " " It 's the one thing I really hate . " " It 's one thing I 'm really afraid of . " ─ " Why ? " " When I was a child . " " Where I lived there were swarms of them . " " One day , my .. my sister . " Will you lead the way , Winston ? Not to me .. not to me ! Do it to Julia , not to me ! I don 't care what you do to her ! Let them have her ! Not to me ! To Julia ! Not to me .. Now Winston , you are wholly ours . You have been washed clean . You will be released tomorrow . " Attention . " " A later bulletin has just been issued by the Ministry Of Peace . " " The southward advance of the Eurasian army on the African front .. " " Is still continuing . " " It is feared that unless a counter attack is launched immediately . " " The whole of central Africa may fall to the invading hordes " " A defeat in this area may well threaten the very heart of Oceania itself . " " In this grave crisis . " " The Ministry Of Truth will continue to issue frequent bulletins . " Julia . I betrayed you . I betrayed you . They threaten you with something . Something you can 't bear to think about . You find yourself saying .. " Don 't do it to me . " " Do it to someone else . " Later , you tell yourself . You just said it to make them stop . But it 's not true . At the time when it .. happens . You mean it . All you care about is yourself . All you care about is yourself . And then you don 't feel the same way about the other person any longer . No . You don 't feel the same any longer . I never thought that could happen . ─ Shush . " Attention , everybody . Attention ! " " Here is the latest bulletin that 's just been received from the front in Africa . " " News has just been received . " " That a vast manoeuvre planned by Big Brother . " " And involving perfect coördination with the land-sea forces of Oceania . " " Has resulted in the utter rout of the Eurasian army in Africa . " " The enemy is completely demoralized . " " And fleeing before our victorious troops . " " Long .. live .. Big Brother ! " Truly . Big Brother . Big Brother . Big Brother . Big Brother . Big Brother . Long live Big Brother . Long live Big Brother . Long live Big Brother . Long live Big Brother ! Long live Big Brother . Long live Big Brother ! Long live Big Brother ! Long live Big Brother ! Long live Big Brother ! Long live Big Brother ! Long live Big Brother ! Long live Big Brother ! Long live Big Brother ! Long live Big Brother ! Long live Big Brother ! Long live Big Brother ! Big Brother ! Big Brother .. Big Brother ! Long live Big Brother ! Long live Big Brother ! Long live Big Brother .. " This then , is a story of the future . " " It could be the story of our children . " " If we fail to preserve their heritage of freedom . " T-G

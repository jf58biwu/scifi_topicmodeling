 VARAN THE UNBELIEVABLE Five , four , three , two , one zero ! We are now on the brink of the space age . Another major step in the history of mankind . Space flight is no longer a mere dream . Outer space is full of mystery . As is the earth on which we live . We are now about to reveal the most mysterious story ever told . PROF . SUGIMOTO 'S BIOLOGYCLASS Everyone , would you please come over here ? I have a surprise for you . Now look ! This species of butterfly has been known to exist only in Siberia . But a schoolboy found if right here in Japan during the summer vacation . I want to find out whether many such butterflies exist there or not . We have sent two institute members to research the area . The area is in Tohoku . Up the Kitagami River ... about 40 kilometers in diameter ... The area is called the Tibet of Japan . Oh , the road is terrible . We should have come on foot . - Mm , let 's see how far we can go . - Okay . Oh , excuse me . Is this Iwaya Village ? Urh ... urh ... Mm ... ! They think we 're monsters . The God of Baradagi ... The God of Baradagi ? Never heard of such a name before . This is the Tibet of Japan , all right . I really hate this place . - Well , let 's go ahead . - Yeah . An earthquake ? I don 't think so . - Where shall we go ? - Mm ... - Shall we turn back ? - Shall we turn back ? - No , let 's go a little further . It 's still early . I 'm scared . It 's too early for monsters . What 's that ? It 's a gas which is specific to this region . I see . I don 't know why the map doesn 't show any lake here . Yeah . - Hey , let 's take a look at the car . - Okay ! Look ! Over there ! That 's the one . Yeah . A red-spotted tail . That 's beautiful ! Yes , it 's a beauty . Hey , let 's go back ! WHO KILLED THEM ? BARADAGI ? TWO SCHOLARS KILLED IN THE MOUNTAINS Professor , you don 't really believe in such things , do you ? Mm , it 's very puzzling . Oh , Yuriko ! Kenji , I came here to take back things that my brother left behind . Oh , this is all that 's left of him . Professor , Miss Yuriko . My condolences . Professor , do you know what killed them ? Well , it 's very hard to tell . The police said that your brother 's jeep was crushed like a paper toy . Then it could not have been a landslide . If it 's a landslide , it will be easy to recognize . Are you superstitious ? No , of course not . But we know nothing about the biological aspects of the place . About the local myth called Baradagi ... We might think it is a superstition ... But the people who live there ... they do not think so . They all think that Baradagi is real . I 'll try to find out what that Baradagi is . You ? I 'm a reporter and we are planning to solve the mystery of the 20th century . This is a big scoop . That 's why I 've joined the research party . I see . But that 's too dangerous . Oh , don 't worry ! I 'll look after her . Oh no , not you . You don 't look like much protection anyway . Professor , may I go with them ? Mm . Ticket , please . Ticket , please . Miss , how far is Iwaya Village from here ? Oh , I 'm sorry , I don 't know . I 've never been there . Iwaya Village ? Huh , nobody goes there . Thank you very much . - Let 's go ' n take a look . - Okay . Let 's rest a while . How about it ? You tired ? Yes , a little . How far is it from here ? Two kilometers . Oh ? Then let 's keep on going . Oh , what 's that ? It 's only a bird . Stupid ! It couldn 't be . Don 't be a coward . I didn 't know a bird could sound so frightening . - You are really scared ! - You are really scared ! - Don 't be silly . What is it ? - Did you hear anything ? - Did you hear anything ? - Sure , I did . Sounds like footsteps . Someone 's coming ! Ah ! You can not go further . Why the mask ? It 's Baradagi ! Baradagi ? Yes , sir . Are you living in Iwaya ? Yeah . - What does your father do ? - What does your father do ? - He 's a priest . A priest ? Look ! That 's Baradagi ! Don 't let him see you . He 'll eat you up . Oh ? Eat me up ? Baradagi ! Baradagi ! Oh God of Baradagi ! Please deliver us from your great wrath . Oh God of Baradagi ! We did not mean to invade your privacy . Oh God of Baradagi ! Please forgive those that have offended thee . Who are you ? What do you want ? All of us came from Tokyo to explore this area . Explore ? Never ! You must go back ! Don 't you know , two men have been killed by Baradagi ? And they were also from Tokyo . You 'd better go ! Wait a minute , these two men and I studied in the same Institute . And ... one of them was her brother . We don 't believe that their deaths were caused by the wrath of Baradagi . It 's ridiculous to believe such a thing ever existed . Hold your tongue ! I refuse to fill my ears with blasphemy . Now everyone of you listen to me , I personally forbid you to go any further . What is Baradagi ? Have you ever seen him ? Heaven forbids , you 'll die if you see Him . Go , go before you evoke the divine wrath . Chibee ! Chibee ! Chibee ! Gen ! Where are you going ? Come back ! Gen ! Gen ! Where are you going ? Come back , Gen ! Come back here , my boy ! Your son is condemned . You will die , if you go in there . Gen ! Gen ! Come back ! Come back , boy ! Gen ! Gen ! Chibee ! Chibee ! Chibee ! What are you trying to do ? Why are you afraid of Baradagi ? Nobody 's seen him . We have to find that kid ! Yuriko , let 's go ! Yeah . Horiguchi ! Okay . Hey , give me a hand . Must you go ? Yes , I have to rescue that boy . Oh God of Baradagi ! Forgive them . Have mercy on them ! Boy ! Boy ! Boy ! Chibee ! Chibee ! Chibee ! Boy ! It 's getting foggy ! Watch your step ! Boy ! Ah ! Damn it ! Gave me a scare ! Yuriko ! Yuriko ! What 's the matter ? - I can 't find Yuriko . - I can 't find Yuriko . - Oh ? Yuriko ! Kenji ! Horiguchi ! Oh , they 've come back ! Oh , they 're coming back ! They 're back ! Now look , the fog is getting too thick . Help us find the boy ! Where is your friend , sir ? We lost her . On account of the fog . Baradagi 's angry ! We can never believe such nonsense . This is the 20th century . How can you be so foolish . It 's true , we have met with many strange phenomena out here . But they have nothing to do with the Baradagi at all . Now , get rid of that silly superstition and help us find the boy . Can 't you see , even a small boy went to save his own pet . Okay , I 'll go with you ! Me too . I 'll go with you ! Oh , Chibee ! Chibee ! Chibee ! Oh , Chibee ! " The boy is safe . " " We 'll stay near the lake until the fog lifts . " " Yuriko . " Say , your boy is safe . Oh , thank God ! The boy is safe ! Let 's go ! Let 's go together ! Oh , Kenji , look ! The fog is lifting . Yeah ! Come on , let 's go ! Oh , boy , the fog is lifting . Yeah ! Ah , Chibee ! Gen ! Where are you ? Gen ! Oh , look ! Oh , Yuriko ! Yuriko ! It 's good to see you . Gen , oh my boy , you are saved . Hey , look over there ! It 's Baradagi ! Baradagi ! Run for it ! Run ! Hurry ! Let 's get out of here . Let 's run ! Run ! Hurry ! Come on ! Hey , come on quick ! Forgive them ! Forgive them ! That 's an oversized lizard ! What is it ? It could be a Varan . Varan ? But it 's unbelievable that Varan can still be alive after millions of years . But , Kenji , you have to believe it now . It is Varan that killed my brother . Yes , it would wreak havoc in a big city . Come on ! Let 's report it ! VARAN , THE PREHISTORIC MONSTER VARAN ANNIHILATES A VILLAGE We have ample evidence to assume that Varan is a Varanopode . And as to my knowledge , Varanopode lived about 185 million years ago ... It ranges from the Triassic period to the Jurassic and cretaceous periods . Hello , Mr. Majima ! Professor Sugimoto ! They 're officers of the Defense Agency . Kusama , sir ! Katsumoto , sir ! How do you do ? The Defense Agency considers this a very serious case . - Oh , I know . Sit down ! - Thank you . - What do you know about the monster ? - What do you know about the monster ? - Actually nothing . But there is one thing we are quite sure , that is we shall never let Varan enter the cities . That is what we are all worrying about . We have already alerted the troops to advance to the location and we wonder , sir , if you could accompany us to the area . By all means . When are you going to start ? We 'll start as soon as you 're ready , sir . Hey ! They are coming ! They are all here ! So this is the lake . Yes . Varan destroyed the Iwaya Village and returned all the way out here . Must we all wait until it comes out again ? Nah , the Chemical Squads are on the way here . They will lure Varan out . Your paper gave us a big scoop . Yeah , I had to risk my life for it . - Hey , is it really in there ? - Hey , is it really in there ? - Yeah . It 's big , you 'd better get yourself a wide-angle lens . What 's that ? Some joker just threw a stone Hey , this is no time for jokes . Get out ! Get out ! Take position ! Set cannons ! Position Secured ! Yes , sir . Yes , sir . No. 1 all loaded . No. 1 all loaded . Range , 700 yards . Range , 700 yards . Standby ! Standby action ! Standby action ! Standby ! First platoon , standby ! 2nd platoon , standby ! Calling Headquarters ! Heavy artillery , 1345 , rockets howitzers and mortars standing by for action . Over ! This is HQ . Your message received . Over ! - All ready , sir ! - Good ! The civilians have been evacuated . Thank you . This is Mr. Kusama and Katsumoto . Nakao , sir . How do you do ? Where is Varan right now ? Oh , I suppose , Varan is at the bottom of the lake . But , don 't worry , the lake has been heavily guarded . - We 'll be off now . - We 'll be off now . - Good ! I 'll take a look at the new weapons . The shells contain chemicals which will dissolve in water . They 'll take effect in 20 minutes . - When we will begin the attack ? - When we will begin the attack ? - At 1400 hours . Ready ! Fire ! Fire ! 25 minutes have passed but nothing 's happened . That 's odd ! Kenji ! Look ! Hum ! Dead fish ! Look over there ! Ah ! Ah ! Look ! Ah , it 's Varan ! Varan ! It 's quite a monster ! It 's horrible ! Colonel Kusama , we must kill that monster . Fire ! The target 's been hit ! Fire ! Let 's run ! Let 's run ! Want the enemy to see you back ? I just want to take a picture from a distance . Good , I think I 'll also take one like that . It 's no use , Professor . We 've thrown everything at him , and he 's still coming . The situation is impossible ! We have to withdraw ! Now this is an order ! Withdraw ! Withdraw ! Let 's withdraw ! Professor , hurry ! Let 's go ! Kenji ! Withdraw ! - You 'd better go , too ! - You 'd better go , too ! - No , I 'll stay with you . Don 't be silly ! You reporters don 't have to take such a risk . Now go on over there and wait for me ! Hurry ! Hey , it 's Baradagi ! It 's Baradagi ! It 's Baradagi ! Kenji , help ! Look ! Can we call for more reinforcements ? It is too late now . Professor , what 's happening now ? You just saw what happened . Varan is indestructible . Unfortunately there 's no way to stop the monster . We can 't kill it ? Well , I think there must be a way . To kill Varan , we might have to use something really drastic . Hey , did you see Yuriko ? No ! Where is she ? Kenji , isn 't Yuriko with you ? Nah , she left before I did . But , she 's not here ! - Not here ? - Yeah . Hey ! Yuriko ! Yuriko ! Yuriko ! Yuriko ! Yuriko ! Yuriko ! Oh , Yuriko ! Are you all right ? Hold on ! Don 't worry . Just hang on ! Hold on ! Yuriko , Yuriko , just hang on ! There 's a cave . Kenji ! Yuriko ! Kenji ! Yuriko ! Look ! They 're trapped in that cave ! Professor , they 'll be killed if they remain there . We must divert the animal 's attention . Did you by any chance bring the flares ? Yes , we did , but how should we use them ? Animals are sensitive to light , and I think the flares might do the trick . - Bring it over here ! - Yes , sir ! Bring the flares ! Yes , sir ! - Shoot the flares towards the mountain ! - Yes , sir . Target ! Mountain ! Fire ! Come on ! Let 's go ! We 've come to save you . Oh , thank you . Yuriko , we 're safe now . Thank you . Look up there ! Hit the dirt ! Anti-Varan Headquarters have now been set up by the Ministry of Defense . The Navy and the Air Force have been alerted day and night in search of the monster . 15 port ! 15 port , sir ! Of course , sir ! Steady ! Steady as she goes ! Of course , sir ! Sonar Contact ? No contact , sir ! So , up to this very moment , there is nothing we can fight Varan with . He is really a monster , he can even repel the 36mm cannon . What is your opinion , Dr. Fujimura ? I don 't think the situation is really that pessimistic . Maybe our cannons and machine guns are not strong enough . But we still have stronger weapons that can penetrate steel . Although , Varan is a monster , he is a living animal . And I don 't think his skin is stronger than steel . Dr. Sugimoto , what do you say ? I am sorry for the time being , there 's nothing I can say not until we know more about Varan . But skin is always flexible and never stronger than steel . Yes , of course it is common sense but Varan exceeds our scope of knowledge . We can never predict what 's going to happen . Have you any suggestions ? Not now . Actually , I 'm hoping that Dr. Fujimura 's idea will work , there are some new weapons . What do you say , Dr. Majima ? I agree with Dr. Sugimoto . It 's not the hardness of the skin that repels the shells . Maybe it 's the flexibility of the skin that causes it . Oh , damn it , not a single fish . Our lucks out ! Oh , let 's go home . Mm , good idea . Hey , what 's that ? Ah ! Ah , it 's Va ... Va ... Va ... Varan ! Varan ! Varan ! It 's Varan ! Ah ! This is the Uranami reporting . Varan is located at 35.5 North , 140.15 East . I 'll repeat , 35.5 North , 140.15 East . Varan is moving toward the southwest . Standby units , move out immediately . Move out immediately . Varan located five o 'clock low . We 've found Varan . Commence the attack with the rocket bomb . I 'll repeat , commence the attack with the rocket bomb . Rockets away ! Varan has submerged . We made several direct hits . He must have been injured . We are still standing by ! Commander , based on this information Varan will attack us where we least expected . So , please alert all the fleet . 10 Port ! 10 Port , sir . Of course , sir ! Steady ! Steady . Calling HQ ! 1120 . We 've found Varan . Calling HQ ! 1120 . We 've found Varan . Range : 2000 ... Range : 2000 ! Damn it ! Varan will attack us again ! - Standby , for action ! - Standby , for action ! - 10 degree port ! - 10 degree port ! Fire ! This is the Uranami reporting . Varan is heading toward the Uraga Channel . Commander , Varan is heading toward Tokyo . Hey , come with me . What 's up ? Is our helicopter available ? - Helicopter ? - Yes . - Don 't you want to take pictures of it ? - Don 't you want to take pictures of it ? - Yes , of course . Are you crazy ? The Airports are closed , right now . URANAMI Commander , let 's attack again . Attack again ? With what ? Depth charges . That is the weapon that will do the trick . Trick ? Yes , sir . We 'll use depth charges . Like we used to do for sweeping the mines . This is Isonami report to HQ . Varan passed Uraga Channel heading towards Tokyo Bay . - All right , go ahead ! - All right , go ahead ! - Yes , sir ! Prepare to attack with depth charges . Prepare to attack with depth charges . Prepare to attack with depth charges . Ready for action , sir ! - Fire ! - Fire ! Standby ! Fire ! Standby ! Fire ! He got hit . A direct hit ... Good , I think we got him this time . He 's still alive ! The Tsukishima harbor is alerted . All the reclaimed land at Ooi , has been alerted . Is the Evacuation proceeding ? Yes , all the costal areas are being evacuated . Your attention , Please ! Your attention , Please ! Varan is approaching . Please evacuate this area immediately . Your attention , Please ! Your attention , Please ! Varan is approaching . Please evacuate this area immediately . From HQ to Haneda Air field . When your defense is ready , report at once . Report at once ! Over ! Roger . Dr. Fujimura , I hear that you have invented a very powerful explosive . Yes , but it 's not exactly ready yet . What kind of explosive ? It 's a kind of bomb that I intended to use for dam construction . But why can 't we use it now ? We could , but I doubt whether it would work . Why not ? It is designed to explode hard rocks from the inside . But if it is to explode outside of something , it will have very little power . I 'll show you the picture and you 'll see what I mean . That 's the explosive . It 's the same size as a stick of dynamite , but 20 times as powerful . Unless we can detonate it inside of Varan , it 's quite useless . But how are we are going to do this ? This is the tower of Haneda Airport . Varan 's started moving . It is approaching the Air field . Dr. Fujimura , let 's try your explosive . No , I 'd rather not . If used in quantity , I think it ought to work . We have our duty to defend our capital . We must try every means possible . All right , I 'll get going . Kusama , this is the showdown between Varan and us . Let 's move our Headquarters to Haneda Airport . Yes , sir . First platoon ! Standby ! Ready ! 2nd platoon ! Standby ! Ready ! Ready for action ! Ready for action ! Fire ! Varan has passed the Haneda light-house . Range : 2000 . Ah ! Over there ! Open fire ! - Have you sent for the bomb ? - Have you sent for the bomb ? - Yes . It should be here any moment now . - Check whether the bomb has arrived ? - Check whether the bomb has arrived ? - Yes , sir . Come in , SM 75 ! Come in , SM 75 ! Hey ! Oh , Yuriko ! - Let 's go ! - Okay , let 's go ! - Thanks for coming . - That 's all right . Thank you . Drive towards the waterfront . No , I can 't . It 's too late now . It 's way beyond the call of our duty . Let 's go . - No , Kenji ! - Kenji ! Kenji ! Now , hold the end of it . Kenji ! Kenji ! Kenji ! Oh ! Oh ! Kenji ! Kenji ! Hurry up ! Hurry Up ! Are you all right ? I 'm all right . Fire ! We did it . Okay , let 's go ! Come on , action ! Move on ! It 's dangerous here , let 's withdraw ! Commander , let 's move to the north end of the field . Attention ! We are moving to the north corner of the field ! Shall we begin to attack once again ? No , if we shock Varan too much , it will also anger him . Well ... Tokyo is doomed . Katsumoto ? That 's the only way it can work ... What is it ? We 'll attack Varan from the inside . - Are you going to do that ? - Are you going to do that ? - Now you just look at this . Did you see , the monster is swallowing all the flares . I saw the same thing happen at the mountain . So if we can tie all the new explosives on the flares and throw it down by helicopter . He might eat it . I see . We 'll do that immediately . Colonel Kusama , while we are preparing alert all the jets to pin that monster down in the same position . Yes , sir . This is HQ , continue the present attack . - Pin down the target . - Pin down the target . - Roger , out ! Make way for the helicopters . Hold all attacks ! Roger , out ! Get back ! All clear ! What time does the bomb explode ? In about 30 minutes . 15 minutes passed , so ... I estimated it 'll go off around 4 : 50 . Look , there ! 7 more minutes . Hold the attack ! Roger , roger ! Oh , he swallowed the bombs ! This time it will succeed . It worked . It has worked . It 's heading toward the sea . It 's still moving . There is one more bomb inside Varan . He 's dying . Come on ! Let 's go ! Don 't run so fast . Are your feet hurting you now ? Nothing bothers me at this moment . It 's a great job ! Let 's take a good picture . Okay Thus , Varan has vanished into a veil of mystery . After a desperate struggle , Man has now won another victory . THE END

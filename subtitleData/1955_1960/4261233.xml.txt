 Okay , cut . Hey , Shuter , tell Himmler , " Okay , already . " How was it , Morgan ? Like a Rembrandt . Okay , wrap it up . Let 's go back to the castle . Home , Himmler . I don 't need him anymore , Shuter . Help her , Mike . Hey , Ronaldo , can it and airmail it to New York . - How long that run ? - Forever . Jealousy , jealousy , lover . Don 't blame me because you 're no longer an ingénue . That 's not exactly what you said when you married me . - Well , I keep you on the payroll . I 'm loyal . - Oh , yes . You 're loyal . To wives number 1-through-4 , inclusive . Would you care to try your luck for five ? If you don 't spell my name right when you wire out your next story , you 're on my hate list again . I don 't know . I may not be able to afford the alimony . - I may have to sleep on it . - Oh , I 'll just bet you will . How I suffer for Douglas Row on Madison Avenue and all those lovely sponsors . Scalped by Indians one show to recreate a covered-wagon massacre boiled and eaten the show before , on the Donner Party expedition and now , nearly drowned to celebrate the 230th anniversary of Frankenstein . And for this , we 've got to travel 3000 miles to his ancestor 's castle in Germany ? Oh , well . Achtung and hell residuals . How could you inflict these people on me , Gottfried ? I have no privacy . I cannot think . I cannot work . I 'm completely overrun . My castle , my grounds ... You are a true Frankenstein , Victor . Always complaining . But you forget , it 's you who forced us into this . " Let them use my castle , " you said . Anything , just so you could get this atomic reactor you need so badly and have no funds to purchase . Well , these days it is difficult to live on the sale of the acquisitions of one 's ancestors . I 've been wanting to talk to you about this , Victor . You have been spending money and money . You 're buying equipment as though you were a government . - Where it goes and what you do with it ... - Is my business . No , it 's my business too . How can I handle your affairs if there are no affairs to handle ? If there is mistrust ? As it is , I have sold practically every one of your art treasures . There 's nothing left . See ? My fish . They 're hungry beasts today . The struggle for existence is just as fierce and ruthless in their world as it is in ours . Not so , Gottfried ? To think that man could torture fellow man as they once tortured you . They believed in one thing , I believed in another . But they were running the country . That was my misfortune . But you won and they didn 't . I won ? You 're thinking only of my surgeon 's hands . They were too clever to do anything to them . They needed them for the unholy operations they forced me to perform for them . Well , what they did to the rest of me , my body ... But you didn 't give them what they wanted . You didn 't go over to their side . They couldn 't take your mind , Victor . My mind . Would anyone ever believe that you and I are the same age ? That I 'm even still a man ? Victor , why don 't you accept the government 's offer of a scientific post ? And wait for politicians to make up their minds ? I am the last of the house of Frankenstein , it is true . But how much time do you think that I have left ? Every hour is a day out of my life . Every day , a month . Every month , a year . A month can see the end of my life ? Victor why ? Why what ? Why the strange secrecy behind your wanting all this equipment ? Why , for days at a time , do you disappear without anybody knowing what you 're up to ? And now , this great urgency for an atomic-powered unit exacting promise that you must have it at once . Victor tell me . Tell me before I 'm forced to think what ... What I dread to be the truth . Gottfried . Remind me to tell you sometime the story of the inquisitive commandant who ... It wasn 't good , it was great . What did you expect ? Oh , hi , baron . They 're shipping out that power unit , or whatever , from Berlin . Should be here in two or three days . Gottfried , I was gonna call you . These are the TV release forms for the baron and you to sign off . Sooner the better , Mr. Row , then I can get on with my work . Glad you brought that up . I 'm gonna rewrite the script , open up the show with you . Fix me a drink while you 're at it , will you ? Scotch . That 's a nice boy you got there , baron . Real typecasting . Now , I got the whole thing figured out . Coffins , epitaphs , lightning , thunder . And you in the vaults , giving us the lowdown on your great , great grandfather . The first Frankenstein . The one who created the monster . It ties in with the film portion we shot today . But we 'll do the clip live , with you . Don 't you let Horrible Herman leave town . - I want him back to play the thing . - Hold it for a second , will you , Doug . As soon as I get finished , we 'll go over the script . We 'll give it a dry run so you 'll get a good idea of it . - We 'll start rehearsals . - You say the unit will be here in a few days , Mr. Row ? Okay , Doug . Morgan , check the vaults for lighting and camera angles . - You may need some special lenses . - Will do . That 's right , in two or three days . You know , after you finish this show you 're not gonna wanna fool around with atomic gizmos . You 're gonna be a television star , with 60 million ecstatic fans screaming for more of you . Give a few , take a few . What with the commercials . The baron may even get his own sponsor . What do you think , a series right here from the castle is such a bad idea ? That could be my pleasure . With you as my leading lady , Miss Hayes . Mr. Row I 'm becoming reconciled to your presence here . Your coming here may be the solution to all my problems . What 'd I say ? " I , Frankenstein began my work in the year 1740 AD with all good intentions and humane thoughts to the high purpose of probing the secrets of life itself with but one end the betterment of mankind . " So wrote my celebrated ancestor . But first he had to learn how flesh was made . He had to discover the art of transplanting vital organs from human beings into his creature and knitting them together until they had all the attributes of God-inspired birth . Of course , I must admit that perhaps he was not too scrupulous about where he got his raw material . But after 17 years his labors were at last rewarded . He created a living man . But to his horror what did he discover ? That his creation was a monster . Hideous , foul . It 's evil brain with but one thought , that of survival . In order to survive it killed and killed and killed again . Until it became the very image of the devil incarnate . Then he realized what he had created , he must kill . But because he was the creator he could not bring himself to destroy it , utterly . In this stone sarcophagus deep in the bowels of the Earth he buried his creature his creation . In a passage in an ancient vault of the family burial place he sealed it away for all time without vital organs or soul so that nevermore could it bring terror to mortal man or challenge God the only true creator for whose merciful forgiveness he prayed . Ah ! I 'm sorry , I ... I got carried away . Well , Uncle Douglas will just have to comfort you tonight , dear . - His favorite indoor occupation . - Stick to the script , Judy . Baron , you were great . Just terrific . - Wasn 't he , Mike ? - Yeah . A real gasser . What 's the matter with him ? He says he 's finished . He doesn 't want to come back anymore . He says all this here makes him so nervous . - He cannot sleep nights . - He can 't sleep nights ? Put this under your pillow , Himmler . This 'll make you sleep like a baby . Maybe you 'll have a couple of real nice dreams . Well , wrap it up . Tomorrow 's another day . Baron , you pick up lines pretty fast . - Well , good night , baron . - Good night , Mr. Row . Come on , Judy . Doug , that dialogue , it wasn 't what you wrote in the script . That 's right , it wasn 't . But between you and me , it was great . Yeah , yeah . Right . We 're flying them in from all over . Europe , the United States . Got a big thing going with the National magazine . They 're gonna cover the Frankenstein party here at the castle right after the show . Yeah , I got a whole thing going . Goblins all over the place running wild . Yeah , goblins . Goblins , that 's right . We ran an international horror contest . The most beautiful goblin from each country . Yeah , you 're not just whistling " Ach du lieber Augustin . " We got some goblins that 'll kill you , man . Anything else ? Okay , thanks . Yeah , Fräulein , it is Herr Elvis . And now we try the London Times , maybe , baby ? Four hours delay ? Cancel it , Brunhilde . I 'll try it again tomorrow . - Fräulein , a little bit more coffee ? - Oh , no , thank you . Oh , Shuter I was in town today and well , I thought you might like this . - No , Fräulein ... - Oh , it 's nothing , really . But a man your age out in all this dampness and fog ... - No , I ... - Make believe it 's your birthday . - No ... Oh , it 'll help keep you warm when you 're working around the castle . I don 't know what to say to that , dear . Thank you . Shuter . You are richly endowed to have one as lovely as Miss Hayes bestow gifts upon you . Revised script . It can wait till morning to be typed . Baron , it won 't be long now . As you say , Mr. Row , it won 't be long now . Hey , Doug . We 're sure gonna have to spot some marks out there if you expect to cut through that fog for the night stuff . Let 's not cut through it . The more atmosphere , the better . Okay , it 's your baby . But I still say it 's gonna fog up the whole night scene . I 'd like to go over that new scene with you , If you 're not too tired . - No , I 'm not tired . - Think of your career , darling . Judy ? - Let 's us take a walk , huh ? - I 'd like to take a walk right out of here . Oh , Mike , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to take it out on you . Torch , scorch , unfortch . Okay , Judy , forget it . Gottfried . Something is on your mind , say it . It is difficult . It has never been difficult for you to speak in the past . This is different . Something has happened . Something is changing . It is you , Victor . I 've been very concerned with you these past days , Victor . What kind of dealings do you have with the director of the morgue ? Are you interested in corpses ? Oh , Gottfried . I shall really have to tell you the story of the inquisitive commandant . The one at Belsen , remember ? Victor I watched you tonight , at the organ . That was no music you ever played before . Not the way you played it . I never felt it that way before . Victor ? They might believe that you want that atomic element to supply electric power but I ... Victor . You and I will always share the truth . I know the history of your family . I know you are the last of your line there are no others to follow you ... What are you trying to say ? I don 't know . I wish I knew . Tuesday , 2018 o 'clock . Resuming work . As a result of stripping skin off the skull keeping clean and keeping at the required temperature the bones have become crystalline . I may now begin reconstruction of the physiognomy whenever I please . A note on the hands : Both real and synthetic skin transplantation fused . Pores open and normal . Texture and tone of tissue firm , showing no deterioration . Attachment of hand to wrist , stable . Contemplating further plastic surgery to remove old scar tissue . Subject has maintained perfect state of preservation . Now ready for final surgical step of transplanting living vital organs . Now needed to complete the last act , before use of atomic reactor to reproduce rebirth . Shuter . Herr baron ? My poor Shuter . Why did it have to be you ? Herr Baron , I do not understand what is happening here . A miracle , Shuter . Come here . No . Herr Baron , you have opened its grave . You have brought the thing back . We 'll bring it back , Shuter . No , Herr Baron , you ... No . You cannot do that . You ... You ... - You cannot kill me . - Come closer , Shuter . - Come closer . - No , but , you ... - You cannot kill me . You can 't ... - I must , Shuter . - Please . - You leave me no choice . - Herr Baron , don 't . - You will live again , Shuter . You will live again . You will hear me , and your brain will obey . - No . - Think . Think , Shuter . What glory it will bring to the name of the house of Frankenstein . No more pain . No more suffering . I 'm doing you a favor , Shuter . I 'm saving you the pain and misery and discomfort of old age . Do you understand what I 'm saying ? Sleep , Shuter . Sleep . Sleep . Sleep . Peaceful sleep . Sleep . Now tying off the aorta and superior and inferior vena cavae . Automatic transfusion system continuing to supply fresh blood . Both bodies are receiving oxygen . Freshly transplanted organs remain alive and healthy . Heart is freed . It is receiving constant massage . I 'm now placing the heart in the left side of the chest . Suturing aorta and two cavae to the heart . Proceeding with uninterrupted massage during surgery . Continuing artificial pulse and circulation of blood at normal speed . Good morning . You know , if you 're fixing breakfast for Douglas , don 't bother . - All he ever takes is orange juice . - Well , I was fixing this for all of us . Shuter isn 't around this morning . I put the toast in the oven . Didn 't that take an awful lot of courage , darling ? After all , you never know who you 'll find dead in an oven . Shuter . Now , where do you suppose he is ? Maybe it 's his day off . Since when does the old family retainer operate on a 40-hour week ? - Shuter . - I 'm afraid he won 't be able to hear you . - Why not ? - Well , it may surprise you but even Shuter has relatives of his own . He 's gone to stay with them at Vertenberg , perhaps for sometime . In the meantime , this young man will take care of your needs . Yes , we 've met . I am sorry you were inconvenienced , but I didn 't expect you up so soon . Oh , it wasn 't your fault . The men with your equipment for the lab woke us . It 's here ? It arrived ? - Yes , about an hour ago . - Splendid , splendid . Shuter 's brain restored , all membranes intact . Continuity between the medulla and spinal cord restored . Cerebrum enclosed . With tantalum prepared in accordance with Glock 's standard trephining technique . You seem rather disturbed , my dear . Oh , it ... It must be the organ . Somehow organ music always makes me think of death . Where did you get that ? Oh , I found it down in the vaults . I was saving it for Shuter when he ... That may be some time . I 'll send it to him . Yes . Where is he , Victor ? Where is Shuter ? Before you tell me that he 's gone to see his relatives remember that I 'm aware he has no relatives anywhere . Yet , this morning I looked into Shuter 's room . All his clothes are still there . Gottfried , dear old friend . Remember the story I was going to tell you ? The story about the inquisitive commandant the one who was at Belsen ? He too was always asking questions . Prying . Seeking to learn what went on in other men 's minds . But do you know what 's it like , Gottfried , to hear the same voice over and over ? Always , always the same words eating into you every day day after day ? No , of course you don 't . You weren 't there . But I was . I had to listen . And then , one bright , lovely day they found the poor fellow . He had no tongue . Imagine the irony of it , Gottfried . Oh , I know . I was called in to examine the poor wretch . A beautiful piece of surgery , if I do say so myself . Beautiful . Time : 2137 . Temperature of atomic capsule : 7 degrees centigrade . Radiation : Nil . I am now starting up the atomic steam generator . I 'm now starting the timer . Temperature : 52 degrees . Geiger-Müller at 3.66 . Experiment proceeding as planned . Time : 2203 . All radiation off . Zero on Geiger-Müller dial . Who is it ? Me . Who do you think ? Who is it ? Me . Who do you think ? It 's rather late . I know and I 'm standing in the grass , honey . Come on , open up . You 'd better go . Are you sure ? Yes , I 'm sure . Carolyn . Please go . Shuter . Shuter . Shuter , can you hear me ? Shuter . Shuter . I 'm talking to you , I 'm speaking to you . Shuter . Shuter . Can you hear me ? Can you hear me ? Ah . Can you understand me ? I see you do . Shuter raise your left arm . Ah ... Now your right arm , Shuter . You understand me , don 't you , Shuter ? Good . Good . Shuter , yours is not the brain that I would have chosen but at least you are obedient . Now we must get eyes for you , mustn 't we , Shuter ? I have none to give you , but we will get you some . You understand me , do you ? Good . Who 's there ? Me . Do I get to come in ? Are you all alone ? Not quite . What are you writing ? Just some revisions for the boss . " I press your lips to mine and suddenly it 's a summer night . " Oh , what chance do I have while you 're working for him ? - You know , to me that is strictly dialogue . - I wish I believed that . I wish I did too . Do you think maybe you could go for me if you ever douse that torch you 're carrying for Row ? I guess so . Sure . Why not ? I press your lips to mine and suddenly it 's toothpaste . You just can 't forget him for a minute , can you ? - I 'm crazy about you , Judy . - Look , we tried this before and it didn 't work , remember ? - It takes practice . Well , it 's getting late . I 'd like to practice my shuteye . - You aren 't gonna kick me out , are you ? - I don 't kick . I try to be a lady . If I ever get Row out of my hair , I 'll let you know . - I 'll let everybody know . - Oh , let 's talk this over . Not now . On your way . - One more thing . - Save it . - Oh , Judy . Let me stay . - Across the hall , your room . - Judy . - Now what ? Don 't be like that . - Sorry , pal . - Let me in , please . Now , please be a good little boy and run off to bed . Shh ! Don 't make so much noise . You wanna wake everybody up ? Don 't be mad at me . We forgot something . You know what we forgot ? You forgot to kiss me good night . Good night , Mike . Oh , please , Judy . Open the door . If you don 't shut up and go to bed I 'm gonna be angry and I 'll never let you in my room . - Oh , Judy . Mike ... Ah ! You fool , Shuter . I sent you for Row . Now you have no eyes , this poor girl is dead and we 're both in great danger . Look , this is my alimony check , sent on by her New York attorneys . It 's got to be serious for her to go off and leave this . All right , I did go to her room last night . I tried to talk her out of carrying that torch for you . I tried to talk her into giving me some time . Well , maybe I talk too much . Or maybe that torch got too hot to hold . Or maybe she took off to get away from both of us . How do I know ? Either way I feel awful . You feel awful ? We 're trying to find my ex-wife , baron . Do you know anything about her ? Oh , the Fräuline Judy ? Well , I know that she is beautiful and charming . What else does one need to know about any woman ? But seriously , no , I 've not seen her since last night . Perhaps I should ask Hans if he can tell us anything . Skip it , baron . Cheer up , Mike . Take it from a man who knows . After she 's pouted long enough , she 'll be back . The worse thing you can do is go chasing after her . Morgan 's been lining up shots for tomorrow . He said I 'd photograph wonderfully in that old apple tree up on the hill . I 'm sure you 'd look charming anywhere , my dear . But I feel that I should warn you . They say that tree has a curse on it . And anyone who sits in it will hang from it by nightfall . Why , I don 't think I 'd care for that . Never mind the apple tree . What I need for a background is something bright , shiny , modern . Something new for a change . That atomic reactor of yours how 's it working ? - I should say an unqualified success . - Where do you keep it ? - It is installed in my laboratory . That 's it . A modern laboratory . We 'll do the prologue there . We go in for the rest of the picture in retrospect . - Let 's go . I wanna see it . - Gottfried . Is the laboratory included in the contract with Mr. Row ? - It is not . - Then you cannot use it . Whatever the difference , baron , I 'll pay it . You do not understand . My laboratory is filled with the latest scientific equipment of my own invention . I would not dream of exposing it to television until I have it patented . You don 't need to worry . Morgan will take care of your secrets . Won 't you ? - Yeah , sure . I 'll shoot around them . - Again you do not understand . The answer was no . I have no intention of reconsidering . You and Carol go down and check the vaults . Mike , come upstairs . I got a new finish I wanna try on you . Hey , doll , bring it up a little , huh ? Hey , doll , bring it up a little , huh ? A little higher . - Yeah . That 's okay . Okay ? According to my Hooper rating , it 's perfect . Yeah , sure . Come on , let 's try one more shot , huh ? You backed up in there , huh ? Look , back up there , huh ? I want you to get back there . That 's it . Now , turn around . Yeah , keep backing up . Backing up . Right . Keep going . The ... Easy there , will you ? Back up . Go ahead . Good . Go all the ways around now . Outside . I want you to make a clean entrance . All the ways out . It 's dark in here . Doll , that 's the idea . I want you to come in to the light from the dark . Back up . Get your hand out of it . Okay . Now make a clean entrance . - Uh-huh . Now walk towards me . - Like this ? Yeah , that 's real crisp . Fine . Okay . Stop there . That 's fine . Let 's try it once more . - And stay a little more to camera left . - Okay . Okay , back up now . That 's it . Keep back ... Watch out for that step . That 's it . Go , doll . You know where you were . Go all the ways back . Go ahead . Out . Outside . Get your ... Get yourself out now . Fine . Okay , now , come on in . That 's ... Uh-huh . Slow . That 's it . Perfect . - Thanks , darling . I 'm gonna pack up . - Are you coming ? No , I 'll stick around here . Line up a few more shots . Okay . Oh , my God . Help . Please , help . Somebody , please help ... Ah ! Hm . One of those relatively rare persons with A-type blood . Under the circumstances any attempt at transplantation is out of the question . Your cameraman has been missing since yesterday your secretary since the day before . You wish the police to find them . - That is so , is it not ? - Right . You sure they had no reason for leaving ? Well , the Fräulein Judy was married to Mr. Row at one time . One might say that she was emotionally disturbed . Yes , of course . And the cameraman ? Well , he said something to me about going in to Frankfurt for a special lens that he needed . Thank you , Herr Baron . Now you see how simple it is ? No , I don 't see how simple it is . Two people are missing . I wanna know why they haven 't come back . Mr. Row , I imagine , would have us suspect foul play . And how do you know he isn 't right ? I left Morgan downstairs in the vaults and I never saw him come up again . Perhaps the Fräulein would feel better if I took a look . - The Herr Baron permits ? - Let me show you the way . There you are , inspector . Search to your heart 's content . Mr. Row , I fail to see the meaning of this search . It is irreverent , disturbing the sleep of the dead . I 'm sorry , Herr Baron . My dear inspector , you must make allowances for these show people . They live in a world of fanciful dreams . Hidden doors , sliding panels , even sudden disappearances . The nonsense of things that don 't exist . World of make-believe . Exactly what I said to myself , Herr Baron . They will stop at nothing to get their names in the newspapers . They might even go so far as to disappear . Eh ? Now , get this straight . This is no publicity gag . I 've been reading about Frankenstein 's monster coming to life and carrying people off . Well , they didn 't get them from me , did they , Mike ? No , chief . It came from me . So it was you and your people who set these stories afoot . Gottfried , come with me . I wish to prefer legal charges against this man . Frankenstein is not one to forgive a thing like that , nor is the law . I shall make careful inquiries . If it turns out you made false statements , you will find the penalties quite severe . It 's so nice to have a policeman along in this dark old place . - Permit me to offer you my arm , Fräulein . - Oh , thank you . Another disappearance , Victor . Too bad . First Shuter , then the Fräulein . And now this cameraman . As you say , it is too bad . Dear old friend are you implying that I have done something to harm them ? That 's the trouble with an old friend . He can always tell when you 're lying . What a wonderful commandant you would have made . Always suspecting people . Prying , asking questions . You really want to know what became of Shuter ? And the other two . What can I do ? You force me to satisfy this inordinate curiosity of yours . It would be a welcome change . You really wish to know where my scientific aspirations have led me ? - Yes . I have the greatest impatience . - Gottfried . I will satisfy your desires . Someone to confide in . I will share my secret with you . It may take great courage to face him , my friend . I have a stout heart . You will need it . Victor . Act pleasant . - Can I trust you , I wonder ? - You have trusted me this far . So I have . All right . Stay where you are . Gottfried . Gottfried . There 's gotta be something down here . I told you we 'd find something if we looked long enough . Come on . I 'm gonna take this to Inspector Raab . Stick around and take care of Carolyn . Good evening . Good evening , Fräulein . Good evening , baron . Excuse me , I was just on my way up to bed . Where is Mr. Row ? Upstairs . He 's working . He 'll work himself to death one of these days . - He hates being bothered , baron . - Oh , then I won 't disturb ... Oh , I see you 're interested in rare old books . Let me show you a real gem . A very old edition . The subject is anatomy . Look at that binding . It must be worth a fortune . You realize that ? Then you 're just the man who 'll appreciate my collection of rare old coins . Let me show them to you . Yes . There . You see that coin ? That is insured for $ 10,000 . See how it seems to gather the light and draw the eye . Yeah . I get great repose from these things of age and beauty . They soothe one . Seem to induce sleep . Sleep . Close your eyes , my friend . Sleep . Sleep . Sleep . Where is Row ? He went to the police . Now listen carefully . When the clock strikes the quarter you will knock on the Fräulein Carolyn 's door and tell her that Row has returned and is waiting for her downstairs here . You understand ? He 's waiting here . Good . Now , I will count three . At the count of three , you will wake up and remember nothing . One two three . Ten thousand dollars . - What do you know ? - Yes . Beautiful , isn 't it ? This castle is filled with rare old treasures . Feel free to browse , my friend . - Thank you very much . - A pleasant good evening to you . Good night . And I tell you , inspector , this is not all . You , August , tell the inspector what you told me . You got the only taxicab in town , is that right ? - Yeah . - Did you ever take this lady from the castle to the station ? - No , mein Herr . - How about this man ? No , mein Herr . And you . You hang around the station all the time . You see everybody that comes to and from town , is that right ? Did you ever see those two people before ? Only when they first came here . If they haven 't left , it stands to reason they 're still in the castle , doesn 't it ? - Yes . That 's a logical assumption . - Well , Frankenstein says they 're not . I 'll ask the baron for an explanation tomorrow . Inspector , do me a favor , ask him tonight . Will you , please ? - Who is it ? - Mike . Isn 't Row back yet ? He 's downstairs . I 'm so glad . He 's waiting for you . Row ? Row ? Ah ! All right , Shuter . Bring her down here . Baron . Baron ! Baron ! Shuter . Shuter , down here . Baron Frankenstein . - Carolyn . - Shuter . - Do as I tell you . Bring her down here . - Shuter ? Shuter . Upstairs , Shuter . - Shuter ! Down here , Shuter . - Bring her down here . - Upstairs , Shuter . Carolyn ! Up there . Come on . Carolyn . Down here , Shuter . Bring her down here . - Carolyn ? Shuter , no . No . Shuter , upstairs . Upstairs , Shuter . Upstairs , Shuter . Upstairs . Baron . Upstairs . Baron . Upstairs . Carolyn . Row . Row , down here in the vault ! Row ! Row , down here . Down here in the vault . Row ! Shutter . Shuter , go back . Go back , I tell you . You 'll be destroyed . Shuter ! The radiation will kill you . Go back , I say . Back ! Shuter , no . No . No . Back . No . Go back . It 's all right to enter , mein Herr . I made you in my image so the name of Frankenstein could survive . I gave you eyes , ears , a heart , a brain ...

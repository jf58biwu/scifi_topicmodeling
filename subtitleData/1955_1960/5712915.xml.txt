THOUGH I 'D HATE TO HAVE MY GIRL SEE ME . [ CHUCKLES ] PETE , YOU 'RE THE END . OH , THANK YOU , MY BOY . HE 'S THE GREATEST . BOY , YOU 'LL GET NO ARGUMENT FROM ME THERE . I SCARE MYSELF . HEY , THIS IS AS CRAZY AS THE FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER YOU MADE OUT OF TONY . ALWAYS THE MASTER 'S TOUCH . YOU KNOW , I THINK I 'LL BE AFRAID TO SEE MYSELF , EVEN ON THE SCREEN . OH , YOU 'LL GET USED TO IT , LARRY . JUST REMEMBER THAT AN ARTIST MUST HAVE NO FEAR . WHY , A CREATION IS ALMOST A SACRED THING . ALL CREATIONS . THE GOOD LORD CREATED SAINTS , AND HE ALSO CREATED SINNERS . HE CREATED THE LAMB AND THE FAWN , BUT HE ALSO CREATED THE WOLF AND THE JACKAL . NOW , WHO CAN JUDGE WHICH IS THE MOST PRAISEWORTHY ? WELL , THAT 'S ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT . FOR 25 YEARS HE 'S BEEN THE MASTER . HE CREATED THEM ALL . AND IF I MAY SAY SO IN ALL DUE MODESTY , I REGARDED EACH ONE AS A CREATION , NO MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS . WELL , THANKS FOR TRYING TO CHEER ME UP , BUT JUST THE SAME , THIS SCARES ME . NOW , REMEMBER , MY BOY , I CREATED YOU SO THAT YOU COULD SCARE OTHERS . AS AN ACTOR , AS AN ARTIST , THAT 'S YOUR MISSION . LIVE UP TO IT . WELL , IT 'S TIME FOR US TO BE ON THE SET . WE MUSTN 'T KEEP THE DIRECTOR WAITING . THERE WE ARE . FINE . WELL , COME ON . HEY ! WHAT ABOUT HIM ? IN THE NEXT PICTURE AFTER WE CAPTURE THE SHIP ? I CLIMB ABOARD , I DRAW MY SWORD , AND THERE , STANDING AT THE HELM- - IT 'S NOT THE CAPTAIN- - BUT THE WEREWOLF . TERRIFIC , HUH ? AND WE 'LL GET OLD PETE TO DO THE MAKE-UP . NOT BAD , NOT BAD . BUT HOW DID A WOLF GET IN THE OCEAN ? HELLO , EVERYONE . [ MURMURING ] OUR FIRST STOP WILL BE ON STAGE 3 , WHERE THEY ARE NOW SHOOTING HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM . FOLKS , I THINK YOU 'RE IN LUCK . THE BIG SCENE OF THE PICTURE SHOOTS TODAY . NOW , IF YOU WILL ALL STAY TOGETHER AND FOLLOW ME ... BOY , WHEN PETE MAKES THEM UP , IT 'S FOR REAL . WELL , AT LEAST WE LOOK NORMAL . HA HA ! DON 'T WE , THOUGH ? [ BOTH LAUGH ] WELL , HERE HE IS , MARTIN . GREAT , PETE . JUST GREAT ! EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED . THIS IS AS GOOD AND FEROCIOUS AS YOUR FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER . WELL , THANK YOU . GET TONY OUT HERE . I WANT TO SEE HOW THESE 2 BEAUTIES LOOK TOGETHER . Martin : WEREWOLF , MEET FRANKENSTEIN . SHAKE HANDS AND COME OUT SNARLING . WELL , PETE , ALL I CAN SAY IS YOU GAVE BIRTH TO A FINE PAIR OF SONS . YOU CAN BE REALLY PROUD OF YOUR CREATION . WILL YOU BE NEEDING ME ? NO . YOU CAN REST ON YOUR LAURELS . IF I NEED YOU , I 'LL SEND FOR YOU . I 'LL BE IN MY MAKE-UP ROOM . GOOD . NOW , BOYS , LISTEN CAREFULLY . REMEMBER , THIS IS THE BIG SCENE OF THE PICTURE . THE AUDIENCE IS WAITING FOR THIS , WHERE FINALLY WEREWOLF MEETS FRANKENSTEIN . THEY HATE EACH OTHER . IT 'S A FIGHT TO THE DEATH . IT 'S THE BATTLE OF THE MONSTERS , AND IT MUST BE THE HIGH SPOT OF THE PICTURE . IT 'S GOT TO BE THE GREATEST FIGHT WE 'VE EVER HAD ON THE SCREEN . AND I 'VE GOT TO GET IT IN ONE TAKE . SO , LISTEN TO DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY . YOU 'LL COME IN FROM OUT THERE . NOW , YOU 'LL COME IN FROM HERE . FAIRLY STEALTHILY ... VERY CUNNING ... WITH ANIMAL INSTINCT , YOU WILL FEEL THAT THERE 'S AN ENEMY AROUND . YOU HEAR SOMETHING . YOU STOP . YOU LOOK AROUND . I WANT THIS TO BE REALLY CREEPY . YOU--YOU HAVEN 'T SEEN ANYTHING YET , BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU 'RE IN DANGER . SUDDENLY , FROM OVER THERE , BIG AS LIFE AND TWICE AS FRIGHTENING , COMES THE FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER . COME IN , SON . AS YOU MOVE TOWARDS EACH OTHER ... PUT EVERYTHING AWAY CAREFULLY . YES , PETE . YOU KNOW I ALWAYS DO . I WANT TO TAKE HOME SOME PICTURES OF THESE BOYS . I LIKE TO STUDY THEM . I MIGHT DECIDE TO MAKE MASKS FOR MY COLLECTION . YOU SHOULD , PETE . I THINK THIS TEENAGE WEREWOLF AND TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN ARE EASILY AMONG THE BEST THINGS YOU 'VE EVER DONE . YOU KNOW , ANOTHER REASON I WANT TO KEEP A SOUVENIR OF THIS PICTURE IS THAT I ENJOY WORKING WITH THESE TEENAGERS . THEY 'VE GOT SPIRIT , AND THEY COOPERATE . THEY DON 'T SOUR ON YOU LIKE SOME OF THE OLDER ACTORS . I REMEMBER THE TROUBLE I HAD WITH THAT OLD BARRY HORTON WHEN I DISFIGURED HIM . YEAH , THE PICTURE IN WHICH HE HAD THE CAR CRASH . HE WAS AFRAID HE 'D LOSE HIS WOMEN ADMIRERS . HEH HEH HEH ! A TRUCK WAS GOING TO RUN OVER HIM , AND HE WANTED TO COME UP WITHOUT A SCRATCH . HEH ! OH , BUT THESE TEENAGERS , THEY 'VE GOT SPIRIT AND CONFIDENCE . THEY PLUNGE INTO A ROLE . THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN YOUR HANDS . I ENJOY WORKING WITH THEM . BUT GENTLEMEN , IT 'S CUSTOMARY TO KNOCK . WE DON 'T HAVE TO . WE ARE THE GROUP THAT HAVE TAKEN OVER THIS STUDIO- - NBN ASSOCIATES . WE 'VE PERSONALLY TAKEN OVER THIS LOT , AND WE 'RE GOING TO RUN IT OUR WAY . MY NAME IS JOHN NIXON . THIS IS MR. JEFF CLAYTON . YES , OF COURSE , I READ ABOUT IT IN THE TRADE PAPERS . IT 'S CERTAINLY NICE TO MEET YOU , GENTLEMEN . MR. DUMOND , WE 'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME CHANGES AROUND HERE . WELL , YOU HAVE MY BEST WISHES . OH , WON 'T YOU SIT DOWN ? WELL , I 'M AFRAID THESE AREN 'T TOO COMFORTABLE , BUT PERHAPS THE NEW REGIME WILL PROVIDE BETTER CHAIRS FOR MY WORKSHOP . YOUR WORKSHOP ? THAT SORT OF BRINGS US TO THE POINT . WHAT POINT ? UH , MR. DUMOND , WE WON 'T BE NEEDING YOU AFTER YOU FINISH THIS PICTURE- - THE ONE YOU 'RE ON NOW . NOT NEED ME ? YES . MONSTERS ARE FINISHED . THEY 'RE COMING OUT OF YOUR EARS . SATURATION . A HORROR CYCLE IS OVER . PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR MUSIC . THEY WANT TO LAUGH . THEY WANT TO SEE PRETTY GIRLS . THERE 'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT , MONSTERS ARE FINI . I HEARD THAT 25 YEARS AGO WHEN I CREATED MY FIRST WEREWOLF . IT SAVED THE STUDIO FROM BANKRUPTCY . NOW , LOOK . I DIDN 'T COME HERE TO DISCUSS THIS THING OR TO ARGUE IT WITH YOU . THAT IS THE DECISION OF THE BIG BRASS . IT 'S MINE , TOO . YES , BUT ... WELL , IT 'S THE WRONG ONE , IF I MAY DISAGREE . WHY , EVEN PSYCHIATRISTS SAY THAT IN ALL THESE MONSTER PICTURES , THERE 'S NOT ONLY ENTERTAINMENT BUT , FOR SOME PEOPLE , THERAPY . WELL , YOU KNOW WE NEVER GET OVER OUR CHILDHOOD FEARS OF THE SINISTER- - THE TERRIFYING FACES WE SEE IN NIGHTMARES . WELL , THROUGH THESE PICTURES , WE CAN LIVE OUT OUR HIDDEN FEARS . IT HELPS . YOU LIVE THEM OUT , BUT NOT ON OUR PAYROLL . LIKE MR. NIXON SAYS , PEOPLE WANT TO SEE ESCAPE PICTURES NOWADAYS . MUSICALS , JOKES , PRETTY GIRLS . YES , BUT- - THE DECISION IS FINAL . NOW , INSTEAD OF GIVING YOU A COLD PINK SLIP , I CAME TO TELL YOU IN PERSON . IT 'S THE HUMAN WAY . IT CERTAINLY IS . AND WE 'LL ALLOW YOU A WEEK 'S SEVERANCE PAY . NO , THANK YOU . KEEP YOUR SEVERANCE PAY . I DON 'T WANT YOUR CHARITY . THIS LOT , THIS ROOM , HAS BEEN MY HOME FOR 25 YEARS ! NOW THAT YOU 'VE THROWN ME OUT , DON 'T TRY TO SOFTEN THE BLOW WITH A FEW CHEAP DOLLARS . I 'LL LEAVE WHEN THIS PICTURE IS FINISHED SHOOTING . OK , IF THAT 'S THE WAY YOU FEEL . YOU TURNED DOWN MONEY . MAYBE YOU 'VE BEEN LIVING TOO LONG WITH MONSTERS . SOMETIMES I FIND THEM BETTER COMPANY THAN HUMANS . PETE , WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ? I DON 'T KNOW YET . BUT ONE THING I DO KNOW FOR SURE- - THEY 'RE WRONG , AND I 'M RIGHT ! I 'D STAKE MY VERY LIFE ON THAT . AND BEFORE I LEAVE THIS LOT , I INTEND TO PROVE THAT I 'M RIGHT . WEREWOLF . FRANKENSTEIN . THEY WANT TO PUT AN END TO US . THEY SAY WE 'RE THROUGH . THERE 'S GRATITUDE . DON 'T THEY REALIZE THAT THE MONSTERS I CREATED , FROM MY FIRST PREHISTORIC MAN THROUGH THE SPACE MAN OF THE FUTURE ... WHY , ALL THESE PAID FOR THIS STUDIO- - MADE THE OWNERS RICH AND FAMOUS . AND NOW THEY SAY IT 'S OVER . BUT IT ISN 'T OVER . I 'LL DESTROY THIS STUDIO , SEE IT GO UP IN FLAMES BEFORE I- - NO . NO , I 'LL DESTROY THEM FIRST . AND I 'LL USE THE VERY MONSTERS THEY MOCKED TO BRING THEM TO AN END . Man : PETE ? HUH ? I HEARD VOICES . ONLY MINE . YOU WERE TALKING TO YOURSELF ? NOT ENTIRELY . I WAS REASSURING MY CHILDREN THAT I WON 'T LET THEM PERISH ... THAT I 'M GONNA STOP THESE MEN FROM DESTROYING US . BUT HOW ? I 'LL SHOW YOU . Pete : THOSE FOOLS . THEY THINK A MONSTER IS JUST PUT TOGETHER WITH GLUE , HAIR , PUTTY , FOAM RUBBER . THEY DON 'T REALIZE THAT A MONSTER , EVEN ON THE SCREEN , IS HUMAN AND MUST BE INFUSED WITH A SPIRIT BY HIS CREATOR . WHY , IF I DIDN 'T BELIEVE IN MY CREATIONS , THEY WOULDN 'T BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES . THAT 'S WHY THEY CAN THROW FEAR INTO THE HEARTS OF SPECTATORS . PETE , WHAT ARE YOU PUTTING INTO THAT ? I 'M BLENDING A NEW INGREDIENT FOR THE FOUNDATION CREAM . IT 'S MY OWN DISCOVERY . IF THEY KNEW HOW MANY LONG HOURS I EXPERIMENTED WITH DIFFERENT CHEMICAL AGENTS TO GET BETTER RESULTS ... DO YOU REMEMBER THE TIME I ACCIDENTALLY ADDED NOVOCAINE ? OF COURSE . JAMES DUNCAN , PREHISTORIC MAN . COULDN 'T REMEMBER HIS LINES . NO . NOT UNTIL I RELEASED HIM . WHEN I ORDERED HIM UNDER HYPNOSIS TO REMEMBER , HE DID . AND I 'LL DO THE SAME WITH THESE YOUNG MEN . AS I SEE FIT , I 'LL ORDER THEM WHAT TO REMEMBER AND WHAT TO FORGET . YOU MUSTN 'T TRY THAT . WHY NOT ? WHY , IT 'S DANGEROUS ! DANGEROUS ? WHY , WE 'RE FIGHTING FOR OUR LIVES . NOW ... THIS ENTERS INTO THE PORES AND PARALYZES THE WILL . IT 'LL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT CHEMICALLY AS A SURGICAL PRE-FRONTAL LOBOTOMY . IT BLOCKS THE NERVE SYNAPSES , MAKES THE SUBJECT PASSIVE , OBEDIENT TO MY WILL . WELL , ALL QUIET , EXCEPT FOR A LIGHT IN OLD PETE 'S MAKE-UP ROOM . WHEN HE 'S ON A JOB , HE PRACTICALLY LIVES HERE . YEAH , I KNOW . HE 'S MARRIED TO HIS CAREER . THAT 'S THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT MY WORK , BUT WHAT CHANCES DO I GET ? NOW , DON 'T KNOCK IT . YOU GOT A NICE , EASY JOB . THE ONLY HOODLUMS YOU RUN INTO ARE THE BIT PLAYERS . WE 'RE STRICTLY LAW AND ORDER MEN . NOTHING EVER HAPPENS ON THE LOTS TO SHIFT . THAT 'S WHAT I MEAN . JUST HIGH-CLASS WATCHMEN . LOOK , MONAHAN , YOU WANT ACTION ? JOIN THE COMMANDOS . NAH . WHAT DO YOU SAY , PETER ? SIT DOWN , MY BOY . A BUTCH AND A MASSAGE , PETE . WELL , I 'M GLAD TO SEE YOU 'RE IN A CHEERFUL MOOD . BOY , YOU 'RE NOT . YOU LOOK BUGGED . HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF SOMEONE PRONOUNCED A DEATH SENTENCE ? ARE YOU SERIOUS ? YEAH , YOU SHOULD BE , TOO . IT 'S NOT LONGER ANY SECRET . THE NEW OWNERS OF THE STUDIO HAVE DECREED NO MORE MONSTERS . MY JOB IS DONE . MY CAREER IS OVER . WELL , ACTUALLY , THAT 'S NOT TOO BAD FOR ME . I 'VE HAD MY DAYS OF GLORY AND TRIUMPH . I SUPPOSE I 'M AN OLD MAN WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO FACE THE END . BUT THIS ALSO MEANS THAT YOUR CAREER IS OVER , TOO . I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST--JUST A RUMOR . IT 'S AN ORDER . ONE ORDER CAN DESTROY BOTH OF US . TOUGH . I GUESS MY AGENT CAN GET ME ANOTHER PART . I DON 'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE YOU , MY BOY , BUT I KNOW THIS TOWN , THIS INDUSTRY . I 'VE GIVEN MY LIFE TO IT . THE FIRST QUESTION A CASTING DIRECTOR ASKS IS , " WHAT WAS YOUR LAST PART ? " WELL , IN YOUR CASE , THE ANSWER WOULD HAVE TO BE WEREWOLF IN WEREWOLF MEETS FRANKENSTEIN . YEAH . I CAN HEAR THE CASTING DIRECTOR AS IF HE WERE IN THIS VERY ROOM . " SORRY , NOTHING IN THIS PICTURE . " BUT SEE ME WHEN THE MONSTER CYCLE COMES AROUND AGAIN . " OH , I BEGIN TO READ YOU . DON 'T FORGET , LARRY- - THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN YOU , YOUR FANS , DON 'T KNOW YOUR REAL FACE . THE ONLY HOPE YOU HAVE FOR A FUTURE IS HERE . I GUESS YOU 'RE RIGHT , PETE . OH , I KNOW I 'M RIGHT . WELL , WHAT CAN WE DO ? I LIKE THAT QUESTION . AT LEAST YOU 'RE INTERESTED IN SAVING YOUR CAREER . I AM ! WELL ... IF YOU 'LL SORT OF PLACE YOURSELF IN MY HANDS , PERHAPS WE CAN MAKE THEM CHANGE THEIR MINDS . GO AHEAD , PETE . I 'M WITH YOU . LARRY , THIS FOUNDATION CREAM HAS A NEW FIRMING AGENT IN IT . SOMETHING THAT I PERFECTED . SO DON 'T WORRY IF YOU FEEL YOUR SKIN TIGHTENING . DON 'T WORRY IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL- - IT DOES FEEL KIND OF COOL . REMEMBER , MY BOY , IT 'S IN YOUR BEST INTERESTS . DO EXACTLY AS I INSTRUCT YOU . YOU WILL PLAY YOUR SCENE WELL TODAY . BUT AFTER YOU 'VE COMPLETED IT ... INSTEAD OF COMING BACK HERE ... THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO . [ BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING ] WELL , CONGRATULATIONS , BANKS . THE RUSHES ARE FINE . YOU WERE RIGHT . THIS MUSICAL IS GOING TO BE A BIG HIT . I LIKE THE WAY YOU 'RE HANDLING THIS PRODUCTION . THANKS , JOHN . EVERYTHING ON THE SET 'S COMING ALONG JUST GREAT . I 'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING . GOOD NIGHT . GOOD NIGHT . WELL , I MIGHT AS WELL SEE YESTERDAY 'S RUSHES ON THE WEREWOLF AND FRANKENSTEIN PICTURE . WITHOUT ME , IF YOU DON 'T MIND , JOHN . MAYBE YOU 'VE GOT A SECRET YEN FOR MONSTERS , BUT NOT ME . I THINK THEY SCARE YOU , AND YOU 'RE TOO CHICKEN TO ADMIT IT . SO YOU GUESSED MY SECRET , HUH ? WELL , IT 'S PART OF MY RESPONSIBILITY , SO I 'M GOING TO SEE THEM . WELL , HAVE YOURSELF A NIGHTMARE . ALL RIGHT , I 'M READY . YOU CAN RUN THE RUSHES ON PRODUCTION 204 . Man : SCENE 136 , TAKE 2 . Second Man : ACTION . [ GROWLING ] [ GRUNTING ] [ SNARLING ] [ GROWLING ] NOW , YOU 'RE SURE , MY BOY , NOBODY SAW YOU ? AND YOU DID EXACTLY AS I TOLD YOU ? AND YOU CAME BACK EXACTLY AS I SAID ? GOOD . YOU 'LL FORGET THIS AFTER I WAKE YOU UP . YOU WON 'T REMEMBER A THING AFTERWARDS . YOU- - PETE ? ARE YOU SURE THERE 'S NO DANGER OF US GETTING CAUGHT ? JUST WASH THESE . NOW WAKE UP , MY BOY . WAKE UP ! NOW , HERE HE IS , DOC . SEE WHAT YOU CAN GET . TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT ALL THIS . DON 'T LEAVE ANYTHING OUT . I ALREADY TOLD YOU . I RAN THE RUSHES FOR HIM ON 3 PICTURES . WHAT TIME ? BEGINNING AT ABOUT 8 : 00 . THAT 'S WHEN HE RESERVED THE ROOM . DID YOU SEE ANYTHING ? HEAR ANYTHING ? ALL I COULD SEE WAS ON THE SCREEN . ALL I COULD HEAR CAME FROM THE SOUNDTRACK . ESPECIALLY THE LAST ONE- - 2 MONSTERS BEATING EACH OTHER 'S BRAINS IN . AND THEN ? WHEN THE PICTURE WAS FINISHED , I PUT THE HOUSE LIGHTS UP . THEN I PUT THE FILM BACK IN THE CAN , AND I WENT HOME . MY WORK WAS DONE . THE COP ON THE GATE , RICHARDS , HE CHECKED ME OUT . OK , YOU CAN GO . HEY , DID YOU SEE THIS ? GLASS OF HIS WRIST WATCH IS CRACKED . IT STOPPED AT 8 : 34 . AND THAT FIXES THE TIME OF THE MURDER . WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT ? WELL , PENDING AUTOPSY FINDINGS , I WOULD SAY THAT HE WAS ATTACKED FROM BEHIND BY SOMEONE WITH FIENDISH STRENGTH . NECK IS BROKEN . AND THAT THE ATTACKER , LIKE AN ANIMAL , INFLICTED SHARP WOUNDS ON THE NECK . LOOKS LIKE FANGS TO ME . I 'D SAY THAT THE TIME OF DEATH AS FIXED BY THE TIME THE WATCH STOPPED IS REASONABLY ACCURATE . SO , WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO ? LOOK FOR A MONSTER ? YOU DON 'T HAVE TO GO VERY FAR . I THINK THAT THEY MAKE THEM TO ORDER RIGHT IN THIS STUDIO . WE 'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ACTORS . WE MEAN A REAL MONSTER . THE NEWS HOUNDS WILL HAVE A FIELD DAY . WHAT A WAY TO START OFF THE NEW REGIME . YOU 'VE GOT TO MOVE FAST ! WE 'LL DO THE BEST WE CAN . THE P.M. DIDN 'T HELP US VERY MUCH . ALL IT ESTABLISHED WAS THAT HE WAS STRANGLED AND HIS NECK WAS BROKEN . THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY A HUMAN . BUT HE WAS ALSO CLAWED AND BITTEN . THAT PART IS INHUMAN . I 'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR SPECULATIONS . I JUST WANT RESULTS . NIXON WAS MY FRIEND . YOU KNOW , IT 'S ONE THING WHEN AN EASTERN HOODLUM COMES OUT HERE TO CUT IN ON JUICY CALIFORNIA TERRITORY , AND THE LOCAL MOB TURNS HIM OUT . BUT WHEN AN EASTERN EXECUTIVE IS KILLED IN THE WEST , IN HIS OWN STUDIO ON HIS FIRST JOB , WELL ... MAYBE YOU CAN HELP US . I 'LL BE GLAD TO . ANY WAY AT ALL . DID HE HAVE ANY KNOWN ENEMIES ? NOT OUT HERE . HOW COULD HE ? AND CERTAINLY NOT ENEMIES . HE MAY HAVE HAD RIVALS FOR HIS JOB , BUT THEY WOULDN 'T RESORT TO MURDER . IN THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS , THE MORTALITY RATE IS FAST AND HIGH ENOUGH . YOU HAVE YOUR EYE ON A CERTAIN SPOT , ALL YOU NEED IS PATIENCE . WAIT A LITTLE BIT , YOU 'RE BOUND TO GET YOUR TURN . WELL , DID HE ANTAGONIZE ANYBODY OUT HERE ? NO , NOT IN THAT LETHAL WAY . NATURALLY , WE PINK-SLIPPED ABOUT 100 AT THE STUDIO . WE HAD TO . STILL CAMERAMEN , FLACKS , MAINTENANCE MEN , SECRETARIES , MAKE-UP DEPARTMENT . BUT THAT 'S NOT UNUSUAL WHEN A NEW REGIME MOVES IN AND TAKES OVER . AND YET IT THROWS AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF WORK . SOME OF THEM MAY NOT LIKE THE JOKE . IT 'S JUST ONE OF THE HAZARDS OF THE INDUSTRY . AND BESIDES , THEY 'LL ALL GET JOBS IMMEDIATELY . THEY 'LL BE ABSORBED BY TV . AND YOU DON 'T KNOW OF ANY ENEMIES HE HAD OUT HERE ? I 'D SAY HE HAD NONE . WELL , WE 'LL PUT EVERY MAN WE CAN ON THE CASE . JUST BEAR IN MIND THAT WE WANT THIS CLEARED UP AS BADLY AS YOU DO . A HOLLYWOOD MURDER IS OK ON THE SCREEN , BUT NOT IN THE STUDIO . [ DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ] WHAT IS IT , LARRY ? DON 'T YOU FEEL WELL ? I DON 'T- - I KIND OF BLACKED OUT . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . I START TO WEAVE , AND THEN I BLACK OUT . THIS IS SOMETHING NEW . NO , I JUST FEEL THIS WAY SINCE- - LOOK , MAYBE- - MAYBE YOU GAVE YOUR ALL TO THE PART OF THE WEREWOLF . NOW YOU DON 'T HAVE ANY STRENGTH LEFT . YOU MAY HAVE SOMETHING THERE . THE LAST SCENE I WAS IN , I- - I HAD TO TRY TO ESCAPE , TO GET AWAY FROM THE POLICE . ARLENE , I STILL FEEL AS IF I 'M RUNNING . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT I 'M RUNNING FROM , BUT- - BUT I AM RUNNING AWAY ! MAYBE THE REPORTERS AND POLICE UPSET YOU . NO , NO . THEY JUST LOOKED AROUND AND TOOK A FEW PICTURES . THEY BARELY SPOKE TO ME . ASKED ME HOW IT FEELS TO BE A MONSTER , THEN THEY TURNED AWAY . I HEARD THEM LAUGHING AT THE MAKE-UP , LIKE- - LIKE IT WAS SOMETHING TO SCARE KIDS . IT 'S THE SAME . I 'M STILL RUNNING , RUNNING , RUNNING- - COME ON , LARRY , RELAX . CALM YOURSELF . I GUESS IT 'S ONLY NATURAL , IF YOU WORK HARD , THAT YOU 'RE GONNA HAVE A LET DOWN . YEAH , I GUESS SO . [ DANCE MUSIC PLAYS ] YOU BETTER GET BACK IN , ARLENE , BEFORE THEY CHIP IN AND BUY ME A WHEELCHAIR . [ CHUCKLES ] [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] WORKING LATE AGAIN , HUH ? OH , WELL , I HAVE NO HOURS . NO CREATOR HAS . BESIDES , I GET MORE JOY AND SATISFACTION OUT OF MY WORK THAN WATCHING THE CLOCK . I KNOW YOU 'RE A BEAVER FOR WORK , BUT IT 'S ONLY HUMAN TO CALL IT A DAY ONCE IN A WHILE . NOT ME . THERE 'S NO REST FOR ME . YOU SHOULD , THOUGH . TAKE IT EASY , I MEAN . IT PUZZLES ME WHY YOU KNOCK YOURSELF OUT , ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU 'RE THROUGH HERE . THIS IS YOUR LAST JOB . SO YOU KNOW , TOO , HMM ? IT 'S ALL OVER THE LOT . BUT IT 'S NO DISGRACE . BELIEVE ME , YOU 'RE IN GOOD COMPANY . HALF THE OLD TERMERS GET PINK SLIPS . DID YOU ? NO , A COP DOESN 'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO BE A DRAG ON THE PAYROLL . BUT I MIGHT JUST FIRE MYSELF--UP . OH ? I NEVER KIDDED MYSELF THAT WALKING A WATCHMAN 'S ROUNDS WOULD MOVE ME TO THE TOP . NO , I GUESS NOT . TAKE MOST OF THESE STUDIO COPS . THEY 'RE RETIRED POLICEMEN LOOKING FOR A SOFT TOUCH . BUT NOT ME , THOUGH . I 'VE GOT DIFFERENT IDEAS . IF I WERE CHIEF OF POLICE AT THIS STUDIO , I 'D RUN IT REAL STRICT . NO ONE WOULD GET ON THIS LOT WITHOUT A PASS . AND I 'D PUT ON 2 NIGHT PATROLS . THAT NEW BOSS NIXON MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN KILLED IF MY SYSTEM HAD BEEN ENFORCED . WELL , IT 'S TOO BAD IT WASN 'T . BUT NOW I 'M HIP TO SOMETHING THAT MIGHT JUST PUT ME IN LINE FOR PROMOTION . OH , REALLY ? TAKE THAT NIXON KILLING , FOR INSTANCE . A MAN GETS STRANGLED JUST WATCHING THE RUSHES . I WASN 'T SATISFIED WITH THE WAY THE BIG BRASS HANDLED IT , SO I PUT SOME POINTERS OF MY OWN DOWN . GOT THEM RIGHT HERE IN MY LITTLE BLACK BOOK . LIKE A REAL DETECTIVE , HUH ? EXACTLY . LIKE I THINK IT WAS AN INSIDE JOB . SOMEONE WHO KNEW HIS WAY AROUND THE LOT . YOU SUSPECT ANYONE ? NO . BUT I CAN GIVE YOU ANOTHER FOR INSTANCE . LIKE YOU AND YOUR STOOGE DIDN 'T LEAVE THE STUDIO THE NIGHT BEFORE THE KILLING . WELL , I OFTEN SPEND THE NIGHT HERE , ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE A HEAVY MAKE-UP JOB . DO YOU REALIZE I 'VE GOT TO BE HERE AT 6 : 00 IN THE MORNING TO GET THE ACTOR READY FOR HIS FIRST SCENE OF THE DAY ? SO WHY BOTHER TO GO HOME ? YOU DON 'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING TO ME . YOU CAN TELL IT ALL TO CAPTAIN HANCOCK OF HOMICIDE . AND YOU CAN TELL HIM , FOR INSTANCE , THAT ON THE NIGHT OF THE KILLING , YOU AND RIVERO LEFT THE LOT AT 9 : 12 . GOT IT ALL DOWN HERE IN MY LITTLE BLACK BOOK . AND I FIGURE CAPTAIN HANCOCK TELLS THE NEW SET-UP , AND MAYBE I GET PROMOTED . YEAH , I 'VE GOT A FEW OTHER LITTLE THINGS WRITTEN DOWN FOR HIM , TOO . YES , BUT WHY BOTHER ? AFTER ALL , YOU 'VE ALREADY DONE ALL THEY EXPECT OF YOU . WHY STICK YOUR NECK OUT BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY ? THE SECURITY OF THIS LOT MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO ME . THIS STUDIO WILL BE HERE A LONG TIME . AND SOMEDAY I EXPECT TO BE ITS CHIEF OF POLICE . WELL , I LIKE A SHOW OF AMBITION , AND YOU 'VE REALLY GOT IT . I 'LL SEE YOU DOWNTOWN . RIVERO . COME HELP ME , QUICK . [ BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ] [ VOLUME INCREASES ] [ WHISTLING ] [ CONTINUES WHISTLING ] OH ! [ CRASHING ] [ BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ] WE 'RE GONNA CHECK OUT NOW . REMEMBER , NOT A WORD OUT OF YOU . JUST FOLLOW ME OUT OF THE STUDIO AND GET INTO THE CAR . [ SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ] WELL , PETE , YOU DON 'T GET OVERTIME FOR THIS , ALTHOUGH I BET YOU EARNED IT . UH , YES . WE ACCOMPLISHED QUITE A LOT , BUT WE ARE FAR FROM FINISHED . JUST A FEW HOURS REST , AND THEN BACK AGAIN . WELL , RICHARDS , NIGHT . NIGHT . [ SWING MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ] [ MUSIC STOPS ] HEY , MONAHAN ! HEY , MONAHAN ! MONAHAN ! AND HE MUST HAVE PUT UP A TERRIFIC BATTLE . SURE LOOKS LIKE IT . I 'M SURPRISED I DIDN 'T HEAR A THING . THIS MAKES NO SENSE . KILLING A WATCHMAN ON HIS ROUNDS . UNLESS HE SURPRISED THE MURDERER . SURPRISED HIM IN WHAT ? AS FAR AS WE KNOW , NOTHING WAS STOLEN . NO DRESSING ROOMS WERE BROKEN INTO . WHEN DID YOU BEGIN TO SUSPECT SOMETHING WAS WRONG ? WELL , I WAITED 15 , 20 MINUTES AFTER HE WAS DUE BACK , THEN BEGAN TO LOOK FOR HIM . I FIGURED MAYBE HE BROUGHT A LITTLE SNACK FROM HOME . HE USED TO TELL ME HIS WIFE WORRIED ABOUT HIS STOMACH . I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WENT TO EAT IT IN HIS CAR , BUT AFTER I CHECKED HIS ROUNDS- - ANYBODY COME IN LATE ? NO . ANYBODY LEAVE ? A COUPLE OF LATE SHIFT MAINTENANCE MEN , PETE , THE MAKEUP MAN WITH HIS ASSISTANT RIVERO . YOU BETTER GET THEIR STORY . YOU GOT AN ADDRESS FOR THEM ? THIS PETE AND HIS ASSISTANT ? WELL , NOT IN THE BOOTH . PAYROLL WILL HAVE IT . ANYWAY , PETE WILL BE BACK HERE IN A FEW HOURS TO MAKE UP THIS YOUNG ACTOR WHO 'S PLAYING FRANKENSTEIN 'S MONSTER . HOW EARLY ? OH , MAYBE 6 : 00 . BUT THIS PETE , HE 'S A HARMLESS OLD GUY . JUST THE SAME , GET HIS STORY . AND YOU 'RE SURE YOU DIDN 'T HEAR A THING ? NO , SIR . YOU SEE , I WAS HERE ALL THE TIME . RIGHT AT THIS TABLE , PREPARING THE FOUNDATION CREAM I USE IN MAKEUP . AND YOU HEARD NOTHING AND SAW NOTHING ? IF I HAD , I WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT .

I 'VE ALWAYS CONSIDERED YOU THE MASTER , AND I WAS THE ASSISTANT . AND LET 'S KEEP IT THAT WAY . A SILENT ASSISTANT . RIVERO , YOU AND I HAVE BEEN INVITED DOWNTOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS .

WELL , YOU 'RE MEETING ME NOW . GARY DROZ , THAT 'S MY NAME . I 'M LARRY 'S AGENT . LARRY , YOUR TEENAGE WEREWOLF . I SENT HIM FOR THE PART WITH THE PRODUCER , BUT THAT DOESN 'T MEAN I QUIT WORRYING ABOUT HIM . I NEVER FORGET A CLIENT , EVEN THOUGH I GET THEM WORK . GARY DROZ IS NOT A FLESH PEDDLER . GET IT ? I DON 'T QUITE UNDERSTAND . I 'M LIKE A FATHER TO MY KIDS . SOMETIMES I DON 'T EVEN TAKE THE 10 % TILL I GET ' EM A TERM CONTRACT . NOW , HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT ? VERY ADMIRABLE , BUT I DON 'T SEE HOW IT CONCERNS ME . ALL RIGHT , I 'LL THROW YOU THE CONNECTION . YOU LEAVE MY BOY ALONE . DON 'T YOU TELL HIM THAT AFTER THIS PICTURE HE 'S FINISHED AND HE 'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER JOB . GETTING HIM WORK IS MY DEPARTMENT , AND LARRY 'S GOT A GREAT FUTURE AS AN ACTOR , AND I 'M GOING TO HELP HIM BUILD IT . AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION , I 'VE GOT 3 JOBS LINED UP FOR HIM RIGHT NOW , AND I DON 'T NEED TO HAVE A TRUCK RUN OVER HIS FACE TO GET HIM MORE WORK . DO YOU UNDERSTAND ? YES , OF COURSE , MR. DROZ , BUT , YOU SEE , I ONLY SUGGESTED THAT- - DON 'T SUGGEST . IN MY BOOK , YOU 'RE A NEGATIVE CHARACTER . I CAN GET LARRY A JOB ANY TIME I WANT TO . WHY , I COULD EVEN GET YOU A JOB- - AS A HEAVY , IF YOU 'LL JOIN THE UNION . WELL , THANKS FOR THE OFFER . YOU 'RE WELCOME FOR NOTHING . AND DON 'T FORGET WHAT I 'VE BEEN TELLING YOU . YOU LEAVE MY CLIENT ALONE ! I TELL YOU , PETE , SINCE THAT MANIAC 'S BEEN ON THE KILL , I 'VE HAD NO SLEEP . NIGHTS ON THE STUDIO GATE , DAYS OVER HERE . I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN , RICHARDS . IT 'S BEEN A HARDSHIP ON ALL OF US . SOMEBODY SURE HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST THOSE NEW EXECUTIVES . IT WOULD SEEM THAT WAY . BUT , AS YOU POINTED OUT , A MANIAC . WELL , A MANIAC REALLY NEEDS NO REASON FOR KILLING . MILLIE , WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMING DOWN HERE TO HELP US . NOW , IF YOU 'LL TRY TO GIVE US SOME KIND OF DESCRIPTION OF THIS MONSTER . WELL , CAPTAIN , THAT 'S AS CLOSE AS I CAN GET TO IT- - A MONSTER . HE LOOKED LIKE HE WALKED RIGHT OFF THE SCREEN ! BIG , HUGE MAN WITH ONE EYE OUT OF ITS SOCKET . OH , IT SURE WAS A NIGHTMARE . HE HIT ME AND KNOCKED ME DOWN . MUST HAVE HAD SOMETHING IN HIS HAND . THE BLOW WAS THAT HEAVY . ABOUT WHAT TIME WAS IT ? WELL , I DON 'T KNOW TO THE MINUTE , BUT I WAS COMING FROM A PICTURE SHOW , AND I TOOK THE LAST BUS HOME TO WHERE I WORK , AND THAT WOULD MAKE IT , WITH WALKING 3 BLOCKS , ABOUT HALF PAST 12 : 00 . THANK YOU , MILLIE . WE 'LL PROBABLY WANT YOU TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THIS , UH , MONSTER FROM ANY SUSPECTS WE PICK UP . YOU MEAN I HAVE TO COME DOWN HERE AGAIN ? WELL , I 'M AFRAID SO . WELL ... YOU CALL ME , AND I 'LL COME . NO MAN LIKE THAT SHOULD BE ROAMING THE STREETS . YEAH , I 'LL COME . YOU CAN COME IN NOW , RICHARDS . SIT DOWN . NOW , LAST NIGHT , AS YOU KNOW , MR. CLAYTON WAS KILLED . BUT RIGHT NOW , WE WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO THE MONAHAN KILLING . YES , SIR ? ARE YOU SURE YOU 'RE NOT HOLDING OUT ANYTHING ON US ? WHY , NO . WELL , YOU YOURSELF SAID IT WAS STRANGE THAT YOU DIDN 'T HEAR ANYTHING . NOW , WE 'VE BEEN CHEWING THAT OVER . EXACTLY WHERE WERE YOU WHEN IT HAPPENED ? WELL , IN MY BOOTH AT THE GATE . HOW FAR IS THAT FROM THE COMMISSARY ? ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE AS 2 CITY BLOCKS . AND YOU MEAN TO SAY WITH ALL THAT CROCKERY TOSSED AROUND AND SMASHED IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT , YOU DIDN 'T HEAR A THING ? YOU THINK IF I HAD , I WOULDN 'T HAVE RUN TO HELP MONAHAN ? HE WAS MY PARTNER ! FOR YEARS WE TEAMED TOGETHER . HE WAS YOUNGER THAN ME , BUT WE GOT ALONG SWELL . WE 'RE NOT ACCUSING YOU OF ANY DERELICTION OF DUTY . WE 'RE JUST TRYING TO GET A CLEAR PICTURE , THAT 'S ALL . WELL , I DID HAVE THE RADIO ON . LOUD ? YES , QUITE LOUD . IT ISN 'T THAT I 'M DEAF OR ANYTHING . I JUST HAPPEN TO LIKE LOUD MUSIC . HOW WAS I TO KNOW THERE WAS A KILLER LOOSE ? IT 'S NO CRIME TO LISTEN TO THE RADIO . NO , NO . I GUESS NOT . WELL , THINK OF THE MAINTENANCE MEN , THE GRIPS , THE GAFFERS , EVEN THE SECRETARIES . THINK HARD ABOUT EVERYBODY THAT PASSES YOUR BOOTH IN AND OUT . AMONG ALL THOSE , ANY SOREHEADS ? ANYBODY WITH A GRUDGE ? NO , THE LOT WAS RUN LIKE A HAPPY FAMILY . WHY , IN MY 10 YEARS THERE , NOT A BEEF , NOT A GRIPE . JUST FRIENDLY HELLOS AND GOOD-BYES . WHY , EVEN AT THE PARTIES ON THE SET- - YOU KNOW , THE USUAL SHINDIG AFTER A PICTURE 'S FINISHED SHOOTING ? A FEW DRINKS , SOME EATS , LAUGHS . A LOT OF LAUGHS . JUST ONE HAPPY FAMILY . YEAH , WELL , IT 'S NOT HAPPY NOW . NOW , YOU GO BACK TO THE LOT . TURN THE RADIO OFF . KEEP AN EXTRA EYE OPEN ALL THE TIME . IF YOU SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING- - IF YOU SUDDENLY REMEMBER ANYTHING- - ANY SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS YOU SEE HANGING AROUND THE GATE , ANYONE WHO TRIES TO SNEAK PAST YOU , CALL US . I WILL . YOU BET I WILL ! THANK YOU . ALL RIGHT , GENTLEMEN . I 'M CAPTAIN HANCOCK . HOW DO YOU DO ? I THINK YOU 'VE MET DETECTIVE JONES . THIS IS DETECTIVE THOMPSON . HELLO . HELLO . PETE , I 'LL TELL YOU WHY WE ASKED YOU AND YOUR ASSISTANT TO COME DOWN HERE . A LITTLE WHILE AGO , WE QUESTIONED THE MAID , WHO WAS KNOCKED DOWN BY A MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE MURDERED CLAYTON . THE TIME AND THE STREET CHECK OUT . WELL , THEN YOU HAVE A CLUE , A SUSPECT . NO , NO . ONLY THIS . SHE CLAIMED HER ASSAILANT WAS A MONSTER . WELL , I SUPPOSE ANY VICTIM OF ANY ASSAULT WOULD GET DELUSIONS ABOUT AN ATTACKER . NO , SHE WAS QUITE SPECIFIC . SHE HAD A GOOD LOOK AT HIM . SHE CLAIMED HE WAS HUGE , BIG ARMS AND SHOULDERS , HAD ONE EYE OUT OF ITS SOCKET . SOUNDS RATHER AS IF SHE HAD HALLUCINATIONS . OF COURSE , SINCE SHE WAS HYSTERICAL , I CAN UNDERSTAND . NO , SHE WAS QUITE SURE OF HER DESCRIPTION . I BUY HER STORY . SHE MADE SENSE TO ME . WELL , GENTLEMEN , WHAT 'S EXPECTED OF ME ? ER , OF US ? WELL , WE WANT YOUR VIEWS ON IT . YOU 'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AN EXPERT . OH , I AM AN EXPERT . WELL , IN THAT CASE , DO YOU THINK THAT , UM ... SOME CRACKPOT , AFTER SEEING SOME OF YOUR MONSTERS IN A PICTURE , I MEAN- - THEY 'RE PLAYING ALL OVER TOWN . NOW , DO YOU THINK A WEIRDY LIKE THAT COULD HAVE TRICKED HIMSELF OUT IN IMITATION AND GOT CARRIED AWAY ? NOW , HOW CAN I PUT MYSELF IN THE POSITION OF WHAT YOU CALL A WEIRDY ? WHY , ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE . BUT IN AN AMATEUR , THE RESULTS WOULD BE CRUDE . IT DOESN 'T TAKE THE FINISHED PRODUCT TO COMMIT A MURDER . I 'M NO AUTHORITY ON MURDER . THAT 'S YOUR DEPARTMENT . AS FOR ME , MY JOB IS TO TAKE AN ACTOR AND TRANSFORM HIM INTO WHATEVER OFF-BEAT APPEARANCE THE PART CALLS FOR . YES , I CREATE A MONSTER , BUT I DON 'T BUILD IN VIOLENCE . WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ALL THIS ? WHY , NOTHING . I DIDN 'T DO ANYTHING . YOU HAVE AN OPINION , DON 'T YOU ? RIVERO WOULDN 'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT . LET HIM SPEAK FOR HIMSELF . HOW LONG YOU WORKED FOR PETE ? ABOUT 25 YEARS . WELL , YOU CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE LEARNED THE TRICKS OF THE TRADE BY NOW THEN . ALL I KNOW IS I 'VE BEEN A GOOD ASSISTANT . BUT IF YOU WANTED , COULDN 'T YOU MAKE SOMEBODY UP TO FRIGHTEN PEOPLE ? HE TOLD YOU HE WAS ONLY MY ASSISTANT . YOU SHUT UP AND LET HIM TALK FOR HIMSELF ! SURE , HE 'S YOUR ASSISTANT . WE KNOW THAT . HOW FAR DOES HIS ASSISTANCE GO ? NOW , WHO DO YOU LIVE WITH ? I LIVE ALONE . WHERE ? OFF CRENSHAW . 1564 SORENTO STREET . YOU EVER BEEN MARRIED ? NO , SIR . HAVEN 'T YOU GOT ANY NEPHEWS ? COUSINS ? OR MAYBE SOME OF THE NEIGHBOR 'S KIDS ASKED YOU TO MAKE THEM UP JUST FOR A PRANK , AND THEN MAYBE YOU DIDN 'T TELL YOUR BOSS , BUT ON YOUR OWN , BECAUSE MAYBE YOU THINK YOU 'RE JUST AS GOOD AN ARTIST AS HE IS , YOU TURN LOOSE A MONSTER ! WELL ? ! WELL , TELL ME ! DID YOU ? NO ! I ONLY DO WHAT PETE TELLS ME . I 'M A GOOD ASSISTANT . ASK HIM . ASK HIM ! WHY DON 'T YOU STOP ALL THIS- - YOU 'VE GONE FAR ENOUGH . JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO SUSPECT IS NO REASON TO BULLY HIM . THEN WHY AREN 'T YOU MORE COOPERATIVE ? NOW , LOOK . WE KNOW YOU LIVE IN A WORLD OF MAKE-BELIEVE . ALL RIGHT . COME OUT OF IT . LOOK WHAT WE 'RE UP AGAINST . 3 SHOCKING MURDERS COMMITTED . 2 OF THEM AT YOUR STUDIO WHILE YOU WERE THERE . WE WEREN 'T THE ONLY ONES . WE 'RE QUESTIONING EVERYBODY . I 'M SURE YOU GENTLEMEN CAN SOLVE THOSE MURDERS WITHOUT US . I WISH IT WAS POSSIBLE TO REALLY HELP YOU- - WELL , THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO . THINK BACK . ALL THE ACTORS YOU 'VE MADE UP IN OTHER PICTURES . THINK OF HOW THEY TALK , WHAT THEY SAID TO YOU . AFTER ALL , YOU WERE CLOSE TO THEM . DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THESE , FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER , MIGHT GO BERSERK ? I 'M SORRY . OFFHAND , I CAN 'T RECALL A SINGLE ONE . THANKS TO OUR MAKEUP JOB , THEY MAY HAVE LOOKED LIKE KILLERS , BUT UNDER THE GREASEPAINT AND PUTTY , THEY WERE ONLY ACTORS PERFORMING A ROLE . NOW , ARE WE EXCUSED ? YEAH , I BELIEVE SO . I CAN GO , TOO ? WE 'LL GET BACK TO YOU LATER . AS I SAID , ANY WAY WE CAN , WE 'LL BE PLEASED TO COOPERATE . THERE 'S SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT THAT OLD COOT . AND HIS ASSISTANT RIVERO . MAYBE THAT 'S WHAT COMES FROM SPENDING ALL YOUR LIFE WITH MONSTERS . I DON 'T LIKE THE WAY HE 'S UNDER THE THUMB OF HIS BOSS . YOU CERTAINLY TRIED TO SHAKE HIM LOOSE . WERE YOU REALLY AIMING AT SOMETHING ? POT SHOTS . POT SHOTS . I HAD HOPED THEY WOULD GIVE US SOMETHING TANGIBLE TO GO ON , BUT I DOUBT IT . THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT MAKE-BELIEVE MONSTERS THAN THEY DO ABOUT KILLERS . GET A GRIP ON YOURSELF . YOU COLLAPSED LIKE A SICK CALF . THE INTERVIEW IS OVER . WE 'VE BEEN QUESTIONED . THE POLICE ARE THROUGH WITH US . I 'M NOT SO SURE OF THAT . I DIDN 'T LIKE THE WAY THEY LOOKED AT US OR THE WAY THEY DIG AT YOU , AND THE WAY THAT BIG FELLA SAID , " I 'LL GET BACK TO YOU LATER . " THAT 'S ROUTINE STUFF WITH ALL POLICE UNTIL A MURDER IS SOLVED , UNTIL THE CASE IS CLOSED . WELL ? WELL , WHAT ? I 'M IN NO MOOD FOR RIDDLES . WHAT ? DO YOU THINK THIS CASE WILL BE SOLVED ? WELL , IT NEARLY WAS WITH YOUR HELP . IF I HADN 'T STOPPED THE DETECTIVE FROM QUESTIONING YOU , YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING . YOU CERTAINLY WERE ON THE VERGE . YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN YOUR FACE . YOU WERE READY TO CRACK , SPLIT WIDE OPEN AND SPILL EVERYTHING , WEREN 'T YOU ? NO , NO . I 'D NEVER GIVE YOU AWAY , ONLY- - ONLY WHAT ? WELL , WHEN THEY PRESSED ME TO THE WALL- - IS THE TIME TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT ! WHY DID YOU SAY , " I DO ONLY WHAT PETE TELLS ME " ? WHY ? WELL , IT 'S TRUE , ISN 'T IT ? I DO WHAT YOU TELL ME . NOT WHEN YOU SAY IT IN THAT SNIVELING VOICE , AND DEFINITELY NOT WHEN YOU TELL IT TO THE POLICE ! IT 'S AS IF YOU ALREADY HAD IT IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND TO BETRAY ME AND SAVE YOURSELF . NO , NO , PETE . I 'D NEVER DO THAT . I 'D NEVER BETRAY YOU . I SWEAR I 'D NEVER DO THAT . WELL , YOU STAY THAT WAY , AND I 'LL PROTECT YOU . ANYWAY , TIME 'S ON OUR SIDE . THE PICTURE 'S FINISHED , AND OUR WORK IS DONE . IT 'S DONE , ALL RIGHT . BUT THERE 'S STILL THE 2 BOYS , LARRY AND TONY . WHAT ABOUT THEM ? WELL , DON 'T YOU THINK THE POLICE WILL GET TO THEM ? AND IF THEY 'RE QUESTIONED- - RIVERO , THOSE BOYS ARE STILL UNDER MY CONTROL . YOU 'LL SEE . THEY 'LL BE WAITING FOR ME AT THE STUDIO . NOW CALM YOURSELF . TAKE AFTER ME . SEE ? I 'M NOT THE LEAST BIT WORRIED . I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU . AND I 'LL MAKE SURE THE BOYS REMAIN UNDER MY CONTROL . HMM ? NOW GET IN THERE . [ CAR ENGINE STARTS ] SAY , I THINK WE 'VE GOT SOMETHING IN THE CLAYTON CASE . YEAH , WHAT ? WELL , WE ANALYZED THE SCRAPINGS FROM UNDER CLAYTON 'S FINGERNAILS . WHAT DID YOU FIND ? GREASEPAINT AND PUTTY . YOU MEAN THE KILLER WORE MAKEUP ? WELL , HE MUST HAVE . WE 'VE ALREADY CHECKED THIS AGAINST THE TRADE PRODUCT PUT OUT BY MAKEUP COMPANIES , AND OUR FIRST FINDINGS ARE THAT THE PIGMENT AND COSMETIC BASE USED IN THE SAMPLE WE ANALYZED WAS SPECIAL . LIKE , HOMEMADE . INSTEAD OF LINSEED OIL , A BLEND . ANYWAY , WE 'LL HAVE TO CHECK SUPPLIERS FOR BEAUTY PARLORS AND STUDIOS- - THAT CAN WAIT . THERE 'S ONE STUDIO WE 'RE GOING TO CHECK ON NOW , AND YOU 'RE COMING ALONG WITH US . GET YOUR EQUIPMENT READY . WE MAY WANT TO MAKE A SPOT ANALYSIS . HEH ! YOU SEE , RIVERO ? THEY DIDN 'T EVEN GIVE ME THE COURTESY OF LETTING ME PACK MY OWN THINGS . OH , SORRY , BOYS . WE WERE A LITTLE DELAYED . I HOPE YOU HAVEN 'T BEEN WAITING LONG . WELL , NO , PETE . YOU ASKED US TO MEET YOU , AND , WELL , WE DID WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE . WELL , OF COURSE , BUT ... NOT HERE . I 'D LIKE YOU BOYS TO COME TO MY HOUSE . WE 'LL HAVE A LITTLE FOOD . A LITTLE CELEBRATION . AFTER ALL , THIS IS NO WAY TO END A FRIENDSHIP . WELL , UH , SURE , PETE , BUT ... LOOK , YOU DON 'T MIND IF WE DON 'T STAY TOO LONG ? WE BOTH HAVE DATES . FINE . NOW , HOW ABOUT YOU BOYS HELPING RIVERO LOAD THE CAR ? OH , SURE , PETE . WE 'LL HELP . YOU GO AHEAD , WAIT FOR ME IN THE CAR . I 'LL JUST GATHER UP THE LAST OF MY STUFF , AND WE 'LL BE OFF IN A JIFFY . OK . HI , PETE . OH . OH , IT 'S NICE OF YOU TO DROP IN . I 'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A FILM EDITOR . I HEARD YOU WERE CHECKING OFF THE LOT TODAY , AND I WANTED TO SAY SO LONG . THANKS . AFTER 25 YEARS , I 'M THROUGH . THIS PLACE HAS MANY MEMORIES FOR ME . TOO MANY . PETE , I HOPE WE GET TO WORK TOGETHER AGAIN . WELL , THANKS , I APPRECIATE YOUR SENTIMENTS , BUT I 'M FINISHED . HEH HEH ! YOU 'LL BE BACK . YOU 'LL BE BACK IN ALL YOUR GLORY . ONE PICTURE CAN DO IT . MAYBE ONE OF THOSE FOREIGN IMPORTS , AND THE WHOLE MONSTER CYCLE IS ON ITS WAY AGAIN , AND PRODUCERS WILL BE CLAMORING FOR THE OLD MAKEUP WIZARD . IT 'S NICE OF YOU TO SAY IT . WELL , GOOD LUCK , PETE . WELL , GOOD-BYE , PETE . GOOD-BYE , RIVERO . TAKE IT EASY . BYE , RICHARDS . OH , UH , RICHARDS ...

HAVE A SNORT ON OLD PETE . THANKS , PETE . BYE . IS PETE DUMOND THE MAKEUP MAN STILL HERE ? JUST CHECKED OFF THE LOT . I KNOW WHERE HIS MAKEUP ROOM IS . LET 'S GO THERE FIRST . IT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK EVERYTHING WITH HIM . YEAH , A CLEAN SWEEP . EXCEPT FOR THIS . LET 'S HAVE A LOOK . Pete : WELL , HERE WE ARE , BOYS . YOU CAN LEAVE THE BOXES THERE , BOYS . [ LOCK CLICKS ] Larry : AHEM . WELL , WHAT ARE THESE ? MY FAMILY . MY CHILDREN . I 'M DEVOTED TO THEM . I 'VE ARRANGED THEM HERE WITH GREAT CARE , AS YOU SEE . I SEE . YOU--YOU CALLED THEM YOUR CHILDREN ? WHY , YES . LATER I 'LL TELL YOU THEIR HISTORY- - HOW EACH ONE CAME ABOUT . BUT NOW LET 'S JUST LOOK AT THEM . THIS ROOM IS LIKE A CATHEDRAL TO ME . THIS IS WHERE I COME WHEN I NEED HELP FROM A SOURCE STRONGER THAN MYSELF . DON 'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE GETTING SOME REFRESHMENTS ? HMM ? OH , YES . YES , OF COURSE . I LOSE MYSELF HERE . AFTER ALL , I 'M YOUR HOST . MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME , BOYS . THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE 'S HAD GUESTS HERE . YOU YOUNG MEN SHOULD FEEL HONORED . WE DO . WE- - WE CERTAINLY DO . LOOK AROUND , BOYS . STUDY THESE HEADS . YOU 'LL RECOGNIZE SOME GREAT NAMES AMONG THEM . ARTISTS WHO , EVEN BEHIND THE MASK OF HORROR , ACHIEVED ETERNAL FAME . STUDY THEM CLOSELY . THEY 'LL BE AN INSPIRATION TO YOU . [ WHISPERS ] Larry ... I SAY WE CUT OUT . OH , MAN , YOU SAW . YOU HEARD . IF WE DON 'T DIG THE OLD MAN 'S COLLECTION , WE 'LL HURT HIS FEELINGS . IT GIVES ME THE CREEPS . YEAH , HE DOES , TOO . I WOULDN 'T HAVE COME , ONLY HE SAID IT WAS SOME KIND OF CELEBRATION- - A PARTY . YEAH . IT 'S A PARTY , ALL RIGHT . ALL THE GUESTS ARE STUFFED HEADS . AH , WE SHOULDN 'T HAVE COME , NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE PRESSURED . HE MAKES IT TOUGH TO REFUSE . I KNOW . YOU KNOW , OLD PETE 'S GOT WAYS ABOUT HIM- - I DON 'T KNOW , STRANGE WAYS . LIKE WHEN HE WAS MAKING ME UP FOR THE PICTURE , PUTTING ON THAT FOUNDATION CREAM . DID HE GIVE YOU A LOT OF STUFF ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD BE YOUR LAST JOB , AND THAT ENEMIES WOULD DRIVE YOU OUT OF THE BUSINESS , AND THAT ONLY HE COULD PROTECT YOU ? YEAH . YEAH , HE DID . HEY , I MEANT TO CHECK WITH YOU ABOUT THAT , ONLY I FORGOT . I--I DON 'T MEAN I FORGOT IN A CARELESS WAY . I ... JUST FORGOT . LIKE , WHEN HE FINISHED , EVERYTHING KIND OF LEFT ME . YOU KNOW , LIKE , WENT OUT OF MY HEAD . YEAH , ME , TOO . IT WAS ONLY SINCE THE LAST SCENE WAS SHOT- - HEY , TONY , TONY . LOOK , WHEN HE FINISHED , DID HE TELL YOU- - PETE , I NEVER CRITICIZE YOU . BUT ... I BELIEVE YOU MADE A MISTAKE IN BRINGING LARRY AND TONY HERE . WHY ? I DON 'T THINK THEY CAN BE TRUSTED . NONSENSE , NOT TRUST THESE BOYS . THEY 'VE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED QUITE FAVORABLY THAT THEY OBEY MY ORDERS . YOU KNOW I HAVE THEM UNDER CONTROL . BUT YOU WON 'T . NOW THAT THE PICTURE 'S FINISHED AND YOU HAVEN 'T HELPED THEIR CAREERS , YOUR CONTROL WILL WEAR OFF . AND THE POLICE ARE SURE TO TALK TO THEM . YES , QUITE POSSIBLE . AND WHEN THE POLICE BEGIN TO PRESSURE THEM , THEY 'RE BOUND TO CRACK . THAT 'S WHY I WANT TO LEAVE , TO VISIT MY BROTHER ON HIS RANCH IN ARIZONA . RIVERO , MY OLD FRIEND ... I SEE YOUR POINT . YOU WANT TO LEAVE ME TO FACE WHATEVER COMES ALONE . OH , NO , PETE . I JUST WANT TO GET AWAY FOR A FEW WEEK 'S REST . AND YOU DO THIS NOT BECAUSE OF DISLOYALTY TO ME , BUT BECAUSE YOU DON 'T TRUST LARRY AND TONY . NOW , ISN 'T THAT WHY YOU WANT TO LEAVE ? YES , THAT 'S IT . THESE YOUNG MEN ARE NOT STRONG THE WAY YOU ARE . NO , OF COURSE NOT . IF ONLY THEY HAD YOUR DEVOTION TO ME- - YOUR IRON NERVES . BUT THEY HAVEN 'T . WHAT A SOURCE OF STRENGTH AND COMFORT IT IS TO ME THAT I CAN BE SURE OF YOU . OF COURSE YOU CAN , PETE . AND SHOULD THE POLICE SPEAK TO YOU ALONE , YOU WOULDN 'T REVEAL A THING . NO , NOT A THING . EVEN IF THEY GAVE YOU A THIRD DEGREE , THEY COULDN 'T SQUEEZE THE TINIEST BIT OF CONFESSION FROM YOU , COULD THEY ? COURSE NOT . BUT THESE BOYS ... THEY 'LL CRACK . YES . YES , PETE .

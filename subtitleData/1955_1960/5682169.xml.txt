 Prepare to surface . Prepare to surface . - Depth : 58 feet . - Depth : 58 feet , sir . Sonar , any contacts topside ? No contact , sir . - Tank center , ready to surface , sir . - Very well . Vents shut . Ready to surface , sir . - Depth : 58 feet , sir . - Very well . Up periscope . Point lonsdale bearing , mark . 013 , sir . - Cape schanck bearing , mark . - 125 , sir . How 's the tide , Bob ? High tide , sir . Controls rigged for surfacing , sir . Surface . Surface , surface , surface . - Blow main ballast . - Main ballast blown . - Depth : 45 feet , sir . - Secure the air . Open main induction . Main induction open , sir . Our scientists disagree ... as to when radiation will reach Australia . The atomic war has ended , but the prime minister reports ... no proof of survival of human life anywhere except here . Navy department . Congratulations . Tea , dear . I said , " Tea , dear . " Got a bit of a burn yesterday at the beach after all . You 'd better put some calamine stuff on it . You did give Jennifer her bottle ? I laid out your white uniform . Was that right ? I almost forgot I have to dash . Peter ? Mm-hmm ? They must be giving you a ship of your own . No , darling . They don 't give ships to Lieutenants . Then why would it be Admiral Bridie himself ? If you were just to replace someone who 's ill or something , that wouldn 't mean seeing Admiral Bridie , would it ? I don 't know . You don 't quite know what to expect these days . I 'll pick up Jenny 's milk on the way home from the station . Why do you have to pick it up ? They just won 't be delivering it anymore , I understand . Oh . It 's a beautiful day , Peter . If I wheel Jennifer down to the club after lunch , could you meet me there for a swim ? Peter ? They just decided that yesterday . If you 're going to be in Melbourne by 11 : 00 , you 'd better hurry . So long , Charlie . Hosgood ? - Hosgood ! - Yes , sir ? Have you seen this from that idiot Attenborough , - that great correlator of statistics ? - Yes , sir . It 's finally seeped down to him that most of the oil in the world ... comes from the Northern hemisphere . Attenborough says so . It 's now official . We will carefully conserve the remaining supplies of petrol in the depot . Yes , sir . Hosgood ! Lieutenant Holmes is here , sir . Ah , yes . Come in , come in . Sit down . Sit down . Thanks , sir . I have an assignment for you . Do you care for some of this miserable muck that passes for coffee ? No , thank you , sir . It 's a reasonably important appointment , as things go these days . That 's getting to be quite a phrase , isn 't it ? " These days . " - You find yourself using it ? - Yes , sir . I 'm afraid I do . I 'm sorry it can 't be one of our own ships . It 's seagoing though and better than sitting around on your bottom . Liaison officer aboard the American submarine Sawfish . She just docked . Nuclear-powered , of course . - You know about her ? - Yes , sir . I read the report . She 's at our disposal for a cruise : Reconnaissance or whatever you care to call it . You 'll sail soon , but just when or where or for how long I can 't tell you , not until the government and a pack of these longhaired scientists sort themselves out . She 's moored across the dock from the carrier Melbourne in Williamstown . You 'll report to the Captain , Towers . That will be all , Holmes . Sir , would it be possible to discuss the duration of this appointment ? No . But I can give you a review in four months . Thanks very much , sir , because I 'd like to be home if possible when ... Is there any official estimate as to how much longer ? The beaker-heads , the finger-in-the-wind boys say , calculating the rate of drift or what have you ... About five months before it gets here . That 's why I say four for review . There 's transport leaving for Williamstown , if you care to take that . Yes , sir . Hosgood , where is this coffee coming from ? Supply says it 's the best they can do these days , sir . Shall I query them again ? No , no , no . It doesn 't matter . You have anything important to do , Hosgood ? No , sir . What is it ? Oh , nothing . I just thought you might like to take yourself off till Monday . A fine weekend . Boyfriend or whatever . No , I ... I guess not . I 'll be here , sir . All watches of seamen fall in on the cabledeck . Rob ... Lieutenant Holmes will be coming aboard ... Monday and off and on until we sail . - Have Benson issue him what clothing he 'll need . - Yes , sir . - I 'll see you Monday , Lieutenant . - Thanks . It 's funny . Somehow I get the feeling ... - they 're putting her in moth balls . - Sir ? I 'm afraid I 'll have to bunk you with this scientist fellow ... who 's coming aboard from the C.S.I.R. Sorry . I don 't know who he 'll be just yet . That 's all right , sir . I 'll manage . Care for a drink before lunch ? Yes , sir , if it 's all right . It 's Australian country in the flattop ... I 'll have to stick to coke . You have whatever you like . I 'm a bit puzzled about this cruise , sir . Our destination , I mean . Admiral Bridie seems ... a bit indefinite . Of course , if there 's some reason I shouldn 't know ... No , there 's no reason why you shouldn 't know . But outside of the fact that it 's reconnaissance , I don 't know any more about it than you do . Of course , the crew has it all down pat . We 're sailing the end of next week . We 're going north , and we 'll be back in two months . But I 'll let you know as soon as I hear anything more official . Do you live in Melbourne ? Just outside , actually , in Frankston . That 's three-quarters of an hour by electric train . You make out all right ? Any serious shortages yet ? Yes , a few . Petrol mainly , but we manage . Say , uh ... I 've been sticking pretty close here lately . Think I 'm due for some shore food . You know of a place where we might get a good steak ? Yes , I suppose so . The Admiral fixed me up with a temporary card ... for something called the Pastoral club . What 's that like ? It 's a mahogany-and-polished-brass place . Some people used to claim it was the stuffiest club in the Commonwealth . I suppose there 's no argument about that now . Would they have any Scotch left ? Yes , if anyone does . My wife 's uncle lives there ; mostly at the bar these days , I understand . I would think they would have some Scotch , yes . Sounds good . Let 's give it a try . I 'll be with you in five minutes . Sometimes I think that child could float a battleship . That 's what I told the Admiral . Peter , how could you ? I don 't know , really . I just held the towel like this and ... Very funny . You 're starting to get your figure back , aren 't you , Charlie ? You know , after Jennifer and all . A little here , a little there . By the way , I invited Captain Towers for the weekend . - Oh , Peter , you didn 't . - I had to , really . We had lunch together , and he started asking questions about how we live and all . Mary , I would have looked an awful clod not to have asked him . - He 'll be all right , I think . - Was he married , do you know ? - Two kids . - And they 're gone ? Yes , they were in America . Nappies flying in the breeze , pablum everywhere . They 're bound to remind him . We 'll just try to get them out of sight , that 's all . He 'll get sodden and weep . I can 't stand that again . He doesn 't look the type to me . Your R.A.F. Chum didn 't either . Now , Mary ... What are we going to do with him for two days ? For one thing , I thought a party on Saturday night . Ten or twelve people . We haven 't done that for a while . Would you like that ? Well , as long as they all understand how I feel about those morbid discussions . We would have to get someone for him , though . What about Moira ? Why not ? If she 's sober this weekend . Julian said she 'd given it up . No , darling , you didn 't listen . Julian said she 'd given up gin ... for brandy . She says she can drink more brandy . Moira 's not a bad notion , in point of fact . She 'd keep him occupied , at least . But she 'd have to stop over , and we can 't just put him on a cot . Put Moira on a cot on the veranda . She claims she 's not slept in her own bed the last three months anyway . That 's not entirely fair . It 's all on the surface . I 'll ring her up tonight and give her the drill . I wonder what he 's like when he gets a skinful ? - Peter ... - What ? - You do understand how I feel about people talking ? - Sure . - And you do love me ? - Of course I do . Then why don 't you ever say so ? Give her what for , mate . You 're looking for me . Am I ? I 'm Moira Davidson . M-O-I-R-A . It was a very fashionable name in bad novels when my mother was young and impressionable . I 'm a throwback . - Where 's Holmes ? - Oh , he 's decking the halls with Holly . - He sent me for better or worse . - Better , I 'd say . I 'm your date or whatever you call it . How 'd you recognize me ? I love Americans . They 're so naive . This way , Commander . A new model . Only one horsepower . But she does a good eight miles an hour on the flat . - Quite a buggy . - Over 70 years old . - Dad said she was made in America . - I wouldn 't be surprised . Give me your toothbrush . Take Amelia 's head while I see if we can get us out of here . She 's still a wee bit sticky in reverse . All right , boy . Here we go . Is there a place we might stop where I could get a little breakfast ? - What ? - " A little breakfast . " Do you mean that in addition to everything else , I have to watch you eat bacon and eggs and all that muck ? I was on a party last night , and I got up at 8 : 00 in the morning to meet you . - I , uh ... - Oh , never mind . Hop in . But you have to buy me a couple drinks to get me started . Oh , incidentally , they didn 't tell me what to call you . - What 's the protocol ? - My name is Towers , Dwight Lionel Towers . Really ? - Really . - Hang on , Dwight Lionel . As a matter of fact , we 've only been in port for three days . - It 's called the Sawfish . - My second husband was an American . We traveled all over the world , and everywhere we went he would say to people , " I am an American . I am an American . " They finally shot him in one of those eastern countries . Oh . Well , I 'm sorry . I was too . He was such a nice man while he lasted . Is he yours , Moira ? Oh , on loan . Oh . Well ... toodle . Toodle . He just drinks and drinks and nothing happens . - At least he hasn 't burst into tears . - Keep up the good work . Amen ! That 's sheer balderdash ! I never heard so much nonsense in my life . You mean to tell me , this whole war was an accident ? No , it wasn 't an accident . I didn 't say that . It was carefully planned , down to the tiniest mechanical and emotional detail . But it was a mistake , it was a beaut . In the end , somehow granted the time for examination , we shall find that our so-called civilization was gloriously destroyed ... by a handful of vacuum tubes and transistors . - Probably faulty . - There you are , Julian . Now we know where the blame lies . Oh , no , you don 't . No . No . Maybe we were the blind mechanics of disaster , but you don 't pin the guilt on the scientists that easily . You might as well pin it on ... motherhood . It should be pinned on somebody . You scientists are the likely ones as far as I can see . You built the bomb . You experimented with it , tested it and exploded it . - Just a moment , Morgan . - Thanks to you chaps , a moment is about all we have . Every man who ever worked on this thing told you what would happen . - The scientists signed petition after petition ... - Julian , please . But nobody listened . There was a choice . It was build the bombs and use them ... or risk the United States , the Soviet Union and the rest of us ... would find some way to go on living . That 's wishful thinking , if ever I heard it . I 'm not against wishful thinking , not now . They pushed us too far . They didn 't think we 'd fight , no matter what they did . And they were wrong . We fought . We expunged them ! We didn 't do such a bad job on ourselves . With the interesting result that the background level of radiation ... in this room is nine times what it was a year ago . - Julian . - Don 't you know that ? Nine times ! We 're all doomed , you know . The whole silly , drunken , pathetic lot of us . Doomed by the air we 're about to breathe . - We haven 't got a chance ! - Stop it ! I won 't have it , Julian ! I won 't . There is hope . There has to be hope . There 's always hope . We just can 't go on like this . We can 't . We ... We ... I shouldn 't drink , you know . I inevitably say something brilliant . Sorry . I ... I can 't help it , Peter . I 'm sorry . I just can 't . Everybody 's gone to bed . You like that ? Settles the stomach . I had a lot to drink . I had a lot to drink . Julian had a lot to drink . Julian and I are the town drunks . What are you trying to forget ? It 's a damn silly question if I ever heard one . Yeah , you 're right . It 's just an expression . You know ... somebody should have given me a copy ... of the local ground rules . I might have opened my big mouth . Danger struck from the wrong quarter . The people of the city watch the wrong mouse hole . Come again ? But then who would know you were so tough and drank straight milk ? Where are you from ? Which state ? I 'm from Idaho . Idaho ? I know better than that . There 's no navy in Idaho because it 's too hilly . Well , I was born in Idaho . I live in Connecticut now . Near New London , where I 'm based . Where were you during all the watchamacallit ? Oh , no . I didn 't mean to ask you that . Peter said not to . You don 't have to answer . I can 't decide if I 'm more objectionable drunk or sober . It 's perfectly all right . We were at sea ... between Kiska and Midway , when it began . We got orders to go to the West Pacific , and when we put our nose up north of Iwo Jima ... The air was filled with radioactive dust . So we ducked . Later on , took a look at Manila ... through the periscope . It was still too hot to surface , so we came down the coast of Australia ... And ended up here . There wasn 't much of anyplace else to go . You look married . Oh , I am . My wife 's name is Sharon . I have a couple of kids : Richard , eight ; Helen , five . Dick is the real sailor of the family . He is going to Annapolis . Oh , that 's to be expected . He 'll probably change his mind . Why is it taking so long ? Can you explain it to me ? Nobody can explain it to me . And don 't tell me about those damn winds again . How the Northern hemisphere and the Southern hemisphere ... get all mixed up and overlap . I don 't want to hear about that anymore . All I want to know is ... if everybody was so smart , why didn 't they know what would happen ? They did . Well , I ... I can 't take it . I ... Oh , yes , I can take it . But it 's unfair . It 's unfair because I didn 't do anything ... And nobody I know did anything . Maybe I 'm stupid . I had to take algebra twice . The only thing I could understand was geography . I like geography . You know what I always wanted to do ? I wanted to walk down the Rue de Rivoli . - Have you ever been to the Rue de Rivoli ? - Yes . I wanted to walk down the Rue de Rivoli , and I wanted to buy gloves . I know the French word for gloves ... - No , you 've got it all backwards . - What 's that ? I was supposed to comfort you , and you 're comforting me . I 'm crying . Everybody was so afraid that you might cry . - They were ? - Isn 't that funny ? No . Sometimes I do . - You better go to bed . - Mm-hmm . But you 're in my bedroom . Oh . Well ... I 'll clear out . Dwight . Even if you don 't like me , would you please hold onto me just for a moment longer ? This fellow Julian ... I take it that he 's English and here on some kind of scientific job . What 's he do , exactly ? I think professor Jorgenson should outline his plan before we make a decision . Simply stated , our view , our strong opinion , is this : During the last winter in the Northern hemisphere , rain and snow may have washed the air , so to speak , causing the radioactive elements to fall to the ground more quickly than anticipated . But the transfer of radioactivity to us would be progressively decreased , and human life could go on here or , at least , in Antarctica ... That 's clear enough , professor Jorgenson . It 's a hope . We agree and the government agrees that it 's worth trying to find out , anyhow . How far north could a vessel proceed ? Our recommendation is that the submarine should go ... as far north in the Pacific as possible , to point barrow , and make the necessary radioactivity readings . The prime minister 's instruction , incidentally , is the Sawfish be exposed to as few dangers as possible . Commander , how about ice that far north ? She 's no icebreaker . We can feel our way . I make it over 13,000 miles round trip . Enough power in your reactor for that , Commander ? I understand there 's a considerable stockpile of uranium here . Enough for ten trips like this . Wish we had something we could use it in . You might try using it in my car . Get a load of the Charlie wheeler . - May I be of assistance ? - Yes , I 'm looking for Captain Towers . I 'll try to locate him for you . Paulson , show the lady to Captain Towers ' cabin on the Melbourne . - Thank you very much . - It 's a pleasure . Right this way , please . Relax . Captain . There 's , uh ... somebody to see you . I asked her to wait in your stateroom . - Oh . - Hello . A very nice man asked me to wait here . I don 't think he knew what to do with me . That 's debatable . Did you ... Did you ask me to visit your submarine one day ? - Hmm ... no . - Oh , I couldn 't remember . Oh , in the meantime , I 've been snooping . Regular fish , these kids . I 'll have to get them a boat of their own one of these days . - Sit down . - Thank you . Here , have a cigarette . Thank you . I 'm glad you came . Oh ... I just bet you are . No , I am . Really . And I 'll just bet that my crew didn 't mind too much either . Yes , I have a sneaking suspicion they didn 't mind at all . Come in . I see they found you . Oh , Mr. Chrysler . See if you can find miss Davidson something she can wear ... - to go down in the Sawfish . - Yes , sir . I , uh ... I take it you put me to bed . - Yes . - I arrived at that by deduction . I asked Peter and Mary , and they didn 't . I 'm afraid I was a bit of a mess . You drank too much brandy . You passed out . Yes , I 've been drinking quite a bit recently . That 's no big secret . But , you know , I ... I 've never had it happen quite like that before . My obvious job was to seduce you . So I suppose my pride is hurt . I ought to feel ashamed . Why did you bother about me ? There 's a regulation in here somewhere . It 's under " shore duty . " - I 'll read it to you . - No , tell me . It says when a young lady has had so much to drink , she doesn 't know what she 's doing , You put her to bed ... and go back to the ship . - That 's what it says ? - That 's what it says . Yes ? Well , this requires quite a comprehensive change . Are you sure about this ? You can 't go down in a submarine in that ballet costume . I 'll give you five minutes . Unpack that one next , please . That one . - Everything under control , Mr. Osborne ? - Oh , I guess so . Blasted idiots sent me two wrong components . I 'll have to get them replaced this afternoon . - As long as they 're right when we sail . - What is he doing here ? Mr. Osborne 's been assigned by the C.S.I.R ... - to look after our health on the trip . - " Health " ? It 's your submarine . Captain ... may I see you a minute , sir ? Half a second . - Very becoming outfit . - You know , Julian , they don 't allow drinking on American submarines . - I can 't imagine what else you 'd do . - Thanks very much . - What are you going to do ? - Oh , keep an eye on the weather . Check on radiation . I guess I 'm sort of a scientific cruise director . Then it can be dangerous ? I wouldn 't know , really . A relative question at best , isn 't it ? It seems that everybody I know is going . I feel left out . I can sing and dance . You 'll have to excuse me . The Admiral is up top . Don 't you go away . It 's the damnedest thing . Started the day before yesterday . Came on again ten minutes ago , sir . Starts and stops . We 've monitored 60 hours so far . It 's weird . You 're sure it 's from San Diego ? Within a 100-mile radius . It 's as close as we 're able to pinpoint it , without triangulation . Could it be a kid , somebody who doesn 't know morse ? We 've made two words , sir : " water " and " connect . " You know the old story about an infinite number of monkeys ... And an infinite number of typewriters . One of them has to end up writing " King Lear . " I may be cracking up under the strain , like everybody else , but this interests me . It 's more than Jorgenson 's theory . It 's a fact . It 's impossible , but it 's a fact . A radio signal is coming from around San Diego , and they shouldn 't be . There shouldn 't even be any power for transmission . - Hydroelectric ? - Yes , possibly . There has to be an explanation , and I 'd like to know what it is . Not that I 'll live any longer for knowing . How would you like to track it down ? - I 'd like it , sir . - Very well , then . I 've been on to our electronic wizards . They tell us you have radio direction equipment that can be used from periscope depth . - Is that correct ? - Yes . It hasn 't been used much , but ... - We 'll have to run some tests . - I 'd like it to be in the pink . Perhaps you can amuse yourself around here a little longer until you 're ready to leave . Hey ! What did you do that for ? We could have won . They 've had it . Are they all right ? They 're all right , but they 're out of the race . It 's like looking at a French movie . Dr. Fletcher ? What about these pills they 've got , whatever they are ? They 'll be available from the chemists shops on the free list ... when the time comes . I understand that they ... have got them already at port Moresby and Darwin . Apparently . What 's the ... the effect ? Lethargy , then some euphoria , coma , then nothing . In fairly rapid order . You , uh ... you don 't suppose you could get me a couple ? And ... wh-whatever it is for children ? Not a chance ... until the time comes . Sorry , Peter . I 'm beginning to twitch when I hear the word " time . " If for some reason ... I 'm not talking about now , I 'm just talking ... If ... if there 's one thing you could do ... No . No , I know what I mean . When the dentist is drilling your tooth , what do you think about ? The nicest thing ? Sex ? Or what ? Fishing . - Trout fishing in a clean mountain stream . - You would . Why not go then , when you come back ? The season doesn 't open until September . I 've asked . You think I can 't fix that ? You think I don 't know important people , that I spend all my time with this moldy suburban set ? You can 't mean me . She never bottled like that before . What happened ? She bottled us . I was trying to win . Taking the race too seriously , not paying enough attention to her . Truth is , he made a pass at me . - I had to go overboard in self-defense . - Well , if that ... I like to see the young folks enjoying themselves . What ? - You never wrestle with me anymore . - What does that mean ? I mean exactly what I say . You never wrestle with me anymore . - All right . - Peter , really . - You said I never wrestle . - Never mind ... for now . - Now , tell them the truth . - But I told them the truth . Sharon is the most terrible liar that ... I think it 's absolutely preposterous . How much of this Gould Campbell have we got left , Stevens ? Better than 400 bottles , sir . And in its prime . Shocking . Shocking ! Four-hundred bottles of vintage port in the cellars ... and barely five months to go . Five months , mark you ! If what these scientist chaps say is right . I think it needs another year , actually . I blame the wine committee very much . Very much , indeed . Should have had more foresight . How can the members be expected to get through 400 bottles of port ... in five months ' time ? Bad planning , I say . Ridiculous . - I 'll take another bottle home with me today , Stevens . - Yes , sir . Sir Douglas Froude is expecting me . - I believe he 's in the bar , sir . - Thank you . Yes , I 've heard about those pills . This cruise is developing into something bigger than I thought . I may not be here when it happens . I understand , but if dr . Fletcher can 't get them for you ... I 'm not certain I can . I 've tried everything else . You 're my last hope . You 're convinced you want Mary to have them now ? I 've thought about it a great deal . Yes , sir . Yes , I do . Hmm . I 'm not certain you 're right ... but considering Mary ... I don 't know how much weight I carry with the government in my old age . There 's a lot of bureaucracy still , you know ? Even in death . But take this around anyway and see what happens . Thank you . The wine committee is mad , absolutely mad . Four hundred bottles of vintage port . Too late . Too late . Sorry , Dykers . Good show . Carry on . As a matter of fact , the whole thing is due to the wine committee ... having failed to conserve their supplies properly . If they 'd only regulated their ... Oh , how nice . Have you noticed Moira isn 't drinking so much ? I wonder why ? No , I hadn 't noticed . - Peter ? - Mm-hmm ? Could we afford an electric mower for the lawn ? A very little one i could start myself while you 're away ? Doris Haymes has one . She does ? Well , she 's cut the cord three times and nearly electrocuted herself . Besides , darling , I doubt there 's any left . What 's that ? Sit down . Sit down . This is something I want you to know about before I go . You 're going to be serious ? I wish you wouldn 't . I wish I didn 't have to be . Now , darling , this is a big cruise we 're going on . There will be mines and ice to contend with . Peter , I knew when I married you that you were going to be a naval officer . My father died at sea . You know that . We just don 't have to discuss it , do we ? We have to discuss this , Mary , because there isn 't any tradition for this . - Peter ... - You 're going to listen whether you like it or not . Now , this is a special kind of ... sleeping pill . I had a devil of a time getting them , but I wanted you to have them on hand and make sure you knew how to use them . What happens with the radiation is that you get ill . You start feeling sick , and then you are sick ... and you go on being sick . You can 't keep anything down . You may feel better for a while , but it always comes back . You get weaker . And this cures it ? Darling , you know nothing cures it . This ends it . But , Peter ... however ill I was , I couldn 't do that . Who 'd look after Jennifer ? Jenny will get it too . You 're not trying to tell me you want me to kill Jennifer ? Mary , don 't be an idiot ! Supposing you get it first ? What are you going to do ? Struggle by yourself until you drop ? Jenny might live for days and be helpless in her crib with you dead on the floor ! Don 't you see that ? Don 't you see it ? Darling ... I 'm sorry . I can 't believe it myself half the time . Let 's not discuss it any more right now , Peter . Anyway , Mrs. Hildreth 's husband was talking to someone the other day ... who said it isn 't coming here after all . - He says it 's slowing ... - For God 's sake , Hildreth 's a damn fool ! Let 's go . Would you like another drink ? No , let 's go for a walk . All right . You know , I think I 've discovered why you fascinate me . Shall I tell you ? Uh-huh . Because you take me for granted . I know women aren 't supposed to like that sort of thing , but somehow I do . I 've been treated in every other way . Like a child ... And sometimes like ... like things I 've probably deserved ... But I 've never been pushed around in such a nice way ... and treated something like a wife . I suppose what I mean is ... like an American wife . - Moira , this isn 't going to do us any ... - No , hear me out . I was hurt at first when I realized you were mixing me up with Sharon . And then I realized that it was one of the nicest things that could happen to me . I wouldn 't really mind if you could forget entirely who I am . I don 't like myself very much anyway . Wouldn 't you like to try ? No . It seemed like a good idea . I suppose it wasn 't . There 's a train leaving at 10 : 50 . I think I 'll take it . You see , in the navy , during the war , I got used to the idea that something might happen to me , I might not make it . I also got used to the idea ... of my wife and children ... safe at home . They 'd be all right , no matter what . What I didn 't reckon with was that in this ... this kind of a monstrous war something might happen to them ... and not to me . Well , it did ... and I can 't ... I can 't cope with it . My kids ... all the planning since the day they were born . Sharon ... Sharon and I , we ... Well ... See , we were the sort of people who ... We would have been happy to grow old together . I ... I can 't accept it . I can 't ... Does that make any sense ? Do you understand ? Yes . It makes sense . I understand . Good night . I am sorry to see this . And you were doing so much better too . I would like to come in , whatever this is . An opium den more than likely . How on Earth did you find me ? - What is it ? - It 's a Ferrari . - Does it run ? - " Does it run ? " She won the Grand Prix last year . Bought it from Simonelli 's widow . Gave her a hundred quid for it . - What are you going to do with it ? - Race it , of course . - You ? - Me . You needn 't sound so pessimistic . I 've always wanted to , just never could afford it . Sixth of August , if the Commander gets me back in time . You 're going to kill yourself . It 's possible . Julian ? When was it you were in love with me and I ... And you were so stupid about it ? And I was so stupid about it . You should have grabbed me . I 'm about to be extinct . I came here tonight , Julian , because I want to know ... are you still ... I 'm serious . In a normal world , I think I would still be in love with you . Yes or no , Julian ? But lately , with so little time left , my sense of values seem to have changed . No , then ? I 'm such a fake , such a lot of meaningless talk . - No , no , don 't say that . - Yes , it 's true . There have been men , lots of men . Every time one fell out , there was always a replacement . But not one of them meant anything to me . I can 't pretend any longer , Julian . I 'm afraid . I have nobody , and I 'm afraid . What about Dwight ? He 's married . He 's married to a girl named Sharon , - and they have two children . - Mm-hmm , I know . But if things were different , if she were alive , I 'd do anything ... any mean trick I know to get him . Even if I could make him forget , there isn 't time . No time to love ... and nothing to remember . Nothing worth remembering . I can 't go home tonight , Julian . May I stay here with you ? It 's late , and I have to pick up some things before we leave . Leave ... You 're leaving ? At 6 : 00 this morning . He didn 't tell you . Come on . I 'll take you home . Depth : 56 feet , sir . I recommend course 045 , Captain . Right rudder , new course : 045 . - Right rudder , new course : 045 , sir . - Check sonar . Fogerty , how 's it look topside ? All clear for about a mile , scattered icebergs . Well , this looks like the spot . - All stop . - All stop . Up periscope . Okay . I got point barrow . Bearing : 130 relative . - Distance : about seven miles . - Aye , aye , sir . All right , Mr. Osborne . You can take your readings now . - Chief , raise the E.C.M. - Aye , aye , sir . E.C.M. fully extended , sir . It 's hot , isn 't it ? It 's hotter than it is in mid-Pacific , at least 30 points in the red . That takes care of Jorgenson 's theory . Well , we 've got another job to do . Let 's get the hell out of here . What 's the course , Bob ? Um , 225 , sir . Down periscope and E.C.M. Course 225 . All ahead , standard . Take her to 100 feet . - Course 225 . All ahead , standard . - Just like that ? Take her to 100 feet , sir . Fogerty , will you get us out of this deep freeze ? When we 're clear of bering strait , set a course for San Francisco . Aye , aye , sir . Julian ? Hmm ? You ever been to San Francisco ? Yes , I have . A week on the way down . Met a lovely girl . Longest , loveliest legs I 've ever seen . Full of Martinis , both of them . The legs , I mean . It got to you , didn 't it ? You know ... I 've , uh , been trying to ... Get Mary to face up to it ... to make her understand what has to be done when the time comes . But , uh ... she won 't . She just won 't . And I don 't know what I 'm gonna do . I don 't think you 'll have to worry about Mary . Oh , you don 't know , Julian . You just don 't know . You didn 't see her face when I told her ... she 'd have to give Jennifer one of those pills if it happened before I got back . You 'd have thought I was a murderer or something . All I was doing was what I felt I had to do . How do you tell a woman you love that she has to kill herself and her baby ? How do you do it ? I envy you . You envy me , do you ? You have someone to worry about . I never envied anyone before . Never really believed in it . But you , yes , I do . I envy you . You have a wife and a child , nappies to change . You have a lot to remember . You 're fortunate to have someone to worry about . There are those who don 't , you know ? I mean , have anyone to worry about . Moira , for one . Myself , for another . We let it all go by the boards . It 's too late now . But you ... You 've had it all . And I 'll thank you not to bother me with any more of your blubbering . I don 't know why I like you so much , Peter . You can be such an intolerable ass . Julian ? Julian ? Now what the devil ? Thanks . What are you standing there looking so silly for ? I don 't know . I just don 't know . You 're not losing your mind or something , are you ? No , I don 't think so . You know ... if I can get back in time , I don 't think I 'll complain about a thing . I think I could change Jennifer 24 hours a day and never complain . Alcatraz island on port beam , sir . Range : 800 yards . Suggest we come right ten degrees , sir . - Right ten degrees . - Right ten degrees , sir . New course : 160 . - All stop . - All stop . Up both periscopes . Captain , San Francisco is Yeoman Swain 's hometown . He wants to take a look . Okay , let him look . - Still doesn 't make any sense . - Down San Diego way , all right . It 's got to be hydroelectric . Where could it be ? Probably in one of the refineries along the coast . They 've got the transmitters and lots of juice . See your house , Rob ? No , sir . You couldn 't see it from here anyway . It 's up in the hills . Seen enough ? Yes , sir . Thank you . You know ... I keep expecting to see more damage . There 's no people . I wonder where they are ? Dogs go somewhere to die . They don 't want anybody to look at them . Maybe people do the same thing ... go to bed . Captain ! Swain 's out through the escape trunk , sir . " Out " ? Secure the loading hatch . Drain the escape trunk . Why didn 't somebody stop him ? Raise the boat ! Give me that . Swain , this is the Captain . Hear this . Don 't be a damn fool , Swain ! Come back right now , and we 'll take you aboard . But I mean right now ! Swain , do you hear me ? Swain ! I got a date on Market street , Captain . I 'm going home ! Mr. Osborne . How long can he last out there ? Oh , three or four days , a week . Depends on the individual . We 'd be safe to take him back up till when ? Up to not more than a few hours . Certainly not after he 's eaten or drunk something ashore . Then you might as well take a time bomb aboard . It 'll be dark in about an hour . We 'll set on the bottom for the night . Secure the diving stations . Underway at 7 : 30 . - Good morning , Swain . - Hi , Captain . I thought you 'd gone . - Catch anything ? - No , just started . Always do though , out here . How are you feeling ? Okay . My stomach was upset last night , but I got some Alka-Seltzer from the drugstore . I must have swallowed some salt water . What 's it like ... in town ? Everybody 's dead , I guess . My folks are . I didn 't look much after I saw a few . Hey , I got a case of good beer , if you want any . No , thanks . Captain , how long is it before I feel anything ? A few days , a week . There 's no rule . Well , the weather 's okay , if the wind would die down a little . Captain , I didn 't mean any disrespect or anything yesterday . I want you to understand that , but ... I 'd rather be home here to have it than in Australia . You know what I mean ? I know what you mean . Is there anything you want before we go ? I 'm okay . We won 't be coming back . I know . You 'll get ... pretty sick . Have you got anything to take ? I got 200 drugstores to choose from . Good luck . Okay . Take it easy . Watch the suck of the props now . - No soap , sir ? - Gibberish . Can 't make out a thing . I don 't know what the hell it is . Stay with it . Got to be somebody . You know , one of us was the last man to see San Francisco ; The last man alive next to Swain , that is , and we didn 't see much . Somebody ought to write a history of the war . What are you bucking for , a whole chapter to yourself ? I doubt anyone could put it all together . If they do , I 'd like to read it . I was in it for a while , and I didn 't know anything about it . - I don 't even know who started it . - I wish somebody had stopped it . The people on Mars probably saw what happened . When things cool off , they 'll probably come down and take over . How about that , professor ? Any chance ? They might have the means of paying our corpse a visit , but I shouldn 't advise it for a long time . Who do you think started it , the war ? - Albert Einstein . - You 're kidding . Do you really want to know who I think started the war ? Yeah . - Why ? - You 're an egghead , aren 't you ? Who would ever have believed that human beings would be stupid enough ... to blow themselves off the face of the Earth ? I don 't believe it even now . We didn 't want a war . We didn 't start it . How did it start ? The trouble with you is you want a simple answer , and there isn 't any . The war started when people accepted the idiotic principle ... that peace could be maintained ... by arranging to defend themselves with weapons they couldn 't possibly use ... without committing suicide . Everybody had an atomic bomb and counter-bombs and counter-counter bombs . The devices outgrew us . We couldn 't control them . I know . I helped build them . God help me . Somewhere some poor bloke ... probably looked at a radar screen and thought he saw something . He knew that if he hesitated one thousandth of a second ... his own country would be wiped off the map , so ... so he pushed a button ... and ... and ... the world went ... crazy ... and ... and ... What 's with him ? Maybe we shouldn 't ask him any more questions . What 's new from San Diego , Sundstrom ? - Still can 't make it out , sir . - We 'll be there soon enough . Oh , uh ... Oh , Lungren . - Sir ? - Mr. Osborne is doing a good job for us . He 's not used to this kind of duty . He 's not feeling well , just a little claustrophobia . - Beg your pardon , sir ? - Professor needs a drink . He 's a civilian . He 's used to a shot or two before dinner . See what you can find in the medical locker . - The closer you can come to Scotch , the better . - Yes , sir . Pull it tighter ! Now I want you back here in one hour . Ditch the boat , the suit , the tank , everything . And take a shower in the trunk for ten minutes . And no souvenirs . All I want to see come through that hatch is you . As naked as a baby , understand ? We 'll give you a blast every quarter hour . When you hear the third quarter , get ! I don 't care if you find a tribe of beautiful girls , eager ! Get ! And I mean it . Fan your tail for home . He 's away . Check Jones . Sundstrom 's away . Still getting that signal ? Off and on . They never went to radio school , those spooks . That 's for sure . Amazing equipment to last like that . Wind . Window shade tugging on a coke bottle . Say , what time is it in Melbourne ? 1500 , sir . I hope old Bridie 's listening . - She 's beautiful , isn 't she ? - Mm-hmm , so full of life . - Here you are , baby . - She always waits for the sugar . She knows she won 't get it if she doesn 't . - Go on , get out . Get . - I 'll bet she would . I 'll bet if she sat down and refused to do anything , she 'd still get the sugar . He should be coming home any day now . - I 'm not sure . - Have you missed him ? - Terribly . - Then why don 't you tell him ? Dwight ? Oh , what a thing to do to me . I 'd given you up . I thought the polar bears had you . Don 't you ever do that to me again , leave me without telling me . I don 't think I will . You 're thinner . You 're not ill ? No , no , a little tired . I 'm all right . - You 're sure about that ? - I 'm positive , Miss Davidson . I 'm absolutely positive . Why didn 't you telephone , let me come and meet you at the station ? I thought I 'd walk . I wanted the air . Is your invitation to spread a little fertilizer still open ? Can you stay for a few days ? If you 've got room for me . I 'd build a house if I didn 't . - Peter ... Peter , I ... - Oh , darling , I 'll never leave you again . You might as well run a railway train through here . - I beg your pardon ? - There 's no need to frighten all the animals . Sorry , sorry . Julian . Hello , hello . The Admiral told me I 'd find you here . I thought you might want to have a look at this report of mine before I have it typed . - I 'm sure it 'll be all right . - You don 't have to be so noisy . - The cows won 't give any milk for a week . - He just said that . So this is the Ferrari ? What will she do ? I don 't really know yet , but I 'll find out on Saturday . - You are coming to the race , aren 't you ? - Well , I 'd like to . - Will there be much of a crowd ? - Oh , I shouldn 't think so . It 's a question of transport for most people . Besides , nobody cares who wins . I suppose you think you 're going to ? I might . It 's the fastest car , you know . Commander , there 's a telephone call for you . Oh , all right . Uh , be right back . Julian , this is ridiculous . - Why are you doing it ? - Because I want to . I can 't think of a better reason . You think it 's that funny ? Well , in view of things , don 't you ? " From : United States Naval Forces , Brisbane . " To : Commander D.L. Towers , U.S.N , U.S.S. Sawfish . " 1 : on the retirement of the present Commander U.S. Naval Forces at this date , " You will immediately and henceforth assume the duty of ... Commander U.S. Naval Forces in all areas . " I guess this makes you an Admiral , if you want to be one . Congratulations . Thank you , sir . May I dictate something to your secretary ? Yes , I could let you dictate something to her , but I tried to get through to Brisbane myself half an hour ago . There was no reply . They 've closed up . I see . Well , thank you , sir . He 's moving up . I wish he 'd be more careful . It 's not that important . It is to him . He almost had it that time . I can 't watch much more . Is Julian all right ? He 's all right . He 's back on the track . Julian ! He doesn 't make the slightest bit of sense . - He 's never been in a race before . - He won it , didn 't he ? I had lunch with Admiral Bridie yesterday . He told me that somebody brought pressure to bear ... and got the trout season moved up . It opens tomorrow . Why don 't we have a crack at it , go up to the mountains for a few days ? - When ? - Now . I know just the spot . It 's nice , quiet and peaceful . # # Waltzing Matilda waltzing Matilda # # # # You 'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me # # # # And he sang as he watched # # # # And waited till his billy boiled # # # # You 'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me # # Will you let loose of your line ? I 'll build up the fire . Captain . You 'd better have a look at Ackerman . Ackerman ? What 's wrong with him ? The doctor says he 's in a bad way . You 'd better have a look at him . I 'll go right down . Do that again , baby , will ya ? - Hello , Ackerman . - Hello , Captain . Well , how are you feeling ? Oh , I 'm okay , except I 'm a little weak . Can 't seem to keep anything in my stomach yet . Guess I hoisted a few too many beers the other night . You know , I don 't know what the kangaroos are putting in the brew nowadays , but I can sure tell you what it tastes like . - Well , you just take it easy . - Yeah . You 'll be perfectly okay . - Dr. King here will look after you . - I 'll do fine . Any chance that he 's right ? He just had a few too many ? No , he has the full range of symptoms . It 's radiation . Well , why ... Why this one case all of the sudden ? Why ? Why not ? It 's here . It had to hit somebody first . It hit this lad . We 're not machines . We 're not going to fall over in rows , you know . - Anything you can do for him ? - No . Except make him as comfortable as possible . This thing is coming sooner than we thought . I 'm a little off balance . I 'm terribly sorry if it 's inconvenient , but I 'm afraid I can 't be held responsible for that . I never predicted the precise date . No , I don 't think we have a freak case here , Commander . I 've been getting very irritable myself , as you can see . It 's one of the first symptoms . O lord , give us the strength . Help us to understand the reason for this madness on earth , The reason why we have destroyed ourselves . Give us the courage to bear thy will , and when the end is upon us , give us thy hand and show us the way ... that we may better understand that only you can give ... and only you can take away . Forgive those of us who are weak , as we forgive each other . For Jesus ' sake . Amen . Simpson , John . Jones , Norman , Molly , Kenneth and Kim . Dickson , George and Lola . You all know the situation . I 've given leave to many of you , to stay here for personal reasons . It 's understandable why some of you might prefer this . I think that the rest of you are entitled to decide what you 'd like to do . I 'd like you to think about it . Take a vote if you need to . Give me your decision by this evening . I think that 's all . Captain . We 've already taken a vote . We 'd like to head for home . Just give it to me straight . How much longer ? We 're 15 points in the red . Up three and a half since last night . I suppose you 've heard about Mary . - No . What ? - Quite irrational . Peter came in Sunday to find her packing for a trip back to England , taking Jennifer . I 'm sorry to hear that . She 's a bit calmer now , doctor and all that . - Dwight ? - Yes ? What about Moira ? I want to stay with her right to the end , but I had to leave it to the men . We 're going . When do you leave ? In a day , two at the most . - You might not have that much time . - Yes , I know . I 've got to see her right away . So long , Julian . God bless . Hosgood ? Hosgood ? Yes , sir ? It looks as if we 've had it , Hosgood . Would you like shore leave or are you staying aboard ? I 'm remaining aboard , sir . Would you have a glass of sherry with an old man ? No , sir , but I would very much like to have one with you ... Sir . There 's one thing that always bothered me , Hosgood . A girl like you ... Why no young men ? They never asked me . I guess maybe it was the uniform . To a blind ... blind world . I think I can get Mrs. Andrews to help me out with Jennifer . Yes , but if you need anything , you 'd better call me . I 'm sure she 'll be all right , but I wish there was something I could do for Mary . Mary . Mary ! Moira , it 's for you . Hello . Dwight . Oh , yes , I 'll be there ! Right away , Dwight ! I 'll be there ! Moira ! Oh , you 're not going . - You 're staying . You 're staying . - No . I 'm going . - But ... the Sawfish ... - Just across the bay ... At the fuel depot . The men want to try to get home . I can 't explain it . Then I suppose that ... the time has come to say , " It 's been nice , Dwight Lionel . It 's been everything . " Oh , Dwight , I 'm so frightened . I know . I 'm so sorry for so many things . I love you , Moira . I love you . I love you . Mary . Mary . I love you . Did you say something , Peter ? I didn 't hear . I said , " I love you . " I ... I feel so strange . You remember the first time we ever met ? It was on the beach . I thought you were everything I 'd ever dreamed about , everything I ever wanted . I thought you were so underfed . Every day after that , I went to the beach , but you were never there . I had the flu . My mother made me stay at home . I looked for you . I looked for you so . Did you suffer horribly ? Oh , Mary , you 'll never know . Did you really ? I thought I couldn 't bear it if I didn 't see you again . I 'd about given up hope , but one day ... There you were . Now it 's all over , isn 't it ? Mm-hmm , it 's all over . And I want you to know ... That I could never have been happy with anyone in the world but you . I 've loved you , Peter . I 've been foolish , and I haven 't been practical , but I 've loved you so much . So much . We 've been happy and fortunate . And Jennifer ... She 'll never have the chance . She 'll never know what love is . - Peter , Peter , you 'll see that she 's ... - I will , I will . Darling ... God ! God forgive us . Peter ... I think I 'll have that cup of tea now .

 eh ? I learned a long time ago you gotta start your pitch with a bang . see . I gotta play it square with you . a plain ol ' farmer lives in this house . easy going sorta guy . - Now get the law after ' em ! he lives on the outskirts of this little town . I 'm not kiddin ' ! That 's the name ... Hiscksburg . Scout 's honor . It 's a quiet little place ... Nothing much for the young people to do ... Well ... Hardly anything . we 're Saturday night . was eating in this fancy restaurant . A regular gourmet 's joint . Him and me are what you might call ... Investments specialists . We were discussing the latest market reports and looking forward to a quiet game of chess before retiring . Oh ... That 's my partner . on the left . Will there be anything else ? I couldn 't afford what I 'm thinking . wait ! I wonder if you can tell me how to ... I can 't even read my own writing here ! I wonder if you 'd tell me how to get to first base with you tonight . Fresh guy ! at least I tried ! Trying is all we ever do ever since we hit this town . We never should 've come here in the first place ! A guy 's gotta be a native in this burg before a dame will give him a break . Oh don 't give me that ! Let 's go home . I 'm bushed ! man . This is country ! Things move slow here . I got a tip that this town 's a cinch for quick buck . will you ? I 'm going to bed . And we 're pulling out of here in the morning ! I 'm looking for action tonight . I 'm taking a ride to see what I can pick up . Fat chance ! And remember that car is half mine . You have the front seat . I won 't be using your half much tonight ! Big lover ! All mouth .. No action . You want a lift back to the boarding house ? I 'm gonna walk up my great expectations . I wouldn 't want to hold back the wheels of progress . Or is it the progress of a big wheel ? what else ? There 's no clouds out there . Lieutenant ? Not bad . How about them young 'uns ? I wonder what they 're watching out there ? I tell ya ... I saw a flying saucer ! What you fellows yappin' about out here ? Duke just said he saw a flying saucer ! Only one ? Nobody 's got a right to brag unless they see at least six . And in different colors . This one was blue ! the boys are kidding about seeing a flying saucer . Oh . Duke says he saw one over there . he might be giving you orders next month . I 'm hooked ! Dragging me in feet first . Don 't you had a date with the Joan tonight ? she 's meeting me here at 9 : 30 . She 's probably fussing with her new dress . Who you 're kidding ! We all know she 's waiting for her old man to get out of the house . What kind of a dress takes that long to get into ? You have to admit she 's got a lot of the right things to put in the right places . Yeah and they 're all mine ! Here she comes . See you later . - Hi princess . - Hi Johnny ! Most of the gang 's at Lover 's Point . what a lousy way to spend the Saturday night . Look ! - Do you like it ? - Great ! Jack . Uh ! ... Another load of those consarned kids on my property . Looks crowded at Lover 's Point . Hope we don 't hit Larkin 's bull on the way out . go ! You nearly startled me out . Larkin 's bull . He 's always hanging around asking for hand outs . Get that beast away from here ! That bull drank so much beer one night that he got the blind staggers . you needn 't be afraid of him . - I 'm not ... Anymore . - Good . - You shouldn 't have done that . - Done what ? - Throwing out the beer can . - Why not ? You know the trouble we 've been having with Mr. Larkin without messing up his farm with beer cans . Let Larkin blow his top . This place was Lover 's Lane long before it was Larkin 's cow pasture . - But I think ... - I got a cure for that . - For what ? - For thinking . More beer . not so fast ! I 'm out of breath . Proves you 're lovin ' ... isn 't that proof enough ? And then some ... Seeing how your father hates me . Oh it isn 't that bad ! Art ... Artie ? at last we made it ! We hit the jackpot . you bum ! come on ! We 're millionnaires . uh ! But this is different . This is big ! Yeah ... Look I 'm not trying to give you a pitch . But this ... we 're gonna put on an exhibition on the first and only truly authentic flying saucer ! You ... You woke me up to tell me that ? didn 't I ? Well I seen one ! Like all the crazy people been talking about . and it glows . And gives off a funny noise like like that ! uh ? that 's it ! It landed over there by the Larkin 's farm property . isn 't it ? Okay ... Okay . I don 't see you invited in . Invited out ! I 'll handle it myself . go back to sleep ! Sleep your life away ! It was a good idea coming up here tonight . Gang 'll never suspect a thing . We can be back before they even miss us . no more sneaking up here to be alone . No more out-swirling your father . - This oughta make it official . - Oh it 's brilliant ! It 's bad luck . I don 't know why these saucers always wait till night to put up an appearance . Where do you think it is ? it must be north-east of town . I 'll check the latest radar report from our station . We better get right out there . The General was thrown up for letting the last one get away . The army intelligence really scooped us that time . 'Scoop ' did you say ! Lieutenant . sir . I know that in civilian life you were a publicity man . sir ? - Just this : ... Our job is to prevent a possible nationwide panic by keeping the information from the public . I figure a public information officer is about the last thing we need right now . sir . sir . sir . I 'll have you court-martialled and shot ! sir ! Good . Now get down the hall and wake up Sgt. Serkins and Carter . sir . Come on . We 're wasting time . - Hey cut those lights ! - You 're cramping our style ! Hey you want Larkin should catch us ? Joan should worry . Her old man 's a city attorney . turn ' em off ! I 'd hate to get caught at a time like this ... I can see your old man helping me ... of all nights . I 'd hate to hit Larkin 's old bull . I could drive this road blind-folded . but never enough ! I can 't see a thing . No back seat driving to our marriage ! you 'll get us all killed ! sir ! I couldn 't see a thing ! We wanna get there in one piece . It 's only another quarter mile to the highway . It 's nothing to be afraid of . Don 't worry . Johnny ! Johnny ! - What was that ? - I don 't know it happened so fast . I didn 't see it at all ! What have we done ? Oh it 's a little boy ! let 's get him to a hospital . Johnny ! What 's this thing ! It 's disgusting ! What a monster head ! Here it is . I killed it . I 'm getting ill . get me away from here ! - What is this ? - I don 't know . We must 've cut the tire when we hit that thing . - Are we stuck here ? - We can 't drive on it . and I don 't have a spare . Let 's go to Larkin 's house and call the police . Amazing ! One of them actually landed intact ! What a story ! That must explain the blue lights our jet pilots told us about . I wonder how many regular airline crack-ups it caused . we 're lucky . But if these things are proved to be unfriendly ... sir . Shall we drive closer so we can get a better look ? I think we oughta wait right here . They 're watching us right now . get me Division HQ . I 'll get some engineers here and see what 's inside this thing . Calling Control ... sir ? Lieutenant ! ... you just follow standard procedure . sir . not guesses . sir . I have Division HQ on up . Sergeant . I wanna report this myself . Division HQ ? This is Colonel Ambrose . I wanna report that the saucer did land near Pallam wood . Maybe he can 't hear you . open up in there ! Hello ? Mr. Larkin ? Anybody home ? we ain 't got any right in here ! it 's an emergency . young fella ? This is Johnny Carter . I 'm at the Larkin 's house near Pallam woods . Yes ... Yes I know you saw little green men . they 're from another planet . give them my love and send them home . Saturday night . That 's official . He thought I was kidding him ! Take it easy . take these . try and find some candles . I 'll try the police again . Darn phone 's gone dead . Bolt lightning must 've got it . there 's more candles in the kitchen . Something out there was looking at me ! honey . It 's all right . now . What are you doing in my house ? we came in to call the police . The door was open . That gives you no right to come in . Who was it you hit ? it was ... - I know . I know it was bound to happen ... With you kids running all over my property . I 'll bet you killed one of my prized efforts . mind you that . - And I 'll just call the police to it . - The phone 's dead . That 's what you say . Get over there the both of you . Get over there . Allo ? Allo ? ... So it is . a monster ! sir . That ain 't turpentine I smell . It 's alcohol . I smelled it before . son ? Johnny Carter ... I work down at Mullon 's gas station . I thought I 'd seen you before . But we didn 't hurt any of your animals . It was just a ... - ( mumbling ) - Okay ... Okay ... Mr. Larkin ! take it easy now ! or they 'll get their backside loaded with rock shots . get out of here ! I 'll know where to find you when I need you . Now get ! - What do we do now ? - I 'll have to go back and fix that flat . It would have to happen tonight of all nights ! honey . Sandy ? This is Larkin . I want you to send a couple of cops out here . And get them smoochin' kids off my property ! I gotta go out and check my livestock . Sandy . I 've never seen such pestering young 'uns in my life ! I guess . Anybody home ? ( mumbling ) uh ! Anybody home ? Will you get me Watkins-10536 ? - Hello ? - Art ? ... Joe . Joe ? but ... see . - Why ? 'Cause I don 't know what it is ! It 's stuck underneath the car . I need your help . I 'm going back to sleep . - But Art ! - But nothing . Goodbye . don 't hang up ! Will you do me one favor ? Clean everything out of the refrigerator . - The refrigerator ? - Yeah . What I 'm bringing is perishable . We gotta keep it on ice . Art ? - Everything out of the refrigerator . I swear to you ! don 't you ? ... I 'll be right home with it . eve-everything out . everything . You got it ? I got it ! You consarned hoodlums ! Refrigerator ... Everything out ... I need a stick to pry him loose . What the heck am I doing ? I 'm as crazy as he is ! Listen ! let 's go see what it is . It 's one of those little things . A live one ! What 's making all the noise ? He 's banging away at the fender of our car with some kind of a crazy hammer ! I bet he thinks the car is responsible for killing his buddy . What do you mean ? you know how the savages blame a rain god for every storm . let 's get out of here ! how much further ? come on ! Come out . You will not be harmed . Answer me . spaceship ? Answer me ! sir ? - Go ahead . We have you surrounded . I don 't believe anybody 's in that thing . I think it 's probably remote controlled . Would you want to walk up there and test your theory ? no sir . Not particularly . And start thinking of a way to explain this thing without throwing the nation into a complete panic . sir . I wish we 'd stuck to the road . These shoes weren 't made for hiking . honey . a police car ! They must 've believed you after all . Let 's go back . The police will take care of those things . it might scare them out . get some reaction . - Go ahead . fire a few rounds . This isn 't getting us anywhere . I want four volunteers to work acetylene torches . I wanna get inside that thing and see what makes it ticks . sir ! Let 's have that again . You were driving without lights ? but it wouldn 't made any difference anyway . we wouldn 't have seen him . Small ? he couldn 't have been over four feet high . And he was all green except his hands . sir . we were really scared . I 'll bet you are . get the doctor over here . I want you to do something for me . I want you to blow up this little balloon . just blow . Hold it up . We 're wasting time ! Aren 't you gonna do anything about the little green man ? - This may be a whole invasion ! - Blow ! This is the silliest thing yet . uh ? - Yeah . Did you ever hear such a cock-and-bull story ? Green men . Spaceships . Wow . we were content with pink elephants . But kids these days ! do you ? ' How do you like that ? What do you expect ? With all the killings they see in the movies and all . Do you smell that alcohol ? Those kids must have killed at least a quarter liquor . Mr. Detective ! can we get going ? you 're awfully anxious to get to the police station ! Crime ? You don 't call killing one of those monsters a crime ? Something awfully screwy around here ... let 's get going . I just wanna explain this ! - I ... Look ... Wait a minute . - Get in ! Now if you just read that before you sign it . now why don 't you do something ! miss . This is no statement . It 's a confession ! don 't you ? sure but ... - With the lights off ? but I told you ... driving without lights and killing a man is a crime in this state ! Killing a man ? you don 't call killing that green monster .. a man ! And I haven 't even added in the drunk driving . that 'll be another strike against you ! right away ! Ha ! I 've been waiting for that . and he 's already been sent for . He 'll straighten you out . even if you beat it out of me . Beat it out of you ? It never fails . you 're charged of using the third degree ! What 's this about a third degree ? Oh ... Dad ! These people are crazy ! John and I had a horrible time . not with this rough neck ! But don 't you worry about the monster ? I heard that ridiculous story when the Sergeant called me . listen to me . I 'll get you out of this mess . he can take his medicine . Oh thanks . Thanks a lot ! sir . We 'll be right in . we 'll make the formal identification . than you 'll believe us ! Jim . Well ? - I didn 't run over this man ! - Are you still on that kick ? I didn 't exaggerate . I tell you ! - We 've heard enough of that . - But I saw it ! - Do you know who he is ? he lives at 121 Maple avenue . as far as I could find out . He and a friend of his drifted into town about a month ago . - Friend ? - Fellow he lives with . - and there was no answer . - I see . Can I talk to them alone for a minute ? Oh certainly Mr. Hayden . Use my office . Come on ! Jim . Take him back . Come in . both of you . We 're lucky in one respect . The man you 've killed is a nobody . There 'll be only one person interested in the charges brought against you . That 's his roommate . Johnny didn 't ... Johnny has sense enough to listen . Now then . I 'll go and talk to this Joe Gruen 's roommate . See what I can do for Johnny . I can 't do anything until then . I 'm taking you home . unless Johnny goes . How is it going ? We 've almost got it . Just as soon as we cut through this seam . look at that ! Looks like some sort of fuse ! let 's get out of here ! Come on ! There 's been some kind of an explosion over in Pallam woods ! - What was that ? - Looks like something blew up . What do you suppose it was ? are smarter than all of us put together ! What do you mean ? Remember when we watched one of them pound away at the fender of my car ? What 's so smart about that ? Don 't you see ? They killed this man and then dented the fender ! It 's all a frame up ! it sure burned out in a hurry . sir . And we thought they were mad at the car ! and get some evidence . Something they 'll believe . If we don 't ... I 'm going to jail . how ? They 'll never let us out of here ! The window ! It 's wide open ! - What about those two kids ? - I talked a little sense into their heads . The little fools ! They 're gone ! did you ? let 's take it ! I 'll take the responsability . where should I be ? I just saw you car drive off so naturally I assumed ... If those two kids stole my car ... ! I hope you know what you 're doing ! so do I ! I 'm awfully worried about taking this car ! what 's a little car theft ? let 's go ! Joan ? Not a thing . Johnny ! I 'm frightened . I 'll handle them with this . Lieutenant ? one of our jets crashed . too . Plenty of calls from people who say they 've seen flying saucers and little green monsters . Wonder how that rumor ever got started ? Sarge . see you later . this is silly . The police were all over here and they didn 't find a thing . I guess you 're right . Might as well go back . but I just can 't relax . I guess you 're right . Would have to happen tonight of all nights ! it 's cold in here . a reflex action ? Seems like the natural thing to do out here . I wonder if any of the gang saw those things ? How do you mean ? that would convince the police that we were telling the truth ! Sometime I think it doesn 't matter how many times they still don 't believe it . It 's an idea . Let 's go to the Point and see if any of the gang is still there . What we got to loose ? What 's so funny ? I expected to be frightened on my wedding night but Nothing like this ! Stand back an I 'll slam the door ! help me ! Help me ! honey . It 's trapped in the car . You 're all right ? Johnny ! don 't you see ! At last we got some evidence . But how do we get it to the police station ? there . Gotta get somebody out here and see this thing ! Johnny ? Remember at the police station . Your father was right about one thing . The only person who 'd be interested is Joe Gruen 's roommate . - He 's our only chance . - But where is he ? Don 't you remember ? Police said he lived at 121 Maple street . We 'll go there and find him ! let 's go ! my legs are killing me ! all right . Who goes watching the place ? uh ? the craziest story I 've ever heard ! will you phone and check with the police ! thanks to these ! you gotta have a secret weapon . Will you please call the police ! Please ! but if this is some kind of a gag ... don 't mention our names . we 're done for . Don 't worry . Police station ? Joe Gruen . Did you say Joe Gruen ? We 've been trying to get a hold of you . Your roommate was killed tonight . Victim of a hit-and-run . Killed ? Do you know who did it ? a boy and a girl . don 't worry . You mean you had them and you let them get away ? Yeah ... And were they scared ! You should have heard them talking about little green men . - I have . - You have what ? thanks a lot . Can you come down tomorrow and claim the body ? I guess so . are we telling you the truth ? Your story checks out . Joe kept trying to tell me something about it . Will you go with us now ? I 'll say I will . mind you . I 'm gonna get a picture of it . that 's a hot one ! - What 's so funny ? I was just thinking how Joe 's gonna feel when I put him on exhibition as the world 's first victim of a spaceman ! Does it work ? It worked all right for the nazi I took it from . - You disarmed a nazi soldier ? - Sure . he was dead at the time . Can we be going now ? Sure . Just gimme a couple seconds to put some clothes on . Hey ! I thought you said the police had your car . this belongs to Joan . the battery 's almost dead . When 's the last time you checked the water ? Every time the man at the gas station asks me . he means the battery water . what 's that ? remember ? Joan . How do you like this ? but a brand new shiny spotlight ! Somebody afraid of the dark ? I didn 't get it for that ! - What did you get it for ? - A girl always need an extra mirror . What a pile of junk ! Elvis is very sensitive ! - Elvis ? - The gang calls her Elvis . but she really goes ! Did you get rid of him ? I gave him the story that one of our jets crashed and that we were taking care of everything . Did they believe you ? you are talking to the man who made the papers believe that 45 years old girls were teenage maidens ! This was duck soup . sir . - Good . let the camouflage boys do their work . sir . men ! Must be here somewhere ! Let 's look on the other side . I can 't see a thing ! It 's in there . It 's got to be ! I 'll turn the spotlight on it . did you see it ? it 's down there on the floor . kill the headlights . Remember the battery . Look at that ! I never would 've believed it ! Seeing is believing . bring my camera . I wanna get a picture of this ! Well I 'll be ... It 's gone ! I saw it ! They 'll believe us when Art backs us up . They can 't accuse him of being a hysterical kid . Let 's get to town ! What was that ? Don 't get excited . You gotta be calm when you call the police . I 'm glad you told me . Darn it ! Battery . Turn the lights off . That 'll give you more juice . good idea ! Give us the gun ! Did I hit it ? - Can 't see anything . - It certainly sounds like you did ! They 're in the bushes ! - Bullets don 't hurt them ! - You 're sure you 're hitting them ? use the spotlight . Turn the spotlight on ! It 's the light that hurts ! Take this . Gimme the spotlight . What do we do now ? Spotlight 's getting dimmer . Battery 's going dead . you 're right . Here they come again ! Looks like we 've had it ! Getting dimmer ! we 'd better make a run for it ! Johnny ! The camera ! The flashbulb ! it 's now or never ! sir ? - Nothing . Whatever flew that thing down here went up in smoke . sir . Lieutenant ? Colonel ? - Being part of a show like this . Protecting our country from alien invaders . Just think of it . will know what happened here tonight . You mean you think we know what 's happened ? of course we do ! this top secret security business is like scratching ... it 's hard to stop . Lieutenant ? Spit it out ! Did it ever occured to you that there might be covering up other things ? Johnny ! I 've got to rest ! I think we 're safe here for a minute . Do you think they killed Art ? I don 't know . I saw them pick him up and carry him away . we 've got to get help . We 've got to ! We can 't just leave him to those creatures . What are we gonna do ? I don 't know . Johnny ... What if we 'd turn ourselves into the police ? aren 't you ? Don 't you see ? we 'll get them to help Art out in some way . that 's an idea . let 's go use Larkin 's phone . that does it . - Not a trace . - It 's a good night 's work ! Now we can go home and get some sleep . Yeah ... And read about a jet crash in tomorrow 's morning papers . sir . Nothing at all . we 're ready to give ourselves up . If you 'll just come out to the Larkin farm ! You 're not wanted anymore . Why don 't you go home and sleep it off ? What about Joe Gruen ? the cause of death due to alcoholism . The alcohol content of his blood was the highest our coroner had ever seen ! What about the fender of my car ? You said that proved I hit him . Oh you hit him alright . But only after he was dead ! After ? he was drunk . and down the hill . We found a liquor bottle near it . You found his car ? that 's what tipped us off . and climb back up to the road . and he conked out . and run over his body . But won 't you come out here ! What for ? You 're in the clear . What about taking your car ? You still want us for car theft ! One of our patrol car has recovered my car when they went out to check on an airplane crash . But we stole it just the same ! your father took care of that . why don 't both of you go home and sleep it off ! And don 't bother me again ! Mr. Hayden . Mr. Hayden ! Trust Daddy . He came through again . What about Lover 's Point ? not at a time like this ! I mean the gang . They may still be there . They 'll help us . They 'll believe us . - What makes you think so ? - I know so . They aren 't like our parents or the police . They won 't think we 're drunk or crazy or anything just because we 're young . let 's go ! Doggone kids ! Look what they 've done to Oswald . I 'll fix him ! I 'll go that . We were attacked by weird creatures ! What ? you gotta help us . And they captured him ! The police wouldn 't believe us . Will you help us ? I 'll show you the way . Come on ! They 're heading toward that clearing remember ? yeah ! gang . Now everybody turn off your lights . we 'll surround the clearing . like this . That 'll be the signal for everybody to turn on your lights . Does everybody got it ? yeah ! let 's go . wait for me ! I was lonely back there . gang ! uh ? You 're alright . Little green men had you but ... we burned them up is this some kind of a gag ? Johnny ? Just like his roommate . Acute alcoholism ! These monsters kill their victims by sticking them with alcohol . Pure alcohol ! like Joe Gruen ? Let me finish ! You don 't happen to die unless you 're already loaded . that 's it . Too much ... He just had too much . What 's going on here ? How did I get here ? What is this ? Some kind of a joke ? You gotta remember . Remember ! he won 't remember a thing of what 's happened . just like anybody else who 's been on a bend . Now you kids listen to me ! You got my bull drunk . I 'm gonna take the law into my own hands . I 'm gonna start shooting . I 'll bet that no one will ever believe us . we 're just crazy kids . Come on . Get out ! But what if they come back again ? What if there 's more around right now ? I guess the best thing we can hope is that the next guy who runs into one is a 100 % certified adult ! Messy young 'uns ! Oh well ! Being young has its compensations . Hey Paul ! Paul ! How would you like to be my best man ? I can 't get married like this ! - I 'll swap dresses with you . - Then you can be my maid of honor ! Young 'uns ! you two slipped your track ? - No we just got back on it ! and let 's drive ! So that 's my story . Poor Daddy . Johnny and Joan helped me remember a little of it . you understand . A true story ? that 's the nice thing about all this book writing business ...

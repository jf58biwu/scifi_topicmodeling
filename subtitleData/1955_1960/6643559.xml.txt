 This is the salton sea in Southern California . A strange phenomenon , in which nature has placed 400 square miles of salt water in the middle of an arid desert . In the desert , near the shore of the sea , the government has established one of its most important naval research bases . At the laboratory on the secluded south tip of the base , top-secret atomic experiments are carried out under rigid security control . At the airfield , under the direction of the parachute test unit , planes leave on daily missions for the jump area over the salton sea , where Navy men dive in the government 's continuous researching of parachutes , to meet the ever-increasing demands of modern flight . On may 17 , in the early afternoon , an earthquake occurred in the desert area . Its force was strong enough to be felt at the research base , even though its epicenter was 10 miles away in the wild rock formations 350 feet below the surface of the salton sea . However , less than 2 hours after the earthquake , the base was back to normal operating procedure . Lt. Hollister , of the parachute test unit , was preparing to make the last-scheduled jump of the day . Hollister was a veteran of over 300 test flights . For him , this was to be one more routine jump . Meanwhile , on the salton sea , crewmen Johnson and Sanders were headed out to meet lt . Hollister . And for them , this was to be one more routine pickup . This is flutterboy 2-4-2 calling Navy 8-7 . You are now in sight . Over . Hollister now preparing to jump . Over and out . He 's down . Navy 8-7 , this is flutterboy 2-4-2 . Over . This is Navy 8-7 . Over . He 's in sight . You 're clear to return to the base . Over . Roger . Leaving for home . Over and out . Flutterboy 2-4-2 calling land radio 4 . Over . Land radio 4 . Come in . Jumper landed safely . He 's down about 2-miles in , off the southeast tip . That 's pretty far out . Hope this doesn 't take all night . Yeah , I 'll call you back . Where is he ? I don 't know . He 's gotta be here . I saw him hit . Hey , lieutenant ! I 'm going down for him . You see him ? No . I 'll try the other side . Johnson ? Johnson ! Johnson ! Johnson ! Uh . Ah ! Ah ! This is land radio 4 calling flutterboy 2-4-2 . Come in , please . Land radio 4 calling flutterboy 2-4-2 . Come in . Come in , flutterboy 2-4-2 . El centro base . Naval intelligence , please . Cmdr. Twillinger 's office . He 's on the other line . Okay , I 'll put you on hold . Lieutenant , I appreciate your calling , but there 's nothing I can do . He went awol , it doesn 't matter what the circumstances were . I 'll have to refer the case . Wait a minute ! In the 1 week that I 've been here , I 've had a dozen different cases come up . I don 't decide these things . I 'm an investigating officer , not a judge . All right , I 'll send you notification . I know this guy . He 's all right . He made a mistake , but ... He sure did ! Commander , Wyatt on 3 . Wyatt ? He 's our radioman at the salton sea pier . Twillinger . Yes , Wyatt . How long ago ? 45 minutes . No , I 've lost radio contact . It 's not a mechanical failure at this end . Have a boat standing by . I 'll be there in 5 minutes . Trouble ? The last pickup crew hasn 't reported in . We 'll have to go out . Sally , wait until I call you . Yes , sir . Still there , mom ? Looks like ironheart 's gonna work late again tonight . That 's right . Shove off . I don 't see why they weren 't covered for something like this . They jump close to 20 men every day . It 's a good system , nothing goes wrong . Something went wrong this time . A boat off the port bow , sir . She looks deserted . Head up alongside . Aye . It 's Sanders . Check the water for the other men . Yes , sir . Sam . Look at this . What is it ? I don 't know . You better take a sample . Have the lab run a test . Commander , there 's something surfacing on the portside . It 's Hollister . Like I told you , he said he 'd call me back later and that was all . That 's when you lost contact ? Yes , and I called the base . When you talked last , was everything normal ? Yes . We was just kiddin ' , you know how you get on the phone . That 's against regulations . Yes , sir . Have a report in my office in the morning . Yes , sir . May I have that sample we took off the boat ? Right here . How long 's that autopsy on Hollister gonna take ? We 'll have it early tomorrow . I 'll cover it for you . Take some divers and go after Johnson in the morning . It 's too late to dive now . Okay . I want to take this to the lab . It 's right there . Go through the main door and turn to your right . I 've already spoken to Dr. Rogers . Good . We won 't need you anymore , Wyatt . Thank you , sir . That your new boss ? Yeah . Sure is an eager beaver , sir . Yeah , that he is . You might know I 'd be making eight carbons . I said I 'm always making eight carbons when my fingers go to ... Hello . Is this Dr. Rogers ' office ? Yes . I 'm cmdr . Twillinger . I 'll tell him . I think you were notified that I was coming . I was sorry to hear about the accident . Young lady , you 're not to discuss that with anyone . Do you understand ? No , of course not . I 'm Dr. Rogers , commander . Twillinger . Lt. Clemens said you have a substance to be analyzed . I do . It 's in here . Come on , let 's take a look at it . Where did you find this ? On the boat , near the body . Lt. Clemens told me what happened . I 'm terribly sorry . We lost 3 men , so far . At least , we think it 's 3 . We 've only recovered 2 bodies . He said there was something unnatural about the condition of one of the bodies . There was . It was shriveled . Shriveled ? Sometimes seawater does strange things to human flesh . In this case , I don 't think so . Would you say that the water in the sea could be radioactive ? Commander , let me answer you in this way . My 2 assistants do a lot of diving related to our work . I know that . We don 't take any chances with radioactivity . Our sea experiments had nothing to do with what happened to your men or the condition of that body . You might be wrong . I 've found that people are always jumping to wild conclusions concerning atomic reaction . Science fact and science fiction are not the same . Not in the least . Just take a few minutes . Can you make it as fast as possible ? It 'll only take a little while , as long as I 'm not interrupted . I 'll be outside . Gail , I 'm returning your child in the same condition as when I got her . I think . Hi , sweetie . Hi , mommy . Excuse me . It 's all right . May I go look at the rabbits ? Not today , sweetie . Please . Hm-mmm . Mommy , of all those rabbits , i like grace the best . You can 't see her today . That 's okay , I 've got a ladybug to keep me company . Gail , when will the boys be finished ? They got tied up because of the earthquake and had to reset all the tests . Oh . Hey . 2 minutes . Your wife and unborn child are starving . A minute and a half . What a life ! Did I ever tell you that I detest this lab ? That husband of mine even has " top secret " stamped in red ink in the middle of his chest . He does . " Secret , secret , secret . " You can 't speed up science . I guess not . Would you like to hold my ladybug ? Hmm ? I said , " would you like to hold my ladybug ? " Certainly . It 's a privilege . Honey , don 't bother him . That 's all right . Doesn 't she have pretty spots on her back ? Yes , she has . Commander ? It 's just a simple marine secretion , although there is something that puzzles me . I 'd like to run another series of tests on it tomorrow . I 'll call you . I 'll wait for your call . You can get me on 254 . 254 ? That 's right . My ladybug . You forgot my ladybug ! Maybe it 's on the floor somewhere . Don 't worry about it . Sandy , you can find another ladybug . But I don 't want another one , mommy . I tell you what , when I get home , I 'll see if I can find her . If I do , I 'll bring her back , okay ? Okay . He 's cute . I guess so . Did you mention that you were available ? Somehow it didn 't come up . If I were you , it would have . You 're a character . Ready to go home now ? I guess so . I 'm leaving now , doctor . 'Night . Excuse me . That 's okay . Just consider me a piece of furniture . Sandy , come here . Look . I 've got a surprise for you . I found her for you . Thank you . I 'll give her a good talking to . I wouldn 't be too severe on her . Thank you very much . You 're welcome . Goodbye . Goodbye . Cmdr. Twillinger ? That 's right . Nate brown . How do you do ? You know Josh Peters , sheriff 's office . We 've met . I 've been with this office for 15 years , but I 've never seen anything like this . Have you , Josh ? Afraid not . I 've seen a lot of people die in different ways . What caused it ? It 's hard to tell . A puncture wound , I think . Both bodies taken from the sea were totally drained of blood and water . What would make that happen ? I have no idea . The wound could 've been made by any sharp object and naturally the body would bleed . But simple bleeding wouldn 't cause this . It happened near the research lab ? Yes . But they say there 's no connection . Maybe . Take a look at the microscope . You 're looking at a piece of skin . Usually when a body is left in water , the epidermal tissues become swollen . But this is like leather . It doesn 't even resemble human skin anymore . Skin on a man over 100 would have 3 times the amount of moisture . What about the other man we found on the boat ? A stroke . A stroke ? There 's a technical name for it , but that 's what it amounts to . I don 't understand you . What could cause a stroke in a man that young ? In that age group , only 2 things could cause a stroke : Violent anger or fear . You can rule out anger . Hm-mmm . In my opinion , the man you found on the boat was literally scared to death . Do you have enough deputies to post a quarantine on all the beaches until we find out what happened out there ? Yeah . I 'll get right on it . Good . Thanks again for your help . Not at all . You boys care for a sandwich ? Got tuna fish and minced ham on rye . No , thanks . It 's nice and cold . Close the beach ? I got 22 people staying here . Sorry , we 've got orders . Nothing we can do . That 's swell . So everybody should go home , is that it ? Did you look at the temperature today ? Yes , we know it 's hot . 120 at 3 : 00 . So nobody swims . What 's wrong with the water ? We got a bulletin , Mr. Davis . That 's all we know ! Okay . Dr. Rogers ' office . Yes , commander . Just a moment . Dr. Rogers , cmdr . Twillinger on line 1 . Yes , commander . Yes , we 're working on it . We hope to have something , late today or tomorrow . Tomorrow ! Look , doctor , that 's the only clue we 've got . I could have sent it to San Diego by now . Hold on , commander , don 't pressure us . We don 't need it . I 'll call you as soon as I finish . I 'll be in my office . I 've just been read the riot act by our friend from naval intelligence . Don 't let him bother you , I 'll give you a character reference . I 'm ready to run a geiger count on the stuff from los Alamos . Good , go ahead . That 's strange . Is that the stuff from the boat ? Yes . What 's it register ? 0.15 . And your last reading on the salton sea ? Normal , 0.034 constant . That 's odd . This is from the same water . Why the difference in the radioactivity ? We 'd better run a check test . Hello , Larry . Mrs. Simms . Bob . What 'll it be ? We 'd like to talk about your beach . About my beach ? I 'm going now , ma . All right . Jody . Jody ! Yes . Who you going out with ? You know . I said , " who ? " Morty . Morty . Sure , I might have known . I got nothing against servicemen , but that morty 's no good . You hear that ? I hear . Ma , look at me . I 'm a big girl now . Grown up . Can 't you understand that ? You won 't pay attention to me anymore . That isn 't what I mean . I don 't want to hurt you . But there are times when I 've got to use my own judgment about things . It has to be that way . Please try to understand . All right . Just you get home early . I will . I got a terrible headache . I 'm sorry , ma . Goodnight . You were saying ? About your beach . I 'm afraid you 'll have to close it up temporarily . No swimming . Mort ? Mort ? Where you been ? Ma , she 's ... Ma what ? Nothing . She 's screaming at everybody tonight . Forget it . Pretty girl . Ha . Pretty girl , where 's your suit ? Underneath , silly . It 's sure a beautiful night . Did you get a look at that moon ? Catch me . Come on . I 'll race you to the float . You haven 't got a chance . Morty . Morty ? Mort . Mort . Ah . Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! I 'll tell you what happened . That boy ran off somewhere with Jody . I know it . He 's no good . I warned her . I said , " why don 't you go out with a nice young man ? " But no , she 's just like her father was : No sense . The boy didn 't report back to the base at all last night . Are you sure he was with your daughter ? Of course I 'm sure . Did you see him ? I didn 't have to see him . Jody herself told me she was going out with him . Uppity as you please . And after all I 've sacrificed and done for her , not a word of appreciation . You 'd think that at least she 'd ... May we take a look around ? No , go ahead . Her room 's in there . Let me have it . No , give it . Wait a minute . I don 't care . Give it to me . It 's mine , I found it . There 's some kids out there with a sailor 's cap . What ? Some kids . What do kids got to do with it ? I don 't know . Give it to me . I don 't care . Come here . Just a minute , son . Let me take a look at that cap . Did you find this cap ? That boy , Freddy , was trying to take it from me . Yes . Where 'd you find it ? Over there . It don 't belong to nobody . It don 't belong to you , does it ? No , it doesn 't . Will you show me where you found this cap ? Come on . There . What 's that ? A uniform or at least part of one . Did your daughter and her boyfriend ever swim here ? Swim ? I don 't know . You don 't think they could ... Jody ! Jody ! Oh . Oh , baby ! I could cut out my tongue for the things I said to you . Oh , baby . Josh ! Josh ! What 's up ? I don 't know . But that 's the same thing we found on the side of the boat . Dr. Rogers says it 's highly radioactive . I better call and have him investigate the bottom of the sea , before somebody else is killed . Man , it 's cold down there . I 'll get price to get you some coffee . Do you want us to move out again ? No , not yet . There 's a rock formation i want to check with a geiger counter . As soon as I fix my regulator . Thanks . Any sign of them ? Nothing . Those kids are probably off on a honeymoon . I hope so . That 's it . Thanks . Okay , let 's go . Keep a sharp eye , will you ? Believe me , we haven 't seen a thing , except a few fish the size of your left hand . Fine . Just be careful . Sure thing . How rough does it usually get ? It depends on the wind . As a rule , there 's not much current . Then if the bodies are down there , they 'll be easy to find . Should be . Unless ... Unless what ? I 'd rather not conjecture . Okay ? Yes , sir . We 've got you on the frequency . Right . We 're still descending . What 's your depth ? 40 feet . 60 feet . We 're leveling off . Good . Try a reading . Doctor , I 'm now checking the rock formation . Reading is normal . Normal . Good . What 's the bottom like ? Doctor , about the same . We 're going down again . It looks like there may be some kind of cave out under us . How deep are you ? 80 feet . Still dropping . That 's most unusual . Why ? We 've been over this area a dozen times , the maximum depth is 65 feet . Don 't take any chances . Don 't worry . 97 feet . 100 . 125 . We 've leveled off again . I think we 're at the bottom of some kind of huge cavern . We see some kind of peculiar object ahead . Hang on . Doctor , I get a reading of 1.038 . What is it ? I 'm not sure . Some kind of marine growth , I think . Circular . About 6 feet . Almost transparent . We 'll try to cut it loose . I 'll send down a net . Lower the net , boys . Okay . Take it up . Is everything all right ? No problems . We 're still looking . Hold off and come up till we check what 's in the net . Okay . We 've found the girl . Can you get her up quickly ? It 'll only take a minute . Okay , but don 't take any longer . My tank . What ' s wrong ? Blake 's tank is caught in the undergrowth . Do you need any help ? No , we 're okay . Oh ! Johns ! Johns ! Answer me , Johns ! I 'm okay . It got Blake . What 're you talking about ? I 'm coming up . Get help . Oh , my god . What happened ? Oh , my god . His body . He died right in front of me . I couldn 't help him . I 've got to go back . Talk sense . What 's down there ? I don 't know , I never saw anything like it . Like what ? A creature . A giant creature . You 're not going back down there . Take your hands off me , i ' ve got to kill it ! I said , " you 're not going back down ! " Stay out of this , I 'll take care of him . There 's no time for hysterics . What are we fighting ? I don 't know . Was there just one of these creatures ? I think so . There was a cave , outside that thing . An egg . That must be one of its eggs . Behind you ! The eye . Get the eye ! Keep those depth charges moving . Hurry up , boys , we don 't have much time . The commander wants to leave in 5 minutes . The Pentagon is sending admiral greenhouse for the conference . Good . We 're keeping the egg in the lab under observation . We should know more about it by then . I issued a press release saying the Navy is conducting routine tests with underwater explosives . That should cover us for the moment . No sense in starting a panic . Excuse me , sir . They 're about finished loading . You want to take a look ? Be about 5 minutes , doctor . Excuse me . Would you sign these ? Did you get a hold of Connie ? No , but I left word for her to come down here . Thank you . If you have any problems , let us know . The chief of staff has authorized full cooperation . We 'll see you in the morning . Thank you , captain . What 's going on ? Did Mars finally invade us ? Another secret ? Where 's George ? Where 's George ? Connie , I couldn 't help it . Where 's George ? What 's happened to my husband ? Connie , step in here with me for a moment . Where 's Dr. Rogers ? He 's in the radio shack . He 's with Connie . Oh . We 're about ready to shove off . Leave them alone , please . Are you all right ? I 'm fine . I don 't think you are . What 's wrong ? I should be with Connie , telling her how you get over it . The trouble is , you don 't . I mean , I didn 't . Would you like a cigarette ? No , thank you . When tom was killed , they said all those things to me . Tom ? My husband . I 'm sorry , I didn 't know . It 's funny , you go around for days and you don 't believe it . You think it can 't be true . And one of those days you get to thinking , " it is true . He isn 't coming home . " And you say it out loud , " he isn 't coming home . " Don 't listen to me , I 'm over it now . It was 2 years ago . I couldn 't go in there with Connie . Not right now . What did your husband do ? He was a pilot . He was stationed in San Diego . Sandy and I moved here afterwards . It takes a great deal of courage to start over . I had a lot of happiness , a lot of things to think about and remember . And I had Sandy . I couldn 't fall apart . I guess not . You know something ? You 're easy to talk to , and I didn 't think you would be . Gail . Yes , doctor . Would you take care of Connie , please ? Of course . We 're waiting for you , doctor . How is she ? She 's resting . She 'll be all right . Good . Men , Dr. Rogers has some final instructions for you . Everything that 's happened , or that will happen on this expedition , is classified " top secret . " Is that clear ? We 've crippled and may have killed this giant creature . To make sure it 's dead , we 're going to saturate the area with depth charges . But our most important job is to find all its eggs . Once they 're located , Dr. Johns will make a quick survey of them and then they must be totally destroyed . Cmdr. Twillinger will be in charge of the underwater demolition . I guess that 's all . All right , men . Let 's go . Believe me , it 's best for you to stay here tonight . I 've got plenty of room . What are they doing ? Come on . What you see here is the formation inside the egg sac we found near the creature 's lair . You 'll notice the shell is beginning to harden . There 's quite a bit of definition in the head . Until our studies are completed , we 're keeping it alive by controlled water temperature . You 'll notice that the thermostat reads 38 degrees exactly . Is there any danger that the egg might hatch ? No , the temperature is low enough to keep it from hatching . As long as this knob is set so the temperature remains constant , there 'll be no problem . I see . Gentlemen , we believe that this creature is of the same family as the historically documented kraken . A giant sea beast that was the direct ancestor of the modern water mollusk . I 've had some film of common mollusks flown in from San Diego . I 'd like you to compare it with the creature that attacked us . Dr. Johns ? Yes . Right this way , please . Sheriff , would you cut the lights , please ? As most of you know , the mollusk family is comprised of animals with a soft body usually covered by a hard shell . This is gonaxis kibweziensis . It 's one half inch in diameter . You 'll note the similarities between it and the giant creature in the salton sea . For example , the gonaxis has a predatory nature . It attacks other living creatures , will devour them , eat their flesh . The larger it is , the larger its appetite . This is a branch of the gonaxis , the euglandia . It shreds the flesh of its victim with scissor-like teeth . Some species suck out the body fluids in much the same manner as the creature with which we 're dealing . As I mentioned , most of these creatures live entirely in the water . But it 's not unusual to find them on land , searching for food . The same thing is true of our kraken . These mollusks are only recently hatched , yet they 're as large as the adult . The reason being that they developed to full growth within the egg sac . From the instant they 're born , they 're hungry . That bubbly secretion you see is formed in the digestive system . It acts as a defensive weapon . Incidentally , it 's chemically similar to the secretion we found on the boat . That 'll give you an idea . It 's interesting , but what 's the point ? The creature was killed and all the eggs were destroyed . That 's right , but we 're not sure we destroyed all the other creatures . Do you think that more than one has developed ? We 're sure of it . From the number of shells in these photographs , I 'd say there are at least 10 of these giant creatures , each one with the capacity to lay several thousand eggs in its life cycle . There was a cave here which we sealed with explosives and probably trapped the rest of them inside . We have to be sure , doctor . That 's impossible , because the mouth of that cave is covered with tons of rock . If any did escape , it will have to surface sooner or later . It won 't find enough food in the salton sea , it 'll get hungry . We can keep a 24-hour beach patrol . Yes , I think that 's imperative . But our real danger doesn 't lie at the sea . Let 's remember that these creatures can travel overland , too . A few miles from here is the all-American canal system , which irrigates the entire imperial valley and then in time empties into the Gulf . I don 't want to alarm you unduly , but if just one of these creatures lived and got by the patrols , into the canal system and multiplied , the species could threaten the entire world . First , devouring all life in the oceans and then , foraging on land . Can you imagine an army of these things descending on one of our cities ? What caused it ? Where 'd they come from ? We don 't know , we can only guess . Perhaps you saw this article here in life . A few miles from here , this lakebed existed in a dry state , void of life for many years . Then a flash flood filled it with about 2 feet of water . In a few days , there were millions of shrimp in that lake . They hatched from dormant eggs that were there for centuries . I believe the same thing happened here . I think that a pocket of eggs from this prehistoric species was trapped here , below the bottom of the salton sea . Suppose an earthquake caused a fissure to open at the bottom of the sea , allowing water to seep down to this pocket . Because this water was slightly radioactive , and because the eggs had a capacity to absorb this radioactivity , they found an environment that was perfect in which to hatch and grow . Then a more severe earthquake widened the fissure , allowing these creatures to escape into the sea . I 'd like to alert the civilian defense . Mr. Patterson , there are 100,000 people in this valley . A move like that would lead to hysteria . I suppose that 's true . I think we should set up a joint patrol around the sea , combine your staff with the sheriff 's office , set up a headquarters at the air base and coordinate from there . Does that sound practical to you ? Yes , sir . How about your office , sheriff ? Sounds fine to me . I 'm due to report back to joint chiefs of staff . I 'll tell them that even if there are some surviving creatures , there 's still no national danger . Unless , as you said , some escape from the sea into the all-American canal . That 's correct . I 'll be in touch with you , commander . Call me if anything develops . Very good , sir . Good day , gentlemen . Good day . Good day . The governor advised me to offer you any assistance you may need . We appreciate that very much , thank you . Yes , doctor . I think we 'd better meet in my office to set this up . Okay . Good night . Good night . Gail , how 's Connie ? All right . She 's staying with me for a while . Good . I feel kind of embarrassed today , commander . Why ? The personal things i said yesterday , I hope I didn 't embarrass you . You didn 't . I don 't usually carry on that way . You ought to , at least once in a while . We 're on our way back to the base now , and we have to eat sometime . What I mean is , why don 't you let me take you to dinner tonight ? I found a wonderful place to eat in mexicali . Thank you , but i can 't leave Connie . I mean , I shouldn 't . Okay . I 'm awfully sorry . If you should change your mind ... I never do . If you should , the number 's 254 . 254 . You already have it . So I have . Good night . Good night . Anything happening ? Nothing . Nothing but moonlight . Wallace and hanson will replace you at 10 : 00 . Thanks . Okay . That about ties it up . This reminds me of last year . We had a stakeout on a federal bank for 3 months . What happened ? Not a thing . You sure you won 't come home and take potluck ? Jenny wouldn 't mind . Much . No , come on ! No , I 'll get something from the cafeteria . Okay , see you later . You bet . This is just like that federal bank stakeout last year . The only trouble is , nothing ever happens . No , mom . I don 't know . Yes , I 'll hurry . No , I don 't know how late . This is Walker , section 5 north . All clear . Check . Oni , twillinger . Hi . I had to come to town with some reports for the doctor . I know it 's past dinnertime , but if you hadn 't already eaten , I ... Yeah , I 'm starving . Where are you ? Right , I know where it is . I 'll be there in 5 minutes . Right , goodbye . I 'll check with you in half an hour . Okay . You can take mine , too , please . You certainly don 't eat very much . I don 't know how you keep going . I had a big lunch . That reminds me , I 'd better check in to base again . Excuse me . ♪ Nothing 's happened so far , nothing at all . Did you make a wish ? Yes . I 've got a confession to make . I bet I know what it is . You 're still hungry . No . What I said about coming into town wasn 't true . I went home and Connie felt like being alone so that made me feel lonely , too . So I decided to call you . That 's not a confession , that 's a compliment . You want a ballpoint pen , senor ? What ? Very cheap , senor . 8 pesos . Big bargain . No , thanks . Si ! No . Much ink inside . No , thank you . She will write 2 million miles , no refills . How much is 8 pesos ? 65 cents . All right , bud . You got yourself a deal . Thank you , senor . Hey , kid , my pen ! What are you grinning at ? Twill . What 's so funny ? That kid walked off with my money . Your face . You 're so serious . Big bargain . You 're really much too serious . Maybe you 're right . But I don 't think you 're like that underneath . What did you want to do when you were little ? First , I wanted to be a fireman , and then a forest ranger , then I guess i wanted to be a cop . Really ? Mm-hmm . Senor , look , you like red ? I got red , white , green , blue , red and white , black and white , green and red ... Blue and white . No blue and white . Red , red and white , black and white , green and red ... Look , I 'll just take this one . Go on , scoot . Shoo ! Thank you , senor ! Where were we ? You were just going to take me home . I 'm afraid it 's getting very late . It 's only 10 : 15 . Want to stop at the four oaks for a beer ? I told Betty I 'd come right home after our shift . So you 'll be half an hour late . Take the canal cutoff and we 'll be there in 5 minutes . Check that car ahead . You better take a look . Yeah . What happened ? What 's wrong ? It . It was ... Better get him to the hospital . Radio headquarters . Right . No ! Mary Jean . Mary Jean . It could have gone a dozen different ways . Every half-mile , there 's a junction and the locks roll open . I don 't understand . Did you check all the patrols on the sea ? Yes , they 're certain nothing got past them . It 's 23 miles from that sea to that canal , and there 's no connection by water . I just got a report . A farmer 15 miles from here found 2 of his cattle dead . Shriveled up . He thinks they were attacked about 10 : 00 last night . 10 : 00 ? How 's that possible ? We know that the boy and girl were attacked here at 10 : 00 . Of course . There must be an underground river through which they escaped . A river that leads from the sea to one of the pools near the canal area . They leave this pool at night , and come around the canals in search of food . We 'll have to patrol the entire canal system . There 's 700 miles of canal bank in this county alone . That could take us days . We don 't have days . The egg at the lab was almost hatching when we got it . We must find their new nest , before they lay any more eggs . I 'll call air national guard . Their helicopters will work with ours . We 'll check every pool in this valley for their secretion . Good . Because the possibility of finding one pool out of thousands is remote . There 's the chance that there may be an old survey map that shows where this underground river empties into the pool . Doctor , if there is such a map , we 'll find it . Come on , we 'll use our car . This is helicopter 2-5 , reporting in . We have covered south basin . There is no sign of target pool . Bearing south-southeast . Well , now , we gave most of our map collection to the library . We 've already been to the library . We 've checked every possible source . You 're our last resort . Too bad . We don 't have many documents . We don 't have room for them . We put up a bond issue , proposition 14-a , specifically asking for a document room . Here . Here we are . Is this all you have ? I 'm sorry . Just not a speck of room . Mr. dobbs , this is very important . Have you heard of an underground river or ancient waterway that runs through the valley that would empty into a deep pool ? Dear , let me think . I can 't think of a thing . But every once in a while , somebody dies and leaves us a whole lot of documents for our room , the one we didn 't get , you understand . Proposition 14-a was defeated . If you hear anything , you can get me at the air base . Air base ? Yeah , El centro . Sure . I always cooperate with the authorities . You 'll find I 'm a very cooperative person . Thank you , Mr. dobbs . Just call on me anytime . Night or day . Give me Navy intelligence , please . Oni , yeah . Lock 23 ? Lock 23 , okay . 23 . 46 , okay , nothing sighted . We still haven 't spotted the pool where they 've nested . We have the entire irrigation system under patrol . The gatekeepers at each lock are on 24-hour guard . Someone is bound to spot one of those creatures . When they do , we close all the locks and hold it till we arrive . Then we 'll follow it back to the pool . Sounds like an effective plan . I 'll be in capt . Master 's office . All right . How many patrols have checked in ? 16 . The gatekeepers have called , except 3 . See if you can get them . Right . Sally , try locks 14 , 32 and 57 . I 'll call you back later , mom . Lock 57 . Yes , I did try , but the line was tied up . No , I haven 't seen any creature . Just plain foolishness . Hey , boys ! Get away from there ! We don 't allow no swimming here , you know that . Go on , now . Okay . Don 't go in there , Sandy . We 're going home now . When can we go swimming again ? I don 't know , dear . Then can I go look at the rabbits ? Not today , sweetie . Dr. Rogers ' office . Yes , just a minute , I 'll read you the figures on that . That was 2-3-4-5 . Yes , and 5-4-2-3 . Hello , grace . How are you today ? We have to be very quiet , because mommy is so busy . Poor grace . You 're cold . If I had a nice warm blanket , I 'd put it over you . Maybe I can figure something out . There . Is that better ? I gotta go now . Goodbye . Fine . Goodbye . Sandy ? Yes , mommy . Let 's go home . Lock 41 , okay . 41 , okay . Proceed eastward on highway 8-0 . Have you heard anything ? Not yet . We 'll keep you posted . What time were the boy and girl attacked last night ? 9 : 30 or 10 : 00 . It 's 9 : 00 now . Yeah , I know . Mm-hmm . Hey , you kids ! Don 't try to hide from me . Hey , you kids ! Hey , you kids ! Still no answer . When did you last talk to him ? At 8 : 00 . Do we have a car in that area ? There 's one within half a mile . You better call it . Get moar and Walker in car 14 . Right . This is control operations calling car 14 . This is Walker , car 14 . What 've you got ? Proceed to canal junction 57 . Repeat . Proceed to canal junction 5-7 . Right . My god . I 'll call in . This is car 14 calling control operations . Over . Come in , car 14 . Tell Josh we found the gatekeeper dead , just like the others . Have them stay there . Radio all the patrols . Roger . Close everything that leads to lock 57 . We 'll try to hold it long enough to follow it . Right . Sally , give me a line . Commander ! Could I help you ? I 'm here to see cmdr . Twillinger . Will he be back ? Not for some time . You just missed him . I know . Well . Is there anything I could do ? No . I think maybe I better wait . If it 's all right ? He may be gone for hours , Mr ... Dobbs . Lewis Clark dobbs . Mr. dobbs . Well . I 'll wait . That 's right . Close the locks south from juncture 302 to 23 . Right . And keep them closed till you hear from me . I called in the minute i heard that noise . I thought to myself , " something 's breaking out there . " " There 's sure something breaking . " So I come out to see what it was . And there it was . Why weren 't you out here ? The lock has an emergency release . You could 've stopped it . Listen , commander , I was only doing what they told me . I didn 't know you wanted to follow it . You didn 't ? Thanks , anyway . I know how you feel , but it wasn 't his fault . Twill ? Yeah ? What do we do now ? Wait for another one . Come on , let 's go back . Commander . Lewis Clark dobbs . Hello , Mr. dobbs . What is it ? It 's probably not anything at all . I see . How 's it coming , sailor ? The same , sir . Nothing ? No , sir . You said it was important , you know , about the map . Yeah ? A very strange thing happened . I was looking for these papers . Actually , I was looking for this petition . We 're campaigning again for proposition 14-a , the one that was defeated , and there was this folder . And in the folder , there was this map . I remembered it because Mrs. de fauna de porto had asked me to take care of it , and then she passed on . I told you about it , didn 't I ? A very great loss . You see , the de fauna de porto family settled this valley . A most distinguished family . Is this a river ? No . But the Indians dug Wells along there , apparently . Here . It says here , in Spanish , of course , " the Wells of life . " I read 18 foreign languages . Clem ! Sir ? Any boys working in the photo lab ? Not now . Get them down there right now . I want this blown up and graphed . Order me a helicopter at dawn and notify Dr. Rogers . Right . Drop us down a little . That 's the one . How do you want to proceed ? We radio for equipment , then dive and destroy them . Chances are they 're dormant now , but any sound may attract them . So set your charges and get out . Right . Are you ready ? Are you ? I think so . Doctor , your lab 's on the mobile phone . Thank you . Yes , Gail . I sent you those cylinders you asked for . They should be there in 10 minutes . Thank you . We may need them . Hold on a minute . Gail ? Yes , twill . Hi ! Is everything all right ? Are you all right ? Everything 's fine . Don 't worry . I 'll call you later . Okay . Twill ? Yeah ? Take care . I always do . Goodbye . I 'll take it . I have you on the frequency . We 're moving through a dense growth . Can 't tell what 's ahead from here . We 've reached the bottom . We 've found them . Any problems ? No , I think we can get them all . It took you 3 minutes to get down . Allow yourselves 2 minutes leeway . Will do . We set the first charge . The pin on my last charge is stuck . Twill , Johns is in trouble . You 're 30 seconds past safe time . Start up . You 're 42 seconds past safe time . Start up . Are you on your way up ? Just a second . We 're on our way up . You have 25 seconds . Come on . Let 's help pull them up . Hurry up . You fellows all right ? Uh-huh . Uh-huh . I wanna make a check in half an hour , when the sediment clears . All right . I 'm sorry about what happened down there . You don 't have to be . I made a mistake . When I signaled you , I was sure the pin was loose . Forget it , anyone 's entitled to an honest mistake . Anyway , you saved my neck . Thanks . Excuse me , I 've got a phone call to make . It 's a great relief knowing we got them all . Yeah . You know , I guess I was wrong about that guy . The commander takes a bit of knowing . Mobile operator . Give me Dr. Rogers ' office . The Navy lab , salton sea , 2-2-1 . Johns is going to stay to load up . Would you mind dropping me at the lab ? Sure , jump in . I called Gail at the lab , but the line was busy . Oh , really ? They 're all down at the pool , sir . Yes , I will . Hi , honey . Hi , mommy . I got dressed by myself . And a good job you did , too . Have you had your orange juice ? Yes . We 'll have breakfast in a little while . Why don 't you go play ? Dr. Rogers ' office . I 'm sorry , he 's not here now . I can take a message if you wish . Yes , captain . I 'm sorry , he was called away . Grace ? Ah ! Mommy ! Sandy ! Honey , stay where you are ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Don 't move ! It 's all right , honey . Someone will come soon and help us . Mobile operator . Could you try the Navy lab again ? Salton sea , 2-2-1 . That 's right . Still busy . Want to stop and get some breakfast ? No , thanks . I had toast and coffee when I got up . But if you want to stop ... No , I can wait . Sandy . Do you see that window ? Yes . Can you get up there ? Try ! I can 't . Try ! I can 't ! Oh , god . I want you to close your eyes . I want you to close your eyes and put your head right there . Don 't open them for a little while . Good morning , commander . Doctor . Go ahead . Gail ! Doctor ! Get help ! Get help ! Can you hear me ? Yes . Can you hear me ? Yes . Now listen , when I holler come out of there . Now ! All right . Now ! Here , take it easy now . You 're still shaken . Yes , I am . But i feel all right now . What about you ? I think I 'm all right . You 're just fine , honey . You know something ? You can go swimming again . Can I ? Yes , ma 'am , you can .

 Ouch ! Dr. Campbell ? Dr. Campbell ? Dr. Campbell ? Hey , Dr. Campbell ? Are you sick or something ? Doc- - Doc- - Get Dr. B- - Beecher . Oh . Yes , sir . Don 't you worry , I 'll get him right away . Hi , Tommy . Matt Campbell 's sick . He sent me for your dad . Carol , tell daddy Matt Campbell 's sick . - What 's the trouble ? - I don 't know , Ma 'am . He 's just lying there awful sick . He asked me to get Doc Beecher . I 'll tell him . You 'd better go on home , Tommy . - But , Ma 'am ... - The doctor will go right over . - Doctor ... - Just remember that . Well , you try not to worry about things , Carrie . What ? Speak louder , young man . I said , try not worry , and take these pills three times a day . Before meals ? Well , after meals . Thank you , Doctor . Yes , Carol ? Matt Campbell 's had another attack . - Oh . - Who ? Who 's sick ? Matt Campbell . Oh , him , him sitting up in that big house all day , doing the-Lord-only-knows-what to those poor animals . And just to be on the safe side , Carol , - you better call an ambulance . - Yes , Doctor . And good-bye , Carrie , and don 't forget those pills . What ? What did he say ? He said to take the pills . Oh . - Matt ? Hey , Matt , what 's wrong this time ? Here we go . Let 's get you over to the couch , huh ? Here we go . Attaboy . Easy , now . There we go , Matt . Okay . Paul , what time ? Tell me . I got to know what time . It 's a little after 6 : 00 , Matt . They 've got to know what I 've done , but nobody will . I 'm- - I 'm dying now . Well , you 're not dying , Matt . You 'll be fine . All these years , all these years of experimenting , I have got the answer now , Paul . It 's- - It 's , it 's , it 's right here . Take it . It 's- - It 's the- - the ... pills . Hey , how about that ? 360 ! Can this boy play darts or not ? This just doesn 't seem to be your day . I can 't seem to get warmed up . I 've done a lot better . Hiya , Doc . Hiya , Buck , George . Hmm , brought you the medical report on Matt Campbell . Good . Thanks , Doc . It was a simple coronary . His heart had been pretty bad for years now . Yeah . Poor guy didn 't have any relatives . I know . So , I called the University of Bigelow , talked to a Dr. Beaumont , he 's bringing someone up tomorrow to take over . Beaumont ? Will Beaumont ? You know him ? Well , we went to school together . No kidding . Well , he 's head of the psychology department now . Is that a fact ? Yeah . He seemed pretty upset over Campbell 's death . What 's going on in that lab , anyhow ? I don 't really know , Buck . The man never talked much . I think he was doing some research about primitive instincts , regressing the brain or something . - I don 't know . - Wow . Well , I got a lot of house calls to make , - I may not ... - Say , Doc , say hello to old Mrs. What 's-her-name , for me , will ya ? - Who ? - You know , your nurse . Well , got a new girl now . Yeah ? I don 't think she 's quite your type , fat , bifocals , buck teeth . But she 's a good , hard worker . Doc , I 'll remember not to get sick . - Hi , Daddy . - Oh , hi , Marion . - Hello , Doctor . - I 'll be with you in a minute . Oh , what have you been up to all day , huh ? Practicing . I 'm always practicing something . Yeah . I guess you are . I wish you 'd get those teachers to pay their bills with money . Oh , they 'll pay me when they can . Here , let me help you , Daddy . Oh , thank you , darling . Let me get my pencil . Yeah . What 's the matter with Marion ? She said she felt dizzy all day . I know just what she means . What 's wrong ? Just another one of my headaches . But ... do you think you could hold her off for a few minutes ? Of course . I 'm sorry you feel so awful . Oh , I 'm gonna be all right , honey . Would you get me my migraine pills ? They 're in my coat there . Oh , sure . Right-hand pocket . How are you coming with your dancing ? Okay . Except I can 't figure out whether I wanna be a concert pianist or a prima ballerina . Well , why don 't you settle for being a cook , right now ? Oh , I haven 't had time for any dinner . Okay , but just because it 's you . Thank you , darling . Tell Marion to come on in here . Oh , sure . My dad says you can come in now . Sit down , Marion . Oh , what seems to be the trouble ? Well , I don 't know exactly . I think maybe it 's my heart murmur acting up again . Marion , I 'd like to ask you something . Did you hear anything about Matt Campbell ? Yes , I did . Well , maybe that sort of frightened you , huh ? Hmm ? I don 't know . Look , Doctor , I live alone , and sometimes I get scared something 's going to happen to me . My heart being the way it is . Oh , now , Marion . My folks are worried sick . I tell them not to worry , but they do . I tell them , I 've got a good job and all , but they just don 't like me to live away from the farm . Excuse me , Marion . Don 't you feel well , Dr. Beecher ? Oh , just a little tired , I guess . I 'm afraid you will have to excuse me , Marion . Do you suppose you can come back tomorrow morning , first thing ? I would like to do another electrocardiogram on you . - Oh , sure , Doctor . - Oh , thank you . Gee , I 'm sorry you don 't feel well . Oh , I 'll be all right . I 'll see you in the morning , now . Sorry . The doctor doesn 't feel very well . I 'm going to come back tomorrow , first thing . - All right . - Good night . Good night . Can I get you something ? No , no , no . Oh , I 'll be all right . I think I 'm gonna lie down for a while . You mind tell Betsy she can forget about dinner ? All right . I 'm not hungry . Oh , thank you . Oh . Nobody home . - What ? - I guess nobody 's home . Oh , uh , are you one of the doctor 's patients ? Not if I can help it . I- - I , um , I don 't believe I know you . Oh , my name is Carol Butler . Carol Butler . My , that 's a pretty name . Well , um , why don 't we go inside ? The door should be unlocked . It 's- - It 's 9 : 00 . You must be a regular customer here . Oh , well , yes , I guess I am , in a matter of speaking . Oh , the doctor must 've been called away temporarily . Hey , you can 't be the doctor 's nurse . That 's right . Uh , but you 're filling in for a friend , you know , - the plump girl ? - Plump girl ? The one with the glasses . No , look , you 've lost me some place . I 've been working here for several weeks . - Oh . - Now , what was your name ? My name- - Oh , Donnelly , Buck Donnelly . The doctor said that- - Oh , hi , Doc . - Hello , Buck . - Oh , Doctor ... - I didn 't know you 're in . - Just woke up . - Doc , can I see you a minute ? - Oh , sure . How are you feeling this morning ? Oh , I feel fine . Bifocals , buck teeth , Doc . All right . Well , what 's on your mind , besides Carol ? Well , we got a report last night there was a prowler in the neighborhood . Mrs. Whitman down the street called us . Yeah ? But she gets hysterical pretty easily , but we sent a car out anyhow , they didn 't see anything , would 've been about 11 : 00 ? Oh , I didn 't hear anything . I was sound asleep by 11 : 00 . Well , I don 't think there 's much to it . I 'm just following through . - - Excuse me , Buck . Dr. Beecher . Who ? Oh , thank you . Yes ? Marion Wilkins ? Oh , she seemed fine last night . She was coming in this morning . I don 't know anything about that , Doctor . I come in on Tuesdays to clean , and that 's all , but she looks awful sick to me . Well , I 'll be right over . Excuse me , Buck . Got to make a house call . - Marion Wilkins ? - Mm-hmm . What 's wrong ? Well , she 's one of my heart patients . Oh , thanks . I don 't think Matt Campbell 's death helped her any . I 'll be at Marion Wilkins' place , Carol . All right . - Ms. Butler . - Yes ? Do you know a good eye doctor ? Why , do you need glasses ? No . But I think doc does . I didn 't know what to do , Doctor . She just lies there like that with her eyes closed up . Can you hear me , Marion ? What is it , Doctor ? I think it 's her heart . You better call the county hospital . Ask them to send an ambulance . Yes , sir . Would you use another phone , please ? All right . It 's all right , Marion . Everything 's going to be all right . Now , don 't worry , you 're gonna be fine . Oh , no . No ! Go away . Go away ! Marion , it 's me . It 's Dr. Beecher . Yes . Yes , it 's you . Don 't touch me . Leave me alone . Don 't touch me ! - - Marion ? - - Leave me alone ! Good morning , Doctor . How is she ? She died . Oh , no . Oh , Doctor , I 'm terribly sorry . It 's all my fault . I should have helped her last night . I didn 't think it was that serious . How could you know ? It was my job to know . I 'm supposed to second-guess death , not run away from it . Another headache ? Doctor , why don 't you let yourself take a rest ? And what would all my patients do ? You could get someone in . No , I 'll be all right . Is something wrong ? No . Where 's Betsy ? Oh , she 's cleaning her room , I think . Do you suppose you could ask them to wait a little while longer ? Oh , I think so . There 's nothing really urgent . I 'll be right back . Hi , Daddy . Hi , honey . Is there an " I " in elegant ? No . What are you writing ? A letter to Aunt Sally . I 'm gonna tell her what an elegant summer we had . Oh , she 'll appreciate hearing from you . You mind if I turn this thing off ? Oh , no , here I 'll do it . Thank you . Whenever you start off like that , I know it 's something important . Well , I did wanna talk to you about something , Betsy . - You remember last night ? - Sure . When I had the headache ? Oh , sure . And I asked you to get me the pills out of my coat pocket ? You mean your migraine pills ? Yeah , um ... These were the pills , weren 't they ? Mm-hmm . You know , doctors are kind of funny . They often carry a lot of pills around with them , and I had some others last night , too . These do look sort of like the migraines , don 't they ? What 's in ' em ? Oh , nothing much , just--just aspirin . I thought maybe you might 've given me these , you know , by accident . No , Daddy , I didn 't . Well , that 's fine . You know , Betsy , I 've been thinking , you and I ought to get out on those hills for a real hike one of these days , huh ? - What do you say ? - Gee , that 'd be terrific . We don 't seem to have much time anymore , just for fun , do we ? - - Daddy ? - Hmm ? I don 't know which one of the pills I gave you . But aspirin never hurt anyone , did it ? No , honey . It never hurt anyone . Oh , hello , Buck . Willy , how 's business ? Oh , picking up , can 't complain . Marion back there ? Yeah , she is , poor little girl . Mind if I take a look ? Not at all . As matter of fact , I kind of expected you . Any reason why , Willy ? Well , you usually turn up , don 't you ? Marion ? Guess we 're having an epidemic of heart attacks . Matt Campbell , now Marion Wilkins . You think doc 's gonna ask for an autopsy ? Autopsy ? Oh , no . No need for that . It was heart , all right , plain and clear . I 've seen a lot of cases in my day . Trouble with you , Buck , you 're overanxious . Guess you ain 't had no excitement since Abe Hibbel axed his mother-in-law . And that 's the way we wanna keep it . Well , thanks , Willy . Anytime . Here , Henry . Put them right there . Will . Paul . Paul Beecher . - What are you doing here ? - Well , I heard you were coming , so I just dropped by to say hello to you . Oh ? Well , we just got into town . Yeah . Paul , this is a pleasant surprise . Years haven 't changed you . And you don 't look so bad yourself , huh ? Oh , Henry . You know , Henry is one of our top research assistants at the university , he 's going to take over Campbell 's job . I 'm just here helping him get organized . You know , Henry , Paul and I were friends many years ago - at medical school . - Yeah . How are you , Henry ? How do you do ? Henry , would you take this thing over to the desk and hook it up ? I mean , Paul , you 're gonna have to excuse Henry . Light bothers his eyes . He suffered a trauma in early childhood . His mother was burned to death when a gas heater exploded and only just has adjusted to society . Always the psychologist , aren 't you , Will ? I hear you 're head of the department now . Oh , yes , indeed . That 's wonderful . What have we got here ? Unusual . Yeah , I noticed that when I came in . They were alive yesterday . I was here with Matt Campbell when he died . - Heart attack . - Mm-hmm . That 's too bad . I didn 't know him very well . I just appropriated the funds for him . Henry ? Do you want something ? The animals are dead . Yes , I know . That 's Henry for you , phlegmatic , but seething inside , brilliant mind , brilliant . He 's just the person to carry on . Oh , well , um , what exactly was Campbell working on ? - Didn 't he tell you ? - Uh-uh . Only briefly . I know it had something to do - with the instincts , reaction . - Yeah . Well , that 's about it . It 's- - How 're you coming ? Dull knife . I cannot work with a dull knife . You know , Henry complains a lot , but deep inside , he 's a frightened child seeking approval . Will , I want you to tell me everything you know about Matt Campbell 's work . - - Why ? - Well ... He tried to tell me something just before he died . I thought maybe it might be important . Paul , I don 't honestly know too much about it myself . We 've been subsiding scientists that work on regression , to see whether it 's possible chemically to revert the animal mind to a primitive state , and if it is , whether or not we can reverse the process and advance intellect . Human intellect , eventually . Well , did Campbell succeed on what he was trying to do ? I don 't honestly know . He claimed that he developed some kind of a pill - which he thought was ... - A pill ? Say , as a matter of fact , these are probably the ones right here . They 're supposed to induce these primitive instincts by draining the blood in the brain temporarily . Well , that would induce fainting . - Let me see one of those . - Sure . Well , I imagine it would , but apparently it doesn 't harm the animals as long as they keep getting the pills . You see , they 're habit-forming . What do you mean , habit-forming ? Just that . I talked to Campbell the other day on the phone , he was very excited , but seemed to run into some kind of a problem , said that once that he 'd given the animals the pills , they had to have them practically every 24 hours , or they went wild . Wonder why those bats aren 't dead ? Will ? How sure was Campbell about this 24-hour business ? Oh , he seemed to be pretty sure about it . I don 't know , but , Paul , after all , the animals are dead except the bats , so we got to find out why . Oh , well , I 'd like to stay here and watch you work , would you mind ? It would seem the synapse leading to the portions of the brain affected suffered permanent injury in some cases , destructive process unknown . What time is it , Will ? - Hmm ? - What time is it ? My watch just stopped . Quarter after 8 : 00 . There 're no conclusions on all this stuff . Nothing that Campbell 's written makes any sense to me . Just doesn 't make sense . Yeah , I 'm having the same trouble , brilliant mind , he 's just brilliant , but unfortunately he 's rather untidy . Henry ... I wanna ask you a question . How long before you know something ? - Know something ? - Yes . What caused them to die ? This business takes patience , Paul . It 's not the kind of thing you rush through . Well , maybe not , but all I wanna know is , was it the pills that killed them ? Oh , no . No , it wasn 't the pills or lack of pills . - Something else . - Like what ? Capillary disintegration . Well , Henry , you have made progress . Look , you 're just gonna have to learn to speak up . Henry , what caused this capillary disintegration ? Disease , maybe a virus . A virus ? I 'll find it . It won 't get away from me . I didn 't know you were so interested in research . You missed your calling , Paul . Well , I am going to call it a day . And I imagine Henry will welcome the peace and quiet . Will you , Henry ? I don 't mind . Paul , uh , don 't forget to throw the switch on the electric furnace . We don 't wanna blow up the circuit . - Coming , Paul ? - You go ahead . Well , oh , Henry , I 'll be at the hotel , if you need me . - You 'll be all right ? - Of course . Yeah . - Henry ? - Yes . Why didn 't the bats die ? I don 't know . Oh , Daddy , you just gotta watch this . I 'm not watching anything . And why aren 't you in bed ? But , please , I just learned how . No , and turn off that stupid record . - But , Daddy ... - Did you hear me ? Turn it off . Daddy ? Daddy ? Daddy , I 'm sorry . Please . Daddy ? Are you asleep ? Oh , shoot . Can 't think . Yes ? Oh , Dr. Beaumont . I 'm just starting a chemical analysis of the pills . Hold it , the storm just shorted out the lights . Doctor ... I think the pills are a control serum . From the bats , they were the only animals immune . Mm-hmm . I think I 'll work on a while longer . Yes , yes . I 'll see you in the morning . Bye . Needless to say , I 'm shocked . I just can 't believe Henry 's gone . It doesn 't seem possible . Did you touch anything in here , Doc ? Oh , no , I- - Why ? Well , obviously , there 's a struggle . We 'll have to presume it was homicide . Oh , no , that 's not possible . - I don 't see how that could be . - Why not ? Well , you 'd have to know Henry . It 's possible Henry might have killed somebody , but vice versa ? - No . - Did Henry have any enemies ? No , he didn 't have any friends , either . Believe me , nobody cared whether Henry lived or died . Nobody would bother to kill him , unless , of course , it was a maniac , in that case . Paul . Paul , this is terrible . Hi , Doc . Buck , I finally got your message . I was asleep . Oh , God . Well , Doc , what do you think ? What ? Cause of death . Well , give me a chance , Buck . Dr. Beaumont tells me that when he left last night , you were still here with Henry . That 's right . How long did you stay ? I only stayed a couple of minutes . Was everything okay then ? Yeah , everything was fine . There 's nothing immediately apparent , except a couple of little marks on his throat , maybe insect bites . I wouldn 't even mention it except that ... Marion Wilkins had the same thing . You didn 't mention that at the time . Well , I didn 't think it was important enough to mention at the time . And now ? I don 't know , Buck . There 's a slight contusion on the head that could be the cause of death , but I doubt it . Well , the autopsy surgeon will be able to tell us more . Will ? What 's the matter ? Did you notice that the bats are gone ? You know , this is odd . I talked to Henry last night . He discovered that Campbell 's pills were a control serum extracted from the bats . Well , that 's hard to believe . Yes , it is . Especially when you consider they were vampire bats . Good morning , Dr. Beecher . Good morning . Well , I 'll get this sample over to the lab right away . Doc , how long before they give you the results of the autopsy ? Oh ... If I put a rush on , six hours . - Make it a rush , will you ? - All right . - You know , Buck ? - Yeah ? I can 't go along with this murder theory of yours . Well , Doc , somebody did break into that lab . All right , but you don 't kill someone by giving them a blood disease . That is , not usually . Doc ... What if someone else died of this - - ? - What did you call it ? - Capillary disintegration . - Yeah . - That is complete destruction of the body tissues . Capillary disintegration . What would you think ? Well , that would depend . It 's such a rare thing . I 'd say the odds were against it happening . Yeah . But what if it did happen ? Do you think there was someone else ? No , I guess not . All right . Well , I 'll call you later on . Okay , thanks again , Doc . Willy ? Willy ? What do you make of the fact that both Marion Wilkins and Henry Winston died with the same marks on their throats ? Well , I don 't know . It must be coincidence . Maybe . Maybe it also means she didn 't have a heart attack , huh ? But she did , Buck . You don 't believe what you 're told . That 's your trouble . But what if she didn 't ? I 'd like to know how you 're gonna know that now , with her all nicely and properly buried up in the family plot . - - Well , we can take care of that . - Buck ! You can 't go around digging up people 's graves . To get a court order , you got to have some good reason . I got plenty of reasons , Willy . Three deaths in three days . Carol ? Carol ? Are you feeling better , Paul ? Well , a little bit . I thought maybe you 'd gone . Well , I was just finishing up . Buck is coming for me . - Buck ? - Yes , he 's taking me to dinner . Oh . - Where 's Betsy ? - At dancing school . Well , I haven 't seen her all day . She thinks you 're angry with her . - Angry ? - Paul ... - What happened last night ? - What do you mean ? I mean , did you two have a quarrel or something ? No . Well , I guess maybe I did lose my temper a little bit . You know how it is with kids , so easy to hurt them , without meaning to . I think Betsy 's pretty indestructible . Carol , do you have to go with Buck tonight ? No , of course not , it was just tentative . Do you want me to work ? No . No , it isn 't that . It ... Carol , I need someone to stay with me . Stay with you ? Yes , I know I shouldn 't ask this , but , well , I haven 't been myself lately . You were right last night when you said that something had happened to me . Oh , you 've just been working too hard . No , it isn 't that , either . It 's ... I 've been using these pills that I take for my migraines as a kind of a crutch , because I haven 't felt well . And I thought ... maybe if you stayed with me , I might not take them , - might not take so many . I 'll get it . - Oh , Buck . - Hey , you look nice . Oh , thank you . I was just going to call you . Oh , look , I hate to do this to you , but I 'm gonna have to break our date tonight . - Something came up . - I was going to have to tell you the same thing . The doctor wants me to stay here . Oh , well , look , can we make it tomorrow night ? - Of course . - Good . Now , I 'd like to see the doc . - He 's in his office . - Thanks . Come in . See you a minute , Doc ? Why , sure . Anything new ? Paul , we 're getting a court order to exhume Marion Wilkins ' body . Well , what do you wanna do that for ? We just found out that Henry Winston died of a rare blood disease , a thing called capillary disintegration , whatever that is . Destroys body tissue . What 's that got to do with Marion ? Well , I don 't know exactly , but if she died of the same thing ... What makes you think she died of the same thing ? Now , Paul , I don 't doubt your judgment on this . Buck . Yeah ? Buck , I ... Something wrong , Paul ? No . Well , this thing needs your signature . Judge Watson 's waiting . Thanks a lot . Appreciate your cooperation . Don 't mention it . Good night , Carol . See you tomorrow . Well , I guess you heard . I don 't have a date . Come on , Carol . Let 's get out of here . You 're going- - go out and have dinner with me . Oh , well , it 's no trouble to fix something here . Well , I wanna go away some place , somewhere where I can relax . All right . But I 'll have to go get changed . All right . We 'll stop by your place . Fine . Oh ... - The pills . - Oh , yes . Put them in your purse , then I 'll have to ask you for them . - Here you are , Doc . - Well , thank you , Joe . - Oh , Doc . - Yeah ? I don 't wanna be imposing on you on all that , but ... Well , what is it , Joe ? Well , this would probably sound funny to you , but , well , it 's my left eye , right here . Oh , I see . It looks all right . Yeah , it looks all right , but it feels terrible . Well , why don 't you call us and make an appointment ? All right , Doc . And we 'll give it a thorough check . Okay , Doc , thanks . Oh , Doc , it 's really my wife . You see , she sleeps on that side , and , well , she 's got a terrible cold , and she keeps breathing on my eye at night , you know . And , well , I figured maybe my eye went and caught it . You know , the germs ? Well , why don 't you just come in tomorrow , and we 'll have a look at them . Okay , Doc . And bring your wife in , too . All right , Doc , thanks . You see , you 're not the only one who 's got troubles . Well , I know one thing . I 'm feeling a little better . You know , this has really done me good . Oh , I 'm so glad . Carol , you 're not prone to hysterics , are you ? Oh , I don 't think so . I mean , if I were to tell you something , something incredible , do you think you 'd believe me ? Well , if it were something true . If it were true ? Yeah . And there , we have the problem . Carol , there is something I must talk to you about . I just can 't seem to do it . Go ahead . I 'm an understanding type girl . Yeah , I know you are . - Well- - - Oh , Doc , you 're wanted on the phone . Excuse me a minute . Dr. Beecher . Yes ? Oh . Yes . Well , can 't you get Dr. Morgan ? All right . Tell the resident to stand by . Yes . Yes , right away . Carol , I 've got to go to County Hospital . An emergency abdominal . Do you want me to go with you ? No , you better- - look , would you mind waiting for me here ? Of course not . I may be a little while . I 'll try to make it as soon as I can . Oh , that 's all right . Oh , could I borrow your lighter again ? - Of course . - Oh , I 'll get it . Oh , sorry . Now , you 're gonna wait , won 't you ? Don 't worry . I 'll be here . Because I do wanna talk to you . Okay , boys , this is it . Doctor . He 's had two-quarters - of morphine , 30 minutes apart . But how long was the last injection ? About 15 minutes . Doctor ? Yes , I 'm ready . Puncture . Give me a # 00 suture . Doctor ? Okay . You 'll have to go on . There , I think that should do it . Nice job , Doctor . I didn 't think he 'd make it . Neither did I. We 'll put him in 107 , Doctor . - What ? 107 . Take over for me , Bailey . I can 't stay . - - what ? - - I can 't stay . But , Doc ... Hello ? This is Dr. Deecher . Is Carol Butler there ? No , as a matter of fact , she just left two minutes ago . Said to tell you she 'd be home if you wanted her . She left ? But she can 't have left . Are you sure ? Well , that 's what she said to tell you , Doc . No ! Okay , boys , open it up . Look , I don 't like this . Take it easy , Willy . Take it easy . All right , let 's go . - Ooh . - Oh . I can 't believe it . I must 've made a mistake . This can 't be the one . Why , Mrs. Dietz , what on earth are you doing out at this hour ? This is our constitutional . Last week , I said to Priscilla , " Priscilla , you and I just don 't get enough exercise . " And what did Priscilla say ? She agreed with me , but then she doesn 't have much choice . Good night , Mrs. Dietz . Good night , Carol . Come along , Priscilla . Mrs. Dietz ? Oh ! Oh . Oh . Come along , Priscilla . Priscilla , don 't tire out on me now . Once around the corner , and we 'll be home . Priscilla , stop making so much noise . You 'll wake everybody up . - - Who is she ? - - Is she alive ? Huh ? Must be . Hey , Daddy ! Egg 's up in one minute ! Daddy ! Come on ! Daddy , if you don 't hurry , I 'm gonna have to eat these eggs all by myself . Daddy ! In a minute . Carol . Carrie . Carol ! Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Carol ? This is Paul . Oh , Paul . I waited and waited for you last night and then- - and all this other happened . What ? What happened ? Somebody killed Carrie Dietz last night . Carrie ? Yes . Oh , it 's the most frightening thing that ever happened . He tried to get to me first . Paul ? Paul , are you still on the line ? Paul ? Yeah . You better stay home today , Carol . Get a little rest , huh ? I will . I still feel upset . I 'll call you later . Oh ! Daddy ! What 's wrong ? What happened ? The mirror fell down . Betsy , I wanna talk to you about- - about something kind of important . I 'm going to telephone your Aunt Sally today . - What for ? - Well , I thought I 'd ask her if she 'd let you ... come and live with them for a while . - Live with them ? - Mm-hmm . But where would you live ? Here . Well , you can 't live here without me . Who 'd feed you and take care of you and everything ? Oh , I 'd get along fine . I don 't wanna live with them . Betsy . Betsy , if you were over in Bigelow , you 'd go to a really wonderful school . There are a lot of kids there , nice kids . You 'd get a good education . Dad ? Are you mad at me or something ? No , honey . I 've never been mad at you . I just want you to have a good home . And you can 't have that here ... with me- - with me being gone all the time . Now , look , with Aunt Sally ... She 'd be there every day at home with you . Oh , look , look , look , honey , please , don 't cry . Please , don 't . All right , all right . We won 't talk about it anymore . But you think about it , huh ? Now , come on , come on . I got a lot of patients to see today ... and a lot of things to finish up . Come on , come on . That 's my girl . I bet those eggs are stone-cold by this time . - There you are , Ms. Miller . - Thank you , Doctor . Now , you see that that boy gets plenty of rest . Yes . About our bill , Doctor ... Oh , now , don 't you worry about that . Just pay what you can , when you can . We 're awful lucky , Doctor . Having you around to take care of us . I 'm going out for a while , Betsy . Oh , okay . And look , honey , I may not be here when Aunt Sally comes . Aren 't you coming back ? Of course I am , honey . I was just thinking , in case I 'm not back in time , you 'd better go on home with Sally , and I 'll call you there . All right , Daddy . Good-bye , Betsy . Take good care of yourself . I will . Daddy ? Daddy , I love you . I love you , too , honey . Good-bye . Well , Paul . I 'm worried you frightened me half to death . - Sorry . - I wasn 't expecting you . Maybe better get you a key , huh ? - Been here long ? - No , not too long . Will , I wanted to talk to you . I 've been trying to get you all day . Oh , well , I 've been at Bigelow all day . The university decided they wanted to continue with the experiment , but ran in a bit of a trouble finding a replacement . Well , for pity 's sakes , Paul , what is it ? I never could stand suspense . Well , I- - Well , a patient of mine , Carrie Dietz , a wonderful old lady , was killed last night . I know , it 's a shame . Well , I talked to Duck this morning . I killed her . - What you say ? - I said , I killed her ! Paul , what are you talking about ? I don 't know how , I don 't even remember doing it , but I 'm sure I killed her . Paul , this whole conversation 's fantastic . Please , let 's start over again . And I think I killed Henry , too . And Marion Wilkins . But ... But why ? I don 't know . I know it has something to do with those pills of Campbell 's . I started taking them , Will . - By mistake . - You mean the regression pills ? Yes . And they 've done something terrible to me . They 've turned me into ... a horrible thing , a beast . It made me kill people . Look , Paul . What you say just isn 't possible . Look , suppose you did take those pills . They may cause a reaction in a small animal , but you 're a human being . I know what I 'm talking about , Will . How ? What proof do you have ? Look . Look at that . I 'm a scientific man , Will . I 've been keeping that notebook , trying to figure it out . Too many things have been happening . Paul , there 's not one thing here that 's conclusive . All right . Then how do you explain it ? Three people have been killed . I have taken those pills three times . I go to sleep , and when I wake up , I don 't remember anything for a while , and then suddenly , there 's something in my mind . A dream . Well , not a dream , a face . First , it was Marion , and yesterday it was ... Henry . And today , it was Carrie Dietz . What do you propose to do about this ? Well , I 'm going to tell Buck . What else can I do ? I just wanted to talk to you first . In other words , you want me to confirm this ? Yes , I guess so . Look , Paul . Before you ruin your reputation and your livelihood in this community , - let me give you some advice . - Oh , Will ... Now , listen to me , Paul . I 've seen sick men before . Now , I know about men , and I know what you 're feeling is nothing more than an emotional state probably brought on , at least abetted , by these confounded pills . Will , you told me yourself , these pills were from vampire bats . Exactly . But , Paul , that doesn 't make you another Dracula . You found a strong suggestive influence there , that 's all . You think so ? It 's my opinion you need a complete rest . Well , you 're wrong , Will . Look . Paul , people depend on you here . I don 't wanna see you destroy your life . It 's a useful life , Paul . I don 't wanna see you destroy it over a hallucination like this . No hallucination ! But suppose it is . Look , suppose you confessed to that killing last night . Paul , you 'll never be able to pick up your work here again . It 's a small town , Paul . It- - It 's a small town . People don 't forget . You know you got to wait . Wait ? Wait for what ? 11 : 00 ? - 11 : 00 ? - Yeah . That seems to be the hour . That 's as long as I can go without the pills . Now , nonsense . All right , Paul . I 'll keep you from taking the pills . Now , you can trust me . I 'll stay with you until 11 : 00 . I can 't let you do that , Will . It 'd be too dangerous for you . Paul , give yourself a chance . Just give yourself a chance . Okay , Willy , that 's all I need . You can take them out , please . - Oh , hello , Buck . - Doc . - - Hi , Willy . - Hi , Buck . It 's incredible . I 'm having the bodies , what 's left of them , sent to the university lab . I 've never seen such total cellular destruction . By the way , Buck , I owe you an apology . So I 'm right , there is a killer . - How 'd he do it ? - Well , it seems that this- - this maniac extracts a small amount of blood from his victims ' throats . And then because he carries the disease virus in his saliva , he transmits it to them . But for some reason , he remains immune himself . I don 't get it . I don 't get it . How could somebody build up something like that in their body ? Maybe an answer to that as soon as the university isolates the virus . That 'll probably be tomorrow , they promised to call you . That 'll be too late , Doc . Too late ? Yeah , I 've got men covering the whole town . If he sticks to his pattern , someone will die tonight . There was one common factor in all the animals dissected , an almost complete cell deterioration . However , in trying to break it down into cause and effect , once again we come against that unknown factor , the origin of the virus . Oh , Will , could you stop that ? My head 's splitting wide open . Do you suppose there 's a sedative in this place ? A strong one ? I think so . Here 's ... Yeah , here we are . I need it . I need it now . Well , you may need it more later , Paul . I think we 'd better wait . There 's one thing , Paul . These pills , do you have some with you ? Yes . Give them to me , huh ? No , I 'll keep them . Paul , if I 'm going to help you , I have to have them . I don 't know that I can give them up . You don 't know what it 's like . Let me be the judge , huh ? Thank you . No , don 't do that , Will . I 've got to be able to get to them if I need them . Well , you can , Paul . It 's just a wooden drawer . - And there is a key . - No ! I can 't be responsible . Nonsense . Paul , let go of my arm . Oh . Oh . Oh , come on , Will . Help me . I 've got to have them . I can 't do it . I can 't wait like this . Can 't you see what 's happening to me ? I can 't see any difference except your state of mind . Now , try to bear it just a little longer . No , I can 't . You got to help me . Look , I 'm gonna give you the sedative , Paul , in just a few minutes . I need it now . Please . Please ! Oh , please ! Paul . Paul . Paul , please ! Paul , stay away ! Stay back ! Paul , please ! Stay back ! Paul ! Paul ! Well , look , Sheriff , if you could keep us covered for a few more days . No , it won 't be necessary . The Highway Patrol 's helping us out , too . Right . - Here 's the file . - Thanks . - I don 't understand it . - What 's that ? Why didn 't something happen last night ? We were set for it . Donnelly . Yeah . Oh , yes , sir . What ? Yes , that is a coincidence . Yeah , I 'll check . Now , that doesn 't make any sense . What 's that ? That was Professor Yates from the university . Yeah ? They finished their test on the blood cells . So ? - What ? - So they finished the test . Yeah . He said it reminded him of something . What 's that ? He said it reminded him that Matt Campbell had been working on a rare virus , a control serum , caused some kind of capillary disintegration . What does that mean ? I don 't know , George . I don 't know . What kind of a guy do you think this Dr. Beaumont is ? He 's okay , a little odd . Mm-hmm . Think he 'd go so far as to do a little experimenting ? On human beings ? Come on . Dr. Beaumont ? Dr. Beaumont ! Ooh , it 's hot in here . Well , here 's your reason right down here . What 's that ? Ooh . Maybe we better wait for him , huh ? Yeah . Look at this , George . Hey , the light 's flashing . Talk about your absentminded professor , he 's even left this thing on . Relating to Experiment 675 , it would appear that Dr. Campbell has made a great deal of progress with the chemical structure of the entire system . However , in contrast , Experiment 703 had no such definition . Sounds like he knew what he 's talking about , all right . I 'm gonna call the university , to see if they know where he is . ... almost complete cell deterioration . Paul , Paul , please ! Paul , stay away ! Stay back ! Paul , please ! Stay back ! Stay back ! Paul , Paul ! Stay back ! Stay back ! Paul ? What are you doing here so early ? Well , I thought I 'd get a head start . I mean , things must 've piled up on you yesterday . Well , you can go on back home . I didn 't make any appointments for today . Paul , are you all right ? I 'm fine . Go on home , Carol . Please . Tell me what 's wrong . I want to help you . You wanna help me ? There 's one way you can do it . Get out of here . - Paul . - Get out of here ! Paul , I don 't understand you . I 've tried , I really have . But I know something is terribly wrong . I 'm sorry , Carol . What 's in the syringe ? Nothing . Paul ... Tell me what you 're gonna do . What 's in the syringe ? Novocaine . Oh , no . - You 're out of your mind . - Yes . - Give me that syringe . - Stay back . - You can 't do it , Paul ! - Stay back ! Oh ! Paul ! Paul , why do you wanna take your own life ? I haven 't any choice . Paul , please . Please . Sorry , Carol . There 's no time . Oh , no . Paul ! No ! No ! Keep away from me ! Keep away ! Carol ! - Give me a hand here . - Yup . Carol ! Check the house . I 'll take a look outside . Paul ! - Are you all right ? - Yes . Yes . Stay right here . Look .

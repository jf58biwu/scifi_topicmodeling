 - Now , then , m 'lad , how goes it ? - All right , Sergeant . Got these on properly ? Control Room say you keep going faint . It 's me voice , Sergeant . From so-called song in the village boozer . Your pal 's not much better . Now ... - Next subject 's due any minute . - BEA plane to Glasgow . I had him yesterday . Oh . You 're going to learn all the targets off in advance ? Useful if war breaks out ! - I never meant ... - Just keep your eyes on that radar tube . And talk loud and clear . I 'm going to make ruddy BBC announcers out of you lot if I have to soften up your gullets with my bare hands ! Here it comes now , Sergeant . - That 's funny . - What ? Where he 's showed up . Must be right off course . - Perhaps you learnt it wrong ! - It is . No , that isn 't a plane . It 's far too weak . 10,000 yards ? - No , less . - TC , calling Control Tower . Wait a minute . 8,000 . Heading this way . - Quick , get Captain Dillon . - Eh ? Control , is Captain Dillon there ? 6,500 . - Captain Dillon , sir . It 's another of them . - Yes , the other cabin 's getting it , too . 5,000 yards now . - Couldn 't be a jet ? - No , nothing so big . Nothing to be seen with these . Can you get a fix ? It must have hit about 2,500 yards from here . - Other side of the hill . - What was it , sir ? Oh , probably nothing . A jettisoned fuel tank . - Going at that speed ? - Are you an instructor on this course ? Anywhere in that circle , sir . I 'll try to get it more exact . Do it on the way . My responsibility . You carry on . Report that plane when it shows up . Nothing else . Got it ? Yes , Sergeant . It 's the one I learnt yesterday , Sergeant . TC , calling Control Room ... - Going to manage that ? - Done all I can , sir . Theoretically , it must have struck somewhere over that way . - I just hope we have some luck with this one . - Yes , sir . - It 's the third , isn 't it ? - Since we 've been here . - Still think you 've come across one before ? - Yes , sir . Before you joined us , sir . Down south , early last year . I 'd swear . - When that big flying objects scare was on ? - Yeah , that 's right , sir . All the newspapers full of stories . Suicides , people thinking it was the end of the world . One of those periodic alarms . It blew over . - Things did fall . - They were all explained away . Yes , sir . - See anything ? - Just sheep . Once they 'd got it all tidied up , they 'd want to keep it that way . That accounts for those ... orders . Orders ? On UFOs ? " Unidentified Flying Objects - " all observations of , reports on or public mention of strictly forbidden . " Don 't want more bods shoving their heads in the gas oven . Sir , there 's something going on , this next field . - What ? - A woman , seems sort of excited . Let 's have a look . Hello there ! Oh , thank goodness . Thank goodness you 've come along . - What is it ? - Tell him to let it alone , to come away . Tell him . Tell him to come away . - Show us . - Through there . My husband . Tell him to come away . You 're soldiers , he 'll have to take heed . - He 'll have to , he 'll have to . - Look . He said it come down out of the sky , sir . What is it ? Is it something he didn 't ought to touch ? Tell him , sir . It 's a meteorite , I think . You were here when this fell ? - Tell him to come away , sir . - One moment . You found it like this ? Broken ? Broken . Funny smell . Like ... Like old stables . He 's had a bit of a fright . It must have been this we tracked . Feel it . It 's still slightly warm . - Think it 's an ordinary meteorite , sir ? - I suppose so . If it wasn 't against orders for us to go any further with this , sir , what might be done ? Well , if ... There 's a man I know . His name 's Quatermass . Quatermass ? - Heard of him ? - The rocket man ! Well , Quatermass ? You 've checked for yourself now . Satisfied ? There 's no spread of radioactivity outside the shielding . - Does that help us ? - No . You 're just trying to find a loophole , some way we might be wrong . - I 'm afraid there isn 't going to be any . - The whole nuclear motor . - Face it . Exactly like the other one . - All the signs are there . Now we can read them . What you 've just done , Bernard , was more than an examination . It was a post-mortem . Firing Base . Yes , he 's here . I 'll tell him . Your daughter , sir . She has the Australian film set up . Go ahead , Leo . I want to get out of this gear . Sir , will there be any further tests ? No , none . - Your father will be along in a minute . - How 's he taking it ? - How do you expect ? - Outwardly , showing nothing . - No . - The worst way . I expected that . I suppose nothing much harder can hit one than a setback at an advanced stage . - We had no way of foreseeing it . - No ? Now , at last , there 's no doubt . - Everything tallies with what 's in here . - Not a great deal , is there ? All that survived the explosion . And enough to have saved us . Did you see this one ? They kept the records straight to the last . " Now certain nuclear motor in runaway reaction . " No response from remote control . " Evacuation proceeding . " It now seems possible that con ... " Con ? Conditions , I suppose . In the middle of a word when it happened . Poor creatures . Do you think they had any idea when they began ? No . Just a routine ground test . Even when the fuel connector went , that might have meant danger , but not complete disaster . - That broken connection began it ? - Apparently . We 're full of wisdom after the event . Sudden conditions were set up - temperatures , pressures . Coupled with unsuspected instability of new fissile material ... - Unsuspected ? Leo , why won 't you admit it ? - Not entirely , then . There was a remote mathematical possibility , but with ... with normal precautions ... The Australian research team , there was nothing they could do ? Once the runaway reaction set in , nothing . They were not testing a rocket motor any longer . They were stoking up an atomic bomb . - Horrible . - Have I kept you waiting ? - No , of course not . - Ready , Paula ? Let 's see this thing . It 's very disjointed , according to the note . Webster in Sydney did the best he could . This is the Tarooma Range , Northern Australia . That 's Webster 's voice . All apparatus was transported overland , not without difficulty . By the set date , all preparations were completed for the testing of the Quatermass II rocket . Here it is on the firing base . The chemical booster has been removed , exposing the nuclear motor for its first test at full power . Normal precautions were taken and final checks carried out according to the practised routine . Automatic cameras set in position to record experiments . This time , only those furthest away were to survive . Last shots of Control Centre shortly before tests began . On duplicate instruments at a remote point - five , four , three , two , one , zero . The rocket actually firing , caught by telephoto camera . Shortly afterwards , remote instruments recorded a fault in the fuel supplies , a break which was followed very rapidly by the runaway nuclear reaction . There is no visual record of the research team 's attempt to evacuate the Control Room . For this , refer to remote tape recording . Those recordings ... Two minutes 45 seconds after the commencement of the test ... The blast was seen from the far perimeter of the range . Next day , the devastated firing base was examined by squads of men in protective clothing . Nothing remained of the rocket . In the whole area of the blast , no one was found to be alive . That 's all . Well , it 's over . How much of a hold-up will this be ? Years . - It would be years . - Would be ? I said it 's over . The Moon Project . It was too ambitious , wasn 't it ? A fleet of rockets to build a colony on the Moon . Carrying machinery there , piece by piece , in hundreds of flights . To build pressure domes so that men could live in the world without air . To do all that . To be the first to do it . Ever since the days of basketball satellites , that has been the dream . It won 't be easy , will it , to face the fact that we 're ... out of the race ? Father , there have been bad patches before . This is more than a patch . The whole project depends on this rocket . On its design , its special adaptability . We can 't even carry out ground tests . - You must go on . - The choice isn 't mine . - What do you mean ? - The Ministry have backed me and for what ? I gave them the first two-stage nuclear experimental rocket , manned . Before your time . - You made a successful flight . - The crew died horribly . Then the international agreement on radioactive fallout made the design obsolete . A total loss to the Ministry . And now this . The first nuclear chemical rocket . Two prototypes - one destroyed and the other useless . More dead men . - The Ministry will draw a neat double line . - Finish ? Of all this ? - They won 't go on . - You 're wrong . No , Paula , the signs have been there - cuts , delays on vital expenditure . - You put your case ? - Until they 're sick of me . I suppose there 's a wind blowing in a different direction . New claimants for their favours . New ideals , new white-headed boys . I 'll go up to London tomorrow , of course , and tackle them . Bernard , remember you 're not alone in this . Sympathy , Leo ? Not just now , please . It might make me feel a little ... tired . And perhaps a little old . Professor Quatermass 's office . Yes , speaking . Who ? There now ? Oh , tell him to ... No , I 'll come through and meet him . It 's Johnny Dillon . He must have got leave . He sent no word . Does he have to ? Tell him to take you somewhere cheerful . - I might do that . - And don 't keep him waiting . Father , you won 't start getting rid of me now ? For my own good ? Don 't . Darling . - You cheated me out of expecting you . - I 'm sorry . It was a rush . Is your father here ? - Yes . - I 'd like to see him . - You sound so ... Is it something bad ? - I don 't think so . Probably nothing . He 'd know . What have you got there ? - Just a box . - Come in . - Oh , hello . How are you ? - Fair enough , sir . And you ? Dr Leo Pugh , Captain Dillon . - How do you do ? - Father , he wants to talk about something . No , not that . You 're not getting rid of me . - Sit down . - Thank you , sir . - I 've really no right to impose on you , sir . - No , go on . Straight in . I 'm right , aren 't I , that you people make a special study of meteorites ? They 're hazards a rocket meets in space . Grit , dust , stones , boulders flying at 30 miles a second . That needs studying . - He 's the expert . - That 's done it ! From this moment I am to be revealed as a mass of ignorance . What did you want to know ? About a year ago , there was a general scare . Do you remember ? - Reports of things falling . - A lot of that was imagination . - How can you tell ? - Our records . It would have been some display . There was nothing unusual . People like these stories . You get a lot . Dr Pugh , how many meteorites reach the ground in one piece ? It doesn 't happen . Perhaps one in a billion . In a billion , mind . And the odds against three of them striking an area 20 miles across in a single week ? Perhaps you 'd better explain . I 'm liable to court martial for this . It 's against orders , but ... I had to find out . We 'll respect your confidence . Meteoric fragments . Found where ? Near where I 'm stationed . My unit tracked the fall . - You got a signal off this ? - I didn 't make myself clear . This thing didn 't break up until it hit the ground . - What ? I told you it doesn 't happen . - It did . Assemble those pieces and you get a single smooth shape . Have you got one , darling ? I 'm right out . Thanks . I 've practically given myself the jitters . - Stupid , isn 't it ? - Not stupid . I still don 't see how you tracked it . The speed would be too great . - It was slower than a jet plane . - And there were others ? Two on other days , but we couldn 't find them . Tell me , is that normal meteoric stone ? Looks like one of the many varieties . Enstatite , I think . Mm . Interesting shape . Who else saw this ? A sergeant instructor , the man who found it - a ploughman - and his wife . That 's all . Really ? Somebody outside this odd army order . - How long will it take us to drive there ? - A couple of hours . Can you spare the time ? - I 'm sorry , darling . We 'll celebrate another time . - Of course . I 'd like to look into this further . John ... - Be careful . - Why did you say that ? - I don 't know . - Captain Dillon ! - Are you sure you 've got all the fragments ? - Yes . Why , Leo ? In that case ... it 's hollow . I bet you never breathed it like I said . Afraid it would do you some good ! That 's a car , isn 't it ? You just keep your feet in that mustard bath till I see if it 's the parson . Nay , it 's strangers . Lost their way , perhaps . Good evening . We met yesterday . Remember ? - Why , of course . Come in , won 't you ? - Thank you . I 'm sorry . We 're a bit upset . - Fred 's got a sort of ... a kind of chill . - Sorry to hear that . We thought you must be the parson . See who 's here , Fred ? - Don 't you remember ? The fella that ... - Captain Dillon . - Funny seeing you without the uniform . - And this is Professor Quatermass . - How do you do ? - Oh ... Professor . I 'd better explain . I 'm a scientist . Mr Large , I wonder if you 'd tell me about the object you found yesterday . Go on , Fred . He 's not himself . It 's the chill . He 'll have thrown it off by tomorrow . Can I get you a cup of tea ? No , thank you . Mr Large , this object , this stone . - Were you there when it fell ? - Of course he was . Tell them , Fred . You saw it fall ? Mr Large , this isn 't just curiosity . It may be important . Was it in fragments ? Broken up ? Fred ? Perhaps we can agree on what you told Captain Dillon yesterday . There was an odd smell ? - He said it was like old stables . - When did you notice this ? - When you first examined the pieces ? - No , sir , it wasn 't ... - Stop ! Stop ! - Mr Large , for heaven 's sake ! No need for that . - Have you seen a doctor ? - No . - I think it would be wiser . - No ! Send them ... send them away ! Nothing to do with it ! Nothing ! - Perhaps we 'd better go . - Yes , go . Go ! - Dear , oh , dear . - Go away from here . Go from this house ! - She 'd only be the one to suffer later . - I 'm sorry . That 's all right . We 'd no right to impose . - It 's not like him . I wish you knew ... - What ? It 's only just this chill . He must have caught it in the field yesterday , sitting there , sweaty , like . Go away from here ! That 's all it is . Isn 't it , Fred ? Just a chill . You 'll be as right as rain in the morning . - I 'm sorry that was so unproductive . - It wasn 't . Could anything have happened in that field before either she or you got there ? I can 't imagine . Why shouldn 't he talk about it ? - I don 't know . - Of course , they 're country folk . - There 's always a lot of superstition ... - Yes , yes , yes . Was that a pub we passed on the road ? Feel like a drink ? I feel like ... talking to people . Fred Large ? - Well , I didn 't know that . Did you , Robert ? - What ? Fred ? No , no , I never heard nothing . What 's the matter with him ? - Nothing serious . Just a chill . - Ah , thank you . You a relation of his ? No , it was just a friendly call . We were passing through , looked him up . - Knew Fred in the Army , maybe ? - Something like that . He 's not an easy man to know . A bit touchy . Liable to fly off the handle . Fred ? Oh , I wouldn 't say that . Would you , Robert ? No , no . Them Larges is a steady lot , Fred more than any . - What did you say to him ? - Asked how he was , if he 'd seen a doctor . Ha-ha ! That might have done it . He don 't hold with doctors any more than I do . Government men ! - Who ? - Doctors . They all work for the government . So Robert 's agin them , too ! When there was less government about , things was better , I know that . He came across something odd in a field . - Odd ? - A stone or stones that had just fallen . - Out of the sky , do you mean ? - Ever seen anything ? Fireballs ? Meteorites ? Oh , a long while back . Stories . Hey , do you think this might have had something to do with Fred being sick ? Do you think it possible ? All right , sir . All right . Evening , Will . The usual ? - The things ... falling on the Earth . - What do you know about it ? - It be the government . - No , not this time . - You think I 'm just a silly old man , don 't you ? - Now , now , Robert . Well , I 'm not . They spoil and destroy . - Who ? - The government men ! You tell him about Winnerden Flats ! No , you tell me . Oh , a village . It was a village . 12 , 15 miles out on the sea . I remember going there fishing sometimes when I was a boy . I courted a girl from Winnerden Flats . - Married her . - The village . The village ? Oh , well , there was a government place there for research . - Research into what ? - I don 't know . A little place , a few sheds , but it seemed to content them . Until last year . - And then ... - Go on . - They run mad ! Tore the whole village down ! - Tore it down ? With them bull ... dozers . And then they built a big place ... with great iron round things on top . - Do you know anything about this ? - No . It 's secret . No one let near . - Guards with guns to keep ' em away . - Guns ? ! I know a fella went by there and they nearly set on him . If you want odd things to happen , well , just ask the government . - Is this true ? - It 's what they call a Security Area . I expect there 's some good reason for it . Yes , I expect so . - Well , we 'll be off . Goodbye . - Goodnight . - You really think there could be a connection ? - We 'll just have a look . From a distance . I don 't want to get you into trouble . As long as I 'm in civvies , they 'll forgive me . But surely it 's just a refinery ? I hope so . What else could it be ? I think I 'm going mad . Let 's try and get closer . - Yes . - Won 't you tell me ? Just a coincidence . Coincidence of what ? Of shapes . - We 're getting pretty close . - I don 't see any guards yet . Listen ! It 's over there . If we can get to it ... - Is that it ? - Something 's there , about six inches down . - Here , let me . - No , I can do it . There 's some sort of alarm ! - Here ! - It 's just like the other one . I was right . I want to get some measurements , quickly . Some men are coming . I hope they realise it 's for their benefit . - It 's starting to ... break up ! - Smell it ? - Yes ! - Ammonia ? Dillon ! There 's something on your face ! On tests in Northern Australia , a prototype of the nuclear motor designed to power the Quatermass II rocket has gone into a runaway reaction , ending in a disastrous explosion . In the rocket research station in England , its twin reveals the same latent faults . Professor Bernard Quatermass and his staff , now including Doctor Leo Pugh and his own daughter Paula , realise that the extensive project to colonise the Moon may have to be abandoned . Then an interruption . Captain John Dillon has tracked falling meteorites by radar and , against orders , has managed to recover one . Reassembled , the object proves to have been hollow . Visiting the scene of the incidents , Quatermass and Dillon come upon a closed area and a vast government plant that is said to be heavily guarded . Its appearance disturbs them . Then , as they venture closer to the place , another meteorite falls . They are able to locate it , still in one piece . Can you smell it ? Ammonia . Dillon ! There 's something on your face ! Dillon ! It 's gone , but there was something , I swear . Are you all right ? All right ? Don 't know . Uh ... don 't know . Whatever else came out of that , there was certainly ammonia . You got a lungful . Take some deep breaths . Try ! Similar to the first one . Hollowed in the same way . Thistledown . What I saw ... What I thought I saw was transparent . Just for a moment it shone and then ... Is your face still sore ? Let me see . Look up . Look to the light . Yes , there is something there . A kind of ... Just on the hairline . A discoloured indentation . Don 't touch ! Keep back ! Tell them . Tell . All right , Dillon . If you won 't start talking , I will . Take a look at this . Be careful - it needs expert examination . It 's some sort of meteorite . We saw it fall and came to examine it . - Who are you ? - That doesn 't matter . - You are in a restricted area . - Let me talk to somebody in authority in there . - I 'll explain when we get there . - Explain . It was intact when it fell . That 's almost unknown for a meteorite . It broke up as we looked at it . This man was affected . Something came from it . Gas , at any rate . Is this a military establishment ? Get those pieces . No ! Don 't you realise the importance of observations ? - Take him . - Wait a minute . - He will be given treatment . - There ? - He must come . - Are you arresting him ? - He must . - Yes ... - I 'm sorry , Dillon . I 'll explain . - You will go . Now . While you can . - But I will tell them that I am responsible . - Do not try . Go . Dillon , I 'm sorry I got you into this mess . I 'll find some way . No , don 't follow . Don 't try to follow ! - Dillon ! - Go now . Go . Psst ! Hi there . - Who are you ? - I got no business here , same as you . Have they gone ? Yes . Lucky they didn 't pinch you , too . You were watching ? - Through there . - Did you see that thing fall ? - What thing ? - That ... that stone . Stone ? Nah . I was asleep until all the whistles and shouting . I come here last night , after dark . Woke up and seen all them fellas around with guns all over the place . So I lay low all day . - Soon be dark again . - Why are you here ? Got a gasper ? I reckon to pass by this way once a year . - There used to be a village here . - Yes . Winnerden Flats . Ta . I heard tales of this coming along the road , but I didn 't believe it . They must have smashed the whole place flat with them bulldozers . Why ? There was nice people about here . Open-handed . When you were here a year ago , the place was normal ? Thriving . Woman gave me a brace of chickens . Give ' em to me . But there was a government research unit ? Only a few little huts . I didn 't mind them . They didn 't bother me very much . A bit different from that . It 's not finished yet . All day long , banging and riveting . And the men they 've got working in there . Thousands of them . Like an army . I 've seen ' em come , I 've seen ' em go . In big lorries . - Where ? Do you know ? - Look ... - On the horizon ? - A whole town . New-built . I come through there . No good . Not all these prefab estates . They 've got no time for trampers . " Dig the garden and I 'll give you your dinner . " " I 'm going on , " I said . Somewhere I can get proper treatment . Winnerden Flats . What have you got there ? A flint ? Plenty of them about . - Too many . - It 's not a flint . - Of course it is . - It 's worn and weathered by long exposure . What else could it be ? Look , they 're all over the place . You 're a funny fella with stones , aren 't you ? What do you do ? Collect them ? You 'll bust your pockets . You 'd better get going . How far to that prefab town ? - Turn north by the sea , then about five miles . - Thanks . Here . Don 't hang around . Gone down to the boozer for a quick one , I suppose . Yes . Yeah , keep an eye out for him . And chase the mother up here , will you ? Tell them ... Tell them she 's been wandering again . Yes . Yes , thanks , Bob . I was right . Why these people can 't look after their kiddies , I don 't know . - Hello . What can I do for you ? - Are there any police in this town ? - Police ? - There are none ? Well , we 're the police . The Camp Committee . - What if you can 't handle something ? - Doesn 't often happen . - With construction teams and labour gangs ? - Look , mister , if we need police assistance , we get it from outside . Now , what 's your business ? I 'm worried about a friend of mine . We were near that plant where your men work . - He was taken ill , the guards took him away . - It 's a prohibited area . You must have known . This is a free country in time of peace . I have rights and will use them . Right . You 've used them . Happy ? What are you supposed to represent ? A publicly appointed committee ? We represent the workers on that project . We 're doing all right . A lot more than all right . We 're asked to co-operate by keeping our mouths shut . Just like in the war . - We try to do our best . - You succeed ! We don 't like people who make it difficult . I have trodden where some bureaucrat didn 't wish me to tread , but does that put me beyond your aid ? Look , mister , your friend will have been taken to the infirmary . He wouldn 't have come to any harm . Let 's check that , shall we ? - Shall I ring ? - Telephone the police . I 'll make a full statement of what happened . What are you grinning at ? - You said you call in police help sometimes . - Yes . Their police . Those guards . It 's a security arrangement . Shall I ring ? Now , look , don 't worry about your friend . - They 'll take him to another hospital . - I 'll ring the county constabulary . No ! Honestly , they wouldn 't deal . Wouldn 't deal ? What IS this place ? Oh , really , mister . Can 't you read ? Excuse me ... Oh , there she is . Poor little love . Mr Dawson , I 'm ever so sorry about this , about all the trouble you 've had . I 've told her a hundred times , but it makes no difference . - Where was she ? - Heading up there . Bob Rigby found her . - You naughty girl . - There 'll be trouble . - I know , I know ! - No one 's allowed there . Yes , Mr Dawson . I don 't like to blame her . Since she was sick , she 's not been the same . - Sick ? - Are you still here ? - Tell me about it . When did it happen ? - A few months ago , just after we moved here . She was out playing somewhere and was taken queer . She seemed to get over it , but since then ... she wanders . - Where to ? - Only up there to the place . Eh , Mr Dawson ? Did you ever see anything like this ? Did you find something once ? When you were playing ? That broke into pieces like this ? And then you were sick ? And then there was this mark ? I seen it a long time ago . It 's never given any trouble . Are you making out I neglect her ? - Was anybody else sick ? - Nobody ! Is he some sort of inspector ? No . I 'm putting a stop to this . A little while ago , I asked you to leave . Now I 'm not asking . - Don 't be a fool , man . - Fool ? ! I think there 's something wrong . Danger . Tell me ! - Tell you what ? - Oh , I don 't know the full facts . - What is this place ? What 's being made there ? - You 're mad . For heaven 's sake , forget these posters for just five seconds ! Get on your way . You want to meet those guards again ? I 'll give you a count of three . - That got rid of him . - Well ! You were right . He must 've been mad . The things he was saying . Why ... This isn 't nothing . Look , Mr Dawson . Is it , now ? - Dr Pugh ? - Yes ? - Ready for the test . - Oh , good . Mm , not a bad section . It 's difficult to find a decent one from one of these fragments . That 's a trace of metallic mineral , isn 't it ? There . Yes . Let 's see . If that etches into the standard pattern , this must be a normal meteorite . - Yes . - Leo , am I interrupting something ? Oh , not at all . - Is your father back ? - Not yet . - What are you looking for ? - An etched pattern . A Widmanstatten shape . A test for a genuine meteorite . No , nothing . - It isn 't one ? - No . - It may not be . - What about the fact of it being hollow ? A small cavity is not unheard of . But according to the ploughman there was a smell of gas . Seven different gases can occur in stony meteorites . We 've nothing positive to go on . - Father , did you find out anything ? - Some . - Where 's Johnny ? - He 's not with me . - I 'm afraid he 's in some sort of trouble . - Trouble ? Yes , he 's not well . He 's being looked after . - But where is he ? - In a strange place . - A very strange place . - For heaven 's sake , tell us ! We went to the ploughman as we intended . He wasn 't very co-operative . No , there was nothing more you could have done . I see that . I didn 't leave it at that . I went to the county police . They were polite , but said they had no jurisdiction . How do you connect these meteorites with this mysterious production plant ? - Think they came from it ? - No , I 'm certain of that . - What do you think is wrong with Johnny ? - He was affected with this gas . - How about phoning where he is stationed ? - He 's at a temporary training post . The base camp . They may know something . Yes , I 'll do that . - Leo , there 's more to it . - I thought so . It wasn 't only the gas that affected Dillon . There was something ... else . - You saw it ? - Just for a minute , clinging to his face . - What ? - I may be wrong , but just for a moment ... It was like a soap bubble that burst . It wasn 't unlike a bubble . Perhaps I 'm imagining it . But ever since that time , so long ago ... - Perhaps I 'm too ready to ... to expect ... - Take a look at this . I got a plaster cast made of the first meteorite . Now , assuming that the shape suffered from ablation in the higher levels of the atmosphere , with a little reconstruction the original might well have been like this . - You 've been busy . - It 's more than a guess . We worked it out . Something like this , travelling at the correct angle , not too fast ... Could skim through Earth 's atmosphere before breaking itself up , gradually losing speed through braking ellipses and even land in one piece . - The same principle as rocket descent . - And that , of course , implies a great deal . Rocket descent . The result of knowledge . Mathematics . Precise planning . Intelligence . Now , we know the weight , the approximate speed of descent , mass ... - I 've got some further data . - Excellent . How do you feel ? Up to making a start ? If we can find some sort of a source ... - Any news ? - He couldn 't return to his unit . He 's being transferred . - The radar post ? Moved from that position ? - Could that be significant ? Probably not . I 'm going up to London tomorrow . I 'll probably get the answers then . Paula , you must leave us . We have work to do . Oh , don 't worry about that . It 's just some idle speculation of Leo 's . No ... No ! Come in , sir . Do sit down . You 've come at a most awkward time . I 'm just tying up a very difficult case . - You asked to see Inspector Lomax . - I know him . I 'm afraid he 's no longer with us . - I hope I won 't embarrass you with this query . - It won 't be easy , sir . Try . Last night I ... happened to trespass upon a prohibited area . Really ? An army range ? Excuse me . Inspector Clifford . Uh-huh ? Yes , I know . The embezzlement case . You 've got him there ? I suppose there 's no doubt that he was a witness ? Right you are , Sergeant . Well , keep him there for a moment , will you ? - Now , sir , about this prohibited area . - I admit it 's a technical offence . We shall assume you did not go there as an enemy agent . When we were near the plant , my friend was taken ill . The guards arrested him . - The plant . Where exactly was it ? - At a place called Winnerden Flats . - I 'm afraid I can 't help you . - There are matters needing investigation . - I can do nothing . It 's under special authority . - What authority ? What 's its purpose ? - Now you do embarrass me . - This man was ill . He was affected by ... I 've got to know his condition . Great Heavens ! I didn 't expect to find bureaucratic idiocy here ! I know my duty , sir . If you must have special favours , go to your own contacts at the Ministry . Ministry ? I must ask you to leave now . I have things to do . - The same Ministry that handles my research ? - Good morning , sir . Tell Sergeant Best to bring that man up right away . The embezzlement witness ! We 've a great deal to get through . Pompous , self-important people coming here ... Well , there you are . You 've got all the evidence I can produce , all the facts as I know them . Now , Fowler , it 's up to you . Man , haven 't you ANY reaction ? I want you to get in touch with Mr Vincent Broadhead . In the lower conference room . 441 , isn 't it ? Find out if they 're in recess . Ask him to come up here as soon as he can . - Was that a sufficiently dramatic response ? - I hope you 're not taking this lightly . On the contrary . I 'm going beyond the limits . Quatermass , we 've had dealings for a number of years , you as a driving force of an enterprise of the future , I as one of the obstructive civil servants you have to contend with . - My dear Fowler ... - How 's it going ? - I haven 't referred to that . - How is it ? - Badly , since that trouble on test . - You 'll want extra funds ? And you 'll refuse them ? We 've been cutting you down . The decision lies elsewhere . - It always does . - It 's policy to support a number of projects . - That makes them , in a sense , your rivals . - What are you getting at ? Well , it could be said that to come with such a curious account about a rival project ... - Are you serious ? - I must put it to you . But I didn 't know it was yours ! - Thank you . I accept that . - Now , what is it ? - Strictly between these walls ? - Of course . The place at Winnerden Flats is harmless . It 's to make synthetic food . Synthetic food ? ! Guards and guns ? ! Oh , I have no personal knowledge . It 's an entirely different section , a new special section . - You don 't like it either . - Like it ? Oh , I expect I 'm hidebound . Nothing you can pin down . A face in the corridor . Yes ... Petty mysteries . An overheard phrase . Altered routines . Changes . Hello . Yes ? The recess ? And Mr Broadhead ? - Thank you . On his way up . - Who is he ? You don 't read the newspapers ? He 's usually a rugged individualist or a damned troublemaker . - An MP ? - Quite a new boy . I knew him years ago . He 's a talker . Just now he 's engaged in a sort of one-man inquiry that he 's managed to force . - Inquiry ? - He 's ahead of you . It 's into Winnerden Flats . - Mr Fowler 's expecting me . Broadhead . - Oh , yes , sir . Somebody with him ? What 's this about , Fowler ? I hope you realise how little time I 've got . Here 's someone I think you ought to meet . Don 't take any calls for the next few minutes . Yes , sir . - And all this happened last night ? - All that I was personally concerned with , yes . I don 't know what to make of it . There 's oddness enough . - At the inquiry ? - Aye . I resume in five minutes . - What sort of oddness ? - Confine yourself to giving information . No , it 's too much . All this stuff you 're telling me is speculation . - It 's true . I have expert knowledge . - You specialise in rockets and things . - The specialist sees things in his own light . - A stupid generalisation . There were those armed guards ... A sick man arrested . I 'll try to use that . - Who are on this inquiry ? - Please , please . No , let him ask it . I 've been sickened with damn secrecy this morning . Members of the Commission and me . It 's to be a one-man confidential report . Silly , isn 't it ? More secrecy , but the fight I had even for that and , in the end , through a technical loophole . How 's it going ? Finding what you wanted ? They 're beating me , I admit it . Evasion ! Never once an answer that means anything . And this is the joke - I 'm trying to help them ! - Do you know what Winnerden Flats is ? - Synthetic food . A revolutionary process . Years of vain experiment . Suddenly , bingo - they 've got it ! - When ? - About a year ago . A headlong rush then to get a factory built . Tremendous costs . - What was the hurry ? - To beat the rest of the world to it . - Now they 're ready to go ahead . - Production ? - Any day now , apparently . - I see . There 's no signs of a distribution set-up . No sales organisation , nothing . They 're trapped in their damn secrecy ! And now this . - A production plant . - Aye , an aerial photograph of it . - Here 's another . The same ? - Seems to be . That one was taken on an inspection flight over Central Siberia . - What ? ! - And this . Brazil . Not much doubt about it , is there ? Other people are in on this " revolutionary process " ! - They 've got competitors before they start . - No , that 's not it . - How long since those were taken ? - All very recent . Broadhead , get me into that inquiry . As a witness . I 've got to get in there ! All right . Come on . Here you are . Sit down . All here ? This is Professor Bernard Quatermass . I 've asked him to attend . He has certain information I wish to bring forward . But , first , have you considered what I put to you before the recess ? A leakage of information . In spite of all precautions . In spite of what seemed excessive precautions . Will you look at these aerial photographs again ? You , sir , Mr Stenning . As Chief Biochemist to the Commission , can you give me an expert opinion ? Pick ' em up and look at ' em . There - the mark . His own Moon project at a standstill following the explosion on test of a prototype rocket , Professor Quatermass has a new investigation . A hollow meteorite is brought to him . A visit to the area of its fall leads him to a vast secret government production plant and another incident - a meteorite falls . It shatters , discharging ammonia gas and perhaps something else . Captain Dillon is overcome , a curious mark appearing on his face . But while Quatermass examines it , armed security guards arrive . They take Dillon into the plant , apparently for treatment . Quatermass is ordered away . He goes through the bulldozed debris of the village that occupied the site a year before and comes upon weathered remains of the supposed meteorites by the hundred . Rebuffed by both civilian and police authorities , he finds out from Fowler , a contact at the Ministry , that the mysterious plant is to produce synthetic food . But with evidence that the secret process is already being duplicated in Central Siberia and in Brazil , a one-man inquiry has been forced by Vincent Broadhead , a Member of Parliament , into the affairs of the controlling commission . When this resumes , he admits Quatermass as a witness . Looking along the faces of those at the table , Quatermass sees once again ... the mark ! - Can I speak to you for a moment ? - Excuse me , gentlemen . - Do you know him ? Where he got that mark ? - No . I 've seen it before . On a child who stumbled across a meteorite . She was made ill . And the mark was on her hand . And yesterday , Dillon . It began to appear when the guards took him away . - I 've seen other cases . - This man in the room ? He , at least . I swear it . Professor Quatermass was concerned about the propriety of his presence here while I put questions on other matters . Now , as members of the controlling commission , do you know of any external dangers to the plant ? There are no dangers ! There can be none ! - Perhaps even missiles directed at it ? - That 's not what I meant . - Just get that stuff out . - Yes . What Professor Quatermass is about to produce is something that fell two days ago within a short distance of the plant . There 's a possibility these may be directed through the atmosphere to a specific point . In this case , to or at your plant . They may possibly constitute some form of carrier . - Carrier ? Of what ? - Of poison gases . - And also possibly ... - Infection . What I know of synthetic foods is that you 're dealing with delicate organic gels and cultures . Now , these can be infected , naturally or artificially , and destroyed . What I 'm trying to establish is the possibility , no more than that , of a threat to your process . - No . - It may be nothing , but it may be serious . Now , first , we 've got to free more facts from this monstrous web of secrecy . - There has been no infection . - In the plant ? You discovered nothing ? - Nothing like that ? - I must ask you to take this matter seriously . I must ask for your co-operation . A picture is beginning to form , however sketchily , of a unique process which is no longer unique . To extend these indications to their farthest limits , it may be in danger of destruction . If this should prove to be ... - What 's going on ? - Yes , it 's a model . An accurate reconstruction , in plaster , of one of the meteorites as it fell . You , sir ! When did you come across a thing like that ? When did they come ? - If I could tell you ... - This must not continue ! These questions must not be asked ! I agree . I think you 'd better leave now , Professor . Please . Now , gentlemen , I 'd like to take up one or two points on the process itself . You certainly stuck your neck out . You might have folded up the whole inquiry . And you must admit the response you got was fairly indefinite . Very well , on a level of simple fact . - You 're a scientist . Isn 't that the only level ? - No ! How long have I been up here ? - 20 minutes . - Could you ring the inquiry ? - Well , erm ... - Try ! Get me room 441 , please . Mr Broadhead . - Reason ? - The last few minutes I was there ... - Seconds , really . - What ? - I was afraid , Fowler . - Afraid ? Why on earth ? I don 't know . Perhaps I 'm discovering new depths in myself . Or streaks . At any rate , I was suddenly sharply aware of menace . Here ? In the Ministry ? Hello ? What ? No reply ? No , it 's all right . Broadhead ! - What 's wrong with him ? - It 's dispersed now , but ... - Ammonia gas ! - What happened ? Look ! - You 're sure ? But how ? - I don 't know . It was here with them . It must have been . He 's conscious . Broadhead ! - Broadhead ... - What happened at the inquiry ? Inquiry 's over . I wonder what he found out . Nothing to find out . Nothing . - I 'll get a doctor . - You were making a report . - You remember ? - Hello ? Hello ? Everything 's ... in order . Everything 's explained . - Hello there . - All right , Fowler . They 're here . - When were you sent for ? - A few minutes ago . We happened to be passing . We came in . - Say nothing . - What about you ? - I want your help . - Help ? I want to get to the plant . Inside it . - I 'll try . Give me an hour . - Where can we meet ? I know a place . One of the old coffee bars . Nobody goes there now . This way . - Here you are , sir . - Thank you . Nice to meet a gentleman who still appreciates a good cup of coffee . Sugar , sir ? Fine , thank you . These new tea bars now , they 've swiped all the trade . Fashion , that 's all it is , really . Just fashion . Fowler . - This is Rupert Ward . Professor Quatermass . - How do you do , sir ? - Two more coffees , please . - Right-o , sir . - Any trouble since I saw you last ? - No . Ward 's in public relations . He 's been to the plant . - What ? - Several times . - Top secret . How much will I say ? - I 'll answer for Quatermass . - I gather you have odd notions about it . - I 'd no time to go into details . Does that mean anything to you ? No . Why , should it ? It 's made of plaster . Yes , it 's a cast . No matter . Ward is attached to the Special Section . Temporarily . - How many visits did you make ? - Half a dozen . - Alone ? - No , I took parties down . - Quite a regular procedure . - Mostly politicos . One or two outside people , press and so on . Some of them quite well known . Names ? - No matter . They were shown the plant ? - Yes , but not by me . I 'm no scientist . I can 't tell one of these places from another . I just handed my charges over . - You left them there ? - That was the arrangement . I presume they came back with someone else . Your coffees , sir . Look here , you don 't think anything happened to those people , do you ? Good Lord . They all turned up again . There 's no doubt about it . One hears of them . - What were they shown ? - There was nothing much in operation . Except a sort of pilot plant . I didn 't go into it . - Perhaps you were lucky . - What ? Didn 't this strike you as odd , with such a secret establishment ? PR routines can be rather odd . I don 't make the decisions . No , you 're just a pleasant , sensible chap . No nonsense . No suspicion would attach to you . What on earth is he talking about ? As if I was , well , guilty of something . There are other chaps . Why not ask them ? - Have you still got your pass ? - Yes . You 'll use it - today . You 're going to take another party round - me and Fowler . - He 'll back you up . - But this is ... Finish your coffee . I showed you a model of something that 's been falling near the plant . I 'm having them investigated ... by my own people . Damn and blast ! - Another blind alley ? - Yes . We 're in a kind of mathematical lunacy . Question : Did those things come like normal meteorites ? Did they come like rockets ? Did they do this ? Did they do that ? We have dozens of theories , all impossible . I realise we 've got to accept that wherever these things came from was ... beyond the atmosphere . - But not so very , very far away . - No , I see that , too . And for a year . Why hasn 't their point of origin , whatever it is , been located by every major observatory ? - Or spotted by every amateur with a telescope ! - Yes . It would be bound by physical laws to travel in set ellipses . A semi-major axis . In a certain set rhythm . So we calculate and calculate and there 's no sensible answer ! Oh , Leo ! Five-minute break . How much sleep have you had ? Send some more coffee up , would you ? Observatory Three . Too many machines , that 's what we 've got . They spoil one from grasping a clear concept . I joined your father as a mathematical genius . That 's not boasting . I was , once . A calculating boy . But these machines , they beat me . I press buttons . - Why did you join him ? - Looking for some kind of beauty , I suppose . The mathematical kind . The idea of making roads in space for rockets to travel . Four-dimensional roads . Curved with relativity , metalled with best-quality continuum . - These roads are two-way ! - The brake 's still on , Leo . - Tell me about the calculating boy . - Ohh . At the village school in Merioneth . The teacher , old Miss Williams , used to set me enormous sums to do . She loved to astonish herself , 'cause I always got them right . " You 'll go far , Leo , bach , " she said . " You have the power to benefit mankind . " And now I press buttons . What sort of child were you ? - I was frightened of the dark . - Nice and normal . It was very scientific . I had a special nightmare that I was in a rocket Father had made going away and getting lost on the wrong side of the world , in the dark for ever and ever . I used to wake up screaming . Leo ? - That might be it ! - What ? The ... what do you call it ? The Bieber Variation ! A sort of fault in the laws . A line drawn from the Sun to the Earth , extend it , you reach a point of equilibrium where a body can orbit invisibly . On the dark side of the Earth . Hello ? Hello , Stewart ? Pugh here . I want the radio telescope on a completely new setting . Come over here and bring Watson . Take it away . I don 't want it . The Bieber Variation ! It took the most advanced brain on Earth to comprehend it , but to go further , to put it to practical use , what manner of being could do that ? Frankie ! Wasting your time throwing stones in the water ! Why don 't you give your father a hand ? Frankie ? Did you hear what I said ? Look at him , left to carry all them bottles down . Can you manage , dear ? Yes . Was that somebody blowing a whistle ? - Over at that new works ? - Yes . - Perhaps it 's their tea break or something . - Yes , dear . Just the same time as us . Isn 't that funny ? Now , where 's this cloth ? Frankie ! Are you trying to go into the water ? Remember your promise . Silly of Uncle Tom to give him them rubber things when he can 't swim . Frankie ! Come on and have your tea now . It 's all ready . I do like a picnic . I always say there 's nothing like the open air . Here you are . Aren 't you going to take that thing off your head ? - No . - Can 't get over that village , though . All them houses down . I thought we 'd come the wrong way . Didn 't I say ? - Yes , dear , you did . - Fancy pulling them all down like that . - It was just like a picture . - This the meat , dear ? - Yes , that 's right . Remember the tea shop ? - Oh , yeah . The one time we didn 't have a picnic we went there . Miss Collins , wasn 't it ? - Yes , dear . - It was so nice , pretty everlasting flowers ... Whatever 's that ? - You blowing that whistle at us ? - He 's got a gun ! Frankie ! - You must not be here . - What ? - It is forbidden . - I told you there 'd be trouble . Sit down , dear . Have your tea . Nobody 's got a right to try and ... Go ! Go now ! - All of you ! - Don 't you point that at my wife and my kid ! We come here peaceable for a picnic . - We 're doing no harm . - Father , we 'd better go . No . Now , look here , mate , you stop shoving us around or I 'll write to the papers . Messing us around when we 're quiet and decent , not doing no harm , not leaving any litter about . I don 't know what this place is and I don 't care . We mind our own business . No harm in that . See anything now ? - Just a little car . - Looks like the guards . Somebody 's in trouble . - Should we go back ? - No . - But surely ... - It may help us . There 's the gate ahead . - Are you ready ? Ward , got your pass ? - Yes . Say as little as possible . Official . Anybody here now ? - Receiving treatment ? - No one . Perhaps from yesterday ? - No . - We understood there was a man here . A young man . He had to be brought in by the guards . Name of Dillon . - He has gone now . - Gone ? He was recovered . He was not seriously ill . He was not ill . He ... - Where did he go ? - Away . You don 't mind if I look round the premises ? It 's quiet . Is construction work suspended today ? - Suspended . - The gangs are laid off for some reason ? - Let 's go . - Thank you . - Do you feel it ? - What ? Ever since we entered this place , there 's a sort of ... lull . If I 'm right , this is where the chief component of the food gets made . Sounds as if it 's in full operation . Come on . This is official . - Are you in charge here ? - Yes . We have to see the process in operation , if you don 't mind . Is that an inspection door ? It 's an enormous project . A liquid 's inside . What is it ? Might be the preparation of amino acids , basic proteins . The product 's pumped out of here along these pipes . Where does it go ? To those external storage tanks ? The big domes out there ? Yes . They 're built to take great pressure . What else is pumped into them ? Gases ? - Yes . - What sort of gases ? Could one of them be ... ammonia ? - Yes . - And the others ? Hydrogen ? Nitrogen ? Methane , perhaps ? Great pressures , low temperatures . You see , I 'm curious . I 've seen structures like this somewhere else . They remind me of ... experimental plans that I 've ... seen somewhere . As means to inhabit another planet ! Tell me if you can . Production has begun ? How long ago ? It is ... on schedule . And now ? Machine gunfire ! - I must see those domes ! - No ! There 's no time now ! Ward ! Where 's Ward ? He 's gone ! Ward ! Where are you ? Ward ! No sign of him here , either . - That gunfire . Do you think it 's possible ? - No , too far away . It was outside . I hope you 're right . I saw him move away from us to look at another part , I thought . - He must have gone out . - By himself ? Why ? - I can 't guess . - I must look at that main storage tank before ... Fowler - look at it ! There on the ladder ! It 's Ward ! - Ammonia ! What 's that black slime ? - Don 't touch it ! He 's soaked in it . He must have got it inside . Keep a look-out . Ward ? It 's Quatermass . Did you get inside the dome ? - Ward ? - I ... I had to know . There 's an airlock . And then ... - Oh ! - What was in there ? Slime ... The tank 's full of it . - I slipped . - Was there anything else in there ? In the airlock . These . - Don 't go ... Don 't go there ! - Quatermass ! They 're coming ! Men with guns ! - Come on ! - Aargh ! Ward ! Come on , out ! - That accounts for the gunfire . - Good heavens ! - Anyone following us ? - No . What do we do ? Go to the police ? Get back to the rocket group . Fowler , somewhere in the back is a box , metal . See if you can find it . Open it and hold it there . - Something I want to get under analysis . - What is it ? Don 't touch ! Ward 's collar and tie . Professor Quatermass ? Lab here , sir . They yielded just under 5ccs of the substance . Yes , plenty for testing . There were some neutral constituents , but I 'd say there 's absolutely no doubt . - Not in that concentration . - I see . Right . Details as soon as you can . Thank you . Corrosive poison . Deadly to any living thing on Earth . - It could never have made synthetic food . - Food ? I think it could . But for what ? Father ... You heard ? Anything ? No . I 'm trying to bring up the gain . Not too much . It might put the balance out . There ! No , damn it ! I 'm getting spots before my eyes . Take over , Paula . There was no sign at all of Johnny ? - I 'm sorry . - It 's bad , isn 't it ? Yes . Could it be ... the same as before ? - The first rocket ? - No , that 's not it . I 'm certain . - Any clear idea of what you 're trying to trace ? - An asteroid . Not more than half a mile across . Reaches its nearest point to the Earth every 48 hours . Then they can come . - They ? - Try to imagine a complete reversal . An organism for which oxygen is not a necessity of life , but a destroyer . Unable to survive in our atmosphere for more than a few seconds . Safe only in a shell , a shell of stone . But with power , Fowler . Power to compel . Leo , quickly ! Yes ! Yes , there it is ! Bernard ! There 's no doubt about this . A clear signal . - The asteroid ? - Distance ? Something over 500,000 miles . Approaching the Earth . Before we begin the fourth episode of " Quatermass II " , we would like to say that it is not suitable for children or those of you who may have a nervous disposition . Probing the mystery of the pseudo-meteorites that take a violent effect on humans with whom they come into contact , Professor Bernard Quatermass is led first to a top-secret synthetic food plant and later , in Whitehall , to an inquiry into the running of this establishment . An inquiry that ends abruptly . With the help of a senior civil servant , Fowler , and Ward , a public relations officer , who are disturbed by what they have learnt , Quatermass gains entry to the unfinished plant . He discovers that building work is suspended there and production has begun of what seems to be synthetic food , pumped to a vast pressure dome , the first to be completed . One of his companions finds a way into the dome . When he emerges , he is covered with black corrosive slime . Quatermass escapes with a sample of the slime . Analysis shows that this synthetic food is a deadly poison to any living thing ... on the Earth . Meanwhile , by radio telescope , the source of the meteorites has been located . No doubt about this . It 's giving a firm signal . - The asteroid ? - Distance ? Something over 500,000 miles - approaching the Earth . By my calculations , it will go on doing so for four hours . Then the asteroid , or whatever it is , will reach its nearest point . - How near ? - About 380,000 miles . Sounds a lot , but astronomically it 's next door . Then it will move away and come again after 40 hours and so on . That 's the pattern . If we 're right about this , it 's able to discharge these ... call them meteorites whenever it reaches the near point . In this shell something travelled to the Earth alive . Not as we know life . Sustained in this cavity by a mixture of compressed gases . Ammonia , methane and probably hydrogen . The atmosphere to which it belongs . Then when it emerged into the air we breathe , into oxygen , it couldn 't live . For a few moments , floating . Seconds , really . It came into contact with an object , a target , and then its energy was expended . - As when one of them touched Johnny Dillon ? - Yes . I thought I saw it for a moment on his face before he collapsed . Like a dark bubble . - And then it was gone . - What happens to a person affected ? An instantaneous invasion of the whole nervous system and a violent shock to the brain . A sort of mental sting ? It may extend to a complete comprehension of the victim 's faculties - his reasoning powers , his subconscious knowledge . But what is certain is that something is implanted in him . A new instinct . - Submission ? - To what ? - By your theory , the thing dies moments later . - It may not matter . - Death not matter ? - Do you know what a colonial organism is ? Imagine a group mind . A thousand billion individuals , if you like , with a single consciousness . What one discovers transmits to the rest . - More - the experience itself . - By all of them ? Simultaneously , wherever they may be . - Doctor Pugh , you 're in agreement ? - Yes . They first came probably at random . A reconnaissance in force . And a year later , phase two , the general offensive . - How many there were in the world ... - Brazil , Siberia . - We know of one incident . - Winnerden Flats . An out-of-the-way village , a small government research unit . In a night , the whole area taken over . - The inhabitants ? - All of them , the trained personnel . A plague spot defended by the victims ! And now the plant 's almost complete . Waiting . - Waiting ? - To be occupied . The pressure dome 's already full of slime in readiness . A small , tiny creature ? But they ... The dome is so huge ! - To accommodate a vast number of them ? - More than that . It might , in its own atmosphere , be able to change in size , mass and shape . - Another 3 hours 20 minutes . - Until it reaches the perigee . The nearest point . And then they can come , perhaps in force . This time , the next , how long ? It must be soon . Whatever we do now , there will be no second chance . We must break this conspiracy of silence with details . We 've got to make it known ! - Isn 't that straightforward ? - No , they 're a year ahead of us ! - Will you go back to London ? - Of course . Be careful . Check your position there first , then find out all you can . - In the Ministry ? - Remember Broadhead . Act quickly . And keep in touch with us here . Hello . Send a car round to Observatory Three . If only it were more than an electronic trace . If one could see ... Father ! I believe there 's something you 've missed . You might be entirely wrong . You said an atmosphere of ammonia and methane , but a small asteroid can 't hold an atmosphere . - It 's not a natural asteroid . - Of course . Sorry . I 'm being so stupid . Yes , it would have to be , wouldn 't it , a made thing ? - From where those conditions do exist . - In heaven 's name , where ? ! - The outer planets . - A frozen world . With poisonous gases for air . Life could exist there , and develop , until a time came when ... Probably one of the moons of Saturn . 800 million miles away . Precision workmanship . This would seal it . Almost certainly airtight . Gas-tight . - Ward had this in his hand ? - Yes . Hmm . About the same capacity . - Only this is man-made . - Made in the plant 's workshops , probably . - And kept in readiness . - Protective containers . Worse . I stripped down the locking device . It 's an acoustic fuse . Charge this with gases and one of those things - a kind of booby trap . And now , Leo ? We 'd better warn our people here . It 's possible for these to turn up anywhere . I 've done that . I meant action . Future developments . I want a general alert sent out to all sections . Basic preparation of the rocket to begin at daybreak . Check number seven ! Check number eight ! - Quatermass ! It 's totally inoperable ! - My decision , Leo . - There 's only a limited chance . - I 'm aware of that . Even with a rocket with 100 % performance , but with this ! We both know its potentialities . It 'll turn into a death trap , an atomic bomb ! Is that how you intend to use it ? Quatermass ! I have no intention of using it if it can be avoided , but it 's got to be ready ! - Firing Base . - Now , you know what I want from you . - Trajectory calculations . - A fix on the asteroid . Exact position of the perigee , all possible interception lines . - I 've already told you ... - I 'm not listening to reason ! - Father ? - Who is it ? - A journalist . Says you wanted to speak to him . - Is his name Conrad ? - Yes . - Then I do want to speak to him . - I didn 't know . - Quatermass here . - What in heaven 's name does he intend to do ? - No , it is NOT the rocket project ! Something much more important . Since we last met , a lot of things have changed . What do you know about the project at Winnerden Flats ? - Nothing ? You 've never been there ? - No . No , I haven 't . I 've heard of it , of course . It 's something top secret , isn 't it ? Synthetic food ? It hardly seems like my line of country , but still , if I 'm the man you want , I ... Mm ? Which scare ? The flying objects last year ? Of course I remember . One thing at a time , sir . We were talking about ... There 's some connection ? Yes , go on . Uh-huh . Yes , I 'm sure we 've got a lot on the files . I 'm doing that right now . - Hurry with that ! - OK , Mr Conrad ! Can you give me any idea what the story is ? No . We 'd better meet as soon as possible . This afternoon . This is much more important ! Let me see . There 's a prefab town a few miles away from the plant . Yes . Yes , I see . All right . I 'll meet you there at that time . Yes , I 'll come alone . I promise . Yes , I 'll be there . But can 't you give me ? - Ah , that was quick . - I am quick . - Too quick . Where 's the rest of it ? - Eh ? - This is all there was ? - It is . Honest . You can look for yourself . All right , all right . Get along with you . There must have been more than this . Funny . - How are you , sir ? Am I late ? - No , no , no . I left my car some distance away . I thought it might be recognised . I 've been looking around . - A drink to start with ? - Mr Conrad , I 've a lot to tell you . You 'll probably have many questions . We 'd better drive around for a while . - All right . - Then we 'll have our drink . I know a pub and some people I think we ought to meet . - " Are there whiskers on it ? " - That 's what she said ! Mac , you 're the one for them , you foul-minded old ... Did you hear it ? Are you too shocked to give us another round ? Four Extra Strong . She could better it herself . Whiskers ! There you are , Mac . It 's this decent man 's silver wedding tomorrow . The way he 's taking them , you 'd think he was getting married ! Well , what 's it to be ? - After that , a double Scotch at least . - Two large Scotches , please . - Everybody here seems to be normal enough . - They probably are . - Well , cheers . - Ah , wait a minute . This isn 't a night for letting it go at that . Now , where 's Mrs Mac ? - She 's far gone in gossip . - Well , has she a drink at her ? - Hey , Mrs Mac ! - Oh , let her be , Paddy ! That 's better . Keep the party together , eh ? Now , what was it , Mrs Mac ? - Ah , that 's a sensible drink . - You 'll have me under the table ! - Get her a glass of water . - One glass of water for Mrs McLeod . - Black with a head on it ! - Don 't , Paddy . She 's not a drinking woman and she 'd be a weight to carry ! Tomorrow 's our silver wedding . Have one with us . Oh , no , these drinks are on me . Will you take the orders , please ? No , I 'm intruding on your party . A silver wedding is something I never had the fortune to reach . Mr and Mrs McLeod ? I 'd like to celebrate yours . - That 's a decent thing to say . - Your poor wife . - I said you had a sad face . - Come and sit down with us . - That 's very kind of you . - That 's right . Make yourself at home . Oh , Paddy ! You 'll be the death of me ! I shouldn 't take it , you know , really . It just rises up here . But tonight 's something special . The eve of our wedding - 25 years ago ! Here 's to you both . And the golden wedding . - Here , you can 't drink to yourself . - Oh , dear ! It must have risen already ! - I haven 't seen you . Been at the plant long ? - I don 't work there . A visitor ? We don 't get many . That 's what I always say . We 're right away from the world . - Just a plant in the marshes . - There 's two cinemas . - Sometimes I wish you 'd never taken this job . - You 've had enough . You probably know his name . The columnist Hugh Conrad . - He writes in our paper . - Hey ! Look who 's here . The fact of the matter is I 'm planning a new series of articles on what it 's really like to work in a big plant . - You want us to tell you ? - I do . It 's terrific . The best jobs a man could ask for . Do you know what they pay unskilled men ? - Ernie ! Haven 't you noticed these ? - Ah , to the devil with them ! Listen , mister . We 're construction workers . We built it , but we 've little enough idea how it functions ! - That 's left to the zombies . - Zombies ? - Men with special duties . - Why " zombies " ? They get special privileges . Free living quarters inside the plant , free board , free ... That 's an old labour dispute ! They 're maintenance men , permanent . - And we hate their guts . - They send us to Coventry all the time . - They don 't talk to you ? - Never . The security guards , what about them ? They 're just the same . Special personnel , they call them ! Special ? Dirty , diseased ... I understand the plant 's been closed to you all . - We 've been laid off , on full pay . - All construction gangs ? - Conrad ... - Tell me , the first of the pressure domes , it 's completed , isn 't it ? All of a sudden , you know too much . Put our names in the papers how we gave out secrets for the price of a drink ? - I want to talk to you . - You 're trying to pump me ! Fool ! I might have known . Listen , everybody , please . I 've got something important to tell you . I 'm not asking for information , I 'm giving it . - Please ! - Don 't listen . Well , Mrs Mac , tomorrow night 's the night . We 'll have you dancing a jig ! - Oh , Paddy ! - Let 's go . Oh , me brolly ! I left it over there . # I love the dear silver that shines in her hair # And the brow that 's all furrowed and wrinkled with care # I kiss the dear fingers so toil-worn for me # Ohhh ... # Maggie ! - What happened , love ? - Get back ! Get your wife away from here . - Conrad ! - It came through the roof ! - It 's under the floorboards . Get back ! - Who are you giving orders to ? - It 's an overshot . - An overshot . - An overshot ? - Things that fall outside the plant . - Something to do with the process . - It 's not that at all ! Let me explain . - Listen , it 's been explained to us . - Explained ? That these is just overshots . Stones . They mean nothing at all . It 's the first time one 's done damage . Here , are you OK , Mrs Mac ? Is she all right ? Just had a bit of a shock . She 'll get over it . It 's been explained ! Concoct a name and then ... You believe me ? Don 't go near it ! Listen , everybody . I 'm a scientist ! It doesn 't matter what you 've been told - it is NOT harmless ! - It 's hollow . It contains something dangerous . - Who told you ? I 've investigated it . And production at this plant is not a food , but a poison . - A poison deadly to any earthly creature . - What ? - I can prove it ! - You 'd better ! He says we make a poison ! Zombies . Look here . This lady was nearly killed . - She hurt ? - No , but she 's had a terrible shock . - Have you nothing to say ? - There will be compensation for the damage . Well , how do you like that ? Conrad , we 've got to follow them ! Look alive . Come on , quickly ! Listen . - A truck . - No , I don 't mean that . Meteorites . We 've got to get to the plant . Where 's your car ? Careful , man . You 'll have us over . Something 's happening out there . In the marshes . Watch out ! You 've hit him ! He 's alive , but it 's one of them . He was trying to stop us . Listen to them now . They 're coming in thousands . See ? Teams of men . Out on the mudflats . There ... and there . Conrad ! This is it ! This is the night ! Containers with their own gas supply . If they put the meteorites in these things before they open ... They must be using them outside now . Keep a lookout ! It 's worse than I thought . Get back to London ! Write that article as quick as you can ! But get them to listen ! Before it 's too late ! - What about you ? - I 'm going to get into the plant . I 've got to see what 's inside those pressure domes ! - Up you get . Paddy , you coming our way ? - I am . - Listen . - What is it ? - Overshots make a noise like that . - They 'd have to be in vast numbers . Must have been the car . Look , it 's that fellow . Give me it ! Give me a telephone ! Have they had an accident or what ? This is Winnerden 31 . I want to speak to London ! - Fleet Street 10000 . Yes . Quickly ! Quickly ! - Hey , are you OK ? Well , can 't you say ? Hello . Hello ! Put me through to the night desk . Hurry ! Frank ? Frank , this is Conrad . Hugh Conrad . Now , listen , I 've got a story here . Get it , every word . Don 't ask questions , just get it . For the past year , this country , and probably others , has been under the influence of ... Look , Frank , you 'll have to sub this to make it sound right . Under the influence of something from outside the Earth . Yes ... The things come in what appear to be meteorites . Contact with them produces violent infection . Ten minutes ago ... I became the victim of one . I ... Oh , Frank , I can 't ... I can 't ... Are you getting this ? Subjugation to the intention of the thing is widespread . It 's given rise to the production of a ... a protected colony at a place called Winnerden Flats . No ! It 's not synthetic food ! It 's ... It 's the re-creation of a world 800 million miles away ! They 're coming ! At this moment ... in thousands ! - What do you make of it ? - I know what to do . Mother , go home . Here , Foster , Ernie , go round the houses , and get out the lads and up to the plant ! Look , Frank , it 's ... it 's true , I tell you . It 's true ! I 've seen them ! Frank , I ... I got hold of one . I wanted to bring it back . But it ... it went to nothing in my hand after it had ... Quatermass ! Get Professor Quatermass ! He 's in the plant now ! Alone ! He 's ... Quatermass ! Quatermass ! No ... Special personnel ! Hurry ! Special personnel , get those containers into the first birth chamber . Hurry , hurry ! All containers to the first birth chamber . Stand by for next phase . Hurry and stand by for next phase . Hurry , hurry , hurry , hurry ! Keep them moving . At the Quatermass Rocket Group , the source of the abnormal meteorites has been located . A body , orbiting in space , nearing the Earth every 14 hours . As evidence grows that artificial means are being used to spread these living things and their contact infection , Quatermass decides on desperate alternatives . First , he orders the atomic rocket , with all its dangers , to be prepared for action , for time is short . At the very moment of finding proof of further plague spots in the world , his Ministry contact , Fowler , is overcome . With the prominent journalist Hugh Conrad as witness , Quatermass goes to the prefab town near the secret plant of Winnerden Flats . He appeals to construction workers . Proof of his words comes quickly - a fresh fall of meteorites now being sought by special personnel from the plant . The things are coming down in hundreds . A full invasion is on . Conrad , infected by one of them , struggles to send a report . Meanwhile , in special squad uniform , Quatermass manages to enter the plant where the recovered meteorites are being transferred to the first giant steel dome . In the re-created conditions of another world , now expanding , grouping , changing in mass and shape and size , are the ammonid things . What is the matter ? Why are you looking into the inspection window ? Come here and tell . Come here and tell why you viewed the inspection window . Attention ! Attention all special personnel ! Go to Gate Four . Repeat - Gate Four . Emergencyl Emergency ! Special personnel attend to emergency at Gate Four ! All special personnel to Gate Four . Quickly , quickly , quickly ! Gate Four . They are maintenance workers , estimated 30 in number . Stop estimating and let us in ! We demand to see the management and we 're going to see them now ! Let us inside ! Silence ! Silence ! This disturbance must end ! It 'll end as soon as this gate is open ! Is that right , boys ? - Tell them they 've got to listen to us ! - That 's right , Paddy ! - You tell them , Paddy ! - We can hear . No ! We want to see ! All right , then . Mac , you tell them . We have reason to believe there is something wrong with the process . Quiet , everybody ! Hear them ? Things falling out there ? We want to know what they are ! Well , what are they ? That 's what we 've got to know ! Those are overshots . They are to do with the working of the process . That 's no sort of answer ! Where do they come from ? They are harmless . They are being collected by our special squads . As a union official , I must object to this treatment . Special personnel , clear the gates for trucks to enter . Clear the gates ! Special personnel , clear the gates for trucks to enter . Clear the gates ! Is that door closed ? Where the hell are the light switches ? Get them off ! - Is he dead ? - No . But Frank and young Green . And a whole bunch of our boys from the tent . Filthy , slaughtering swine ! Well , youse that 's here , have you all got guns ? And magazines like I told you ? All right . Get to that window . And you over there , keep a lookout . - It 'll stop them . - They were set for trouble and got it ! Here 's something a bit heavier . A bazooka . They were ready for tanks , too ! - We nearly dropped it once . - Frank and the other fellas ... - All right , lad . - Were they killed ? - Maybe not . - We ran and ran . Why did you bring us here ? It 's the best place . They 'll think twice before they attack , for the sake of the apparatus . Get this beauty ready in case they bring anything heavy against us . - Listen ! - Hello there ! Don 't shoot ! I 'm coming through . - It 's a zombie ! - Just a minute ! - I thought I heard voices . I had to be sure . - It 's that fella ! - Where did you get those things to wear ? - I took them . - We thought you were a zombie . - You 'd be in heaven if you had been ! Tonight they 've killed decent men . - And been killed . - They started the shooting ! - Of course , I 'm glad you 're here . - Now , wait a minute . There 's things to tell us . - There isn 't time . - You led us into this , you and that reporter . - Conrad ? He 's gone back to London ? - No , he 's down there making the best of it . - He said he was infected . - Did he get the story through ? - He was trying . - Pray that he did . He said that what we call overshots are really from outside the Earth . There 's something inside them alive . Well ? Look . - The pressure dome ? - Ten minutes ago I was in there . Through an armoured panel I saw what came in those shell cases . Tiny things in their hundreds which , while I watched , grew into strong , powerful forms ! - Alive ? - Breathing . If they breathe . Gases poisonous to us . Absorbing black ammoniac slime . As they did 800 million miles away . - 800 million ? ! - I won 't believe it ! - Feeding on slime ? - Yes . The real food product of this plant . And you 've all helped to develop it ! How much of this do we believe ? Look here . Oh , go on . He can 't hurt you . Somewhere on his skin you 'll find a mark , shaped like a double ring . - Behind the ear . - I 've seen that before . On them . - Only on them ! - What about us ? - If you 're right , why aren 't we like that ? - It wasn 't necessary . - What ? - You were doing what was wanted . - And if we hadn 't ? - There would still be that dome out there . - And other plants in other countries . - There are none ! They 're being made ready now ! The means for these creatures to colonise the Earth . The human being of the future ! Ready to die for them . Mister , we can 't afford to disbelieve you . We 're committed . What 's the next action to take ? Is it from here the gases are pumped to the pressure dome ? - Cut off the supply , you mean ? - Can that be done ? It might . Here . - Who worked this place ? - They did . Aye , but we were on the construction of it , so we ought to be able to ... - Mac , isn 't that the line of the junction pipe ? - Yes . It must be . It would lead us to this set of ... Combined pressures . 200 atmospheres . Three sub-controls . Ammonia , methane , hydrogen ... Hydrogen ? The product of electrolysis of water . - Biggest unit in the country . - What happens to oxygen ? - It 's piped through to the power section . - Yes , it would be . - Where is it piped through ? - Through here . Then we 're in control ! Can your men open up that food pipe and pump oxygen into it ? We could try , but surely oxygen ... To those things in that pressure dome , it 's a deadly poison . Paddy ! Paddy , where are you ? We 've got to get this whole section out . Swing a length of superhose across ... - How long ? - Give me an hour . Ernie , hurry them up . - No ! The tackle first ! - Attention ! Calling unauthorised personnel now in occupation of the pressure control block . Resistance by you must end . It must end immediately . Lay down your weapons and leave in an orderly fashion . You will then be permitted to go to your homes pending further action . - Is that so ? - It is known that Quatermass is among you . - How do they know ? - Pay no attention to this troublemaker . - See anything ? - Cease resistance now . You will be fairly treated . Abandon all weapons and come out . Come out and ... Come out and be shot to death , is it ? - Trying to move in on us . - Have they gone ? One got clear . - You know an odd thing ? None tried for cover . - Their reactions aren 't normal men 's . Swine . They must be kept away . They may be ... carrying something . You go round the boys . Tell them what to do . Here . I 've got work to do . All right , let 's get on with it . Lower away . No . It 's no good - an internal line . I tried it . The old woman 's a worrier . No , I haven 't heard from him . Hello ? I 'm his daughter . I told them that before . I understood he was to meet one of your staff reporters tonight . Yes , Hugh Conrad . Did they meet ? Did you get a story from them ? Why can 't you tell me ? Do you know where my father is ? Where am I ? Why do you want to know ? Preparations ? No . None . I 'm working alone . Hello ? Hello ? ! Get me the Firing Base , quickly . Hello , Leo ! I 'm worried . There 's something I want to tell you . Stay and I 'll come down . Oh , thanks . Hmm . That sees everything checked , then . Go and get some sleep in case there 's an early alert . - I said in case . There 's still no decision . - Yes , sir . - Hello there ! You ! - What is it , sir ? - Oh , it 's all right . Just want to make sure . - You can trust me , sir . - Who 's that ? Right you are , miss . - Leo ! Something 's gone wrong ! - Oh ? - I know it 's meaningless now , but ... They rang up just now from that newspaper . Asking as if they hadn 't had the story . - Yet they knew what it was . - Who spoke to you ? They refused to say . They kept asking . That was what was so odd . Leo , they only wanted to know about this rocket . - The rocket ? - I was suddenly afraid . - Did you tell them anything ? - No . Ohh , it 's so cold . Seven hours till dawn . It 'll get colder . They knew where Father was . They denied it , but I could tell . - How ? - Those voices . The way things were put . Leo , he 's inside the plant . I 'm sure of it . - I 'll go . - You ? Oh , isn 't there some other way ? - The police ? Or some official way ? - They 're a risk now . - But surely ... - A risk we dare not take . - May I come with you ? - Just one of us . No . It 's closing in , isn 't it ? Those woods over there . The colour of the moonlight . The air itself . As if it were changing already . Allegations have been made concerning the nature and operation of the process . These allegations are without foundation in fact . There has been violence . Also , an interruption of gas supplies by unauthorised personnel . - How is it up there ? - Nearly finished ! Hurry it up , will you ? I said an hour . We 'll be well under . The normal working of the plant must be allowed to proceed . Usual night shift amenities are being provided . Amenities ? Music while you work ! We have it whenever there 's a night shift . Playing it now - are they mad ? ! - What do you make of it ? - Persuasion . - Who are they trying to persuade ? - You - that this is just a routine night and you 've been led into a wild blunder . Listen to it ! There 's men lying dead ! - No , no ! We may need that ! - Paddy ! All clear ! Right ! Let them set this to music ! Let her go , Mac . Ernie , don 't take your eye off it . Going at full pressure . Go on . - Pure oxygen . Are you sure about that ? - Yes . Once it begins to work - when that will be depends on many factors , mostly unknown - but come here . That pipe must be kept clear . It goes pretty well straight up and high . They 'd have a job to get at it , but ... Did you hear that , mates ? - How long before something happens ? - I can 't tell . Damn music ! When you mix oxygen and what do you call it ... hydrogen , isn 't it an explosive mixture ? Eventually , but that 's not what we 're trying to do . The oxygen should work on its own by now . Ahh . How long is it ? Only a few hours since we were down at the pub . Celebrating . Aye . It 's the day now . I 'm 25 years married . - Good old Mac . - You should try it sometime , Paddy . - The wedded state . I remember once we ... - Attention ! Attention ! Normal working must be restored . Disruption must cease . The management are anxious to co-operate . Anyone injured in recent violence will be treated immediately . The canteen is also open for normal service . Unauthorised personnel in the pressure control block report to the canteen . All questions can be settled there . Leave any weapons and go to the canteen . - Go now ! Go ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Hurry ! - Listen ! It must be starting to work ! " Leave any weapons " ! Do you hear them ? Everybody stay right where you are ! - A zombie trying to get to the pipe . - They 'll try anything . - Think they 'll rush us ? - Not till the last . Attention ! Attention ! This is a final appeal . You are destroying the process you worked to create , you and your comrades . Oxygen gas being passed into the Pressure Dome A will destroy a priceless food product . You have been misled . You are betraying your comrades . They will suffer for your folly . Here is an offer . The entire plant is open for your inspection as from now . Whatever you wish to see will be shown to you . This is in good faith . - Hear that ? - It 's just a bluff , isn 't it ? - It 's what we asked for ! - They 're desperate . McLeod , you 're a fool ... - What proof have you given us ? - For heaven 's sake , man ! - I 've listened to you too long ! - This is the last appeal to reasonable men . - Do not betray your work and your comrades . - Hello ? Hello ? You are chosen workers in a unique and revolutionary process . - My name 's McLeod . Put me through . - Who is that ? EJ McLeod , shop steward . I 'm accepting your offer . - I want to see inside Pressure Dome A. - Don 't do it ! I told you what 's in there ! - At the least , you 'll be infected ! - Hurry . Come alone or bring your companions . - Make them go with you . - I want your men to come with me . - Agreed . - They 're at their most dangerous ! They 'll be in mortal agony ! Meet one minute from now outside Pressure Dome A. Confirm this . - I 'll be there . - Mad and useless ! They said good faith . If they break it , do what you can . - I 'll go with you . - No . You 're in charge here . But the others ... - I 'm with you , Mac . We 've stuck together . - Let 's have that door open . - For the last time , won 't you believe me ? - I 'll believe my own eyes . Keep them covered , as far as you can . Did you see their men ? No guns on any of them . Maybe they mean it . It won 't be long now . One way or the other , we 'll know when they come out . Hey , listen ! - I heard something along the pipe like ... - What , Ernie ? - Men . - Men ? - A long way off , sort of yelling . - How long did it go on ? - Just a moment . A few seconds . - Ssh ! - There 's something . - It 's ... It 's different now . Seems to come from the other end of the pipe . At the dome . Men ! Do you see anything ? Hello ? Hello ? Is anybody there ? - What was that ? - No reply ? I thought I saw a man . Running away from the dome . A zombie ? Look at the pressure ! Hey , up there ! Cut the oxygen , quick ! Walter ! Everything off ! No higher . - You know what that meant . - The pipe 's blocked . - Blocked ? How could it be ? - I said they were in agony . - They had to stop the oxygen flowing . - What with ? - I 'm going to open it up ! - No ! Don 't do that ! I 'm going to do it , mister ! If what you said is true , what 's blocking that pipe might even be ... Come on , everybody ! Ernie , never mind that gauge ! It 's coming ! When I shout , everybody back ! Right ! It 's coming ... now ! There 's something trickling . You hear it ? Hear it ? Blood ! - I tried to stop them . - You mean ? Mac ? And the others ? Their own men , too . They ... They must have taken them and used them to block the pipe . Th-They 're jammed in the pipe ? A human pulp ! - No , no , no ! - Hold it , men ! If the gas is sparked , there 'll be no chance ! Leo , what are you doing here ? Quatermass ! I got here ... The explosion ... The whole tank went up . Leo , it was full of them . The ammonates . It 's clearing now . Lucky you had the window closed . Leo , there are men back there . They 've got to get help . - In the pressure tank ? - That 's nothing . - I went to look . There 's nothing . They 're gone . - Destroyed ? All of them . The whole plant 's a wreck . - They 're finished . - So ... Sounds like helicopters . Coming this way . Leave it to them ! Quatermass , we 've got to get back to the rocket ! Quickly ! - Why ? What 's happened ? - You drive . Got to get back to the rocket ! This is what Leo told you about . The list . Father , I couldn 't believe I 'd see you again ! Calls every few minutes asking for you and then cutting off . No names . And always different voices . As if they knew , knew you were dead . - Have there been planes over here before ? - No . Hello ? When did Fowler send this ? Not long after you left . From the Ministry . Just those names of countries , over and over . - Gradually , he couldn 't speak . - " Protected information " ! All these , in all parts of the world . And we 've only wiped out a single nest . Hello ? For heaven 's sake , check the number ! I wish you 'd leave it . Don 't try to make that call . I must make this known . There 's at least another two plants nearly completed and we 've only got days , hours . - One 's destroyed , the others will be . - Who 's to do it ? Who knows ? - We can 't be the only people . - And if we are ? Hello ! This is Bernard Quatermass . To whom am I speaking ? Have you had the report from Hugh Conrad ? Your man Conrad ! About the project at Winnerden Flats ! Well , have you or have you not ? There 's a lot more to add . A riot last night , half the plant destroyed ... Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? I 've been cut off . What ? All of them ? Keep trying . There 's something wrong with the lines . - You mean they 've been cut ? - Leo ? Have you got all the trajectories set ? All possible points of interception ? How are the internal lines ? Up in an hour ? In one hour 23 minutes . - Miss that , you wait another 14 hours . - " You " ? Right . Alert all sections for rocket take-off at 0817 hours . Get me the Firing Base . Here , you take it . We must be able to hold out this place long enough . There must be somebody there . I thought I saw figures . - Figures ! - Firing Base ? Hello ? Who is that ? Who ? Your voice ... It 's John Dillon . He 's come back . Yes , back . The rocket base is under our control . Discharged from an asteroid near the Earth , ammonid creatures are growing to monstrous size and power at the first of the steel pressure domes at Winnerden Flats . Discovery that the purpose of the vast secret plant , planned by infected human beings , is to harbour the ammonids in the re-created conditions of an outer planet leads to an armed riot by uninfected construction workers . They storm their way into the control centre . Their actions , on the advice of Quatermass , result in an interruption of vital gas supplies and , finally , in the destruction of the creatures in their first colony on Earth . Escaping from the holocaust , Quatermass finds that his chief assistant , Doctor Leo Pugh , has narrowly escaped death from the exploding gases in coming to find him . But the danger is not passed , but growing . There is proof that other colonies exist in the world , almost ready for occupation . Convinced that his own freedom is now limited , Quatermass decides on a desperate throw - to use the faulty nuclear rocket as an offensive weapon . But already it seems too late . The rocket base is under our control . Set up holding positions . You two men , with me . They must have overpowered our security people . Quatermass to all sections . Stay where you are and keep calm . These men are British paratroops . We 'll sort it out . Meanwhile , stand by . I don 't want a massacre . - There . Coming into the lights now . - Dillon ? - Two men with him . The rest stayed behind . - You get out . Go to the radiation bunker . - I won 't leave . - They may be carrying more than guns . - You 've seen those containers . - Yes . He won 't be the same man you knew . I 'm prepared for that and I won 't leave you alone to face ... It doesn 't matter . This establishment is under military control . - Johnny ... - What have you come to do ? Here are written orders . - From the very top . Look at the signature . - Yes . - If that 's genuine ... - I 've no doubt . And now ... is it our turn ? - When was this issued ? - Three hours ago . Before the explosion . When those things in the dome were destroyed , the influence ... It obviously made no difference . Captain Dillon ... It is necessary to speak with you alone . Tell your men . Tell your men . Wait outside . - You must understand ... - Take care ! Dillon ? Captain John Dillon . When you came here four days ago , you brought something you had found . Remember this ? The meteorite ? You thought it might mean danger . It did . Terrible danger . It 's one of these that has infected you . Are you aware of this ? Can you try to resist ? Even for a short time ? There 's a possibility , no more than that , to reach the parent body from which these come . This is evidently known , or at least anticipated . If I 'm not able to make this attempt , they 'll come again in their thousands and their millions . New colonies are being made ready for them elsewhere in the world . There they can develop , expand , breed , protected by their victims ! Men like you , Dillon ! Guarding and feeding them until they spread all over the Earth ! Until your condition becomes the condition of all humanity ! A subject race forever or until such time as we have served our purpose and are brought to an end . Choked to death , perhaps , in a changing atmosphere . They show no mercy for those they use . - They 'll kill your kind , as they will the rest of us . - No , no ! - I 've seen them do it ! - Orders ... the orders ! - THEIR orders ! Break them ! - This man may be throwing his life away . But better that than ... the other . Do you understand ? Keep back ! Understand ... Understand . Captain Dillon ... The rocket must go . Just over an hour , that 's all we need . Your men , are they like you ? Tell them . Give orders . You can speak to them from here . Get me the firing base . Is Lieutenant Carter there ? Carter ? A change in plans . Withdraw all troops from area of rocket . Stand them down . Quatermass to all sections . Stand by to resume preparations for take-off . I repeat , stand by to resume preparations for take-off . This will be at 0817 hours . You turn into the orbit of the objective after ten hours seven minutes . There will be no margin for error . The last stage depends on the physical nature of the objective . Try to home onto it and fasten to it . Must you do that ? If this plan is to succeed , yes . Force-jettison the remaining fuel in Step Two . That should take you about 70 seconds . Set the nuclear motor into its critical phase . The nuclear motor . That costly and explosive dud . Well , maybe we 'll be able to give the taxpayer value ! The Australian prototype reached explosion point in 2 minutes 45 seconds . - There 's time to try to get clear . - Under certain circumstances . And if those circumstances are wrong , there 's still time to get clear ? No . This is no sort of examination at the very last moment . - How long were you exposed to those gases ? - A few minutes . - And you 're over the permissible age . - There 's no one else to do what I have to do . - Must it be him ? - We may need changes to our calculations . He 's the only one that can do them . You understand that under normal experimental conditions , I couldn 't pass either of you ? I do . It 's your decision . Now , wearing these the whole flight is going to increase the strain . Is it essential ? Yes . We may be able to dispense with our helmets at certain periods , but no more . - You aren 't going to leave the rocket ? - I 've no intention of doing so . - Then why these ? - The rocket may suffer damage after take-off . You mean retaliation ? I don 't think we 're going to be ... unexpected . Firing cable connected ! I 'll follow . - Stay on the control panel . - You know I will . As long as possible . Dillon , you 'd better get your men clear . Goodbye , my darling . Damn these things . This is Ground Control . Please clear the firing base . This is Ground Controller speaking . Please clear the firing base . - Check two tally ? - Yes . All points , please . Observatory B ? Thank you . Rolling platform , clear the firing base . Control to Quatermass . Three minutes to go . Are you set in take-off positions ? Are you set in take-off positions ? Over . Quatermass to Control . Almost . Thank you . Over . You all right , Leo ? What 's this ? This gun . Did you ? - Something you overlooked . - Any excess weight , no matter how small ... - Except ... - One minute to go . Quatermass to Control . All set . Standing by . - Over . - 30 seconds to go . 25 seconds . 20 seconds . 15 seconds . Ten seconds . Nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . Quatermass to Control . Burn-out of rocket booster just occurred . Height - 18 miles . 20 . 22 . 24 . Count down . Over . Control to Quatermass . Correct . Drop through , sir . Nuclear motor firing . Over . And out . All right so far . As long as we 're getting that signal . - Don 't worry . - Not much longer . By Doppler monitors , their height should be coming up to ... 600 miles . - They 'll cut the motor in ... - The nuclear motor . It should be in ... five seconds from now . It 's gone ! The signal , it 's gone ! No . We were picking up radiation from the motor . They 've cut it on time . - It must be . - Acceleration . They 've had to stand over 12Gs . Control to Quatermass ! Information , please . Over . Quatermass to Control . Velocity ... 32,000 miles per hour . Course as directed . We 're suffering ... G effects . Give me a few minutes . Over . Leo . Leo , I ... I 'll step up the oxygen . - Ah , that 's better . - Get your feet on the floor or they 'll float . Can you manage ? Once the magnetic soles are holding , you 'll be all right . Quatermass to Control . Speed maintained at 32,100 . Internal pressure , temperature normal . Nuclear motor cut out cleanly . No indication of runaway reaction . Hope we get it when we want it . Now ... check with me every ten minutes . If anything happens to prevent this , notify me instantly . Over . Control to Quatermass . Check and out . Oh , Leo ... This should have been a great moment . A crew of fit young men , bursting through the frontiers of space , and so on . A magnificent achievement . Not two old men on a kamikaze flight . Oh ! Sorry . Lack of oxygen . Radar screen shows all clear ahead . Less than ten hours to go . Control to Quatermass . Ready for check . Over . Quatermass ... Quatermass to Control . No change since last check . Beta deviation zero seven . - As it should be . - Over . Control to Quatermass . Course correct by precalculations . You 're getting beyond the range of equipment . Shall we continue to check with you at the present ? Over . Quatermass to Control . Yes , keep me informed . I want to know the situation with you . Over . There 's no change . The ... military are still here . But no interference in our work . Over . And out . All right , Leo . I 'll take over for a spell . Have you rechecked all this ? - Yes . - Are you sure ? Yes . Teacher ... at the village school ... " Stand up , Leo Pugh . " Leo Pugh , multiply ... " 12,548,321 by 25 times 35 . " Leo Pugh ... divide ... " Leo Pugh ... multiply ... divide ... multiply ... divide ... " Leo Pugh , you 're a mathematical genius . " " Yes , Miss Williams . " " You have a brain that , when you grow up , will have the power to benefit mankind . " " Yes , Miss Williams . " - What 's the matter ? - Nothing . - Are you ill ? - No . - Lungs , chest , any congestion ? - No , no . Better make sure . Don 't want anything to go wrong with you . As far as my medical knowledge tells me , you ought to get out of this for a bit . - No . - We 've got drugs . - We don 't want any stern endurance yet . - It will not happen . - I think they were natural . - Yes . Quatermass to Control . Just gone through a swarm of meteorites . No damage sustained . Speed indications here show that they were normal . Beta deviation now ... zero nine . Over . Control to Quatermass . You were lucky ! Beta deviation correct for position . Out . No , wait a moment ! Hello ? I can 't talk loudly . Can you hear me ? Over . Yes . Over . It 's about ... Dillon . He 's here in the control room . A few moments ago , he said something . It sounded like , " They must reach it . " Just that . Over . Coming from him ? It 's probably nothing . Don 't worry . Are you all right ? Over . Be careful . Over and out . Enemy territory ahead . Hard , unwinking stars . No atmosphere to deceive us . We 're seeing them as they really are . And somewhere ahead ... an object . Constructed , if it is constructed , by creatures whose very existence makes us fools . Somewhere . Boneless creatures able to make energy at will by changing their mass . Able to transmit experience . To maintain power over other creatures . Time is close now . Yes . Very close . Leo ... Ten hours ago , had that influence weakened or merely changed direction ? - Can 't afford these speculations . - Into another channel . When it touches a very complex human brain , the effect may be deeper , more complete . No resistance . Leo , am I right ? - Right ? - You know what I 'm saying . - All attention must be on the controls now . - Leo , tell me I 'm making a mistake . The course is correct ! Present position within 14 degrees four five six . Leo ! When did it happen ? Nothing ... nothing happened . When I found you in the car that time , was it the effect of the gases or had some of them survived the explosion and one of them reached you ? - You 're mad ! - Is that why Dillon was confused ? - Because the orders were changed ? - Stop this ! - Tell me ! - Let go ! - Then I 'll know what to do ! - Do you want to destroy us ? ! Control to Quatermass . Check your position . Check your position . You should now be ready to enter interception orbit . Over . - See ? You wouldn 't listen . - Quatermass to Control . Position checked . No change . They 're still getting no reaction from objective . Is it where we expect ? Over . By our observations , it is . Over . Quick ! Time to change the alignment ! 24 . 25 . 02 . Turn will be completed ... in seven seconds ... from now . Manoeuvre complete . We shall make contact within two minutes . Yes . Over . Bernard ! See ! Against the thing ... We hit it ! I 've got the grapples out . There seems to be some sort of rock surface . Like plates . But we seem to be holding . Visibility 's gone , but there 's no doubt . This is it . I 'm going to force-jettison the nuclear fluid and set it into the critical phase . Leo ! Leo ? Leo ? Where are you ? What are you doing ? Leo ! Come back ! Leo ! Leo ! Leo ! Leo ! Leo ! Where are you ? Leo ! Leo ! Where are you ? Leo , come back ! Leo ! Leo , where are you ? Leo ! Are you there , Leo ? Leo , what are you doing ? Give me that gun ! Go back to the rocket ! Leo ! Leo , come back ... - We 're not going back . - What ? Instead of you , there will be others . - Others ? - Listen . Listen . More of them must reach the Earth . In the rocket . - It is necessary . - You WERE infected ! I was shown that these things are to happen . - Don 't fire that gun ! - You have done as intended . Now there is no more need of you . Aaaargh ! Leo ? Leo ? Leo ! - Aaargh ! - Leo ! There 's no gravity . It was the recoil . Leo , can you hear me ? Twist in the other direction ! And fire again . Leo ! Hurry ! - Hurry ! - Aaaargh ! - They 're coming ! - Help ! Leo ... He-e-elp ! Aaaargh ... Quatermass to Control ! Are you receiving me ? Over . We are . Over . They 're holding me ! The fuel 's gone from the nuclear rocket . The critical phase has started . - But Pugh 's outside . - Help ! - Help ! - Never mind . I think ... Yes ! Yes , it is ! - At critical point ! - Help ! It passed ! I 'm going to separate the cruise section from the nuclear stage and fire at the last chemical motor ! There 's an even chance I 'll get free . Help ! Leo ! If you can hear me ... there 's no other way ! Help ! It worked . Nuclear motor abandoned in orbit ... as planned . It should go up any second now . Control to Quatermass ! You 've done it ! The trace went completely ! You wiped it out ! - Are you safe ? Father , can you answer us ? - Over . Yes . Quatermass to Control . My instruments show the same . Over . - He 's destroyed it utterly ! - Captain Dillon ! Look at him ! The mark ! - It 's gone ! - Paula ... - If it 's the same for the others ... - Control to Quatermass ! The effect is over ! Finally going ! Dillon , talk to him . Let him hear your voice . Quatermass ! Quatermass , this is Dillon . John Dillon . Are you there ? Can you hear me ? Can you hear what I 'm saying ? Yes . It 's over .

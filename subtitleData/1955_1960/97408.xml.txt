 THE MYSTERIANS ( CHIKYU BOEIGUN ) Isn 't it great ? ! - They will dance all night . Etsuko , would you like to dance with me ? Sure , shall we ? - Yes ! Hey Shiraishi , why don 't you dance with Hiroko ? Brother ! What 's going on with you ? You 're hurting Hiroko 's feelings . Why did you break your engagement with Hiroko ? She is concerned about you . That is not like you . I can 't ... I can 't marry her . Unfortunately , I must stay here in this village . That 's not you at all . What do you have to do here anyway ? Go back to the festival . Hey ... Hey ... Look . Fire , Fire ! Where is my brother ? - Your brother ? He ran to the fire . The flames are huge Follow me Over here ! - Over here ! Wait ! What is it ? ! You are Mr. Shiraishi , right ? The fire is spreading fast . It 's best to stay here . You don 't get it We can 't just stand here ! We 're going to put it out ! But that 's too dangerous ! We are old enough Let 's go , go ! Here we go - We 'll stop it ! Out of the way Stand back ! Gee , this fire is big . What do you think we should do ? Oh boy . I wasn 't expecting this . Let 's run Run ! Run ! Blimey ! Zounds ! DOOOOH ! Mr Atsumi is here to see you . How do you do ? Fine ... Let 's go there . It seems that Shiraishi isn 't doing well . I wonder where he is now with his theories - Well ... He wanted me to give you this . He is still working on it ... A report on Mysteroido ! What is Mysteroido ? - It 's the name of a planetoido . He believes there is a small cluster of planets between Mars and Saturn But before that , it used to be one big sized planet . That 's according to Shiraishi . But to us , it is still a mystery , hence the name : Mysteroido . You don 't seem to believe much in Shiraishi 's theories . Nope . I 'm not bold enough to believe in theories like that . That 's rather strange . What is ? Well , a real scientist would have finished his report . Hello ? He 's here . Please hold the line . Atsumi , it 's someone from the university . Sure . Hello , Atsumi here . What ? Mount Fuji ? Which village is it ? ! Yes . I understand . There is an earthquake right where Shiraishi lives . I hope Shiraishi is fine . I dunno if we will be able to talk to the villagers . What do you mean ? There is a lot of radioactivity in that area . Really ? Between ourselves , I don 't think many of them are still alive . Something unusual must have happened to them . Let 's go that way . That 's weird . It wasn 't like that yesterday at all . Thank you for coming . - Thank you . Incredible ! I can 't believe a Shinto shrine was standing just right here . If that 's the case , then the village should be standing right over there . It 's as if something has turned the place upside down . We haven 't found one trace of radiation here . Strange ... It was radioactive yesterday . Really ? ! - Yes . What do you think ? Mmm ... Let 's carry on . Shiraishi was here for health reasons , ja ? - Yep . He was the best in his field . Jolly good . Shall we see where the fire took place then ? Let 's go there . What 's going on ? - let 's see . All the fishes are dead ! They must come from upstream ! Right , let 's investigate . We go ! - Jawoll ! Something 's burning . The tyre is smoking . - What the ? ! The road is burning hot ! It 's radioactive . What 's that ? ! Oh bollocks ! Let 's go back ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Hold that ! Hurry ! Schnell ! Mr. Atsumi . Etsuko Shiraishi from Tokyo is waiting for you at the hotel . Thanks . Captain . Thank you for coming . What is this thing ? Is it true that weapons can 't stop it ? Yes indeed . It fires some sort of heat ray . So it did burn the whole area then ? What ? The monster is approaching the power station ? Is that far from here ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Emanuelle ! Emanuelle ! Oui ? We must leave ! Hurry ! - yes ! First battalion reporting ! What ? The 3rd battalion ? Captain ! Yes ? Yes ... Go to the city at once ! We are under attack ! By order of the army , all citizen must evacuate ! By order of the army , evacuate to the fields ! I think Shiraishi 's studies are linked to all this . You think so ? By order of the army , evacuate to the fields ! Clear the area ! Clear the area ! Clear the area ! Clear the area ! Hurry across the bridge ! We are now setting charges ! What were those ? Prepare the charges ! Detonate ! The fires , the earthquake , and the monster ... All this must be linked to someone , but nothing is for sure . Our analysis of this part of the monster shows it to be made of a new metal . It is made of a substance that cannot be found here on Earth . The monster is not a living thing . It is a remotely controlled roboto ! Who can have created such a thing ? And for what purposes ? I do not know . We are trying to discover who is behind all this . Excuse me . Do you mean to say that this thing comes from outer-space ? Our enquiry is not over . Professor ! Shiraishi 's theory is correct . This mystery comes from beyond the Moon Are these UFOs ? Let 's take a picture . - Yes , certainly . Ah , just the man ! Shiraishi was really on to something big . Everything was foretold in his report . Professor , I 'm done . It 's their base . No doubts about it . They travel by rocket ? - I don 't think so . According to Shiraishi , they use an artificial satellite . They can do as they want from up there . Professor , I saw some UFOs at the village . Really ? So did Shiraishi 's sister . You should have told me first ! But ... a scientist must have proofs Sometimes you have to do without them . The future of mankind is as stake . No need for scientific rigor . Tomorrow the press will be told and I 'll ask the help of all the scientists . Give me all the details . Absolutely . Shiraishi believed that UFOs roamed around this lake . There are no fish here and at times you can see strange ripples on the water . Professor , what is that ? Let 's move ! Earthlings ... We do not want of an unnecessary war . We want to talk to the following 5 people only : Kenjo Adachi , Masao Noda , Tsutomu Koda , Joji Atsumi et Nobu Kawanami . How do they know us ? We have been invited , let us go in . Wait , once you are inside , there is nothing we can do to protect you . Well , too bad . We must go see them . But ... - Let us go . Do you guarantee their well being ? Yes . Please do come in . Inform HQ - Yarr matie ! Hello , Hello . 1st battalion reporting here . Yes ... Yes . We are ready to engage if needed . It will be cold inside ; please take a coat . Please , have a seat . It is a great honor to receive Earth 's greatest scientists . Maybe , but we aren 't very happy about being summoned here . To avoid war , you will have to make some small concessions . What small concessions ? As you are aware , we have been attacked since we 've first arrived . We have shown you our might , so we can avoid any other conflict . Where do you come from ? We come from the planet that Ryoichi Shiraishi has called Mysteroido . If such a planet has ever existed , it exploded some thousands of years ago . Yes . It was because we Mysterians started a nuclear war . But some of us fled the planet in time to take refuge on Mars . On Mars ? Of course . You all 5 people know that Science is without limits . These people want war . We hope that you will dissuade them . We have had the H bomb while Earth was still in the stone age . If Earth decides to use the H bomb , so shall we . And the Earth will be totally destroyed . What is your reason to come to Earth ? Haven 't you launched satellites ? Don 't you want to conquer the Moon and then conquer Mars ? We haven 't got such grand ambitions . We only request a zone of 3 kilometers around this base . We also want to breed with Earth women . Because of all the Strontium-90 , 80 % of our babies are born deformed . To save our race , we need to cross breed . To start with , we want these 5 women . We already have 3 of them . That 's insane ! You weirdos want us to GIVE you our women ? We are actually a peace loving people . This ends this meeting . We now rely entirely on you to make the right decision . They are asking for a 3km zone which they already have gained by force . They also request to mate with Earth girls , but they have abducted 3 of them already . Although they are stronger than us , we have to show them we can fight . Start the military operations . The Army is on alert and deploying in great urgency . Combat units are regrouping around Mount Fuji . After attending an important conference Professor Adachi talks to the press . We must all face something that concerns us all , humans . Our decision was taken , after long talks and deliberations . That is all for the day . Welcome ! Welcome . Have you seen the news ? Do you know what is happening ? It 's the Mysterians , they want to breed with our women . Oh my god ... - Oh , no ... There is worse . You have been chosen . Don 't joke with these things ! - I 'm not joking at all . You are under the protection of the police . Joji ... They must have obtained a picture of the festival . That is correct . Look , on the television ! You ! As you can see , I am still alive . Atsumi , I know that the Army will attack at 22 : 00 . Make them stop . As a scientist , you must do it . Are the Mysterians forcing you to say that ? No . I 'm doing this for Earth . Are 3 km too much to ask for ? You work for them ? After having met them , I now know that our scientists are no match for them . Nothing can compare to their technology . I 'm speaking to you from a TV set just to show you their superiority . Don 't start a war you have already lost . If you want to contact me , just turn on your TV . At any time . Brother ! ... instead Space isn 't empty but inhabited by superior races . Let us put our differences aside and face this menace together . Shiraishi is with the Mysterians . And how do you know that ? I have seen him on out TV set . - On your TV set ? ! He begged me to stop the attack . I can 't believe that . Not one bit ... - But ... Everything is ready ! - Perfect ! Ready for transmission ! - Ready for transmission . Spy plane now at coordinates : 137 ° 47 ' east , 35 ° 35 ' north . Open fire ! - Open fire ! Pull back ! Now ! According to our technical staff this ray of theirs is a gamma ray of 10,000 renkens . It 's an energy of level 10 In short , their ray has the power of the great Kanto earthquake . That much ? - Absolutely . People of Earth ... People of Earth ... The Mysterians do not want war . We are only defending ourselves and we will stop when the threat stops . We simply request a 3 km zone around our location . We hope that the governments will grant us that . The Mysterians only want one thing , peace on Earth . We have been utterly defeated . So , what is done now ? We are studying the results of our attack Has anything been found ? - No , nothing at the time . Teko , give me a report on our ground forces .. - Yes , chief . Take a look at this . A Supersonic Atomic Heat Ray Cannon ? - One of my teams is working on it . Whether they like or not , the USA and the USSR live on the same planet . What is happening to Japan can happen tomorrow to the USA or the USSR . I 'm sure that all the people on Earth will get united against the Mysterians Failing to do so , will be the end of our human race . If the Mysterians gain ground on Earth , others will arrive . Have they travelled that far for just 3 km ? Let me show you my plan . When will this be ready ? We need 500 of your Earth 's hours . 500 hours ? When the subterranean complex is finished , the shore will be ours . In Arizona , the USA have launched a satellite to spy on the Mysterians . We hope to gather important informations . Do you know Ryoichi Shiraishi ? Yes , I have met him in Geneva . At the International Space Conference , right ? Yes , that 's right . Would you like to talk to him ? Can we do that ? - Yes . Lots of things can come out of my hat , like ... Oh ! It 's you ! Greetings ! You must be fearing for you life . I 'm a scientist . The Mysterians want to prevent the destruction of Earth . What do you mean by that ? That the human race will blow itself up in 20 years from now . in 20 years ? 20 years ! It 's the time it took on Mysteroido . The Earth cannot stay under the control of the humans . Control the world ? It 's what humans do with animals Our space station is 42,000 km above our heads . The flying saucers can reach New York London , Moscow , Tokyo in one instant . The Mysterians have complete control over Earth 's skies . Who is controlling Earth now ? You or the Mysterians ? No , it 's Science that rules now . But we have to fight ... We haven 't got any other choice . We must study the Mysterians 's weaknesses . For instance , the dome 's ray ... It can 't aim high into the sky . According to Pr Adachi , the Mysterians cannot stand hot temperatures . Let 's stay focus on these points and apply that to our heat cannon . Yes . I 'll inform the general immediately . Good . So ? Are they watching us ? What do you think they 're doing ? It 's only the beginning . They bet on an easy war . Without weapons , what can we do against them ? It looks like the Earth forces ! - Cover your eyes ! No flying saucers in sight . We believe their ray loses half of it 's power above 3,000 metres . Airship Beta , airship Beta , this is captain Sugimoto . Initiate the attack at 3,000 ... Initiate the attack at 3,000 ... Roger , roger . Engage the enemy ! Start dropping the bombs ! Are you hurt ? Hang on ! Airship Beta , airship Beta . Continue the attack ! Temperatures of 3000 degrees Celsius have no effect ! What is this dome made of ? Airship Alpha , airship Alpha . HQ here . Abort mission and return to base . Abort mission . Maybe there is really nothing we can do against the Mysterians . It 's coming from right underneath ! General . Have you heard HQ ? General , unless we can bounce their ray , things will get very bad . Is the electronic heat gun ready ? Yes . The only problem is to mount it on an airship . Please hurry up , the entire world is depending on it . Yes , general . We now occupy a 120 km zone . This is a warning . Any earthling that will come in will be killed . The situation requires it , we can 't avoid the possible use of nuclear weapons . Kawakita , we can 't allow ourselves to do that . What happened to the Mysterians might happen to us . Please look at this ! It 's a new weapon . A Markalite ? To sum it up , it 's a 200m wide Atomic Heat Ray Reflector . That 's a hell of a thing ! It can store the ray and send it back to the enemy . From its center , it will send a ray of the same power back at the Mysterians . It 's range is of one and a half km . So we must built it close to where the enemy is then ? Won 't they destroy it before we 're thru building it ? Of course ! ... How can we do then ? We must have an other meeting . Can 't we mount this thing on airship Alpha ? Yes . It could neutralise the Mysterians Heat ray . I shall organize a technical meeting . - Good . Is there a problem ? - No , no , nothing at all . Hiroko ? Hiroko ? Hiroko ? Crap ! - Don 't shoot ! Etsuko ! Report back ! - Yes chief ! Based on the recent UFO activity , the Mysterians must be closing in on their goals . We just can 't wait . If the heat ray cannon is not ready , then let 's use the Markalite . But the Markalite won 't last for more than 7 hours . We must also use the ray cannon . No . Even if the damages aren 't important it will delay them long enough . We shall attack . Do your best to finish the heat ray cannon in time . Yes . We must evacuate the 120 km zone right away . I hate to have to sacrifice Etsuko and Hiroko . But we can 't save them now . We can 't stop everything just for them both . In the valley , a tunnel opened right under my feet . The Mysterians might be strong , but they can 't stop a man alone ! And I 'm not afraid ! But I can 't stop the attack . Yes ? Ah ? The Markalite will be deployed ? It 's ready to be moved to mount Fuji ? Thank you very much . Atsumi ! Drop it ! First unit is working fine . Everything is nominal . The Earth women , where are they ? NO ! All of you , come with me please ! Now ! The Markalite is weakening . 20 minutes left . Airship Beta , take-off . Airship Beta , take-off . Here is airship Beta , here is airship Beta . The heat ray cannon is not ready yet . Cease fire immediately or else we shall strike back . Very well , but you must leave our planet first . Airship Beta ! Airship Beta ! Only 5 minutes left . Here is airship Beta , here is airship Beta . We are taking off . Hurry up and get out of here . Ryoichi ! Brother ! Stand back ! I 'm not coming with you . Shiraishi ! Don 't say anything . Take that to Professor Adachi , it 's the second part of my report . My paper on Mysteroido is now finished . Ryoichi ! Shiraishi ! Very soon their base will be built . Then they shall destroy Tokyo . The Mysterians have betrayed me . I still have things to do here . Goodbye . Ryoichi ! - Shiraishi ! Hurry up and get out ! There is going to be a big firework ! The Earth must be told about the sad story of the Mysterians . We must reject hate and learn to love ! The Earth must not repeat the same mistakes the Mysterians did . Look ! Come with me ! Airship Beta here , airship Beta here . We have entered the combat zone . One minute left . Get ready to fire . - Get ready to fire ! Target in sight ! - Target in sight ! Fire ! Fire ! We must retreat to the space station ! Fire ! Target in sight ! - Target in sight ! Fire ! They shall wander in space for all eternity . What is that ? It must be their satellite . I believe that the Earth will hear again about the Mysterians .

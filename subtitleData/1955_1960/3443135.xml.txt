 The word " lycanthropy " is defined as a human being having the power of becoming a wolf , or of having the power of turning another human into a wolf . Some say lycanthropy stems from nothing but myth and superstition . Yet the belief that a human can turn into a wolf has persisted since the Dark Ages to this very day . It is a universal belief . The ancient Romans and Greeks wrote of the phenomenon . There are tales of such happenings in Borneo , Turkey , South America . Everywhere . The American Navajo Indians and other tribes tell stories about wolf-men . The legends have persisted from the beginnings of man 's memory of time . Why ? Why haven 't these tales died ? The tales that say wolf-men roam the earth . Nothing smaller ? Hey , mister . Your change . You a stranger in Mountaincrest ? You don 't know me ? I 've never seen you before in my life . I guess I 'm just passing through . You guess ? I 'll be right back . Yeah , you 'd better make sure . You didn 't pay for your drinks yet . - Hey , bud . - Yes ? You left Chad 's sudden-like . Could you tell me , do I live in this town ? You didn 't get that crocked on just one drink . How 's about you coming back and buying me a couple ? No , I think there is something I must do . I 'm broke , friend . You got almost twenty bucks. I saw it . How about just handing it over ? Why ? Why should I ? I 'm in a hurry. I don 't like talk . So now we don 't have any more talk , huh ? Just give me the money . Ma Everett ! What in blue blazes you yelling like that ? - lt came out of the alley ! - lt ? What do you mean , it ? Two men were fighting . They were in the alley . Only that thing came out . Let 's take a look . Well , you 're the deputy sheriff , you go first . You girls wait here . Hoxie ! His throat . Hoxie ... Only an animal could do that to a man 's throat . Hank , go get Doc Jonas ! Now , who was it , Ma ? Who went in the alley with Joe ? I don 't know. I never saw him before . Hoxie , you got any guns at your place ? - l got a couple of deer guns . - Well , go get them . - Min , you tell Jack Haines . - But , honey , I 'm scared . Yeah , I know . But I want the sheriff to know . I 'll go with you . Come on . I 'll drop you off on the way , Ma . Hey , look at them tracks . Yeah . Nobody would run across that field unless they were trying to get away . Come on . There . Those are wolf tracks . I seen them in Canada . Oh , there ain 't ever been wolves around here . Do you suppose some animal got the guy ? The snow doesn 't show any signs of a fight . Just his shoe marks . And then ... Then those . I 'll tell you something else . Whatever made those tracks was walking on two legs . Well , I ain 't going any further . This is a job for the sheriff . You think it 's as simple as that , Hoxie ? Just another job for the law ? I don 't know what I think . Mack , you go back with Hoxie . You tell Jack Haines exactly where l am . At the top of Pearson 's land , where it goes up the hill . You ain 't staying here by yourself . Do as I say. I 'm a deputy and I get paid . This is no job for you . Just don 't waste any time and get Jack out here quick . Clovey , there 's no sense ... Look , I 've got a gun . Nobody 's gonna bother me . Now , get going . Go on , get going . That 's an order . I tell you , we should 've never let Clovey stay up there by himself . You heard him . He gave us an order . All right . Stop arguing . It wasn 't your responsibility , either of you . Look , have a drink on me , huh ? Hey , they 're coming ! The sheriff and Clovey . Clovey ! I don 't want you breathing a word about what happened tonight to anyone . Understand ? Nobody . I don 't want this getting around the town before we know what it 's all about . - Sure , Jack . Sure . - Min , Cora ? I 'm scared to even think about it . - l won 't talk . - Me , neither . You see the thing , Clovey ? Get back inside the bar , all of you . Just stay sober enough to keep your mouths closed . - Clovey . You , too ? - He 's been hurt pretty bad , Amy . - Can Doc get on it right away ? - Yes . Come in here . How 's Joe Mitchell ? He was dead when they brought him here . My uncle 's got him in the other room until they can get the undertaker up here in the morning from Larken . I 'll get my uncle . Thanks . Feel like telling me about it ? Well , there 's not much to tell , Jack . The thing didn 't make a sound . All of a sudden , it was clawing and ripping at me . And I yell and you fired that shot and the thing took off . You know , it 's a good thing you came along when you did . Ripping at you with what ? - You 're gonna think I 'm batty . - No . Well , maybe ... Maybe it had hands covered with hair . Or maybe it had paws , like a wolf . Only it wasn 't all wolf . I didn 't get much chance to see . Pity people can 't get themselves killed and chewed up during the daytime . Man my age needs his sleep . Pretty bad lacerations , Clovey . What 's the matter ? Wouldn 't she kiss you ? Wasn 't a kissing mood , Doc . Yeah , men ain 't as good as they used to be . Gonna tell me about it ? I don 't know , Doc. I 'm trying to decide . Gonna make a medical report . One man killed by an animal . Another , darn near . Besides , you want to marry Amy , you 'd better tell me . We 're not sure it was an animal . Clovey , grit your store teeth . Give me a little more , Amy . Grit your store teeth , and grit them good , ' cause this isn 't going to feel good . Ow ! Doc ! Suffering catfish . There . Better hope this takes . I 'm not even sure whether I have to give you the Pasteur treatment for rabies or not . Neither am I . Wrap it up , Amy . Jack , what are you trying to do ? Scare us half to death ? What are you holding back ? It wasn 't an animal that killed Joe . The same goes for Clovey. lt was a man . There were teeth marks of an animal on Joe 's throat . We both examined Joe . Amy 's a good nurse , Jack . She knows what she sees . So do I . She 's right about the teeth marks . Well that 's the trouble , Doc . I think we both are . What are you talking about ? Well , it had to be either animal or man . I wouldn 't lay odds on that , Doc . Man , what you 're trying to say is just a lot of poppycock . Storybook stuff . The things kids get nightmares about . I know , I know . But a witness saw what looked like a man kill Joe , and Clovey here is stone sober . You got answers for it ? I haven 't . There is a word for what you 're saying , Jack . Yeah , I went to school , Amy . Werewolf ? If you think I 'm gonna put that in my medical report ... A murder 's been committed . You can make out your report any way you like , but it was murder . It wasn 't a man accidentally killed by an animal . If this gets in the papers , they 're gonna think we 're all crazy up here . Okay , Doc . Can I go now ? Yes , but don 't use the arm too much . - lf what you 're saying is the truth ... - l will take up the search in the morning . I 'm not letting anyone go looking through those woods at night . I don 't know whether I should take a sedative so I can sleep or drink coffee to stay awake . Well , you can get some sleep , hon . The deputies from Larken will be here in about an hour . They 'll help me police the town and set up roadblocks . Nothing 's getting in or out of town without us knowing . - l 'll check with you in the morning . - Thanks , Amy . Doc . By the way , if you have any books on the subject , you might read up and tell us what we 're looking for . - Good night . - Good night . What a night this is going to be . Dead man in the other room and a werewolf running around loose . You know , Jack 's got me believing that ? Amy , those old books of mine up in the attic ... There 's a couple on mythology . Long as we can 't sleep , they should make some interesting reading . No ! I was dreaming ! I know I was dreaming ! It could only be that some animal came by while I was asleep . Oh , Lord in heaven ! Give us a break , Sheriff. I promised the boss I 'd bring him back a deer . I 'm sorry , men . Nobody 's gonna do any hunting in those woods until I say so . Anyone tries it , I 'll slap the biggest fine on him I can . - But why ? - Never mind why . Just stay inside the town . It 's going to look awfully funny going back without any meat . How do you like that ? The boys are sure raising Cain over not getting their hunting licenses . Yeah , but they 'll get over it . You watch the store . I 'm going down to check the roadblocks . All right . I can 't help it what papers you boys are from . - All I know is the orders we got . - Trouble ? Reporters from the city papers . Reporters ? What do you men want here ? You usually set up roadblocks because a man got killed by some animal ? - How did you men know about that ? - There 's a talkative undertaker in Larken . We saw the body . Come on , Sheriff , let us through . You have no right to hide the news . Besides , that guy charged us seven bucks just to drive up the mountain . - All right . Let them through . - Okay , Jack . - They go through ! - Thanks , Sheriff . Say , do you know anything about what 's happening up in Mountaincrest that we ought to know ? You think there 's a story , you find it . It 's been quiet . Car 1 7 's out having a look along the roads . Well , let me know pronto if they see anything . If he tries to stray off the road dressed the way you say he is , he 'll freeze to death up there . I 'm counting on that . I 'll check with you later . What do you want ? Sorry. I didn 't mean to frighten you . I saw the doctor 's sign at the front of the door . No one answered the ring . My uncle 's probably upstairs . is someone ill ? Could I talk to him , please ? It 's ... - lt 's very important . - Of course . - Follow me in the back way. lt 's shorter . - Thank you . Doc , someone to see you . - This is Mister ... - Dr . Gilchrist . - lf l can talk to you , please . - Come in . Amy always listens . Sometimes she diagnoses better than I do . - l didn 't say I was sick . - No ? She 'd better listen , anyhow . Take a seat , Mister ... I don 't know what my name is . Well , that 's a good beginning . That 's why I had to see you . I can 't remember who I am , or even what I 'm doing in this town . You 're a stranger here ? When did you arrive ? I think last night . Well , let 's try and think back a bit , get a few facts . What 's the last thing you remember ? I 'm not sure . It seems as if there was an automobile accident . Not a bad one . - l was taken to a doctor 's office . - Who was the doctor ? There were two of them . I never saw them before . That 's all . That 's all I can remember . I 've been trying to remember more but there 's nothing . Doctor , I want to know who I am . I want to know what I am . What you are ? Was there a man killed in this town last night ? Yes . How ? The sheriff thinks it was some kind of animal . No . I killed him . Now , now , lad . You 're just a little bit upset . Those tracks I saw in the snow this morning , they had to be mine . They couldn 't have been anything but mine . Doctor , in the name of heaven , what 's happened to me ? Amy , maybe our friend would like a little something to quiet him down . What makes you think you killed somebody ? A man pushed me into an alley last night . Tried to take my money . - l couldn 't let him have it. lt was all I had . - So ? He hit me and ... I thought I was dreaming ... I leaped at him and he fell and then I ... Here . You 'd better take these . They 'll help you ... No ! You 're not giving me anything . - Those other doctors did something to me . - Now , now , now , take it easy , lad . We can 't help you if you won 't let us . - Let 's get a hold of Sheriff Haines . - l saw the police on the road . They had guns . The man in the woods last night , he had a gun . Josie ? Quick , get me the sheriff 's office . Sheriff 's office . Clovey speaking . Oh , hello , Amy . No , no , Jack isn 't around . He should be back in about a half-hour . What ? Look , Amy , are you sure ? Well , after all , for such a thing like that to happen ... All I know is it has happened . Doc Jonas and I will come down and wait . We must talk to Jack . - Well , maybe he thought that Doc would ... - What 's this ? Well , the guy that killed Joe was in the Doc 's office not more than 20 minutes ago . You okay ? He got away . Bolted like a jackrabbit when I mentioned the police . It wasn 't the police he was afraid of , it was your guns . I want you to round up every man you can get . We 're going to search every inch of those woods . - Oh , Jack , listen to me , please ... - Honey , there 's no time . Go ahead . - He 's not a criminal . He 's a sick man . - Man ? It was nothing but a human being that came into our office , Jack . I didn 't get a chance to examine him . He remembers an automobile accident and his brain may have been injured . He can 't even remember his name or where he came from . Jack , help him . Don 't shoot him down . He committed a murder , Amy . What can I do ? If he wants to surrender , okay . - But what if he doesn 't ? - He was afraid of us , too . He said some other doctor had done something to him . - What ? - That , he didn 't say . I 've never seen a man so frightened in my life , Jack . Give him a break , if you can . - lf we could just talk to the other doctor . - lt 's no use . He can 't remember the doctor 's name or even what town he was in . I found Mack outside . He 's going to line up some men for us . Okay . Clovey . - You run up against this guy in the woods ? - Yeah ? Doc and Amy think we should take him alive . Well , that won 't be easy . You 're the boss , Jack . But if it means the necks of any of those men out there , they 're gonna shoot . We 'll do the best we can . Doctors try to save people . The law doesn 't always have a choice . Morgan . You think this is our man ? This paper says they found an animal 's teeth marks on the dead man 's throat . Morgan , what have you done ? Done ? Accomplished is a better word , Emery . Someday , it will happen . The human race will destroy itself . Not quickly but slowly . That wolf-man is the proof . Radiation creates mutants , people who become monsters , no longer human . They 'll make the hydrogen bomb more powerful , then more powerful again , enough to change every person on the face of the earth into a crawling , inhuman thing through fallout radiation . You really believe it will happen in our lifetime ? The science of destruction always gains on us , Emery . It could happen tomorrow , next day , next week. I don 't know . - But it won 't happen to us . - Well , how can you be sure ? I wasn 't until I read that newspaper . The serum we used from that wolf-mutant that died of radiation , that was the answer . By a slow series of inoculations , we can immunize ourselves and a small , select group , just as I planned . When the rest of the world has been destroyed , we will be the only normal , thinking persons left . The perfect science , Emery . The one that ends all science . Perhaps it would 've been better not to know what 's coming . Ridiculous. lt will mean the beginning of a new kind of world . A world that will start without hatred . - And we 'll be the ones to give it birth . - How did we get into this , Morgan ? Two doctors , full of ideals and curiosity . Too much curiosity ? A doctor should be able to cure more than broken bones and runny noses . I want to cure a world . You see , I still have my idealism . You don 't . But to take a stranger , a man , injured in an accident and give him a full inoculation of that serum ... Yes , I 'd almost forgotten about him . So much could fail if he should remember and tell someone what he knows about us . There 's nothing else left but to ... Well , you 're not going to kill him . Do you think he still wants to live after what he 's become ? It 'll be an act of charity . - There 's somebody at the door . - Another patient with a runny nose . I 'll get rid of him and we 'll drive to the town of Mountaincrest immediately . It 's less than 40 miles . If the police haven 't disposed of the man by the time we get there , it may become our task . - Dr . Chambers ? - Yes ? I 'm Mrs. Duncan Marsh . Oh , the man who was injured in the automobile accident . I haven 't heard from him and the police said that you might know where he is . The police ? Well , yes , they said he was injured near here , and they brought him in to you . Well , that 's right , but I wouldn 't worry . It was just a bump on the head . As a matter of fact , I left him in my office for a moment , and when I came back , he was gone . I can only presume he doesn 't think much of doctors . - Was he all right ? - Of course , Mrs. Marsh . Even his car was only slightly damaged . He fell asleep at the wheel , ran into a tree , and hit his head on the steering wheel . I 'm sure you 'll be hearing from him shortly . I hope so . Usually when he travels like this he calls me every day . A most considerate husband . Well , thank you . I feel much better about it now . - Goodbye . - Goodbye . What 'd the doctor say , Mom ? Did he know about Dad ? The doctor said he was fine . Now what do you want to do ? - Go shopping ? A movie , what ? - Would you mind , Mom ? I 'd rather go home . Maybe Dad 'll call up or something . All right , we 'll go home . Come on , scoot . Five hours out here and no sign of anything . Well , I hope the boys at Mile High Ridge are doing better than we are . Hold it , men . Sorry , men . You 'll have to turn back . It 's urgent that we get to Mountaincrest , Officer . We 're doctors and may have information that will help the sheriff . Information ? We believe the man involved in that murder up here was a patient of ours . All right . Check in at the sheriff 's office when you get there . - Wait here a minute , we 'll open up . - Thank you . - You shouldn 't have told him that . - We 'd never have got through otherwise . - Apparently , they haven 't caught Marsh yet . - There 's no time to lose . We 'll check in at one of the lodges and then tell the sheriff that we want to help . What can we do that the deputies can 't do ? We know one thing for sure that they don 't . They 're looking for a man . We 're looking for an animal with an animal 's instincts and habits . I doubt if they 'll ever catch Duncan Marsh in the open . If there 's a hidden spot anywhere in the forest , an animal will find it . Jack , it 's going to be dark in about another hour . Think we ought to turn back ? No , we 'll push on for another half mile or so . I hate to think of that thing loose for another night near the town . Put out the fire , Red . Over there , in that hilly section . Go on , take a look up there . Marsh ! You . You were with him . You were with that other doctor . Please . Help me , please . Don 't move , Marsh . Don 't come a step nearer . There 's nothing we can do for you . You 're going to shoot me ? But why ? What have I ever done to you ? Morgan ! Morgan ! Morgan ! - Who told you to fire that shot ? - That creature up there . - Why did you shoot at me ? - l 'm Sheriff Haines . We had that mine entrance located and we were closing in on it . - You scared the thing away . - Why didn 't you shoot at it yourself ? From this distance and miss the way you did ? Morgan ! - Who 's that ? - Dr . Forrest . - Morgan , Morgan , I saw him , his face . - What did you see ? One moment it was a human being talking to me , and then it changed . His hair and his ears and his teeth . Everything . It would have killed me if it hadn 't been for that shot . Only authorized people of the searching party were supposed to be out here . Let me explain , Sheriff . I 'm Dr. Morgan Chambers . Dr. Emery Forrest and I came to Mountaincrest this afternoon to offer our services . For what ? The man you 're looking for was a patient of ours . A patient ? Jack , it 's going to get dark before we get back . Yeah . We 'll set up sentry posts around the town for tonight . All right . You make an official report at my office . Somebody will be around in a couple of hours with some more coffee . - Just make sure you keep awake . - Yeah , okay . Jack , why do you suppose those two doctors really came here ? They could have phoned you the information . Well , they claim they have a personal interest in our wolf-man . Personal ? They only treated him once . Then they didn 't even know his name . Well , at least we know the car accident took place in Brockville . The report from the police down there should be in soon . What a horrible , horrible thing to happen to a human being . Yeah , I know . - lt happened again . - What this time ? The thing killed a sheep at the Sanderson ranch , then it started to ... lt started to eat it like a starving animal . Laura Sanderson saw it . She 's in the office now , hysterical . I want all the farms in the area evacuated . Call the people . Tell them to get into town as fast as possible . If they haven 't got phones , send trucks out for them . All right . You still think we should treat this thing like a sick man ? I don 't know , Jack. I just don 't know . If you 'd only heard him plea for help the way I did . You , Doc and I had better have a huddle , honey . Why ? I have something in mind that you and Doc won 't like . If you can say anything that 'll make me see it differently , I 'll forget it . You want me to talk you out of it , Jack , and I 'm not so sure I know how . I can only give you the same arguments I gave you before . It 's vicious and cruel . How can you do that to another human being ? Amy , the lives of everyone in this town are dependent on the police right now . Why don 't you try to see it my way ? If this thing killed a sheep because it was hungry , it 'll go for bait in a trap for the same reason . A bear trap could crush its leg , too . Maybe that 'd be better than having to shoot him , Amy . A leg can be healed . And if we can catch him , perhaps a sick mind can be healed , too . If only that thing hadn 't come to your office . How can she defend it that way ? I 've seen you pick up an injured bear cub in the forest and care for it till it was well . - That 's not a strong enough argument . - All right , then , Jack , do what you have to . - Good night , Doc . - Good night . This makes eight traps we 've set . How many more we got to go , Jack ? Just these three . That 'll cover all the areas around the town . Calling Car 22 . Calling Car 22 . Hey , Jack . Your radio . Calling Car 22 . Come in , Jack . Hold it , Clovey . Jack 's coming . Clovey ? Jack , things are popping here . Can you come back ? Right away . Help Fanning finish those last three traps . - Okay . - l 'll send a car back for you . I told you , if there was any news to be had , you 'd get it . You 've been telling us that for some time ... Hey , Sheriff , you gonna give us a story , or are you still making with the sign language ? What happened ? Well , number one , one of our cruisers found a car ditched off the road . Where ? About halfway up the road leading into town . The car is registered to a Duncan Marsh , 1670 Lane Drive , Cedar Corners . Cedar Corners ? That 's about 30 miles from Brockville , where those doctors are from . Number two , a police report came in from Brockville . - Duncan Marsh has a wife and son . - Wife and son ? If this Marsh is a wolf-man , it ain 't gonna be pretty . His wife and kid are on their way up here now . My guess is that Marsh is our guy . His wife filed a missing persons report on him two days ago . How do you explain a thing like this to a wife and kid ? Maybe you don 't try . Did you leave an okay for her to get through the roadblock ? Yeah . I don 't want those newspaper men on her back . I guess the best thing would be if Doc and Amy 'd take her in . I 'll see if I can fix it up . When she gets here , bring her over . All right . Mountaincrest . We almost missed the turn-off . - Mom ? - Yes , Chris ? How would Dad 's car get all the way up here ? Well , he might have been up here on business . Maybe something happened to the motor and he got stuck . - lt 'll be all right . - He didn 't even phone us or anything . You 're a worrier , honey . Emery , that woman 's in town . The wife of Duncan Marsh . The deputies took her to the house of a Dr. Gilchrist . She doesn 't know anything . What could she tell them ? She can 't tell them anything . But her being in town means the deputies might try to take him alive , rather than killing him . Every minute that he 's alive is dangerous to us . Morgan , can 't we turn back ? We 're not murderers . We 're both responsible for what Duncan Marsh has become . When time comes to kill him , you 'll be with me . These are a little out-of-date , Chris . Doc Jonas hasn 't worn these in ... Well , let 's say a long time . Think they 'll fit you ? - l don 't know . - Well , come on , hold up your foot . Yeah , I think they 'll do fine . - You 're being so good to us , Miss Standish . - lt 's nice having guests . - Miss Standish ? - Yes ? Why is everybody being so vague about my husband ? I can 't seem to get straight answers from anyone . I 'm sure if anyone could tell you anything , they would . I 'm not a child , Miss Standish . My husband 's car is here , but he isn 't . I read in the papers about a murder at Mountaincrest . is it possible that the dead man could have been identified wrong ? No . I 'm sure your husband 's alive , Mrs. Marsh . Why are you sure ? I 'm sorry , Chris . You 've been waiting all this time . Here , try on the skates . - Thank you . - l 'll see if the lake is frozen ... - Please , Miss Standish . - Amy , Jack 's in the office . - You 'd better see him . - We 'll talk later . Amy , I just got the word . Marsh was caught in one of the traps . - Was caught ? - He got away . The trap was smashed . - Then he 's hurt . - There were bloodstains in the snow . Would you care to tell that to his wife and son ? Amy , cut it out . Men who 've had wives and kids have gone to the gas chamber . I 'm sorry , Jack . She was just questioning me and ... Well , how much longer can we keep the truth from her ? I 'm afraid not much longer . I couldn 't help hearing . - Where 's Chris ? - He 's still outside . Sheriff , I appreciate your trying to protect me , but if you don 't tell me the truth , I 'll have to find out some other way . Mrs. Marsh , your husband 's ill . He 's killed a man . I don 't believe it . Duncan is the most gentle man who ever lived . Well , something 's happened to him . Just what , we don 't know . - We won 't know until we can examine him . - The papers said something about a man ... You know how the papers are always looking for sensations . We think we can find your husband , Mrs. Marsh . He 's been injured . We may be able to bring him in and help him . Amy , see if you can fix me up a kit . Bandages , antiseptics , whatever 's necessary . You 'll need a doctor with you . You haven 't been able to go through those mountains in winter for 20 years . - l 'll get my things . - Now , wait a minute . I 'm not letting you go out there . It seems to me I 've had better luck with Mr. Marsh than anyone else . If he 's ... If he 's himself , there won 't be any trouble . Sheriff , I know Duncan won 't give you any trouble if Chris and I are with you . - l don 't know what 's right anymore . - l think Mrs. Marsh is , Jack . But what if her husband 's ... Whatever my husband is , Sheriff Haines , I want to help him in every way I can . Well , I 'm taking a portable public address system with me , so I can talk to him from a distance . I don 't want to scare him off again . I 'm hoping that we can talk him into giving himself up . Please , take Chris and me . Amy , see if you can find some more warm clothes . Mrs. Marsh and the boy are going with us . No rifles . We 'll carry pistols under our coats , where he can 't see them . Yeah. I guess most animals are gun-shy after the first shot . - Hello , Sheriff . Starting a new search ? - Leaving in a few minutes . Dr. Forrest and I would like to help , if we may . Thanks , but the less people along this time , the better it might be . Going to try and take your man alive ? - lf it 's possible . - l see . Well , I suppose it 's the most humane thing at that . - Can you stay in town a while longer ? - Why , of course , if you wish . There are some things about this case that are still bothering me . Maybe you can help clear them up . - Well , good luck , Sheriff . - Thanks . Goodbye . I thought he told you all he knew . Well , according to Marsh 's wife , nothing was ever chalked up against Marsh until his car accident . Dr. Chambers treated him . Maybe it means something , maybe it doesn 't . We 'll find out . Wait here . Mom , let me go with them . That track takes off to the east . We 'll circle around and pick up the trail on the other side of that low hill . All right . I don 't want his wife to see this . You know , Jack , when this is over with , I 'm gonna get drunk and stay that way for a whole week . You 're going to have company . Duncan . Duncan Marsh . Duncan Marsh . If you can hear me , show yourself . We want to help you . Duncan Marsh . We know you 've been hurt . We 're here to help you . Duncan , I know you 're hurt . Duncan , I know you 're hurt . Come on down . We 'll keep going . He couldn 't get much further with an injured leg . Jack , thanks for doing it this way . Let 's hope he 's normal when we do find him . If prayers help , he will be . Duncan Marsh . We 're ready to help you . - Show yourself . - Wait a minute . Duncan Marsh . We know you 're up there . Show yourself . No harm will come to you . We want to help you . Nothing . Mr. Haines , maybe if I could talk to him through that , maybe if he could hear my voice ... Duncan . Duncan , darling , this is Helen . Please , listen . Please , try to understand , Duncan . We want you to come home . We want everything to be right again . These men have promised not to harm you . Show us where you are , Duncan . Please , darling . Chris is here with me . He wants you to come home , too . We know you 're hurt , darling . But there 's a nurse here who 's going to help you . Chris ? Chris ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! For the love of Mike , what 's the big idea ? What 's the deal , coming way out here and not telling us ? Chris . You didn 't even call us . We just waited . I 'm sorry , Helen , I 'm sorry . Dad , this is the sheriff . He and Amy are gonna fix your leg . Everything 's gonna be okay . Helen , Chris , go away , please . Don 't stay here . Please make them leave . - Any minute something could happen . - Dad , I want to be with you ! Mrs. Marsh , your husband needs plasma and I can 't administer it while he 's upset . You 'd better take Chris and wait below . Chris , go with your mother . It was the traps that got him , I tell you . There 's an art in setting them . You know that . Place them just right and then kind of figure if the wind 'll take the smell of your bait the way you want it . Yes , sir . Me and the sheriff and Fanning are real handy with a bear trap . We caught that wolf-man right in the ankle , so he can 't run much anymore , can he ? Shut up , Durgis , you talk too much . Well , I was just ... All right , all right , if that 's the way you feel ... Excuse me , fellows , I 'll go home . You feel lousy about it , don 't you ? I was just over to the jail a little while ago . Jack wanted me to make a statement . Marsh 's wife and kid are there . Funny . You think maybe you 've got all the troubles in the world , till something like this happens to somebody else . I think I need a straight shot . I 've never seen anything like it . Everybody 's going crazy . - All of them scared . - Scared ? Of what ? They 're celebrating . The wolf-man 's captured . I think I know what they 're scared of . They 're scared of what Marsh has become because it could happen to them . It could happen to anyone . You see , now they know it 's possible . Make that a double shot . How long do we have to wait like this ? Patience , Emery . Just a little more patience . How long do you think he 'll stay the way he is ? Oh , even he doesn 't know that . You saw the way he broke the bear trap . What makes you think he couldn 't break out of the cell the same way ? Look , I got enough troubles of my own with this report . Duncan , isn 't there anything I can say that will change your mind ? You think it 's easy for me to send you and Chris away ? When I 'm better , I 'll come home . Please , darling , do as I say . If it should come back while you 're still here , that 's the way you 'll always remember me . It would never be any good , even if I did come home . Please , leave now while I 'm still all right . Dad , I don 't want to go ! Please , Chris , don 't make it so tough for me . Come back soon , darling . We 'll be waiting for you . Come on , son , we have to leave . Come on . I 'll send someone all the way home with you . - The roads are pretty bad at night . - Thank you . We 'll find out how Marsh got that way . We 'll find out and we 'll find a way to cure him . Go on , now . I 'm going over to Doc 's . No matter what , don 't leave this place alone for a minute tonight . You two can spell each other . I 'll check back later . You 'd better grab some sleep before you fall flat on your face . I 'll take the first shift if you want . You know , I 'm beginning to forget what sleep was like myself . You know what ? If anything happens in there , get a hold of us quick . There 's an art in setting them . Oh , yes , there is . All you ... What 's the matter ? What 's the matter ? Ain 't nobody else wanna hear how we caught the wolf-man ? - Why don 't you get lost ? - Get lost ? Nobody wants to hear about it . We caught him . Yeah , we caught him , all right . Right in the ankle . You see , Emery , patience is its own reward . Go to the sheriff 's office and find out what precautions are being taken to guard Marsh tonight . - You 're not going to do anything in the jail ? - Please , Emery , do as I ask . Well , she and the boy are gone . Gibbs is a good man . - He 'll drive them home , all right . - We were talking , Jack . Up until now , what 's happened to Duncan Marsh is beyond all our known laws of science and medicine . You know , this thing didn 't come on him suddenly , of his own volition . You 're trying to say somebody did it to him ? Yes . Well , if it 's beyond anything men know , how could somebody do it ? It 's a frightening thought that a single human being , out of all the millions and millions , could somehow have obtained that kind of knowledge . We want to send samples of his blood to a laboratory for tests . Well , that 's up to Marsh . But he 'll do anything if it will help him . We don 't feel it much up here in a place like Mountaincrest , but the world 's a place of change . Recently , for the first time in history , men were able to manufacture diamonds , real diamonds . For the first time , men are making new valves for the heart and machines that can take all of a man 's blood out of his body and then put it back again , while he 's still breathing . Every day , science and medicine start up new roads . And you think Duncan Marsh is one of these new roads . The thing is , the man who did it to Marsh , what did he have in mind ? And what kind of a future is he dreaming up for everybody else ? You two are giving me the creeps . Doc , right now I 'm too tired to look up any of those new roads of yours . Then why don 't you sleep on the couch tonight , honey , instead of going all the way home ? With all you 've given me to think about I 'm not sure I could sleep anywhere . Try it . You are going to talk to Duncan about those blood tests in the morning ? Sure . - Providing . - Providing ? Hey , you 're a welcome sight . Well , you 're not . My bed looked much better . No change in Marsh . He 's out cold . The guy 's exhausted . I hope he stays that way till the ambulance picks him up in the morning . Yeah . - l 'll see you in a few hours . - Right . He 's going to be fine for us , Emery . Get my bag and hurry . Meet me near the jail . Hello there . - Who 're you ? - Do you know me ? Mister , do you think if I could see , I 'd be standing here ? - l 'll give you a hand . - l gotta go the other way . Oh , wait a minute . Aren 't you the one who almost caught the wolf-man in a bear trap ? I got him right in the ankle . That 's me. I 'm the guy . And do you know something else ? He broke that trap wide open . What do you think of that ? Yeah , I hear they 've got the pieces down at the sheriff 's office . - Could you show them to me ? - Certainly . The sheriff 's a pal of mine . Come on . Whack to the ear . Go out and get my bag . See what condition he 's in . He 's asleep . Marsh . Quiet , Marsh ! Quiet ! - lt 's a scream , I tell you ! - Out to the jail ! My God . Snap out of it , man . That thing is loose in the village . - Fanning , round up all the men you can get . - Did he break loose ? Yeah . We 'll need torches . Animals are afraid of fire . Maybe we can scare it away from the village . Jack , I 'm in a fog . What gives ? Marsh has killed Chambers and Forrest . We can 't take him alive this time , Amy . He 's killed two more men . You can take a look at them , Doc , but I don 't think it 'll do much good . Come on . Hold it a minute . - He came this way . - Well , it 'll be light in a little while . - Then we 'll get him . - Yeah . Wait a minute , Jack . I can see something . Throw some torches up there . Hold your fire ! We 're going up there after him ? No , I don 't think he 'll turn back now . He 's scared . I don 't want to take a chance on any of these men getting hurt . We 'll wait till it 's light . Let 's go back . There he is . He 's headed for the highway above the bridge . Let 's try to cut him off . Hey ! Block the bridge . Pull the scraper across the bridge . Don 't shoot . You 'll hit the driver . Shoot in front of him . Try to stop him . Get to the other end of the bridge ! All right . Get him . You see that ? He changed back again . - Do you think he 'll stay that way this time ? - Yeah , he 'll stay . Now he can go home .

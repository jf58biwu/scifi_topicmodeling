 Look here ! Look what 's here ! Hey , boys ! Come and see what 's here . Come on , quick , all of you ! - It 's a skull , all right . - It 's all bashed in . You reckon he 's been murdered or something ? No , it 's all ... you know , fossilised . Like stone . It must 've come up with me last lot . Must 've been down there a long time , maybe hundreds of years . - Hundreds ? - What are we gonna do with it ? - Here 's the gaffer . - What 's going on ? What 's the stoppage ? - He 's found a skull . - Careful ! It 's real old , innit ? Looks it . Reckon we ought to report it to a museum or something ? That 's right . Like them Roman remains . I don 't know . There 'll be trouble if the work 's held up . This could mean something good for all of us . - That 's right . - Let 's get on with it . Jack , you stay here and see that nobody messes it about . - What do you make of it ? - I don 't know . I don 't like this place . I haven 't done from the start . Ah ! Here 's another bit . Odd idea , this , calling a press conference ! - What 's odd about it ? - I run from one to another . - You 're the popular press ? - " Evening Gazette . " And you ? - " The Palaeontologist . " - " Pal ... " ? Not heard of it . It 's a foremost scientific journal . The man you 're going to interview is a palaeontologist . Oh , this Roney . He 's Canadian , isn 't he ? - Possibly . - He used to be on TV a lot , in that programme . He 's a foremost figure in his field . Gentlemen , will you be seated , please ? May I introduce Dr Matthew Roney ? Thank you . Gentlemen ... And ladies , too . I 'm relieved to see you . The idea of calling this press conference hasn 't entirely met with official approval , has it ? - Oh , really , Dr Roney ... - To be blunt , I 'm counting on YOUR help . And through you , that of the public . Now , I 'm in charge of the archaeological work at Hobbs Lane in Knightsbridge . We 've been there now a week and ... I 'm worried . We need time to do our work properly and I 'm afraid we 're not going to get it . The owners of the site want to get on with their building and they 're pressing us to get out . - That was confidential . - Oh . All right , please keep it off the record that they 're trying to kick us out . But if they do ... they may wreck one of the most remarkable finds ever made . Now , I 've made statements that these fossils are important . I 'll go further than that . I believe they are of unparalleled importance . They may teach us more about our remote ancestors than we 've ever known . I believe they 're of vast age . I believe they will show that creatures essentially resembling mankind walked upon this Earth between three and five million years ago . Dr Roney , isn 't that far further back than has been supposed ? Several times as far . Up to now the figure has been put at half a million years . - Can you prove it , sir ? - No . Not until I 've got every scrap of evidence out of that excavation to make full tests . I 'm giving you my personal conviction based on what I 've found . What have you found ? Parts of two skulls , fragments of upper and lower limbs . - Can you tell us what they looked like ? - Not at this stage . Yes , I think I can . It 's just another guess , of course . Miss Judd ! Here we are . Over here . Gentlemen , this is my chief assistant Barbara Judd . She 's attempted a reconstruction . Now , these modelled portions are what we 've found so far . That is , if they 're filled out with flesh . He wasn 't very tall . He had the face of an ape , but he had a big brain . And he stood like a man . I must say , Roney , I 'm glad I 'm not in your shoes . You know , a lot of people may think it 's a trifle improper to publicise wild guesses . Particularly if they turn out to be bad guesses . - Your brandy , sir . - Thank you . Water ? Poor old Roney . The press boys certainly gave you the treatment . I know what they 're like . No , they didn 't . I said it all on free will . What possessed you ? I want the man on the street on my side . Look , if I can 't catch his imagination , there 'll be a block of offices slapped on that site , bones an ' all ! Your health , Armitage . You know , uh , you 're really the reason I came to the club today . - Oh . So I 'm being bearded , eh ? - That 's it . Your excellent journals haven 't shown much interest so far . - Weekly magazines work a good way ahead ... - That 's when I may need your support most . In about a month . I 'll give your photographers special facilities . Another large brandy ... Really I must go now . I really have to go . I never interfere with my editors , but I 'll get them to ring you . Bye , now . Goodbye . - Good luck . - Here we are , sir . No , I don 't ... Yes , I do ! - Quatermass ! - Roney , how are you ? Well , fit enough . Tired , eh ? Harassed by publicity ? Harassed by not getting enough ! You know , till a week ago , I was a retiring sort of creature . Now I 'm like a press agent . Sometimes you have to get public support . I have to now . Ah ! I 've said far too much , too soon . If I 'm wrong ... If you 're wrong , it won 't matter , will it ? No . I 'll just retire . They 'll stick me right alongside the Piltdown Forgery as a horrid warning ! Well , Quatermass , it 's been years now . Are you still buried out at your rocket research place ? - Hmm . Shall we lunch ? - I doubt if I 've got time . Oh , Arthur , could we have a few plain sandwiches ? - Yes , Professor . - I almost forgot you were a member here . I 'm just up for a conference at the War Office . The War Office ? I thought you were strictly , well , a civilian outfit . Well , we were . Good heavens ! They 've taken you over . Well , if I say so , I 'll be infringing the Official Secrets Act . But it seems we have to move with the times . I 'm sorry , Quatermass . - There you are , sir . - Thank you , Arthur . Oh , cheese . Have one ? Tell me . How much time do you need with this excavation of yours ? It depends what we find . You can 't rush these things . Some of those fossil fragments are so fragile ... - Come and see for yourself . - I wish I could . - When your conference finishes . - I doubt if I 'd be very good company . - I 'll give you a lift in my taxi . - Professor Quatermass ! Do you know , Roney , for all your troubles , you 've got one thing to be thankful for . There 's no military value in fossil apes . Now , you 're going to watch the digging party . What do you think about the missing link ? Missing link ? I dunno . It 's all right if they want it . - And what do you think ? - I like it . You like it ? The missing link ? Yeah . And you , madam . Do you think it 's right that the building work should be held up on this site ? Until they get them monkeys ' bones up , yes , I do . They ought to be let . Thank you . And you , sir , what is your opinion ? Well ... Ah ! I think I 've just caught sight of someone whose opinion really is worth something . Dr Matthew Roney , who 's the scientist in charge here . - Dr Roney , would you grant me an interview ? - Just a moment . Thanks for the lift . Looks like I asked for it ! - Now , what are the latest developments ? - We 're on the brink of a startling discovery . Whitehall , War Office . - Hello . - Hello . Well , Professor Quatermass ! We enter the last round . Isn 't that what you wanted to say ? Nothing so pugnacious as that . Just that it 'll soon be over and you can enjoy a rest . We all can . Will you take your seats , gentlemen ? The Minister won 't be a moment . Final session . I 'm sure you all feel as I do . It won 't take us long to agree our conclusions . I 've asked Harrison to prepare a rough draft . But surely , sir , we 've come to no agreement so far . But I should 've thought we had , a very substantial measure . About the Rocket Group , its finances , administration ... - But not policy . - We 're not here to formulate policy . - That 's for a higher level . - We must express our views . We are men , not mechanical computers . Professor Quatermass , isn 't your concern unduly personal ? I think we all realise how much is owed to your formative influence . I brought the Rocket Group into being . But it is a government project . It always has been . It was intended for peaceful scientific research , not to be perverted to fulfil such a monstrous conception as this ... well , this Dead Man 's Deterrent ! I thought I 'd made it clear from the outset . The decision has been taken . We are here merely to find the means of carrying it out . I must say I agree with Quatermass . The commission that founded the Rocket Group ... This is a change of policy . Since there is some confusion , I 'll ask Colonel Breen to restate it . - I didn 't mean ... - For information only . Briefly , please . And finally . The setting up of permanent bases on the moon and possibly Mars also is a certainty within five to seven years . Those bases will be military ones . The present state of world politics leaves no doubt about it . - So there 's a race on ? - As usual , there is a race on . Whoever plants those bases can police the Earth . Ballistic missiles will be stored there . Slave missiles designed to react automatically to , erm ... well , to activity on Earth . Even if an aggressor nation should totally wipe out a neighbour in a nuclear attack , they would themselves be obliterated by missiles from space . That is the concept of the Dead Man 's Deterrent . Do you really believe that missiles could be so accurate ? - They could locate the Earth . - And destroy everything on it . - We should not have been the aggressors . - No , no . But you send all of humanity up in smoke to avenge ourselves ! I take it greater accuracy in these missiles would be a constant object ? - Of course , sir . - The absolutely ultimate weapon . A Sword of Damocles would hang over the head of any aggressor ready to fall . - We might call it Operation Damocles . - Yes , yes , good idea . Stop this ! " Ultimate weapon " ! Can you really pretend to believe in such a thing ? There never has been one and never will be ! All this means is that from the very start we 'll be going into space with one thought - war ! We 're on the verge of a new dimension of discovery . It 's the great chance to leave our vices behind us , war , first of all . Not to go out there dragging our hatreds and our frontiers with us . Gentlemen , we ... We must not lightly agree to this plan . We have a right to express our opinions , to advise against it . I implore you ! I 'm a little surprised . Is that all ? And disturbed to hear such naive views still put forward . Naive ? They compel me to ask have you a conscientious objection to remaining as the head of Rocket Group ? Do you want me to resign ? Well , I shan 't . I shall stay there in control as long as I can , use what influence I can to try to prevent ... Of course , I shall be glad of your co-operation until such time as , er ... Meanwhile , a new Deputy Controller under you will join the Rocket Group - Colonel Breen . Breen ? - You knew . - I told him this morning . He 's being seconded from army duties . - I see . - I think you 'll agree on his fitness for the post . Unrivalled experience with military rockets , ballistic missiles . Any comment ? For the present , none . Now , let 's consider this draft . In Vienna , the conference on nuclear disarmament remains deadlocked by failure to agree an agenda . Terrorist activity in Nigeria has been responsible for 87 more deaths during the past month . Police report that Birmingham was peaceful last night after almost a week of racial disturbances . More fossil bones were found today at Knightsbridge . Dr Matthew Roney has confirmed that they , too , belonged to the species he has described as " the earliest known true hominid " . That is the end of this news flash . That 's drying nicely . That is a shoulder blade . - Looks better than the others . - It 's bigger , anyway . Got it ? You know , I think there were four bodies . - Four ? - At least . Well , you carry on , Barbara . Look out for scattered vertebrae . Miss Dobson , are you all right ? It 's just my head . Oh , it 's so close down here . Clammy rather . Don 't you notice it ? Oh ! Perhaps you ought to call it a day . Nonsense . Just a touch of migraine . Oh ! It 's gone now . Oh , look at them all gaping up there ! I 'm making an exhibition of myself . Miss Judd ! Miss Judd , I think I 've got something . Possibly right scapula . Part of clavicle may also be present . Go carefully . - Get that to the museum right away . - Yes , sir . Another find ! - Dr Roney ... - Something good ? No , er , come and see . Dr Roney , I 'm afraid it 's only a pipe . - Pipe ? - Yes . Water , I think . Might be a trunk sewer . What a good thing I wasn 't using a pickaxe ! - They 'd have had a good laugh . - Now they think we 've found something . Smooth . Give me that trowel , please . Very smooth . It curves downwards . - I don 't think it is a pipe . - Then what would you suggest ? - An unexploded bomb . - What ? Goodness ! Yes ... Yes , it does look like one . Why did you say that ? We can 't afford to lose any time . - It ought to be reported , Dr Roney . - Very well . Barbara , get in touch with ... Who 'd it be ? The police ? I think so . We could go on working on the other side . Hello , is that the police ? I want to report what may be an unexploded bomb . - Captain Potter , Inspector . - We 've been expecting you . - Where is this thing ? - Just down here . - Unload that gear , Sergeant . - Very good , sir . Is somebody still living in that house ? - I don 't know , sir . - Carry on . I 'll see to it . Right ! Hold it a minute ! - What type do you think it is , sir ? - Well , it could be a Satan . - Well , it could be , sir , except ... - Except what ? Well , I 've never seen a Satan with bumps . Hmm . Hmm , there 's no ticking . An odd thing , that . The mike didn 't stick . - Well , it can 't be steel . - What do you think it is , then , sir ? I don 't know . If it fell during the war , the surface ought to be corroded . There 's no corrosion . All the Jerry stuff I 've seen was pretty well ... I don 't think it 's any kind of metal . Captain Potter , how long is this going to take ? - Sir , I advised you to leave . - I 'm in charge . - Not now . Carry on spraying , Sergeant . - Very good , sir . - You understand my work ? - I 've read the papers . I have to complete it quickly . This wrecks all my arrangements . If it blows up , it 'll wreck more than your arrangements ! - You really think it might ? - Our job is to prevent it . That might take days . - How long do we go on for , Sarge ? - Till I tell you to stop . Till he says " stop " ! Hey , Westie , how much do you know about Jerry planes ? - They 're all Yanks . - In the war ! When they were still making their own . Wasn 't any could have carried a thing this big ! - It 's bigger than a ten-tonner , sir . - Well , it 's not a buzz-bomb . Dr Roney , in your digging did you find any sign of a hole this might have made when it came down ? No . Most of the work was done by grabs . You could ask the building contractors . - Five minutes ' break , Sergeant . - Yes , sir . Five minutes ' break , boys ! - You 'll call them now ? - That 's my business , sir . Captain Potter , you 're a young man . You couldn 't have had the wartime experience ... - I should call in a second opinion ? - If you don 't know what it is . I 'm finding out ! It 's deliberate . I 've annoyed him and now he 's gonna work to rule . - I 'm sure that ... - They 're making tea ! He 'll probably turn that hut into the officers ' mess ! Barbara , you stay here as long as they let you and keep an eye on things . - Yes , but where are you going ? - To get a second opinion . I think that concludes our business for the present , gentlemen . Thank you for your help . You will receive draft reports in the course of the next two days . - Breen , congratulations on the appointment . - Thank you , General . And about time ! So , we 're colleagues . I 'm sure we shall get on very well together . - When do you start ? - As of now , I understand . - No , I haven 't got an appointment ! - I can 't admit you without permission ! No further , sir ! Professor Quatermass , there 's a gentleman here to see you . - Roney ! - I 've had enough of these petty bureaucrats ! - Quatermass , I had to catch you . - What 's happened ? A bomb turned up at the site . There are soldiers there now . - What can I do ? - You can hurry them up . You know these people . Look where we are ! My dear Roney , if I had any influence with the army , I ... Wait a second . Breen ! - Yes ? - Breen , this is Dr Matthew Roney . You 've heard of his prehistoric finds at Knightsbridge ? - Oh , yes . - How are you ? Roney 's having a little difficulty with a bomb-disposal squad . Could you help ? - Interfere ? - They need expert advice . - Who says so ? - It 's a fact . I 've had no official request . It would be highly irregular . - Suppose you had a request from me ? - From you ? Yes , a friendly one . After all , we are colleagues now . I 'll come with you . I can 't promise any more . Good man . I 'm sure we 'll get on very well together . Mrs Chilcot , you can 't come in here till they 've finished . Just to get some more clothes . The place we 're in , he feels the cold . Won 't take a moment . - I don 't know . - There 's nothing going on down there just now . All right , then . Quick as you can . Having to beg to get in me own home ! Builders have been trying to get rid of ' em for months . Hey , look out ! - You know me , Officer . - Who are the others ? We 're here to have a look at that bomb . Charlie , the old codgers , get ' em out , stir ' em out ! - Still at it ? - Yes . Had any luck ? This is my chief assistant Miss Judd . Professor Quatermass . How do you do ? - I 'm in charge here , sir . Can I help you ? - That 's the question I was going to ask . This is Colonel Breen of the Guided Missile Group . And Professor Quatermass . - What have you got there ? - I don 't know yet , sir . - Have you informed your superiors ? - No , not yet , sir . Mind if we take a look ? Kill the jet . Break for five minutes . A bomb ? No sign of an ingress cavity , sir . I checked with the firm who did the excavating . The hole could 've collapsed , closed up . Hmm . The famous excavation . Yes . We 're probably standing on priceless fossils at this moment . Mm-hm . About here they dug out the first skull . Oh . A trifle muddy . Blast ! Thanks . Something he said ... Roney ! Roney , where did you say the skull was found ? Where exactly ? Well , in the earth that 's been dug away , two or three feet above this level . That 's right ? Yes . It was here . - You said " above " ? - Why , what 's wrong ? Well ... if it was above this thing ... Roney ... tell me again . How long did you estimate that skull had been there ? Something like five million years . Five million years ?

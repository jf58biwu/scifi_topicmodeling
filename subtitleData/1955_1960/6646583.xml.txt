 NARRATOR : First in Alaska and then Invading steadily southward , there Were reports of a new species . The giant killer shrew . [ THUNDER ] Sure is a lot of quiet out there . Almost smell it , can 't you ? No , I but I can feel it . That pressure 's dropped so fast it 's almost made my ears pop . Hurricanes got definite ways of telling you it 's there . Where is it ? Dead ahead . What 's that mean to us ? Now boy , that puts our port right in the middle of it . There 's a cove on the east side though . We 'll snuggle up close to the bluff and ride it out . What about the bottom ? Well , the chart shows it 's good holding ground . It 's clay . You know something ? If this thing had an automatic pilot , I wouldn 't have to put up with you . Then you wouldn 't have nobody to chew out . We should be there in a couple of hours . These mills of yours keep running . Look , automatic pilots can 't play dixieland jazz On their [ INAUDIBLE ] like I can . Hey , Rook . Rook , come here . Take a look . There she is , dead ahead . Man , that sure do look good . Man named Craigis owns this island , does he ? That 's the name on the crate , Dr. Marlowe Craigis . We 'll unload tomorrow . I don 't want this crap sitting high in that water When that blow hits . You going to ride [ INAUDIBLE ] with a lot of water under ? That 's right . That sea won 't make up in that cove . That wind will have her whipping around like a kite . Step forward and break out the heavy weather hook . Check it and make sure it 's free to run . - I don 't mind , sir . - Good . Ah , she 'll ride like a duck . If she swings too far to starboard We might have to take a check line to shore . Hey Rook , take a slant up that trail . Now that 's a rather strange set up , wouldn 't you say ? Looks like somebody 's getting rid of somebody , huh captain ? Maybe . Hard to tell . I 'm Dr. Craigis . Thorne Sherman . I have your supplies aboard . That 's good . Nothing wrong with Captain [ INAUDIBLE ] , I hope ? I wouldn 't know . I just bought his run . Oh , I see . Well , [ INAUDIBLE ] order ? Everything on the list . Here 's the manifest . Missing last week 's supply has run us a little short , You know . Captain , after you have unloaded , I have a passenger for you . Ann . Captain Sherman , this is my daughter , Ann Craigis . Hello . So you 're the passenger . That 's right , Captain . Well , it 's going to be nice having you aboard . I 'm getting a little tired of looking at Griswold . But we 're , uh , we 're not leaving today . In fact , we 're not even unloading . That load will cut the roll in half . You expecting an invasion ? Yes , animals . Game or otherwise ? Under certain conditions it could be dangerous . Hey Rook , you want to shake the kinks out , limber up a little ? Not me , Captain . You go right ahead and stretch your legs . That ship 's going to be bucking like a bucking bronco Before long . Besides , I got some work left to do . If you do come ashore , wear a gun . Got you , Captain . When I told you about the hurricane , You acted like you didn 't know anything about it . What 's the matter ? Your set broken down ? We have been out of communication for more than a Week , Captain . Can 't it be fixed ? It 's totally out of commission . My assistant , Mr. Farrell , Jerry Farrell . Father , perhaps the captain would enjoy a drink . Well of course . Will you join us for a cocktail ? Well , I 've never been known to turn down a drink yet . I 'd be glad to accept . Fine . In that case we 'll have martinis . Mario . Si , senor ? Mix them , please . Right this way , Captain . Come in . You have everything here you need ? We are self sufficient here . We have cows for fresh milk and chickens for fresh eggs . We even have [ INAUDIBLE ] horses . Sort of a world all your own . That 's exactly what I 've tried to create . Well , to each his own . If you have to be isolated for your work , You picked a lonely little island . Excuse me , please , I think I 'll change . She 's a little worried because you Aren 't leaving until tomorrow . Well , I can understand that . But there 's something else bothering her . Radford . Radford . Radford , would you please step over here ? I 'd like you to meet someone . Just a second , Doctor . That could go on for hours . Dr. Baines . There 's no need to shout , Doctor , I 'm right here . I 'd like you to meet Captain Thorne Sherman . This is my other assistant , Radford Baines . How do you do ? Two new litters since lunch , Doctor . Both support GT116 . That 's good , but , uh ... We can breed them to the 205 group in about three weeks . But I 'd prefer to wait and expose about half of them To the Hoskins factor first . If you agree . Good idea . Do you know there 's a hurricane coming ? Hurricane ? Well , I don 't suppose there 's much we can do about that . Glad to meet you . Sherman , was it ? You have to excuse Radford . Anything that does not concern his Project cannot get through to him . Brilliant mind . He would starve to death if someone Didn 't remind him to eat . Must be very interesting work . What 's his field ? Biology . He specializes in genetics , heredity . I 'm afraid my interest doesn 't run in that line , you know . Think what would happen if you could isolate and identify The inherited [ INAUDIBLE ] in each gene . Now wait a minute . I 'm afraid I 'm not very good with pure research . This is practical research . [ INAUDIBLE ] mammals , the smaller the size , the higher The metabolism and shorter the life span . Yeah , right . Well , I 'm attempting to decrease the size By maintaining a low metabolism and result In a longer lifespan . What reason ? Overpopulation . Not a problem now , but it will be in time . If we were half as big as we are now , We could live twice as long in our natural resources . Father , may I speak with you a moment ? Will you please excuse us , Captain ? Well , providing you drop the captain . I prefer Thorne . Tell me something , Doctor . Has a hurricane ever hit this island before that you know of ? I wouldn 't know . We 've only been here nine months and this place Has been unoccupied for years . Well have you ever been through one ? Only the fringes . Well , this one 's building up very fast . Pressure drops very quickly in the center . I 'd advise you to get some doors and windows open in this place . Ventillators in the roof . And if you 'll freshen Ann 's drink I 'll go and check them . I 'd be happy too . Thank heavens you arrived today . Why , are rations getting short ? No , it 's more than that . Much more . We 'll surely be able to sail tomorrow , won 't we ? Possibly . But not probable . Not until late , anyway . Takes a long time for a sea like that to quiet down . Well if you 're worrying about me , you needn 't . I 'm a good sailor . Oh , I 'm not worried about you . We 'll sail when the time 's right . Got them opened all right . Oh , Captain , let me freshen you a drink . One for the road . Not trying to rush you , but it will be dark soon . I 've invited Thorne for dinner , father . Oh ? I see . If you 're not worried about your ship , you are welcome . I 'll take a rain check on that dinner . If you wish . Father . I 've asked Thorne to stay . Progress , Doctor . This is the sole survivor of group 30 . 28 months old today . Well that 's equivalent to 140 years to us . That 's right . Yet it still maintains low metabolism Without any sluggishness . It 's not a breakthrough , but it certainly sets our course . Radford , suspend series 52 through 96 And we 'll concentrate on the rest . What is that ? It 's a sorex soricidae . Looks like a small rat . Smells like a skunk . They have musk glands [ INAUDIBLE ] . These little fellas are our subjects . They have a birth cycle of 10 to 14 days and using them We can establish traits . We can trace the progressions through a number Of generations over a short period of time . Well how big do they get ? That 's an adult . See , the muzzle is long and thicker than a rat 's . It extends over the lower mandible , see ? Does he bite ? Only when he is hungry . Well , maybe you 'd better take him . He doesn 't know me . All he knows is his next meal . He 's just been fed . He 'll be all right for another eight hours . [ CRASHING ] [ SCREAMS ] A shutter blew open . Radford . I got it , senor . Don 't let that scare you . It 's going to get worse . Storms always frighten her , ever since she was a child . They are not climbers . They are digging animals , like the mole . They feed only at night unless they are starving . And when they are hungry enough , they 'll Tackle anything regardless of size . No kidding . If you leave two of them in a cage for 12 hours without food , The stronger will eat the weaker . Like cannibals . Precisely . You see , their intense activity requires A tremendous amount of energy . To supply , they must eat three times their own weight in food Every 24 hours or starve . Radford . Radford , would you please take this ? Take him . Some call them bone eaters . When the flesh is gone , they 'll eat the bones for marrow . All they leave are teeth , horns , hooves ... I could use another martini . Do you mind ? Of course , my dear . I 'll get you one . There you are . Mario ? Mario . [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] Mario will show you to the bath And you will freshen up a bit . [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] Excuse me . [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] You got a problem too ? Que paso ? [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] But you will leave on the ship tomorrow . Well , I think that all depends on the wind and the sea , Don 't you ? Si . Si senor . I don 't know . Ah , [ INAUDIBLE ] . I feel the point . I see . Well , I 'm glad to hear that . Now if anybody else is concerned about my sailing Tomorrow , why , you see they feel the point too , huh ? I don 't like to repeat myself . OK , senor . I know , but I 'm not saying that you created them , Jerry . I am saying that because of your drunken stupidity In leaving the cage door open , you Created the horrible situation that now exists . Look , Ann , this is a mistake any one of us might have made . And I 'm getting a little sick of being called An irresponsible drunk , now believe me I am . Excuse me . Care for a cigarette ? Thanks . And thank heavens you arrived today . You said that before . What 's the strain ? If I don 't make sense , please excuse me . But it seems like everything is coming to a head at once . Oh ? I want to leave , but I want my father to go with me . Well then , why doesn 't he ? We 've discussed it many times , but he 's adamant . I 'm sure Jerry has a lot to do with his decision . He tried to convince me that the crisis Will only last for a few ... Well . This is certainly a cozy little scene . Might even be called intimate . Boy meets girl ... Stop it , Jerry . That remark is uncalled for . What I do or have to say does not concern you . I can 't disagree with you more , my dear . I 'm concerned with everything you do And I intend to keep it that way . Now on my book an engagement isn 't a casual thing . In my book it isn 't either . And last night ended ours . [ SHREWS CHATTERING ] [ GUNSHOTS ] [ THUNDER ] [ THUNDER ] [ SHREWS CHATTERING ] Help ! Help ! Captain Thorne ! Somebody help ! Help , Captain Thorne ! [ THUNDER ] Be reasonable . Everybody in the world is scared to death of something . That 's evident . When they came at us last night you Knocked me down getting inside the fence . It 's just that I can 't stand them . And I 've discovered something I can 't stand . All right . But I advise you not to mention it to anyone . I 'm going to complete these experiments with your father Regardless of anything , do you understand that ? Nobody is going to take this chance away from me . Where 's Captain Sherman ? Checking the weather . I 'll get him . Captain ? Time for dinner . [ SHREWS CHATTERING ] Help ! Somebody ! Help ! Help me ! No ! Somebody ! Help ! [ GUNSHOTS ] Help ! Somebody help me ! Help me ! [ SCREAMS ] [ SCREAMING ] [ THUNDER ] Well , a miss as good as a mile , I always say . And if one of those trees crashes through It might just knock the whole ... Look , any tree on this side of the house Will fall away from us , so just relax . But I think I 'd better go back aboard . Don 't think I 'm not grateful for your hospitality . I am . I 'll see you tomorrow . Thorne . Your ship is safe . Please , stay here with me . Why ? You scared or lonesome ? Both . I 'll take a rain check on it . Thorne . You can 't leave . No one opens that gate after dark . Well , who 's going to stop me ? You ? With this . No one opens that gate at night . [ SHREWS CHATTERING ] Look , I don 't ask questions because it 's Against my principles . But wouldn 't you like to explain that ? All right . Sit down and I will . Give me the gun . Not very becoming , anyway . Do you believe in fairy tales ? Well , I 'm a little old for that sort of thing , But what did you have in mind ? Well I 'll tell you about one . A true fairy tale , and you 're right in the middle of it . Oh ? Have you ever heard of a shrew ? As in " Taming of the " ... No , the animal . Radford called them sorex soricidae When he showed you one . Well , then shrew must be the common name For those cute little animals . Cute ? That 's the last word you can use to describe Those little monsters . They 're the most horrible animals On the face of the earth . As father told you , they breed within three weeks after birth . Their lifespan is one year . Yeah , I know what your father told me . But what 's that got to do with me opening that gate ? There are 200 or 300 giant shrews out there . Monsters weighing between 50 and 100 pounds . 50 to 100 ... wait a minute . You must be kidding . I 'm definitely not kidding . That 's as big as a full grown wolf . And what 's more , they are beginning to starve . No wonder you didn 't want me to go out there . Thanks for saving my skin . And I 'm sorry I had to threaten you with a gun . But I didn 't know how else to stop you . It was very effective . But all you had to do was tell me about them . I hoped I wouldn 't have to . But you changed everything when you started to leave . And I had to stop you some way . You say there 's 200 or 300 out there ? Ann . That 's right , Captain Thorne . And if you 'd stuck with your row boat And played captain instead of trying to play detective , You wouldn 't have to worry about how many are out there , Would you ? That 's enough , Jerry . What 's wrong , Ann ? Thorne decided to leave . To dissuade him I started to tell him about the shrews . He might as well know the whole story as half of it . I guess we 're all a little jumpy , captain . I 'm sorry . Six months ago we managed to isolate The path to controlling size . Two litters were born . Six individuals kept for study . They were about the size of buckshot at birth . But the rate of growth was abnormal . They continued to grow and grow . They were mutants . But they inherited all the negative characteristics Of their breed . Somehow they managed to escape . About a month later we saw one of their offspring . They were multiplying . We did everything in the world to exterminate them , But no apparent luck . Then we haven 't seen any since daylight blinds them and they Forage only at night unless starving . But the fact that two of them charged Ann and Jerry At the gate last evening indicates That their available food on the island is nearing depletion . Then what , Doctor ? They will exterminate each other . It will take a couple days . And what do we do during that time ? Stay indoors and wait until it 's over . I guess some wires blew down on the transformer . I 'm sorry . I 'll get some lamps . Mario . Mario . Si , senor ? There 's a lantern in the pantry . Light it and bring it in here . Radford , light all the candles you can find . All right , I will . Where 's the generator ? Outside . Can 't get at it at night . Here , let me help . A lantern will give you all the light you need . I will join you shortly , Jerry . [ THUNDER ] Well , Jerry , I felt she was sincere And made sense from her standpoint . Wanting her father to leave the island with her makes sense ? It 'd be much better for the project If I went with her for a few days . As a matter of fact , I think I 'll talk to Doctor about that . That might be the answer . And another thing , I don 't take much to this Thorne Sherman . He looks to me like the type that would try anything . That left handed dinner invitation . That was just to keep me here until after dark , wasn 't it ? I wanted you here tonight . I thought something terrible was going to happen . Do you still feel the same way about it ? Not as much . Not since you 're here and know everything . [ SHREWS CHATTERING ] [ HORSE NEIGHING ] I love an open fire , don 't you ? Mm-hmm . The wind has a lonesome sound , doesn 't it ? Sure does . Back in Sweden we don 't have a wind this strong . You 're a strange man , Thorne . I never met anyone like you . Oh ? You seem so disinterested in everything . Aren 't you the least bit curious ? Don 't you wonder about the unusual things around here ? The guns , the fence , shattered windows , my accent , anything ? I 'll tell you something . I 'm only interested in anything that concerns me , Then I do something about it . [ HORSE NEIGHING ] You 're going to sail with me tomorrow whether your father [ INAUDIBLE ] . [ HORSE NEIGHING ] Thorne , no ! Father ! Rad ! Out there . I don 't think he was going out , Jerry . I couldn 't take a chance . He 's fool enough to . Don 't be stupid . I had no intentions of going out there and opening That gate unless somebody needed it . Did you hear it , Doctor ? Sounded like a human voice . I was thinking of Rook . It was the livestock . The shrews got into the barn . What was it , father ? The livestock . Did Mario forget to bar those doors ? No . I put them in the barn myself . They couldn 't get through the wood doors . They dug through the dirt floor . Let me ask you something , Doctor . How could you expose all our lives , yourself included , With those things out there ? All you had to do was get the Coast Guard or the Navy To come in here and burn them out . Those things got loose ... Any unusual experiment can produce unusual results . That 's why I chose this island . It 's isolated . Miles of open water in any direction . Our project is privately financed . It 's not a product for the government or military . And the world is no danger . This species does not swim . And as far as the shrews are concerned , This island is their world . Very soon , right here on this island , There 's going to be a miniature reproduction Of an overpopulated world . And you 'll see the importance of what we 're working to avoid . I 'm not concerned about all this theory . What I 'm concerned about is our lives . There 'll be ample time to panic when they run out of food And go on a 24 hour forage . How do you know they haven 't already ? That 's possible . Their main diet has been small animals on the island . That source could have been depleted 18 or 20 hours ago . And that 's why they went after the livestock . There 's still some food on this island Before they reach the crisis . Where ? No worry about them digging in here . The floors are tile . But the walls aren 't , Doctor . They 're adobe . Our safest bet would be on that boat . You may be right . You can reach your boat in daylight . The shrews will gorge themselves on livestock . That will keep them lethargic for several hours . There 's no sense looking at the dark side . And there 's no sense minimizing a serious situation . It leaves you completely unprepared to cope with it . Now we certainly can 't make it tonight . That 's out of the question . Maybe tomorrow . I have it . We 'll get some sleep tonight , but we 'll Have a watch , an hour and a half apiece . Doctor , you go first , and then Radford , Mario , Jerry , And then me . Shutter all the windows . Make sure they 're locked good and tight . Check all these walls . Come now . No , I think I 'll stay here by the fire . I feel safer . I couldn 't stand it in that room alone . All right . As you wish . But try to get some sleep . I will . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Senor Farrell , it is Mario . You are next to make the patrol , no ? ( SLURRING ) Sure , Mario , come on in . Been waiting for you to finish . I must have dozed off . You kind of startled me . Sit down . Here . Have a drink . It 'll help you to relax . Gracias , senor . Sit down . Rest a while . You just checked every room in the house , didn 't you ? Si . Fine . You 're a good man , Mario . A man that can be trusted . You know what I 've been thinking about , Mario ? Ann and that captain . You and me . Imagine an intelligent girl like her going For a common sea tramp like him . I know why . You do too . In case anything goes wrong she 's Looking out for her own hide . That 's why I keep thinking about you and me . Anything goes wrong , we 're going to outlast them all . [ THUNDER ] I 'm going to trust you to take my turn At patrolling the house . But when you finish , don 't wake the captain . Come back here and get me . I 'll probably feel good enough by then to take his turn . OK , Mario ? Si . OK . [ SHREWS SQUEAKING ] Senor , it is Mario . Mario . Come on in . What is it ? [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] A shrew in the cellar ? Si . I hear him [ INAUDIBLE ] down there . Well how did he get in ? The [ INAUDIBLE ] the kitchen window . But I close it off . He went down there . Why should he go down there ? The food for the [ INAUDIBLE ] . I [ INAUDIBLE ] . They love it . Well did you tell Jerry ? No , senor . He [ INAUDIBLE ] your turn next . Here is [ INAUDIBLE ] . We kill him , no ? Yeah . Ann . Ann , wake up . A shrew got in . It 's all right . He 's down in the cellar . Now , we 're going down after him . But I don 't want you to let anybody Open that door until I tell you to . You understand ? Good girl . OK . Open it just a crack . Open it . Hold on to it . OK . Take that side . Mario ? [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] You see anything ? I see where he was . I do not see where he is . [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] Si , senor . I will be careful . [ GUNSHOT ] [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] Here , let me fix that . [ SHREW SQUEAKING ] [ GUNSHOT ] You all right down there ? Doctor , get down here quick . Mario ! He ... he 's dead . Dead ? I got this on him right away . He couldn 't have bled to death . Might as well let go of it . Won 't do him any good now . What could have killed him ? I 'm not certain . Until the autopsy . Hemotoxic syndrome . I 'm afraid so . We 'll know after pathology . Doctor , that 's not the same animal you showed me . That 's a monster . As I said , they are mutants . In controlling the size factor , we Seem to have crossed some of the other characteristics . Well , you certainly did a good job of it . I 've known that for some time , Captain . Would you please give me a hand with Mario ? Radford , bring up the animal . Extremely high poison content in the shrew 's saliva . Mm-hmm . Now compare it with this . Careful count isn 't necessary . Any indication the same poison in Mario 's blood Will give you the answer . Yes , you 're right . Look , Ann . Brooding about it 's not going to do any good . Now why don 't you try to think of something else ? Tell me , what do you do around here ? Are you a scientist ? I 'm a zoologist . Oh ? That 's the study of animal life , isn 't it ? Well , do you specialize ? What do you specialize in ? [ INAUDIBLE ] . I had a hand in this too . I 'm partly to blame . [ SHREWS CHATTERING ] [ INAUDIBLE ] . If we ever get off this island , I 'll Never have anything to do with it again . What will you do ? Live normally , like normal women do . May seem a little dull after the life I 've been living . But I 'd rather dull and alive than excited and ... I 'd take a dull alive woman every time . Say , Thorne . The autopsy has proved what we suspected . Several weeks ago I concocted the most virulent poison I could with the materials I had at hand . I put it out as bait . Mario was killed by poison . Doctor , I wonder if you thought the system of the sorex Enabled them to assimilate that poison . It remained in the salivary glands of their jaws . Isn 't that wonderful ? I am sorry . Of course I always speak from the clinical point of view . Well , don 't you have something to counteract that poison ? Once Mario was bitten I 'm afraid there 's nothing anyone Could have done . This indicates that we cannot afford to get even so much As a scratch from these animals . They 're more poisonous than snakes . What , do you think they 're all effected ? Best way to find out is let them all Bite you and see which bites you die after . We might just all get that chance , Jerry . You included . Doctor , I 've closed all the doors in the house . I suggest we do the same thing with this hall and this lab . It 'll cut down the chances of getting In the front of the house . I think if we keep a close watch on those walls and windows In there , we might make it until daybreak . The walls are two feet thick . Do you think they have a chance to dig in ? Of course there 's a chance . Anywhere that plaster 's off , that adobe 's as soft as mush Where that rain hit it . [ SHREW SQUEAKING ] It 's not a bad idea , Doctor . But here 's another possibility , Doctor . It 's very light out . It 's going to be daylight soon . We take the shrew that killed Mario And throw it over the fence and use it for bait . If they show up for it , of course the run for the boat 's Out . But if they don 't , then I 'll go down And have Rook lay too with the lighter . Then I 'll return to the bend in the trail And give you the all clear signal . Sounds fine , Captain . Good , then you explain it to the rest . Yes , I will . Well , the bait 's been out there 20 minutes . Nothing 's touched it . Even the wind has gone down . Isn 't that wonderful ? I 'm afraid it 's not over , my dear . It 's just a lull . There 'll be a lot more . He 's right . I 'll be back at the bend shortly . Now you watch for my signal . You can 't go alone . I 'll go with him . Not you , father . You haven 't even fired a gun . Take Rad or Jerry . Sure , I 'll go . And you 'll be sure of getting a signal . Don 't shoot that gun unless you have to . We 've only got 20 rounds all together . I know that as well as you do . Sherman . You stay away from her . Do you have that gun pointed at me ? Right at the middle of your back . Look , we got enough problems without worrying about Ann . I 'm telling you , stay away from her Or when the shrews get through with you , They won 't even find a buckshot . [ SHREWS CHATTERING ] Hey , Rook ! Hey , Rook ! Rook ! [ WHISTLES ] Where 's the skiff ? I 'll follow that check line . I 've got to find him . Since last night you won 't find much of him . Would you shut up ? I 'm not going back . You what ? I 'm staying here . All right . You suit yourself . But if I were you , I 'd swim out to that boat . Can 't swim . Then stay here . Wait a minute . You 've got to give me a gun . Give you a gun ? Sherman , wait ! This is the gun we had on the boat . They don 't leave much , do they ? Sherman , we 've got to make a deal for ... [ SHREWS SQUEAKING ] What is it ? Shh . They 've been trailing us on both sides . Where ? I didn 't see anything . Look , Sherman , you 've got to give me a gun . All right . Whatever you do , don 't you run . And you stay in front of me because I don 't trust you . [ SHREWS CHATTERING ] They 're coming ! Open the gate ! Open it ! [ GUNSHOT ] Open the gate ! Open the gate ! Open up ! Let him in ! Jerry , open the door ! [ GUNSHOT ] [ INAUDIBLE ] . Sherman ! The shrews were out there ! I couldn 't take a chance ! [ MEN YELLING ] For heaven 's sakes . Doctor , stop him ! All right , didn 't he have it coming or didn 't he ? What happened out there ? Oh , nothing much . Jerry just tried to kill me twice in the last five minutes . Rook came ashore last night . He 's dead . This is all that was left . Won 't do us any good . It 's got no ammo . I 'm deeply sorry , Captain . I wish he had followed your orders . Look , Doctor , you casually mentioned animals . You didn 't explain to us what we were facing out there . You have every right to feel the way that you do . My mistake was only mine . It was one of judgment . I didn 't know about the hurricane . I didn 't anticipate the effect it would have on the shrews . I thought the house would be safe through the crisis . How could you expose your own daughter ? How could you expose Ann to that ? She was going to leave last week , but the boat didn 't come . I need a drink . Anybody else care for one ? I could use some coffee . I 'll make some . Thank you , Ann . Cream and sugar ? [ SHREW CHATTERING ] Oh , my leg ! [ GUNSHOTS ] Slam the door ! You all right , Doctor ? He just ripped my trousers , that 's all . Are you sure that 's all ? I 'm completely aware of it , Doctor . I 'll kill them ! [ GUNSHOTS ] That was a stupid waste of ammunition . Every one of them a clean miss . There 's still four of them in there . How did they get in ? Through that kitchen window . That rope must be rotten . It 's got him ! Radford ! He 's dead . Oh , no ! He recorded every symptom and reaction . Right up to the moment of his death . Jerry , tear down one of those drapes and cover him up . Sure . Sure . Craigis will cover Ann and I 'll cover him . You 'll cover me . But who 'll cover you ? Shut up . We can get on [ INAUDIBLE ] . I told you to shut up . Now you stop snivelling and think . It 'd take a tank to get us out of here . Thorne ! There ! [ SHREW SQUEAKING ] Won 't take them long to dig around this . You 're right . No telling where else they 're digging too . [ GUNSHOTS ] Come on . [ INAUDIBLE ] . There 's not enough stuff here to barricade those walls . I 'll tell you what , pile some of those crates up over there . That roof 's our last chance . Help me , Doctor . Find something light . All right . Here , [ INAUDIBLE ] Doctor . Jerry , see if you can find some rope . Doctor . Yes ? Use these chemical drums as tanks . Individual tanks . Here , I 'll show you . Set it down now . Slow . All right . All right ? Yeah . It 'll work . It 'll work . But these drums are too tall for the base . If the shrews don 't push us over , the wind will . Not if we lash them together . Are there any more around here ? Only that one over there . Have any [ INAUDIBLE ] chisels or hammers or anything I could knock a hole in here and make [ INAUDIBLE ] pieces ? There are some tools over there in the corner . Hey , here 's another one . Get that out there . Hey , even better . Give me a little more slack . Get some rope and put it on that latch so we can [ INAUDIBLE ] From the ground . [ SCREAMS ] [ SHREW SHRIEKING ] Now hold this in . All right . All right . We 're all set . Look , it 's going to be rough , but we Should be able to duck walk to the beach . Where 's Jerry ? There 's a lot of them out there . I can see them . I 'm not going . Look , come down here ! That wind will blow you right off that roof . I told you , I 'm not going . I 'm staying here . We 've got to get him down here somehow . Ann , see if you can coax him down here . Jerry , Jerry please come down with us ! No . Ann , they 'll get you if you go out there . Come down here , you fool ! Poor devil . I hope he makes it . We can 't leave . He 's not responsible for himself . We have to go now . All right , Doctor . Now hold it up . Everybody ready ? I 'm going to open that gate . Ready . Ready . OK , here they come . Hold on . Hold on . [ SCREAMS ] Ann , what 's the matter ? Your side 's dragging . You want to rest ? You tired ? [ SPEAKING SWEDISH ] What 'd you say ? She says she 's all right . She 's keeping her eyes closed . All right . Keep your eyes closed . They can 't get at you through the slit . This empty drum is too heavy for her . I can barely hold up my side . I 'll be all right in a minute . All right . You walk . I 'll drag for a while . Listen . Don 't let their head get under . They 'll flip us over . [ GUNSHOTS ] [ SCREAMING ] [ SCREAMS ] He got my foot ! Check your foot ! No , my foot is free but he got my boot . Is there a scratch ? No . Not a mark . [ GUNSHOT ] Keep moving . Let 's go . Let 's go . Thorne , I don 't think I ... What ? Sand ! We 're at sand ! Sand , we 're close ! We 'll hit the water soon . Doesn 't sound like they 're following us anymore . We 'd better walk deeper . I 'm about drowned out . OK , let 's swim for it . OK . [ SPEAKING SWEDISH ] We are safe , aren 't we ? I mean , the storm . Oh , sure . She rode out the first half all right , And that 's always the roughest . Anyway , riding an anchor out will give me a chance To learn a little bit more about that Swedish accent . In 24 hours , there 'll be one shrew left on the island . And he 'll be dead of starvation . An excellent example of overpopulation . Well , you know something , Doctor ? What 's that ? I 'm not going to worry about overpopulation just yet .

 THE STRANGER OF A LOST WORLD ( 1956 ) The producers wish to thank assistance received by the War Department during the production of this film . Translation : CARTWRIGHT - One minute and fourteen , Sgt. - Very good . Good job . You can now return to his post . Today we perform good tricks . - Mr. - Yes , what happened ? Lord , I could do this ? 're Sure you want to do ? I am sure , sir . Okay , prepare it , Sgt. Silence ! Let 's go ! What do you expect ? Sergeant , hide it well , that ihe cost to find all day . We 'll be here all day . I do not know what they want , we are not at war ... Want us to be well trained . All ready , sir . Timing . I think most know use the Geiger counter . Remember what they learned today . Can save their lives . And another thing , we used a type of harmless radioactive material . When the time comes , the radioactivity not be harmless , be lethal . When they find , point to the place and rush off . Leave the rest to the subject matter experts . Correct ? Good When we 're done , we go home . - What a disaster ! Look where it goes . - It will take a week to find it . Not if I can help . Do not think too long , sir . But what is he doing ? This asshole ! It 's so dumb , not find the nose on your face . See , what did I say ? What happened ? I have a very good , sir reading . Gives control here . Sergeant , tell the Commander Cartwright ! Yes , sir ! I know , we 'll be here all night . Speak of the devil ... - News , sergeant ? - Lieutenant Bannerman wants to see you , sir . Mr Bannerman . What 's going on here , sir ? Why these men are still here ? Should be in the barracks . Something strange happened , sir . We are registering a reading where there should be . How ? In this area , there are sufficient readings . - Where they buried the capsule ? - Ali near that trunk . Well , come on . - Mark this point . - Yes , sir . Wait here . Where buried her , Sergeant ? For this area , sir . Test with the meter , Mr. Bannerman . You know what happens , is a uranium mine . I wonder if we could take possession . I do not think the Army is in on it . Lord , is there something very strange . Wait a minute . Mr ! - Go see what it is . - Yes , sir . I do not understand what is happening . Because ... What the hell is this ? I do not know , seems like a thunder . Sergeant , dismiss the men . Have you heard the commander . In march , everyone outside of this area . Come on , get those asses ! Soldier ! Take this man away . Come on , get out ! We will . Get out of there ! BANNED PASS THIS AREA Attention , Dr. Royston , head to the principal 's office . Container cobalt No. 19 , reading ten o 'clock . 2 to 1.5 Dr. Royston , head to the principal 's office . It seems that his father wants Dr. Royston 's head . And mine too , if continue like this . Finished . If anything happens , I am in office administration . Peter , wait a moment . Where is Dr. Royston ? Asked me to stay here . And he , where is he ? In his lab , doing an experience of routine . But he had to be doing their job . Peter , let 's look the last container ? Container cobalt No. 20 , start reading . What makes Dr. Royston , in his lab ? An experience . Safety , sir . Safety , sir . Oh , it 's you , Russell . Come in . Get behind this frame , because it has radioactive material . Your radio sounds very bad , sir . Do you hear me , sir ? The radio is too noisy . It 's amazing . - What is it , Russell ? - The radio . There is nothing strange . With the demise of the radiation field , after storing the material there , interference disappear . - Tell me , have you come ? - The director wants to see you in his office . Came by car ? No bicycle . Well , come on , walk will do me good . - He said it is urgent and is a little angry . - No wonder . Tell him I will then . No matter what you say , I 'm the boss . I do not like to do the Peter waste your time . And you think I do this to him ? I want you to get me the job Peter is administrative . I know you are a scientist , but this do not justify the current . Has a great future and I 'm who decides what should IHE . - Sorry , was not my intention . - I know , that 's where the problem lies . That does not happen again . Got a call from the Army , registered a radiation field . Go take a look . Why not ask it to another ? Now I 'm very busy . No , I can not . Prepare a car in five Dr. minutes to Royston . - Could you speak with the soldiers ? - Of course . Now there is no sign of radioactivity . Commander , is certainly not there was some mistake ? I will not think , talk with my men . Step back , step back , loudly . Mr. Bannerman , wait , please . This young man was hit by the explosion . We thought it was stunned , but these appeared burns it . Not looks good . There has not . Thanks , guys . And the other man ? Is best , was not so close to the explosion . Consider your back . That seems IHE ? Took it in hand when the explosion occurred ? Yes sir . With your permission . Doctor ended ? Yes , thank you . Is finished . Commander , I need more equipment . I 'll write it here ... send a message ... so that bring me something from my lab . Yes , no problem . I will send radio to headquarters , and then take charge of everything . Ok The unfortunate is a mess . You can see it ? A little ... is ... not the first case we see , is equal to another . One who got burned . What do you mean ? What died . He spent the night screaming . I feel like some tea . Tea ? This step does not or we will take breakfast . Turn out that light . Commander , as happened so suddenly ? How had time to disperse his men ? Let 's see if my question answered . It comes to nuclear power ? You see , we only know ... And now , what are you doing ? Now we 're doing ... If there was radioactivity . How do you explain his absence now ? I do not know ... That tells me the wounded ? Where are they ? Are in the hospital . Military or civilian ? Military . There was a dead man , who is ? Lansing was called . Doing military service ? Yes Why ? It is not a coincidence that the only were killed in military service ? Do not be so ironic , was very near the explosion . - Mr. - Yes Sgt. Dr. Royston wants to see him . We also want talk to Dr. Royston . Gentlemen , is not permitted entry of unauthorized personnel . Listen , this is private property . I 'm responsible , or do what they say or I escort all . Please silence . Sir , the doctor expects . Thank you , Sergeant . Good evening , gentlemen . I 'm starving . According to the sergeant , not be long at dinner . Yes , this is what he says every day . Just think of eating ? That 's right ? Yes sir . Other recorded signals . Of that I have no doubt . Called me , Royston ? Yes , commander . Here we can do no more . Let two of his men standing guard to prevent anyone falling into the well . No sense making guard all night . We will close the area , and will put posters warning . Keep the equipment , I hope you in the car . You find ? You know what depth is ? Depth ? We do not know . Do you mean , who has no background ? I mean that the scope our equipment is limited . Good evening , sir . Good evening sir . Lord , what depth think you have a screwdriver ? I do not know . The commander said that you had suggested that it would not fund . So what ? This does not seem IHE unscientific ? Logically have to have background . But because of crack have some origin . And hopefully some end . The forces that originate these cracks scattered . The forces which cause these cracks do not cause radiation burns . What do you mean , sir ? I do not mean anything , just do not understand . Suppose the commander 's right . Better than imagined monsters in the darkness of night . We will . When you come home , they 'll kill me . Me too , but we did a oath , and can not be broken . Repeat the oath . " I swear I 'll go to the tower to see if the Old Tom sleeps there every night . " Are you afraid ? No . Now you will see , fast ! Wait for me here ? For five minutes . Three minutes . Good luck , Willie . Come on , faster , Willie ! What happened , Willie ? What did you see ? Hey , Willie ... wait for me . Come back , Willie , do not leave me alone . How many drops , doctor ? Six drops per minute . And then ? radiation burns first grade . I knew , why did he come . What time was received ? About an hour ago . You can talk to your parents . Out here are . - Nurse , change the bandages . - Yes doctor . What happened to you , doctor ? What does he have ? Could not tell us something , doctor ? I fear it is too early , to say something . His son suffered severe burns . - Can you tell me how this happened ? - How ? What kind of burns ? That 's what we try to find out . When they realized ? This morning , when I walked in his room to wake him , I saw these horrible marks throughout the body . Where was he yesterday ? You know something ? Do not know , been here , with his friend . Ian Osborn . Ask him ... he will know where were at night . Ian , wait a moment . Are you someone who wants to meet you . Ian , this is Dr. Royston . Dr. Royston , introduce you to Ian Orson . How are you , Ian ? Thank you . Let 's sit down . Just visit his friend Willie Harding . Not very well , Ian . What happened to him ? Second I was told by night the two returned home late . I believe what happened something where you 've been . I want you to tell me about it . Where have you been ? What happened to Ian ? I can not say , we took an oath . Willie is very sick . Very sick , Ian . I can not , can not ... We took an oath . Yes , Ian , but that was when Willie was right . Now is sick and things have changed . He would want to tell . - You sure about that ? - Quite right . We 've been through the swamp . We were afraid and challenged Willie so that it was up to the tower . Hello ? Is anyone there ? Mr ? Lord , wake up . What happened ? Look at this ... Want a drink ? No thanks . I came because ... because ... want a cup . This container is mine is my lab . Where did you get ? This ... I found in the field . Let there ! You have ? Are you crazy ? Do not touch that . Touching may die . Come in . Now I understood your call . Was stolen . Unfortunately , yes . Is lead ? Of 12 mm . Seems like ... I know I found it in the tower . There is a towel . Not going to get take out , leave within one or two hours . What is it ? Whatever is all over . Do not understand . Mangle everything to take a simple bottle with samples . You know what it contained ? Strontium . Do not be alarmed ... it 's harmless . Knows how long radioactivity preserved ? There is a very stable compound . - A 30 . - 28 . Treat to measure the radioactivity . Works perfectly , see . Needles are good . What happened ? Do not understand . I 'm afraid that not too . Yesterday , the material on this bottle ... had a reading ... dangerous radioactivity . Now is harmless . But this is impossible . Do not you think too ? Yesterday would have said yes . But this fact is irrefutable . The trapped energy has not been extracted . And what 's worse ... the windows have bars and the door is reinforced . Who has entered , is an expert monstrous . - Inspector bellowed . - Mr. bellowed . Excuse me , but all this subject is ridiculous . Lord , I did not hire him . Send us the police . Any crime related to this institution , goes into our hands . It is possible , but the crime does not has nothing to do with this institution . This bottle was stolen from Mr. Royston lab . And it is a personal matter . I think that 's racing local police . With respect to Dr. Royston bottle contained radioactive material , I 've talked to the doctor himself , and do not wish to talk more about this subject . But I do , sir . Where can I find Dr. Royston ? Listen , Inspector ... Mr. bellowed . If gives credit history , do not know the basic principles of science . Dr. Royston knows . What does he know ? The basic principles of science . Lord , I am here to conduct an investigation . I hope you will allow me do my job . Where can I find Dr. Royston ? Do not rest or to eat ? My name is bellowed , mind if I sit down ? Division of Atomic Energy of the United UK , Department of Homeland Security . Very impressive . Yes , impresses except during receiving the salary . You want to know ? Inspector ... Mr. bellowed . Well , Mk . Who wants to know ? With respect to burned boy . Any idea as it happened ? I 'm not too sure , it is possible that had manipulated my sample vial . Have not contain radioactivity . Had told me . - The Doctor ? - The Doctor . What is your opinion about it ? What is yours ? I am not qualified to opine , only care about the facts . I spoke with the tramp who lives in the tower . The Old Tom And I confirmed with the old , the boy not approached his bottle . The burns were caused by something else . Dr. Royston , wanted to help me discover what would have been . I regret . Maybe you want to stay a little come into my office . Thank you . Parents Willie . Is dead ? Yes , he could not recover . You need to figure out how occurred . It 's what we investigated doctor . - Kelly . - Bellowed . That 's why we came . Are you Dr. Royston ? I 'm sorry , Mr. Harding . It is useless excuses . I 've heard of you , Mr. Royston . You are a scientist not cure the sick . Is dedicated to the experience and kill them , as it did with my son . Should be in jail . With them in your class . Playing with things can not control . You are a danger . You are a murderer . Mr. Harding , please . I do not know what to do , Dr. Kelly . How to help ... my wife . Do not know what to say . Sure , mooed . He knew , but he was mistaken . We just tried to create , without destroying . Two minutes ? Ok ROOM OF RADIATION . TRESPASSING UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL . Zena , I 'm here . What a cute ! And practical . So they say the other nurses . Do not listen to rumors . Of course , by I 'm here . So that would not come if ... ? to ... make me some x-rays ? Honey , why linger both get it ? I believe it was done enough . It had to have been more direct . Should have told me , Harry , I want , I want ... What happened ? Is activated , should be power of his personality . Stay here . Do not move . Here we kept the radium . It is clear , radium was what they wanted . Destroyed all reinforced box . What temperature would have used to do this ? Much unimaginable to us . It 's incredible ! Made in a few seconds . Perhaps the young can clarify something else . - You see this ? - Yes , it 's everywhere . As in his laboratory . How is she ? I doubt he recovers , but you better get her out . She can tell us what happened ? Can not say or as it is called . What is it ? What face ? How to get here ? out here We have all the time . I think the only this entry is possible . The grid can not open , is welded to the wall . Went through it . It is impossible , as there is no one small that it can enter there . How big is 100,000 liters of oil ? What do you mean ? 100,000 liters of oil would occupy a fairly large area . Yes . And 100,000 liters of oil could pass very well for this grid , no ? That yes . I entered both here and on my laboratory , under the door . This thing can acquire way you want . And now where is it ? The slit . I hope that the commander did not hear me and let no soldier on guard . Yes , he did . Is ready . - What is it ? - Tea . I heard something . Like what ? I do not know . Wait . What could be ... Spider , here I see a glow . What will ? I am not sure . - Why do not you see ? - Yes Why me ? Are you afraid ? Yes , and do not mind admitting . Why will not you ? Do you know this area better . I do not know . There was Scottish ? I was born at 200 km. from here . We no longer need , is gone . Is the same thing , I 'll see what there is . Make tea not cool . Accordingly . Haggis , I 've been thinking ... Together ... we can go to Glasgow , when we give permission . You could show me the castle . Come , Spider , look ! What happened , Haggis ? Where is Haggis ? Where is Haggis ? We arrived late . Danger NO PASS I called this meeting , because I have an idea about what is happening . Is to find a solution . Anyone who thinks only present idiocies , I hope to show a most logical conclusion . What is it ? Facts or theories ? A few facts and many theories . I understand , we 're all ears . Would you like me to report to a job that did in my student days . It comes to the cooling of Earth 's surface . Makes hundreds of millions of years , the earth was like the sun , had no form nor solidity , was an accumulation of gases . Then the earth began to cool . During this process formed a crust . The energy was still there , but was beneath this crust compressed . Over time , the crust was getting thicker while all this energy followed compressing a space increasingly reduced . Is explaining something that any primary kid knows . What are you getting ? Excuse me , I shall avoid the basic arguments No , do not skip anything , Adam , I was never a good student . Well then , in a period relatively short for some 10,000 years , evolved the man . Man evolved from nothing to be converted to the smarter this planet . And given the long period of time elapsed , would not be reasonable to assume that the forces contained in the center of the Earth ... could also develop a ... own intelligence ? If we accept this , we would ask , what think those forces ? Your world is depressing to a vanishing point . The survival be their top priority . And the most natural , following his self-preservation , is back to its origin , the planet 's surface . Now ... Proven ... if summer each 50 , due to the position of the Earth within the solar system , The planet 's surface undergoes the greater force of gravity . Here we do not see , but 2000 km. the surface ... who knows ... ! And during the brief time it lasts this maximum force of gravity , notice that always has been an earthquake , and it has coincided with the opening cracks in the earth 's surface . This makes you think these occasions , has been the large amount of energy prey , causing concussions the intention to leave to the surface . But ... and this time , has come to the surface , seeking a livelihood ? To live would be missed , the food . And this force is almost pure energy . The energy that feeds ? Energy . Exact . Energy can not feed themselves more than energy . For example , radiation . Are 50 , 100 , 150 years these forces were without any means of livelihood . And its mass is destabilized and disintegrated . but now ... we come to another 50 cycle . Now there is radiation . There radiation in the hospital . Also in the laboratory . While they can feed themselves , continue living . And much more vivid , grow more . Fantastic ! I recognize that does not seem very scientific . But if they take a most reasonable explanation , to give . I would be very Happy to hear it . Want to tell us that the slit , came a strange creature ? I do not mean anything . Only presented a theory based on the facts . What should we look for ? I do not know . And if we find something ? What do we do ? Also not the answer . What size can have this thing ? Could be the size of a fist ... or the size of this home . We must do something . We have to find it and destroy it . Destroy it ? What do you think ? Burn it , shoot him , blow him up ? I have something to say . Just tell us a story based on few facts and a great deal of theory . I 'm surprised they have accepted this story without any hesitation . I must say that all this sounds fantastic to me . And I will say more , to me , seems bullshit . Dr. Royston , you 're a scientist and based on the facts . A man of his intelligence , has no right to talk like that . Surprises me . And burns boy ? Already talked about this . And the incident at the hospital ? I assure you that has a most logical explanation . I suggest we leave the subject the hands of police . I 'm the police ... come and ask for advice Dr. Royston . In this case , I do not want waste any more time . Good evening , gentlemen . I see you share this view . May present something . The only thing we can do , is go to the cleft . We 've been there several times ... and has nothing . Do not misunderstand me , someone has to get off the crack . I 'm ready . Peter , if you do not have why continue . You have nothing to worry about . I offered myself as a volunteer . That 's right , Adam . Ok , Peter . Thank you . The boss did not like it . Or anyone . Called the center 's director . Said that all this is a waste of time . We end up in getting into trouble . Maybe not , but I fulfill orders . All ready , sir ! Okay , Peter ? Yes of course . What 's the plan ? If the spectrometer radioactivity noted , let us know and you 'll pull from there . Right . Let 's go . Slowly . Nothing . I see nothing . Lower more . All right , sir ? Slower . Nothing . Stop it ! High . Come down a bit . Simply . You are right , sir ? He 's fine . What happened ? It 's okay , but it has something strange , sir . No , there is nothing , everything well , continue falling . Continue falling . Stop it ! I said , stop ! Oh my God ! Get me out ! Come on , quick ! Get me out ! Hurry ! Come on , guys ! Please get me out ! Faster , faster ! You were right , sir . I saw the corpse of a soldier . Was charred . Okay , do not worry . Let 's get out of here . What did you see down there ? I do not know what it was , seemed like a nightmare . So I ran danger ... We 'll talk about that . Now get in the car . Gave the order that if they saw something strange downstairs , I went into action , sir . What kind of action ? Kill whatever and capping with cement . Capping with cement ? You 're not serious ? I fulfill orders . When they start ? Tonight . Sergeant ! I see you do not lose time anyway . There was no other solution , do not you think ? Dr. Royston was a scientist , but that 's their problem , never understand why easy solutions . They believe that everything has to be complicated to be effective . Come in . Where you been ? Hold it . The slit . And managed to solve ? What exactly was it used ? Practically everything Lance-throwers , explosives and a precious tombstone cement . Rest in peace , huh ? Think it will be useless , is not it ? It is absurd , if we into account the facts . Give me this . How is it possible that this force X , is it is , that has pioneered through kilometers and kilometers of solid rock , will not cross this simple case of cement ? Yes , but would like to survive the lance-throwers and explosives ? No living organism known , would . But this is an organization truly special . His system of life could look like this . Get behind this frame . Excuse me . How to try to kill it ? What 's this ? A particle of clay ... because ... its structure atom emits radiation . But it is no more than clay . How to kill ? Has entered the London about all this ? Only a half-dozen times . E ? At first , it Ihes looked interesting ... They told me they would consult with the director . Later , the director communicated with them . The result is that I have to go back to London . When ? Tonight . In the last plane from Glasgow . I 'm so sorry . It was one of my best allies . This thing again out , correct ? In my opinion , yes . Can not do anything to prevent it . I do not know , I have taken very time working a disintegrating formula atomic structure , avoiding explosion resulting therefrom . But ... What 's this ? What is a bomb ? It is a division of atomic particles , no ? Not just that , but it is something . I try to achieve this division without the explosion . It is a ... See , I 'll show you . In this container has a lead atomically unstable compound . IHE can happen to two things : Continue emitting radiation during the next 200 years , or be subjected to an external energy disintegrate in the a fraction of seconds . A bomb . Could be , so deal to improve it . In theory , if we put the particle between the pickups ... and adjust the pickups to one certain vibration , we get a neutralizing effect . That would not explode ? That is the question , could not . No longer would a bomb , but a handful of clay within a very expensive container . That would be awesome , Adam . At least , we will by a good way . Could use it against this thing . It is possible that within six months , but ... Tell me , Russell , What 's going on ? Mr. Peter sent me , to remind you of the time . Ah , yes . Thank you . Russell , could locate Mr. Elliott ? So far no , sir . Gosh ! I regret . Thanks , I 'm coming . We should be analyzing cobalt , but nevertheless ... we are not able ... locate John . Mc . We will feel very its lack . Goodbye , Adam . Good luck . Peter , the truck is ready ? Yes You are at the door , sir . As soon as we all cobalt I want the quick upload . Cobalt is disabled ! Cobalt is disabled ! Okay , let 's get him . POLICE No sir , I do not think . I think we can go back happening . Excuse me . Sorry sir . The line is bad . Yes , I will , but ... I ask ... just one more night . If there is no novelty , take the first plane tomorrow . It is the sergeant talking . Where ? Thank you , sir . They told me that the director , Mr. Elliott is calling you . Speak up , line malfunctions . Thank you very much . And the date ? Yes . How ? What madness ! No sir , I know , but anyway ... Agreed , good night . Send a patrol right now . Need a car There has been an accident . Yes sir . Goodbye , Sgt. Goodbye , sir . And we warn you when they reach the site of the accident . They said they have We are melting . As I said , sir ? There was an accident at about 4 km . Yes , I know . And what are melting ? Informed me by phone . Should this be some ... Let me see . What are you doing ? I asked IHE what r u doing . I 'm sorry , sir . Have a phone here ? Has a public , about 2 km away . But maybe some of these people let them use their . Have someone who has your phone ? I have the phone in my store , half miles. from here . - You are at your disposal . - Thank you , get in the car . Dr. Royston ... John , just take Cobalt storer . There was no reason for ... Who authorized you ? We had no time to consult him . You know the importance What is this cobalt . Will delay the project , in a couple of weeks . Without consulting anyone . It is an important official experience . Disables cobalt , without telling me . This is not your lab . Hello ? Could you speak up , please ? There currently is busy . 'm Peter Elliott . Yes . I 'll say it right now . Dr. Royston . It bellowed . Apparently it you feared most happened . Ends killed four people who were in a car . The line is very bad , but I think that said they are melted . Hello , Mark . Me , Royston . What happened ? Yes . Yes , one moment . Just a moment . A pencil , please . Tell me , yes . Where ? Okay , okay . I wrote it down . Goodbye . It has a map of the area , in your office ? Yes of course . Can we see it ? Yes , obviously . Here is where the slit . Here is the hospital . Here is where we produced the brightness . Here ... is ... my lab . Following this line , arrived in the old tower . We notice that this thing detects radioactivity . And when you do that , nothing stops her . Go straight to the radiation and soon returns to the slit . These lines demonstrate that always does the same path . Finally , the successful with the car ignited , we know you 're here . If we extend the line from the fissure , this crossing point , where to find somewhere this line , is your goal . The Center for Atomic Energy . Exact . Go in search of food most immense of his life . Come on , open this gate ! I 'm coming , I 'm coming . Come on , open the gate ! Give me your identification . Come on , as if did not know me ! Sorry , sir , give me your identification . - Look out . - Thank you , sir . We have to hide the Cobalt . Have to get him out ASAP . The thing must have a limit to detect the radiation . We should act in haste . Adam , I want you to know ... never mind ... , 'll notify Security . Gotta find ? Not yet . Can not be far . I gave notice to the people keep their homes . I have all men on alert . I tried to contact London but the lines do not work well . Looks like you have interference . Here we have the same problem . Do you know if anyone saw anything ? My men saw nothing . Why this thing can disappear ? Not disappear , but it could change shape and to become practically invisible . What are they doing ? We try to make this Cobalt here . And then , Elliott ? How 's it going ? We have worldwide alert . I make a call ? Ali has a phone . But the line malfunctions . WARNING : " It is strictly forbidden to anyone passing beyond that point . " - Go running to the main entrance . - Yes Everyone out ! What we do with the Cobalt ? We can not do anything . But if attaining , may explode . It would be the first cobalt bomb . Out of here ! Everyone out ! Come on , quick ! Just a moment ! There 's a dead man . Where can I see the tower ? Climb those stairs . The whole world vacate the area ! Come on , quick ! Come this way ! Our only hope , is to neutralize the radiation . Do not tell me that cobalt is very unstable ? Yes , it is . The guard of the entrance , dead like the others . And this thing comes by West area . Look . There is , on the roof . Go up , fast ! Is increasing in size . The dough has to expand to accumulate the radiation it absorbs . Volume that could get to have ? The question is to what degree instability has . We can not do anything . We can do but not here . We must wait until back to the slot . We know which way to follow , so we have to disengage from her so as not to produce no more victim . I 'll try to get a helicopter . Thus we can achieve it , if you change your direction . And what will you do , Adam ? Back to my lab . Is growing . Who said ? Nothing. interference do not let me hear anything . The sergeant said this thing does not move fast . - Let 's get out of here . - Okay . Come on , quick ! all to the church ! Need help , Father ? For now , no . How far is it ? Approximately a 100 meters away . Close this street . When will you ? Within a couple minutes or less . Come on lady , fast . Come in here be safe . There is . Changed direction , does not follow the planned route . Is with the map upside down . It 's getting pretty close . Helicopter to base . Helicopter to base . Heads up the East . There is no point . Nothing is heard with so static . Have a flashlight ? Yes , it is on your right . Ok We drove the three point . Look , here it is . Come on , lady , quickly , No time to lose . Fast . Get in quick ! Stay here ! The phone lines are seedlings . The radio does not work . There is no way to talk to London . We must act on our own . I keep thinking that when reach the crevice , we should leave her alone . Until we talk with the Ministry . Look , Mr. Elliott . Adam said that the more huge this thing becomes , the greater your reach . This will be their next target . See , here it is . The experimental nuclear station . To get there , traverse through the city center . We have to stop this thing while in the slot . And we have to do it once . How 's it going ? Not very well , but I 'll try again . Be careful , anyway . There , it worked ! It worked , you got it , Adam ! Gotta do ! Adam , look ! The container , see how shines ! What 's going on ? Does not work , I have try again . We do not have time . If a size material of a pinhead , is able to cause this explosion ... Imagine what could occur in the slot . We need more time . No matter , we to risk . We have to stop this thing in the slot . I think the scanners could have desynchronized . Yes , this is possible. could also be hundreds of things . May have been the scanners . Yes , yes . May have desynchronized . We have everything asked Adam . Vehicles , radioactive material , everything is prepared . If so then , start working . Tell them that depart hence , make an infernal noise . Do not want to draw attention . Yes sir . Ready , Commander . It 's been half an hour . They are doing their men ? Mc , we will vacate the area . Adam , if you go wrong , both causes that are close or not . Okay , but let 's do anyway . This is our Jeep . As you said . I suppose you know what takes the Jeep is lethal . Yes sir . The goal is to make this thing out of there . Do not get closer than 3 meters . - Roger that . - Very well , sir . In motion , attention on the trucks . Ok , sir . Follow this car . Okay , sir . Do not allow the Jeep , get closer than 3 meters . - Remember well , 3 meters . - Okay - We can help you in something , Adam ? - No , Mc . - But what you can do is watch . - Well , I 'll be careful . Commander , tell your men that remain synchronized , scanners . And that they activate when I give the signal . Accordingly . - Is everything going well ? - Yes , sir .

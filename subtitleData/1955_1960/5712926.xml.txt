 CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY LIONS GATE HOME ENTERTAINMENT AAH ! Man : CAROL ! HEY , CAROL , WAIT . HI . HI , MIKE . HEY , WAKE UP . THIS IS MIKE , REMEMBER ? THE BOY WITH THE GOLDEN HEART AND THE MEMORY OF AN ELEPHANT . LOOK , I REMEMBERED , SEE ? HAPPY BIRTHDAY , CAROL . THANKS . WELL , AREN 'T YOU GOING TO OPEN IT ? NOT NOW . WHAT 'S WRONG ? IT 'S DAD . HE DIDN 'T COME HOME LAST NIGHT . SO WHAT ? YOU KNOW IT DOESN 'T MEAN A THING . I MEAN , YOU KNOW HOW HE IS . WHAT DO YOU MEAN I " KNOW HOW HE IS " ? NOTHING . I ... [ HONKING ] NOW , WHERE DIDN 'T HE COME HOME FROM LAST NIGHT ? WELL , HE WENT TO SPRINGDALE YESTERDAY TO BUY ME A PRESENT . HE SAID HE 'D BE BACK BEFORE DINNER LAST NIGHT , BUT HE STILL HASN 'T COME BACK YET . WELL , THAT DOESN 'T MEAN A THING , CAROL . I MEAN , IT ISN 'T THE FIRST TIME . YOU 'RE MEAN , MIKE . AND I DON 'T WANT YOUR SILLY PRESENT EITHER . HERE ! [ SCHOOL BELL RINGING ] THE ELECTRONS JUMP FROM ONE ELECTRODE TO THE OTHER BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THE ELECTRICAL POTENTIAL BETWEEN THE 2 POLES . THIS ONE IS THE NEGATIVE POLE , FROM WHICH ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO THE POSITIVE POLE . WE CALL THE POSITIVE POLE WHAT ? All : ANODE . CORRECT . THE NEGATIVE POLE ? All : CATHODE . GOOD . IF THE VOLTAGE APPLIED TO THESE ELECTRODES IS INCREASED TO A GREATER AMPLITUDE , THE ELECTRICAL ARC , IN TURN , WILL BE GREATER . THE LARGER THE ARC BECOMES , THE MORE DANGEROUS IT IS TO ANYTHING THAT MAY BE PLACED IN ITS PATH . AND ONE THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE FLOW OF ELECTRONS IS ALWAYS FROM THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE . THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE POSITIVE POLE HAS HIGHER ELECTRICAL POTENTIAL . NOW , IN A SIMPLE VOLTAIC CELL , THE POSITIVE ELECTRODE IS MADE OF COPPER . THE NEGATIVE , OF ZINC . A SIMILAR EXPERIMENT TO THE ONE WE CONDUCTED HERE WAS RECENTLY CARRIED OUT AT WISCONSIN TECH USING A VOLTAGE MANY THOUSANDS OF TIMES GREATER , WHICH PRODUCED A SPARK CLOSELY SIMULATING ACTUAL LIGHTNING . IT ISN 'T THE VOLTAGE THAT CREATES THE HAZARD . IT 'S THE AMOUNT OF CURRENT FLOW . IF A MAN WERE TO COME IN CONTACT WITH A HIGH VOLTAGE WITHOUT A DIRECT PATH TO GROUND , IT 'S PROBABLE THAT HE WOULDN 'T BE HARMED . HOWEVER , IF THE CIRCUIT 'S COMPLETE AT THE GROUND , THE CURRENT WILL FLOW UNHAMPERED AND CAUSE HIM TO BE ELECTROCUTED . NOW , FOR OUR NEXT EXPERIMENTS ... IF MIKE , CAROL , AND JOE HAVE FINISHED THEIR BUSINESS . I CAN 'T BLAME PEOPLE FOR WHAT THEY THINK . EVEN MOTHER SAYS HE MUST HAVE RUN INTO SOME OF HIS OLD CRONIES AND STAYED IN TOWN . HE HAD HIS PAYCHECK WITH HIM . I KNOW IT ISN 'T TRUE . NOT THIS TIME . HE PROMISED HE 'D BE BACK . I KNOW SOMETHING 'S HAPPENED TO HIM . SURE IT DID . MAYBE HE RAN OUT OF GAS . HE 'D NEVER MEET ANYBODY ON THIS ROAD . HOLD EVERYTHING . WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT ? RUBBERY STUFF . I DON 'T GET IT . STUCK TO THE TREE UP THERE AND ... IT 'S PITCHED ACROSS THE HIGHWAY JUST BETWEEN 2 TREES . WHO WOULD DO A THING LIKE THAT ? I DON 'T KNOW . I DON 'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS STUFF IS . YOU KNOW , IT LOOKS LIKE THERE 'S BEEN AN ACCIDENT AROUND HERE OR SOMETHING . THAT FIGURES . A GUY DRIVING ALONG LAST NIGHT HITS THIS THING STRETCHED ACROSS THE HIGHWAY AND ... CRACKS IT UP . SEE THE GLASS ? WOULDN 'T DO TOO GOOD FOR JOE 'S TIRES , WOULD IT ? YOU KNOW , MAYBE THAT 'S WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR OLD MAN . WHERE IS HE NOW ? OH , I WOULDN 'T WORRY ABOUT THAT , CAROL . HE 'S PROBABLY HANGING AROUND SOME GARAGE WAITING FOR A BUSTED FENDER TO GET FIXED . " TO CAROL WITH LOVE , DAD . " OK , SO HE DROPPED IT WHEN THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED . WHAT OF IT ? IF HE WAS ALL RIGHT , HE WOULDN 'T LEAVE IT LAYING HERE . AND IF HE WAS IN A GARAGE , HE 'D CALL MOTHER AND LET HER KNOW . WHAT 'S THAT DOWN THERE ? JUST AN OLD PICKUP TRUCK . THAT 'S WHAT DAD WAS DRIVING . IT 'S DAD 'S ! GOOD THING HE GOT OUT OF IT IN TIME . WHAT IF HE DIDN 'T ? DAD ! DAD ! NOW , WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO ? WELL , IF HE 'S HURT , HE COULD STILL BE AROUND SOMEWHERE . THAT 'S RIGHT . HE COULD BE , BUT HE ISN 'T . UNLESS HE WENT IN THE CAVE . OH , HE WOULDN 'T GO IN THERE . I NEVER BELIEVED THOSE STORIES ABOUT THE CAVE . MAYBE HE DOESN 'T EITHER . YOU KNOW , IT GOT PRETTY COLD LAST NIGHT . SUPPOSE HE COULDN 'T WALK FAR AND WANTED TO , WELL , KEEP WARM UNTIL HELP CAME . COME ON , LET 'S GO TAKE A LOOK . FIND ANYTHING , MIKE ? NO . DO YOU REALLY THINK HE COULD BE IN THERE ? I--I DON 'T KNOW . WAIT A MINUTE ! MAYBE I BETTER GO IN . YOU WAIT HERE . OH , BE CAREFUL . MIKE ! YOU WON 'T GO VERY FAR , WILL YOU ? PEOPLE HAVE GONE IN THERE AND NEVER COME OUT AGAIN . MIKE ! MIKE ! I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO STAY OUTSIDE . NOW , WHAT 'S THE IDEA OF FOLLOWING ME ? MIKE ? I 'M SCARED OF BEING ALONE . DO YOU SEE ANY SIGN OF HIM ? WELL , NOW , HE WOULDN 'T BE RIGHT HERE IN THE OPEN IF HE WANTED TO KEEP WARM . I 'M GOING TO GO A LITTLE FURTHER IN . I 'M GOING WITH YOU . OK . IT 'S NO USE . HE DOESN 'T SEEM TO BE IN HERE EITHER . OH , LET 'S NOT GIVE UP YET , PLEASE , MIKE . WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT GIVING UP ? WE 'RE JUST GETTING STARTED . THIS CAVE IS SUPPOSED TO GO WAY BACK INTO THAT MOUNTAIN FOREVER . DAD ! DAD ! [ ECHOING ] DAD ! [ ECHOING ] DAD ! [ ECHOING ] DAD ! [ ECHOING ] DAD ! GADS . HOW WILL WE EVER FIND HIM IN A PLACE THIS BIG ? MIKE ? LETS GO THIS WAY . DAD ! DAD ! DAD ! [ ECHOING ] DAD ! DAD . AAH ! OH , MIKE ! MIKE , I THINK WE BETTER GO BACK . I THINK YOU 'RE RIGHT . BUT I--I CAN 'T GO WITHOUT ... ALL RIGHT . WE MIGHT AS WELL LOOK A LITTLE FURTHER , I GUESS . MIKE , I CAN 'T SEE . AAH ! ARE YOU OK , CAROL ? I THINK SO . WHAT IS THIS THING WE FELL IN ? I DON 'T KNOW . IT 'S STICKY , THOUGH . HOW DO WE GET LOOSE ? I KNOW . I CAN 'T . IT 'S JUST LIKE GLUE ! YOU KNOW ... IT 'S LIKE THAT ROPEY STUFF WE FOUND UP ON THE ROAD . [ SCREECHING ] WHAT 'S THAT NOISE ? I DON 'T KNOW . IT 'S A REGULAR NET WE 'RE ON . YOU KNOW THAT ? [ SCREECHING ] THERE IT IS AGAIN . MIKE ! WHAT IS IT ? AAH ! AAH ! COME HERE ! HURRY , PLEASE ! [ SCREECHING ] I CAN 'T SAY FOR SURE WITHOUT HAVING IT ANALYZED . BUT , IT DOES LOOK LIKE A LARGE PIECE OF NATURAL SILK . WHAT DID WE TELL YOU ? BUT THAT DOESN 'T NECESSARILY PROVE THERE 'S A GIANT SPIDER . THAT PART 'S PRETTY HARD TO SWALLOW . BUT WE SAW IT ! BELIEVE ME , MY SON IS NOT IN THE HABIT OF LYING , MRS. KINGMAN . THAT ISN 'T WHAT HELEN MEANT . WHETHER WE BELIEVE THEIR STORY , OR NOT . THE MAN TO SEE ABOUT IT IS THE SHERIFF . YEAH , SURE , SEE THE SHERIFF . WE DID . HE DIDN 'T BELIEVE THEM . [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] [ RING ] SHERIFF 'S OFFICE . OH , YES , MR. KINGMAN . WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU ? OH , DON 'T GO YET . IT 'S ONLY A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER . WELL , YOU KNOW THESE TEENAGERS AS WELL AS I DO , MR. KINGMAN . YEAH , WHAT WILL THEY PULL NEXT , HUH ? HA HA HA ! SPIDERS ! I TOLD THEM TO BRING ME ONE AND I 'D BELIEVE IT . I CAN 'T SAY I BLAME YOU , SHERIFF . NATURALLY , I DIDN 'T CALL YOU UP TO GET YOU TO INVESTIGATE ABNORMAL INSECT LIFE . BUT , FLYNN 'S STILL MISSING , I BELIEVE . THE YOUNGSTERS FOUND TRACES OF HIM OUT THERE . YOU MAY BE DOING YOURSELF A FAVOR IF YOU LOOKED INTO THAT . YOU TOOK THE WORDS RIGHT OUT OF MY MOUTH , MR. KINGMAN . THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS , I 'VE GOT MY DEPUTY SANDERS OUT ROUNDING UP A SEARCH PARTY RIGHT NOW . GET HALF A DOZEN MEN . SPENCER , HASKELL , MAYBE OLD JAKE . ANYONE ELSE THAT ISN 'T BUSY . BRING THEM HERE AND I 'LL SWEAR THEM IN . YEAH , WELL , I 'LL NEED THOSE 2 KIDS WITH US TO POINT THINGS OUT . AND , UH , IF YOU WANT TO COME ALONG , TOO , THAT 'S FINE . OH , DON 'T YOU WORRY . WE 'LL BRING RIFLES , IN CASE WE RUN INTO THAT SPIDER ! ANYTHING ELSE ON YOUR MIND ? WELL , SPEAKING OF SPIDERS , ARE YOU SURE RIFLES ARE JUST THE THING ? INSECTS HAVE A PRETTY SIMPLE NERVOUS SYSTEM , SHERIFF . YOU COULD PLUG HOLES IN ONE ALL DAY AND NEVER HIT A VITAL SPOT . IF YOU WANT TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE , CALL THE PEST CONTROL PEOPLE IN SPRINGDALE . HAVE THEM SEND OUT ALL THE DDT THEY CAN FIND . GOOD . HA HA HA ! A GIANT SPIDER ! WHAT NEXT ? WELL , BRING YOUR BUG JUICE AND LET 'S GO . SAY , WHAT ARE WE USING IT ON ? DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE ? WELL , I 'VE GOT TO MIX THE DDT ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU WANT KILLED . WHAT DO I TELL HIM , PROFESSOR ? UH , SPIDERS ? A 2 TO 4 % SOLUTION IS THE USUAL DOSE . MAKE IT 50 . WHICH WAY , KIDS ? STRAIGHT AHEAD . SOME PLACE . MAKE A NICE ELK 'S HALL , YOU KNOW THAT ? YOU THINK WE 'LL FIND THAT GIRL 'S PA IN HERE ALIVE ? WE MIGHT . SPIDERS HAVE A HABIT OF STUNNING THEIR PREY WITH VENOM AND STORING THEM IN A SILK BAG UNTIL THEY 'RE READY TO FEED ON THEM . AND THEY EAT THEM UP , I SUPPOSE . NOT QUITE . THEY DRAIN THE LIQUID FROM THEIR BODIES , LEAVING ONLY THE SKIN AND BONES . MAN , WHAT A MIND YOU 'VE GOT . ALL RIGHT , LET 'S LOOK FOR FLYNN . AND DON 'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE MAN NEXT TO YOU . NO SENSE IN ANYONE GETTING LOST . JUST A MINUTE ! THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME ! YOU KNOW SOMETHING ? I HAVEN 'T SEEN A SPIDER YET . AND I DON 'T THINK WE WILL . YOU WILL IF HE 'S STILL THERE ! IT 'D BE JUST OUR LUCK , IF HE 'D MOVED INTO THE NEXT COUNTY . I DON 'T THINK YOU 'LL BE DISAPPOINTED . THERE 'S SOMETHING IN HERE , ALL RIGHT . YOU NATURALLY EXPECT TO FIND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WILDLIFE IN A CAVE . RATS , MICE , BATS , AND SO ON . BUT YOU DON 'T . THEY 'VE BEEN FRIGHTENED OUT . AH ! [ WINGS FLAPPING ] NO WILDLIFE , EH , KINGMAN ? THAT 'S ABOUT AS BIG AS THEY COME , I 'D SAY . I WOULDN 'T HANDLE IT , IF I WERE YOU . IT MIGHT HAVE RABIES . THERE . IT 'S BURIED . WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS OVER IT , SHERIFF ? AAH ! [ SOBBING ] IT 'S HER FATHER . UH , WHEN YOU GET BACK TO TOWN , MAKE OUT A CORONER 'S REPORT . JUST PUT DOWN , JACK FLYNN AS THE NAME . AND THE CAUSE OF DEATH , UH ... IT WAS THE SPIDER . DRAINED ALL THE LIQUID OUT OF HIS BODY . UH , JUST PUT DOWN CAUSE UNKNOWN . AND LET THE CORONER WORRY ABOUT THE REST . THAT 'S THE TROUBLE WITH YOU EGGHEADS . YOU JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS . I KNOW WHAT I SEE AND I SEE A DEAD MAN . BUT , UH , I DON 'T SEE ANY SPIDER . WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT . MIKE ... WHERE WAS THE WEB ? RIGHT THROUGH THERE . WAIT A MINUTE ! YOU DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE DOING . YOU--YOU CAN 'T JUST WALK IN THERE . WHY NOT ? HA HA HA ! FIND ANY GIANT SPIDERS , SHERIFF ? OH , SHUT UP ! GET THAT DDT IN HERE , QUICK ! HERE , YOU BETTER PUT THESE ON . I SUGGEST YOU SPRAY THAT WHOLE CAVERN , SO IT WILL GET HIM WHEN IT COMES BACK . [ SCREECHING ] DON 'T LEAVE ! HELP ME ! [ SCREAMING ] [ SCREECHING ] CAROL . YOU THINK IT 'D BE BETTER IF I TALKED TO YOUR MOTHER FIRST ? NO THANKS . I CAN DO IT . I REALLY BELIEVE YOU CAN . THE BOX WITH THE BRACELET . ARE YOU SURE YOU HAD IT ? IT WAS IN THIS POCKET . MAYBE I DROPPED IT IN THERE . YOU CAN 'T GO BACK THERE NOW . THE PLACE IS FULL OF GAS . WE 'LL COME BACK SOME OTHER TIME . TOGETHER . OK ? HEY , HASKELL . WHEN YOU GET BACK TO TOWN , TELL OLD WARREN TO GET RIGHT OUT HERE AND BOARD THIS ENTRANCE UP . RIGHT , SHERIFF . WELL , IF YOU DO , I 'D SUGGEST YOU PUT A BIG , WIDE DOOR IN IT . THE WHOLE WORLD IS GONNA WANT TO COME HERE AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT THING DOWN THERE . WELL , WHAT 'S YOUR IDEA ? THAT THE TOWN SHOULD CHARGE ADMISSION ? THAT ISN 'T WHAT I WAS THINKING OF . YOU KNOW WHAT WE EGGHEADS ARE LIKE , SHERIFF . WE WANNA KNOW WHY THIS , HOW COME THAT , WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER . THAT 'S A MATTER OF SCIENTIFIC INTEREST TO FIND OUT WHAT MADE THAT CREATURE TICK . WELL , IT 'S TOO LATE NOW . IT 'S DEAD . THE SPIDER IS . BUT NOT THE PRINCIPLE THAT CAUSED IT TO GROW . THAT 'S STILL FOR US TO DISCOVER . WELL , WHY BOTHER ? WE HAVE TO PUT AN END TO IT . OTHERWISE , THERE MAY BE MORE GIANT SPIDERS COMING INTO THE WORLD . THEY MAY EVEN BE HATCHING FROM THEIR EGGS IN SOME REMOTE SPOT , RIGHT NOW . YOU REALIZE HOW EASY IT WOULD BE FOR THEM TO OVERCOME US HUMANS ? THEN INSTEAD OF BEING THE HUNTERS , WE 'D BECOME THE HUNTED . THEY 'D BE OUR MASTERS . THEY 'D LIVE ON US . WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST THE SHERIFF 'S OFFICE OF RIVER FALLS DO ABOUT IT , MR. KINGMAN ? BRING THAT SPIDER UP INTO THE DAYLIGHT WHERE IT CAN BE STUDIED PROPERLY . WELL , IF YOU WANT TO DO IT , GO AHEAD . BUT LEAVE ME OUT . IT 'S NOT MY JOB , I DON 'T WANT ANY PART OF IT . OK , SHERIFF . UGLY CREATURE , ISN 'T IT ? I CAN THINK OF MORE SUITABLE SUBJECTS FOR MY CAMERA CLUB TO TAKE PICTURES OF . WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH ' EM , SEND ' EM TO THE PAPERS ? NO , JUST THE OPPOSITE . ONE BIG ADVANTAGE OF LIVING IN AN ISOLATED MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY LIKE RIVER FALLS IS NOT HAVING REPORTERS CRAWLING ALL OVER THE PLACE . YET . I 'M GOING TO SEND THESE PHOTOGRAPHS ALONG WITH A COMPLETE REPORT TO DR. BERGIN AT THE STATE U. NANCY ... WOULD YOU GET ME SOME CLOSE-UPS , PLEASE ? OH , SURE . GOOD OLE BERGIN .

I CAN 'T QUITE APPRECIATE THE HUMOR IN IT MYSELF . I SAW IT WHEN IT WAS STILL ALIVE . I EXPECT THE UNIVERSITY IS GOING TO WANT IT FOR EXPERIMENT AND DISSECTION . FRANKLY , I 'LL FEEL RELIEVED WHEN THEY COME AND TAKE IT OFF MY HANDS . I CAN 'T SAY I BLAME YOU . IT IS A LITTLE UNHANDY . IT TOOK A HOUSE MOVER FROM RIVERDALE TO GET IT HERE . COST ME HALF MY SAVINGS . BESIDES WANTING MY MONEY BACK , I 'D LIKE TO GET THE HIGH SCHOOL BOARD OFF MY NECK . SUPPOSE THE UNIVERSITY DOESN 'T GO FOR IT ? THEY 'D BETTER . YOU THINK I 'M GOING TO ALL THIS BOTHER MERELY BECAUSE I 'VE COME ACROSS A SCIENTIFIC WONDER ? NOT A BIT . SOMEWHERE IN THAT HIDEOUS CARCASS ARE THE GENES THAT CONTROL ORGANIC GROWTH . MAN HAD BETTER FIND OUT WHAT MADE THIS CREATURE SO BIG , AND FIND OUT FAST , OR WE 'RE ALL GOING TO BE IN PRETTY SERIOUS TROUBLE . USUALLY , IF NATURE PRODUCES A FREAK , IT DIES IMMEDIATELY . BECAUSE IT CAN 'T ADAPT ITSELF TO LIFE . IT 'S WHAT WE ORDINARILY CALL A BIRD SPIDER . BUT THE WONDER OF IT IS , IT 'S PERFECT , FRASER . PERFECT IN EVERY DETAIL . FRASER , YOU HURT ? ARE YOU SURE THAT THING IS DEAD ? SURE , IT 'S DEAD . HOW COME IT KICKED ME ? IT 'S JUST A MUSCULAR CONTRACTION . GALVANI 'S REACTION , IT 'S CALLED . IT OFTEN HAPPENS . NOT TO ME , IT DOESN 'T . IF IT CAN DO THAT WHEN IT 'S DEAD , I 'D SURE HATE TO MEET IT SOMEWHERE ALIVE . HEH HEH HEH . DON 'T , CAROL . I CAN 'T HELP IT , MOTHER . I KNOW . I LOVED HIM , TOO . I KEEP THINKING IT WAS MY FAULT . HOW COULD IT BE ? IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF HE HADN 'T GONE TO GET ME THAT PRESENT . NOW , I 'VE LOST IT . YOU MUSTN 'T THINK OF IT THAT WAY , CAROL .

IF WE DO DIG OUR WAY IN , WHAT 'S TO KEEP IT FROM GETTING AT US ? I DON 'T KNOW . WHAT DO YOU SAY , KINGMAN ? WE GOTTA HAVE SOME KIND OF AN EFFECTIVE WEAPON AGAINST IT , THAT 'S OBVIOUS . THAT POWER LINE ACROSS THE HILLS- - IF WE COULD BRING A CABLE OVER FROM THERE ... WHAT FOR ? LET 'S SEE IF WE CAN ELECTROCUTE THE BEAST . KNOW WHERE WE CAN FIND A QUARTER MILE OF INSULATED COPPER CABLE THIS SIDE OF SPRINGDALE ? THE PIPE IS PROBABLY EXPRESS- - SEEMS TO ME I SAW A LOT OF THAT STUFF IN THERE . YOU WANNA GO FOR IT IN THE TRUCK , SIMPSON ? YEAH . I 'M SURE YOU WOULDN 'T WASTE ANY TIME GETTING IT BACK . HOW 'S IT COMING ? NOT BAD , BUT WE HAVE PLENTY TO GO . CAROL ? CAROL ! CAROL !

HE 'S GOING TO HELP US WHEN THE CABLE GETS HERE . I THOUGHT YOU 'D BE THE ONE TO BRIEF HIM ON WHAT WE 'RE DOING . WELL , MY IDEA IS TO TIE INTO THAT POWER LINE , TAKE A COUPLE ELECTRODES INTO THE CAVE , GET THE SPIDER BETWEEN THEM , AND TURN ON THE JUICE . WE WANT TO CREATE AN ELECTRIC ARC , YOU SEE , SO IT JUMPS THROUGH ITS BODY LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING . THINK IT 'LL WORK ? IT COULD . HOW ABOUT ELECTRODES ? SIMPSON 'S BRINGING THEM . HAVE YOU GOT TOOLS AND RUBBER GLOVES ? IN MY JEEP . ALL WE NEED IS THE CABLE AND I 'M READY TO GO . THAT COULD BE SIMPSON NOW . [ SCREECHING ] [ GASPS ] LEDGE . IF WE CAN GET OUT FAR ENOUGH ON IT , THE SPIDER CAN 'T FOLLOW US . DON 'T BE SCARED , JUST HOLD ON TO ME . [ SCREAMS ] MIKE ? YEAH , WHAT ? THERE 'S NOTHING TO WALK ON OVER HERE . OK . WE CAN 'T GET BACK ! [ BANGING ] GIVE ME THAT THING . DOES THAT SOUND HOLLOW , OR AM I CRAZY ? WE BROKE THROUGH . DO YOU HEAR ME ? WE BROKE THROUGH ! HOW ARE THEY DOING DOWN THERE ? IS CAROL ALL RIGHT ? WE 'RE GOING DOWN THERE FOR NOW , MRS. FLYNN . IT MAY TAKE A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE WE FIND THEM , BUT WE 'LL SEND UP NEWS AS FAST AS WE CAN . AS SOON AS I GET DOWN THERE , PASS ALONG THE CABLE AND ELECTRODES . KEEP IT COMING . SEE THAT I HAVE PLENTY OF SLACK . NO TELLING HOW MUCH I 'LL NEED ONCE I 'M BELOW . WELL , DON 'T GO DOWN YET . WAIT FOR THE EQUIPMENT . YOU WAIT FOR THE EQUIPMENT . SEE YOU BELOW . THE REST OF YOU MEN FOLLOW THAT EQUIPMENT . CAROL ! MIKE ! CAROL ! MIKE ! HEY , CAROL , IT 'S THEM ! THEY 'RE COMING FOR US .

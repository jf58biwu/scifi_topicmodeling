 Ah , Satan , mon cher . You are late ce soir . Still looking for your girlfriend , huh ? Mademoiselle Dandelo has found another . You will never see her again . But don 't you worry . There will be others . Y en a toujours . Ne t 'en fais pas . Madame ? Yes ? Yes , who is this ? This is François Delambre speaking . Hélène ? Oh , how are you , Hélène dear ? What can I do for you ? François ... I 've killed André . I need your help . Oh , now look , Hélène . It 's past midnight . I 've had a hard day . I love you both dearly , but this sort of joke ... It 's true . I 've killed André . You killed ? But ... Please help me . Call the police and ... Come quickly ! I ... I just can 't ... Hélène ! Hélène ? - Yes ? - Monsieur François ? Gaston . I tried to call you . Something terrible has happened ! A man is dead . His head is under the press ! And I saw a woman running ... running away ! - Yes , Gaston . - It looked ... I think it was Madame Delambre ! You stay there , Gaston . I 'll get the police immediately . Atheneum Club ? Is Inspector Charas still there ? Yes , thank you . Yes , I 'll wait . Check . Sorry to interrupt , sir . There is a call for you . Thank you . - Hello . - Inspector ? This is François Delambre . You may remember we met a few times at the club . It 's just ... I 'm sorry to call you so late , but ... - Well , I 'm in terrible trouble . - Trouble , monsieur ? My sister-in-law just phoned that she 'd killed her husband , my brother , my brother André . What ? At our factory , Delambre Frères . And our night watchman called too . There is a body . Where are you , Mr. Delambre ? I 'll pick you up in a few minutes . Goodbye . You 'll have to excuse me . - Hélène lives ... - No , we ought to look here first . - But I 've got to talk to her . - I 've sent a man . She 'll be all right . It 's André . How can we raise the press ? - I 'll do it for you . - Would you like us to get one of your men ? I 'll be all right . Whenever you 're ready , monsieur . Dead about 30 minutes . - Is the downstroke fast ? - No . About the same . - No danger of it coming down again ? - No . It 's been set for 50 tons . Impact ... zero . - Zero ? - Yes . That ... that means level with the bed . - It 's never been set that way . Never . - Oh ? But that would ... squeeze the metal to nothing . It 's been set for single strokes , too . She didn 't know how to operate the press . - Are you sure this is your brother ? - Well , he ... There was a long scar on his left leg , a war wound . I 'll ... - Would you mind ? - Doctor . I can 't believe it . Can you think of a reason why she would do this ? None . Absolutely none . They were completely happy together . They have a wonderful little boy , Philippe , whom they both adore . Hélène was always so gentle . It just doesn 't make sense . André loved two things : His family and his work . It 's impossible ! - What is it , monsieur ? - The stroke count . That 's the stroke count . - I don 't understand . - Whoever did this to André ... It reads two . They did it twice ! - Twice ? - Oui , monsieur . I heard the press come down two times . - Evening , Monsieur François . - François , mon ami . Is it true ? - Yes . - Mais c 'est impossible . - Did Hélène ? - Listen , I can 't believe it . Inspector , this is our family physician , Dr. Ejoute . Inspector Charas . Your man called me . Hélène told him , so I came . - How is she ? - Quite calm now . Almost in a state of euphoria , of relief , as though she 's happy about it . - Is she insane , Doctor ? - Hélène could never have killed her husband . It 's impossible , unless she is or was insane . - Did she tell you anything ? - Nothing , except she killed him ... and how . No , nothing in her could make her do that . Nothing . Why , Inspector , I 've known her all her life . I even delivered her . - She and André were devoted to each other . - Where is Madame Delambre ? In the living room . François , I 'm sorry I called you . As you see , I could have called the police myself . - I 'm all right now . - Hélène , if there 's anything I can do ... You are the police ? Inspector Charas , Madame . Hélène , what 's going on ? - Why do you say you killed André ? Why ? - It 's all right , François . - Everything 's all right now . - Madame , would you tell us what happened ? Of course , monsieur . I killed my husband André Delambre about half an hour ago in the hydraulic press shed . You understand the gravity of the crime . You say you killed him . That means you murdered him . I killed André , yes . - Why ? - I cannot answer that question . - How did you kill him ? - With the hydraulic press . How do you operate it ? First you put on the main switch , then you set the stroke to whatever tonnage you want . You set the stroke to maximum , that is level with the table , or zero . Then you press the release button . It 's the red one . You mean you put your husband under the press ? No , Inspector . He did that himself . He put his head and his arm under the press ? Yes . Why ? I cannot answer that question . - Coffee , Inspector ? - Yes , please . - Gentlemen , would you wait for me outside ? - Yes , of course . No , thank you . Now , Madame ... You were happy with your husband . There were no mistresses . I had no lovers . We were both very happy . That is the truth . - Then why did you kill him ? - I wish to help you all I can , Inspector . But I cannot answer that question . - You pressed the button and it was all over . - Yes . - Why did you press it twice ? - Oh , it was only once . The stroke count read two . A machine cannot lie . Oh , yes ... Yes , it was twice . I was wrong . I did it twice . Why ? - Perhaps you will wait , Madame . - Of course , Inspector . - What would you advise medically , Doctor ? - Uh , rest . Maybe in a day or two her state of mind will improve . Very well . You understand the lady is under surveillance . I 'll arrange for one of our nurses to take charge of her . Thank you very much , Inspector . You can rely on me . What do you think ? Would you show me your brother 's laboratory ? Yes , of course . This way . This is the work of a madman ! There was over $ 200,000 worth of special equipment here . André was always so ... so careful of everything . - Special equipment ? What was all this for ? - Well , I don 't know . It could have been anything , any one of a dozen ideas . Well , when he 'd develop something , then he would show it to me . He was working on an idea for the air ministry . Perhaps they 'd know . I imagine electronics is a profitable field these days . Yes , very . We own the business jointly . We both have more money than we know what to do with . They had no outside interests , none , I 'm sure of it . That 's why it doesn 't make sense . You 're very attached to both of them , aren 't you ? Yes . Inspector , what does all this mean ? I 've no idea . She would tell me nothing except that she 'd killed him . There appears to be no motive , no reason , except insanity . And even that leaves several important questions unanswered . Perhaps he committed suicide . If he did , why does she say she killed him ? And why such a clumsy method ? And why involve your wife ? And she was there . She could hang for this . Poor Philippe . What will I tell him ? How does one tell a child ? Well , if I may suggest , you could look after the boy for a while . - What 's going to happen to her ? - We 'll keep her under observation . There 's plenty of time . Did your brother ever experiment with animals ? - Never . - Or insects ? Insects ? No . Though that would be funny , if ... No . Hélène and André believed in the sacredness of life . They wouldn 't harm anything . Not even a fly . Lunch , Madame . Oh , I 'm eating much too much . At this rate I 'll gain pounds . - Can I get up today ? - Ask Dr. Ejoute , Madame . Every time I ask him , he says tomorrow . You 're coming along nicely . The rest will do you good . Is Inspector Charas coming today ? He did not say , Madame . I like him . He 's been very gentle . I hope François brings that nice little boy today . What is his name ? Philippe ? Yes , Philippe . A nice boy . They think I 'm mad , don 't they ? They never tell me what they think about . Go away . Go away ! - Is it bothering you ? - No . No , it doesn 't bother me . - I 'll soon rid you of the pest . - It 's all right . Please leave it alone ! But , Nurse ! Stop it , Nurse . Stop it ! Leave it alone ! Leave it alone ! No ! No ! Whatever ? Now you get back into bed . - Let me look at the fly ! - Back into bed , Madame . Get out of my way ! Where is it ? Where ... Oh . Oh , there ... Oh ... Come on . Come on , Madame . - It 's just a common housefly . - Yes . Perhaps it symbolizes something deep in her subconscious , as the psychiatrist believes . - Mr. Delambre , do you think she 's mad ? - It 's obvious , isn 't it ? In spite of what the doctors think , I believe Mrs. Delambre 's mind is quite clear . - Even when catching flies . - How can you say that ? She must be mad . What about Philippe ? She acts as if the boy were mine and not hers . She may be trying to protect him . Perhaps she fears him , or even hates him . That 's impossible . Hélène couldn 't hate anyone . You must be out of your mind . You 're in love with her , aren 't you ? Yes . - Why didn 't you marry her ? - Because she loved my brother . I don 't think she ever noticed me . I 'm glad you 're being honest with me . You see , at first I suspected you . Me ? Why should I do such a thing ? Motive one , for his wife . Motive two , to control Delambre Electronics . What do I care about motives ? Hélène is in trouble and André 's dead . It 's a nightmare . I know now you had nothing to do with it , but I had to check , for her sake . I 'm sorry , Inspector . I 'm a fool . You 've been so patient . Forgive me . It 's just ... I understand , monsieur . Perhaps it 's I who should apologize . I have to pry into all sorts of personal things . It 's ... Well , it 's necessary , unfortunately . Thank you for coming . If there 's anything I can do to help , I will . Did you discover what André was working on ? No . The air ministry scientists have been through all his papers . They didn 't mean a thing to them . We couldn 't decipher the ashes . Nothing there either . Well , I 've delayed all I can . We 've been quite patient with the lady . I 'm afraid I shall have to ask for a warrant tomorrow . The courts can decide . Tomorrow ? The charge can only be murder . I 'm sorry for you and the boy . But I cannot conceive of any verdict except guilty ... or guilty but insane . Thank you , Yvette . - Uncle ? - Yes , Philippe ? - When 's Daddy coming home ? - Soon . - Can I see Mummy again tomorrow ? - Yes . She 's very sick , isn 't she ? Yes , Philippe , she 's very sick . Do flies live a long time ? I don 't know . Why ? Because I saw that fly Mummy was looking for again . - I didn 't know she was looking for one . - Oh , yes , she was . It 's grown quite a lot . But I recognized it all right . - Mm , this is good . - How did you recognize it , Philippe ? Its head is white instead of black and it has a funny sort of leg . - It was on your desk this morning . - Oh ? I ... I didn 't notice it . When did you first see that fly , Philippe ? The day Daddy went away . I had caught it , but Mummy made me let it go . And then later , she wanted me to find it again . She 'd changed her mind . You know how women are . Excuse me , Philippe . I won 't be a moment . Inspector Charas . Inspector Charas . - Good evening , Nurse . - Why , Mr. Delambre . Inspector Charas told me about her relapse . - How is she now ? - Resting quietly , poor lady . But , monsieur ... The inspector told me that I might speak to her for a few moments alone . - He knows I 'm here . - But he didn 't say you were coming . But he has so much on his mind . I won 't be long . Oh ! Oh , François . I didn 't hear you . - You look tired . - Oh , it 's just the office . You know . - You shouldn 't work so hard . - How are you ? I 'm fine . I feel all right . I 'm glad you came . I ... I wanted to ask you something . Of course , Hélène . Anything at all . How long do flies live ? Oh , I don 't know . I ... I think a month , two months . The fly you were looking for was in my study . Today . Did ... did you kill it ? - No . - Well , you have it with you . - Give it to me . Please , give it to me ! - Hélène , I haven 't got it here . Oh . You know now . What is this all about ? - You haven 't got it or you wouldn 't ask . - Yes , I ... I have it . It 's locked in my desk . Now tell me what happened . - No , never . André wouldn 't want me to . - I know you 're not mad . I want the truth . Either you tell me or I ... I 'm going to give it to Charas . You swear you have it ? Yes . If I tell you , will you promise to destroy it ? - I can 't do that until I know . - Then I can 't tell you anything . For your own sake you 've got to tell me . You 're all right or you ... you can be all right , perhaps . As soon as they examine it , they 'll know . - And they 'll know that you 're not insane . - No ! For Philippe 's sake , François , I beg you . Don 't you see ? I was pretending to be mad , for Philippe 's sake . Better I should be declared insane than he be the son of a woman hanged for murder . I want to know . Either you tell me now , or I give the fly to Charas . If I tell you , will you tell them ? I only want to help you . I can only do that through them . Yes ... I would tell them . Poor François . Call Charas then . I can 't tell it twice . So long as you kill the fly . You promise ? Yes . This is not a confession . Although I killed my husband , I 'm not a murderess . I simply carried out his last wish . A few months ago ... Who 's a ticklish boy ? - Why not pick on somebody your own size ? - André ! What a pleasant surprise . - Hi , Daddy . Are you gonna play with us ? - Later , Philippe . I 've got to borrow your mother for a moment . I won 't be long , I promise . I tell you what . Before you go to bed , I 'll play with you . - Promise ? - Promise . - All right , then . I 'll play with Dandelo . - Good . Be gentle with her , Philippe . - Come on . I 've got to show you something . - André ! We don 't see you for days on end ... - Now don 't argue with me . Come on . - But ... I 'd no idea you 'd made so many changes . - A completely new line of research . - Let me guess . The permanent battery . Not the portable reactor ? I 'll show you . But there must be no mention of this made to anyone . - Of course . - It 's much too important . Hélène , you 're the first to see a miracle . - Remember this ? - Oh , of course . Our wedding present from my devoted and very rich Aunt Bess . Mm-hm . The family heirloom . Hurry . Put them on . Now watch the box . You can take your goggles off now , darling . It 's gone . Come on . - It 's the same one . - Mm-hm . - Have you turned magician ? - In a way . For a split second , an infinitesimal part of a second , this was disintegrated . For one little moment it no longer existed . Only atoms traveling through space at the speed of light . Then a moment later integrated again into the shape of an ashtray . Oh , you 're joking ! Doesn 't sound possible , does it ? - But it is true . - It is impossible . - You 're playing some joke on me . - Take television . What happens ? A stream of electrons - sound and picture impulses - are transmitted through the air . The TV camera is the disintegrator . Your set unscrambles or integrates the electrons back into pictures and sound . Yes , but ... this is different . - Why ? - Well ... because it 's impossible . Fifty years ago , if my father were told he could sit in Montreal and watch a World Series in New York as it happened , he 'd say it was impossible . - This is the same principle exactly . - But it 's not the same . - This is solid . - Oh , no , it 's not . To your touch maybe it is . But in reality it 's billions of atoms which we believe are only a series of electrical impulses . You actually did this ? It 's ... it 's no trick ? No . I can transport matter - anything - at the speed of light , perfectly . Oh , of course this is only a crude beginning . But I 've stumbled on the most important discovery since man sawed off the end of a tree trunk and found the wheel . The disintegrator-integrator will change life as we know it . Think what it means . Anything , even humans , will go through one of these devices . No need for cars or railways or airplanes , even spaceships . We 'll set up matter-receiving stations throughout the world , and later the universe . There 'll never be famine . Surpluses can be sent instantaneously at almost no cost , anywhere . Humanity need never want or fear again . I 'm a very fortunate man , Hélène . I 'm a very fortunate woman . Don 't ever transmit me . I wouldn 't want to come out like this . What do you mean ? Well , it ... it doesn 't matter , does it , André ? André ... It 's perfect . Everything checks . It 's perfect . Perfect . Dandelo ! What 's the matter ? Are you hungry ? There we are ... That 's it . You won 't feel a thing , Dandelo . And tomorrow you 'll be the most famous cat in all the world . Dandelo ! Dandelo ... Hello ? Oh , François . How nice to hear you . Important ? You 're getting married . No ... No , not yet . No , I ... I think I like it this way . No , it 's just that ... Well , there 's no hurry . - Is André there ? - André ? I 've seen him about two hours in the last two weeks . He eats and sleeps in his lab . He won 't even answer the telephone . - I don 't want to eat ! - I don 't want to hear one more word . - You 're going to eat your dinner right now ! - I don 't want to eat ! Philippe 's delinquent , Dandelo 's disappeared , I 've got to go to Professor Augier 's alone ... You know how he is , Hélène . It 's just until he solves his problem , whatever it is . - Be patient . - How you men stick together . Anything I can do ? All right , François . I 'll tell him if I see him . I 've got to run now , François . Bye . Well ! Where have you been ? Listen , darling . I 'm sorry about the last couple of weeks . I had a little setback , but it 's all right now . I didn 't mind ... Well , maybe just a little . Call Augier and cancel . We 'll celebrate by ourselves . Wonderful ! I didn 't want to go anyway . Oh , François called about some equipment . - He 's sending it over . - Good . - By the time you 've changed , I 'll be ready . - Changed ? - I 've got tickets for the ballet . - The ballet ? - And we 'll eat at Tour d 'Eiffel . - Wonderful ! Now hurry . We 'll finish a delightful evening with reintegrated champagne . - Finish ? - Well , not quite . Oh ? What , then ? Well , what do you suggest ? - You 're in an unscientific mood . - You ... don 't approve ? I didn 't say that . Will the champagne be as good as ever ? Exactly the same , bubble for bubble . Here . - The label 's perfect ! - Of course . Oh ! And it 's still cold . And it 'll stay that way , until I show you something else . No , André , don 't . It might not work . I won 't allow it ! - It 'll be all right . - André , please ! Put your goggles on , darling . - It 's astounding ! It works ! - I test-ran it this morning . - It 's all right . - You 've succeeded completely ! - It 's ... it 's unbelievable ! - We 'll have to wait and see . - I 'll know in a few weeks . - I don 't understand . I have to see if it suffers from any ill effects . If it 's alive in , say , a month we 'll pronounce the experiment successful . - May I look after him ? - It 's still a her . But you can . Oh , for one whole month she 's mine . Now don 't kill her with overfeeding . It 's a little frightening , isn 't it ? Yes . The first live experiment was disastrous . - Dandelo . - Dandelo ? ! André , how could you ! She disintegrated perfectly but never reappeared . I don 't know why , even now . I redesigned the projecting device , and now it 's perfect . Well , where 's she gone ? Into space ... A stream of cat atoms . - It would be funny if life weren 't so sacred . - André , promise me one thing . No more experiments with animals . I promise you . No more experiments with animals . Oh ... It 's frightening . It 's ... like playing God . God gives us intelligence to uncover the wonders of nature . - Without the gift , nothing is possible . - Oh , André , I get so scared sometimes . The suddenness of our age . Electronics , rockets , earth satellites , supersonic flight ... and now this . Oh , it 's not so much who invents them . It 's the fact they exist . But you 're not frightened of TV , or radio or X-rays , or electricity , or that the earth is round . No , but ... everything 's going so fast . I 'm ... I 'm just not ready to take it all in . It 's ... it 's all so quick . Just do like Philippe does . Accept them as part of our normal life . They 're facts . Wonderful facts . Which brings me back to the champagne . I love you so much , André . It 's wonderful being married to you . And to you , my love . You 're the healthiest guinea pig in the whole world . André ! - You 'll catch cold . - Not today . - What are you doing ? - Oh , just looking at the sky . - Looking at God , perhaps . - You 're a strange man , André . So precise and practical , and yet so ... I don 't quite know how to put it . So aware of the infinite ? The more I know , the more sure I am I know so little . The eternal paradox . You said you were frightened by progress . I 'm filled with the wonder of it . - Spring will soon be here . - I like spring the best . All life growing , renewing itself . - It 's fantastic to be alive . - How do you mean ? Oh , I don 't know . It 's just ... I 'm just so happy to be alive , that 's all . So am I. Would you marry me again if you had your time over ? - Hm ? - I think so . Well , I 've got a lot to do . - Oh , François is coming to lunch . - Oh ? Bring him to the lab . We 'll show him now . Shall I call Professor Augier and the air ministry ? No , no . There 's no hurry . I , uh ... I don 't even know how or why parts of it work yet . It 's too important . It 's too impossible . Poor François . He 'll never believe it . Don 't stay out too long , darling . You look tired . The last thing I am is tired . - And we 're finishing with crêpes suzette . - What 's all the celebration about ? - André wants to show you something . - In the lab ? - Well , what is it ? Flat screen ? - It 's better . No more questions . Come on . I 've only been into the laboratory three times . Each time I came out with a potential fortune . Oh , dear . We won 't see him for lunch . I see what you mean . His writing gets worse and worse . Mummy ! Mummy ! - Where are you ? - Coming , Philippe . Yes , darling ? - I got something to show you . - I have something to show you . I caught such a funny-looking fly . You want to see it ? You know how your father disapproves of you catching insects . But this isn 't like any other fly I 've ever seen . It has a funny white head and sort of white leg . Now you let it go at once . Now go along , do as you 're told . Go on . Look at all that dirt you 've brought in . Best fly I ever caught . - Anything else , Madame ? - No , thank you , Emma . Good night . Shall I leave something for the master ? He didn 't touch a bite of his dinner . - Oh ? - I fetched up his tray about an hour ago . It was still outside the door . Had his favorite pastry on it too . He probably didn 't hear you knock . I 'll see if he wants anything . - Thank you . Good night , Madame . - Good night , Emma . André ? André , I 'm going to bed now . Is there anything you want ? André . " Hélène , I 've had some trouble . " Trouble ? André , what 's the matter ? Answer me . " I 'm counting on you not to lose your nerve , for only you can help me . " " I 've had a serious accident , but I 'm not in danger at the moment although it 's a matter of ... life or death . " André ! " It 's no good calling to me or saying anything . " " I can 't answer . I can 't speak . " " You 've got to do exactly and very carefully what I tell you . " " Knock three times to show you understand then fetch me a bowl of milk laced with rum . " Bowl of milk ? ! André ! - Anything I can do , Madame ? - No , I can manage . Go back to bed , Emma . Good night , Madame . " When you knock , I 'll open the door . " " Walk over to my desk and put the milk on it . " " Then go into the other lab and try to find a fly . " A fly ... " You will easily recognize it . Its head is white . " Philippe . Oh , André . " Don 't hurt it , just give it to me . " " Before you come in , you must promise to obey me implicitly . " " Do not look at me . Talking is useless . I cannot answer . " " Knock three times to show I have your promise . My life is in your hands . " You can depend on me , darling . It 's not in here . If you can 't talk , knock . Knock once for yes and twice for no . Do you understand ? We 'll find the fly tomorrow , I promise . Just as soon as it 's light I 'll start looking . Now why don 't you go to bed ? I 'll help you . No one will see you , I promise . Philippe caught a fly this morning . He said its head was white . I didn 't see it . I made him let it go . " Come back in morning . Will type explanation . " " Need you fresh and strong tomorrow . Poor darling . Sorry . " I 'm all right now , darling . Don 't worry . I 'll find that fly . Do you need anything tonight ? Darling , please try and get some sleep . Good night , darling . André ? Remember the ashtray ? I 've had a similar accident . I transmitted myself successfully yesterday . But in a second experiment , a fly which I did not notice was in the disintegrator with me . When we reintegrated our atoms were mixed . Now my only hope is to find the fly go through the machine once more with it , and pray our atoms untangle . If you can 't find it , I 'll have to destroy myself . Can I come back in ? Don 't worry , André . I 'll find that fly . It can 't be far away . But you mustn 't talk about destroying yourself . You mustn 't ! I 'll call Professor Augier and other scientists . They can help you . I ... Don 't be angry , André . I ... I only thought that ... Promise me that you won 't do anything . Let me see your face . I won 't be afraid . All right . All right , André . All right . - Flies , Madame ? - Yes . Close the windows . - Catch flies ? - I told you , Emma . A fly escaped from the lab . We 've got to find it . It 's got a white head . Mummy ! I don 't know what 's gotten into this house . Mummy ! - Look ! Caught lots of ' em . - Where is it ? - Are you sure you caught it ? - Oh , the white one . - No , I haven 't caught it yet . - I told you to find that fly ! I 'm sorry , Philippe darling . But you 've got to find it . The white one . Only the white one . - Gotcha ! - You fool ! I said catch them . Don 't kill them . I ... I 'm sorry , Emma . Please , just catch them . Madame ! There 's one in the hall . Where ? Where is it ? Oh , it 's no good , Emma . We 'll never find it . Philippe ? Make some supper , Emma , would you ? I 'm sorry . It 's ... it 's just that ... Come on , Philippe . - Go and wash for dinner , there 's a good boy . - All right , Mummy . Oh , Philippe . I see it ! Don 't move . Go and get some sugar , quick ! Give me the sugar . And close those doors . Now stay back . - Caught him ! - Good boy , Philippe ! Careful now . Oh , no . It 's in back of the curtain ! Oh , don 't harm it . Don 't hurt it . Oh , God , don 't let it get out . You try and keep it behind the curtain . I 'll get it from outside . Oh , no . Oh , God ! Please , God , don 't let it ... Don 't cry , Mummy . Please don 't cry . We 'll catch it tomorrow . Don 't worry . Please don 't worry . André ? We caught the fly today , but it escaped out into the garden . I 'll look for it again tomorrow . You eat . I 'll read this here . If you had caught the fly , you would not be reading this . I know you will never catch it now . It 's hopeless . There are things man should never experiment with . Now I must destroy everything , all evidence , even myself . No one must ever know what I discovered . It 's too dangerous . I 've thought of a way . It 's not easy , but I need your help . André ! You can still reason , André . You 've got no right to destroy yourself . You mustn 't think about it . You 've still got your intelligence . You 're still a man with a soul . You 've no right to destroy yourself ! We 'll find that fly tomorrow . I know we will . Think easy . But you 've got to give me more time . Why ? Why won 't you wait ? Then see Augier and the other scientists . They 'll do anything to help you ! I 've another idea . Remember the ashtray experiment ? Go through again . It worked before . Why ? Please try it . You 've got to try it . Please , André . For my sake . Maybe it will work . I beg you ! Oh , darling . I love you and I want you so much . Please ... please let this come out right . Hurry , darling . It will work . It has worked , hasn 't it ? You 'll be all right now . I know it 's worked ! No ! No ! No ! A strange story , Mrs. Delambre . It 's almost impossible to believe , isn 't it ? - Where are his notes ? - He destroyed them . - And the writing on the blackboard ? - I rubbed it out . I see . Well , I must be going . Thank you for telling me . Inspector , it wasn 't wrong to destroy the ... thing . A fly-headed human ? No . It wasn 't André . I couldn 't have hurt André . But I 'm glad . I 'm glad the thing is dead . I 'll see you out , Inspector . - Inspector ... - I 'll be with you in a moment . - Inspector . - Do you believe the story ? Well , it explains all the facts . The reason for the press , the fly , everything . True . But I asked you if you believed it . Oh , I 'm only a policeman , I 'm not a science fiction enthusiast . But I do not believe what she said . It ... it can 't happen . But you don 't ... Well , I mean , you didn 't know André . He was a genius in some ways . Possibly . But matter cannot be transmitted . Oh , the story is impossible ! I 'll be back at ten with a warrant for her arrest on the charge of murder . The nurse is under strict instructions not to leave her for any reason . But , Inspector , it might be the truth . It is the truth ... to her . I 'm satisfied now she 's insane . Don 't worry . She won 't hang . - Well , I 'm not satisfied . - I wish I could help you . The lady 's in need of a doctor 's care , permanently . There 's no telling whom she might attack next . Perhaps the boy . But there must be something we can do to prove ... There is . Show me the fly . - Good morning , monsieur . - Good morning , Emma . - How 's the mistress , sir ? - Oh , as well as can be expected . - Such a lovely lady . - Yes . Emma , when you had that ... that mad search for a fly , did you see it ? - Oh , yes . I saw it . - What did it look like ? Oh , just a fly . I 'd say it was a bluebottle . You know , quite a large one . - But it ... Did it look any different ? - Not to me it didn 't . She and Philippe were saying its head was white . But it was just a fly . - Thank you . - May I fix you breakfast , sir ? - A nice cup of tea ? Some coffee ? - No ... No , thank you . Help ! Help me ! Help me ! Help ! Help me ! Please help me ! Help me ! - We can manage , thank you , Mr. Delambre . - Well , I ... I thought I ought to be here . You wish to check the warrant ? As next of kin you have the right . No , I 'm ... I 'm sure it must be all right . Madame ? Time to get up now . Oh ... Mm , I slept so well . Wonderfully . Is it a nice day ? Yes . - I think I 'll have the silk one . - Take this one . - You must be warm . - But I 'm not going out . Come in . Good morning , Mrs. Delambre . Inspector . But I ... I don 't understand . I have a warrant for your arrest for murder . And I must caution you , anything you say can be taken down and used in evidence . - But , Inspector , I told you everything . - It is for the court to decide . But you said it was not wrong to ... to kill a thing . - You have to come with us , Madame . - François , didn 't you show them ? You didn 't destroy it ? - Inspector , you saw it . - I 'm afraid I did not , Mrs. Delambre . I lied to you , Hélène . I never had it . I never had it . You never had it ? - If you 'll just come with us , Madame . - You never saw it ? Leave her alone . She doesn 't have to go with you . I demand that I have time to talk to my attorney . Dr. Ejoute will care for her . I have consulted him . The patient is ready to leave . - I don 't believe it . - I have his diagnosis and his authority . - No , wait . Wait ! - Don 't make things more difficult , monsieur . - Here you go , ma 'am . You 'll be all right . - No , François . Don 't let them take me ! Don 't let them lock me up ! François , please ! - Mummy ! - Oh ! Philippe . Oh , François , do something . Don 't let him see me like this ! Please ! Philippe . You can 't see her , Philippe . Not at the moment . I 'll ... I 'll take you for a walk . I know . I 'll take you to the movies . - But they don 't open till this afternoon . - Well , then I 'll take you this afternoon . Is the ambulance for Mummy ? Yes . Is she going to be all right ? Yes ... All right . - I ran all the way over here . - Oh ? I wanted to see how she was . I wanted her to play with me . She 'd like that , Philippe . But she can 't , not now . - When 's Daddy coming home then ? - Soon , Philippe . - I saw that funny-looking fly again . - Oh ? - Which show will we go to ? - Any ... You saw the fly ? Where ? It 's in a web . The spider 's going to get it . By the bench in the garden . - You 're sure ? - Oh , yes . Stay here a minute . - Inspector , it 's in the garden ! - Please , monsieur . Philippe has seen it ! It 's there . I beg of you , please . Please ! All right . Show me where . Here , Uncle François . Wait in the house . There 's a good boy , Philippe . Help me ! Please help me ! Help ! Go away ! No ! Please help me ! Please go away ! Go away ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Charas ... Charas ! I didn 't believe it . But you saw it . You saw it , didn 't you ? Yes , I ... I saw it . I thought she was ... As God is my witness , I saw the thing . It 's unbelievable . I shall never forget that scream as long as I live . You 've committed murder just as much as Hélène did . You killed a fly with a human head . She killed a human with a fly head . - If she murdered , so did you . - I know . But who 's going to believe us ? They 'll think we 're both mad . But ... he could have started the press and got under it in time . It ... it could have been suicide . André 's mind was deranged . Hélène just tried to stop him . But the stroke count . I was the one who forgot to reset it ... after it was used the last time . Yes . Yes ... It could have been suicide . Oh ! A great shot , Philippe . - Oh , François . - Hello . You look wonderful . - Thank you . - Hi , Uncle François . - You taking me to the zoo ? - Yes , if your mother doesn 't ... You run along . We 'll have dinner together later . Oh , good . - Uncle ? - Yes ? Mummy told me about Daddy . Something she said to ask you . Why did he die ? Well , Philippe ... he died because of his work . He was like an ... like an explorer in a wild country where no one had ever been before . He was searching for the truth . He almost found a great truth . - But for one instant he was careless . - That 's what killed him ? Search for the truth is the most important work in the whole world . - And the most dangerous . - I 'd like that . I 'd like to be an explorer like him . Will you help me , Uncle François ? Yes , Philippe . - You 'd better run and get a coat . - Yes . Right away . You 're a dear one , François . So kind and thoughtful . Thank you . - Here I am . - Well , come along , you two . I 'll see you off .

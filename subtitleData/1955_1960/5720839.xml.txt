 CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT Narrator : IN THE DAYS WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG AND THE GODS HAD NOT YET ABANDONED THE RACE OF MEN , THERE LIVED IN THE LAND OF THE NORTH A GREAT AND STALWART PEOPLE . WHEN THEIR OWN ROCKY SHORES AND FORBIDDING MOUNTAINS COULD NO LONGER YIELD THEM A LIVELIHOOD , THEY BAD FAREWELL TO THEIR WOMEN AND VENTURED FEARLESSLY INTO THE UNKNOWN . AFTER WAITING FOR THEIR WARRIORS ' RETURN 3 YEARS , A BAND OF BRAVE WOMEN GATHERED TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY SHOULD EMBARK ON A SEARCH FOR THEIR MEN . THEY CAST THEIR VOTES IN TYPICAL VIKING FASHION . Woman : I VOTE WE GO ! WE STAY . NO . YES . THYRA , THE GODS HAVE BEEN OFFENDED . IT 'S AN OMEN OF DISASTER . THAT 'S ENOUGH . I 'M ASHAMED OF THE WOMEN OF STONJOLD . THIS WAS YOUR PROPOSAL , DESIR , NOT OURS . DO YOU WISH TO DIE UNLOVED , WOMEN WITHOUT MEN ? WE CANNOT GO AGAINST OUR FATE . THE GODS ARE ANGRY . THE GODS ARE ANGRY ONLY AT THOSE WHO COWER IN FEAR ! VIKINGS MAKE THEIR OWN FATE . WOMEN OF STONJOLD , HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE OUR MEN SAILED ACROSS THE SEA ? HOW LONG HAVE WE WAITED ON THE COLD CLIFFS FOR A SIGHT OF THEIR RETURNING SAIL ... IN VAIN ? IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK THE MAIDENS OF STONJOLD TO HELP THEIR PEOPLE ? IF YOU NEED AN OMEN ... LOOK ! OUR MEN BECKON . THEY NEED US AS WE NEED THEM . THYRA , YOU VOTE TO GO , YET YOU HAVE NO LOVER OVER SEA . AM I LIKELY TO FIND ONE HERE ? YOU MUST DECIDE FOR YOURSELF , LITTLE SISTER . TO PLEASE HER SISTER , ASMILD WILL DESTROY US ALL . MAYBE NOT . SEE WHO 'S CASTING THE DECIDING SPEAR . HOW DO YOU THINK OUR DARK PRIESTESS WILL VOTE ? SHE 'LL VOTE AGAINST HER . SHE HATES DESIR AND WANTS HER MAN . Woman : SHE VOTED TO GO ? SHOULDN 'T SHE BE ON OUR SIDE ? THANK YOU , ENGER . I WANT NO THANKS . THE DECISION 'S MADE . COME . THERE 'S WORK TO BE DONE . I DON 'T TRUST HER . AREN 'T YOU GLAD SHE VOTED TO GO ? YES , BUT WHY DID SHE DO IT ? OH , OTTAR , YOU 'RE ALWAYS SO SUSPICIOUS . I 'M GLAD SHE 'S WITH US . DESIR , I 'M GOING WITH YOU . NO , OTTAR . THERE 'S NO NEED FOR YOU TO TAKE THE RISK . I SPOKE BRAVE WORDS , BUT I KNOW WE FACE GREAT DANGER . WELL , IT 'S A STRANGE DAY WHEN ENGER THE DARK AIDS THE CAUSE OF DESIR . SHE HAD A GOOD IDEA . OH , COME , MY DEAR , DON 'T TELL ME YOU 'D DO ANYTHING TO HELP DESIR . I THINK I UNDERSTAND . IF AT THE END OF THE VOYAGE , VEDRIC HOLDS OUT HIS ARMS AND HIS FLAXEN-HAIRED BEAUTY IS NOT THERE TO ENFOLD IN THEM , PERHAPS THE CHIEF WILL LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR COMFORT . THOSE MAY BE YOUR THOUGHTS , DAGDA , BUT I SAID NOTHING . THERE 'S A WAVE ! HOLD IT ! AAH ! QUICK ! GET THAT OAR IN THE WATER ! THERE . NOW STEADY THE BOW ! GIVE ME YOUR ARM . COME ON .

WHERE 'S THE FOOD ? HELP YOURSELF . BOY , THAT TASTES GOOD . OTTAR , WHY DID YOU STOW AWAY ? SOMEBODY HAS TO PROTECT YOU WOMEN . IT 'S RIDICULOUS NOT TO HAVE A MAN ALONG ON A DANGEROUS VOYAGE . IT 'S RIDICULOUS NOT TO HAVE A MAN . THYRA ? MMM ? WHEN I SAW YOU , I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER FOR ME . LUCKY I RECOGNIZED YOU IN TIME . I 'D HAVE HAD MY DAGGER IN YOUR THROAT . I DIDN 'T MEAN THAT . IT 'S JUST THAT I ... I DIDN 'T THINK YOU 'D PROTECT ME FROM ENGER THE WAY THAT YOU DID . YOU 'VE ALWAYS SEEMED SO FORBIDDING THAT I 'VE ALMOST BEEN AFRAID TO TALK TO YOU .

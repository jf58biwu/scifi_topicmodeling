 Mrs. Barton ? Why , yes . You 're the guide , Mr. Grant . No , he 's Grant . Hi . I 'm Tom Morgan . Oh , you 're Dr. Morgan ? And Dr. Borg . How do you do ? Doctor . Morgan , genetics . Borg , roentgenology . Johnson , biochemistry . Johnson 's in the lab . My husband never gave faces to any of you , just name and occupation . That 's the way most medical men describe most medical men . But he didn 't say much about you . I guess your field isn 't medicine . Only through marriage . Dr. Barton . Dr. Morgan . Dr. Barton . Dr. Borg . Grant . You met Mrs. Barton . I had some difficulty persuading her to come . She felt she might be in the way . Not at all , Doctor . Would you like to go to your cabin , Mrs. Barton ? Thank you . Is the lab ready ? Everything 's ready for me . My equipment 's set up . You better check to see that everything you want is there . Dr. Barton ? Good morning , Captain . Whenever you 're ready to cast off , sir . Thank you . Stand by . Now let 's take a look at the lab , Dr. Morgan . Hello , Dr. Barton . Johnson ... Dr. Johnson . Very good ! Very good , indeed , Dr. Morgan . I had no idea you could arrange surgical instruments this well . Genetics may be my specialty , but I 'm also a doctor . I didn 't mean to offend . It 's just unusual these days ... to find such fidelity to doing things exactly right . Thank you . It 's unfortunate that Mr. Grant ... couldn 't tell us the exact location of what we 're looking for . I told you it was in the Everglades . I 'll get you close enough . The rest 'll be up to you . Have you explained to Grant the technique we intend to use ? Not yet . The big trick will be to maneuver him to still water ... where this liquid rotonone compound , when spread under pressure , can anesthetize him in a matter of seconds , providing , of course , we can give him a concentrated dose . Don 't look so doubtful . It 's worked before . You know , gentlemen , I 've seen the drug used by the natives ... to catch fish up the Amazon . But I 'll have to see this first to believe it 'll knock out 300 pounds of the deadliest ... Dr. Barton speaking . Everything 's ready and secured , sir . All right , Captain . Get underway . That was a school of barracuda . Their length varies from five to five and a half feet . Is this gadget your idea , Doc ? Not exactly . Similar machines are being manufactured by a few of the big electronic firms . Works like the sonar device that commercial fishing outfits use to spot schools of fish . The Scandinavian countries , New England , California ... They all use them . The electronic waves move to the object in the water ... and bounce back . The time lapse between sending and receiving gives us the distance . Takes all the kick outta fishing if you know what 's there in the water . On this particular trip , we 'd better know what 's in the water . And we will because these devices also reveal the exact specie of fish . You see those new , slightly arced lines ? Giant rock lobster . Unmistakable . Of course , we can 't be sure what sort of image we 'll get on the scope ... when we find what we 're looking for ; however , we can make an educated guess . Grant , put on the lights , please . Sure . Excuse me . Of course . The thicker the mass , the lighter the image on the screen . Based on information from Ocean Harbor in Florida , the length of the creature on the screen should be ... about half a centimeter more than that of the average male adult . What was that ? Marcia ! Shark ! Got two of 'em . They were after a school of porpoise . That 's good shooting . But not good hunting . There 's no risk involved . I 've hunted all over the world . Anytime you wanna match me ! Marcia , dear , this is one hunting trip ... where you 'll have to be more of a spectator than a participant . Dr. Barton ? Yes . We 'll be dropping anchor in a few minutes , sir . Oh , fine . Your husband must be an awfully good surgeon ; I mean , uh , awfully rich . Because he 's financing this ? Oh , no ! Even a beach bum like me knows it 's deductible from his income tax . I mean , awfully rich to be able to afford , uh , everything he owns . Anybody home ? Si , senores ? Senor Grant , entre , por favor . Buenas dias . Senor Grant , welcome . Morteno , my friend . Thank you for the food , the money . That 's all right . Glad to do it . Listen , Morteno , these gentlemen are my friends . I want you to tell Dr. Barton ... the story of how you were hurt . These men are going to help me catch him . Bueno . When did the creature attack you ? How ? Where ? I am in Everglades to shoot alligators to get skins . I sell Senor Grant , who buys for men who make belts and shoes in city . One day , after long hunt , I shoot something near me . It raised up and grabbed my gun ! Parecia el diablo . It looked like devil , fighting me . I take my knife . I fight back . I cut ' im good . Animal malvado . There was plenty blood . Then devil go away and I not remember more ... till people from village find me . When I wake up , I am cripple , face torn . My village try to hunt it down , but it is smart . Not like man . Smart like devil ! Well , that 's the story , gentlemen . The last place he was seen was off the coast . I 'll take you there . Where is the knife that you used to fight this devil ? Est√° bien . May I have a look ? What about it , Johnson ? The red corpuscle count checks with the Ocean Harbor figures . Thirty-five percent . Halfway between the count in mammals ... and marine life vertebrae : Nature moving out of one phase into another . Are the corpuscles beveled ? No . Then the blood type is of a marine life animal , right , Johnson ? Except there 's no nucleus to each corpuscle . There ! Gentlemen , the creature can be changed . We can make the giant step , and bring a new species into existence . - No . - Why ? Because it hasn 't been done ? We can create an entirely new form of life . We can change the blood texture , build up the red corpuscle count , then the gene structure has to be affected ! I didn 't know you wanted that kind of experiment . I thought we were only going to subject him to study under more controlled conditions . There 'll never be another chance like this . I 've seen the imperfections of the human body . A surgeon sees them and knows . Modern man is limited , earthbound to this planet which he devours ... and eventually which will fail to support him . Yet , he 's bound to it because he 's physically incapable ... of taking the next giant step ... into outer space . Well , we can make him physically capable . I disagree . We can learn from nature , help nature . We can make this earth a happier place by helping nature select what 's best in us . And when man 's ready , mentally , physically , he 'll get to outer space . But , Doctor , there 's no shortcut . You can 't bypass nature . Perhaps you 're afraid to ! If you are , I could take you all back and assemble a new group . No , I 'm staying . I want to know for myself . Yes ! I do too . Good ! Now ... Can I talk to you on this throat mike ? No , but we can talk to Dr. Borg . He can talk to both of us . Remember , locate your position and be sure of your approximate distance from any object . I 'll call down my identification . You verify . Hey , you gonna wait for me ? This dive is to test the equipment . You 'll have to wait for another time . We might go deep . Fifty feet ? This might be 150 feet . The worst that can happen is that I won 't like it and my ears will hurt . The worst that could happen is that you might get deep-diving sickness . They call it " raptures of the deep . " Like getting drunk ... on water pressure instead of champagne , and you try to give your equipment to a passing fish ? I never get drunk . I always know when I 've had enough . What 's the harm ? We 'll take care of her . I told you , no . I 'm tired of just sitting around . That 's fine . I 've got it . Thank you . Anybody gonna join me ? Grant ! You better use one of these too . I don 't need a gadget to tell me how deep to go . I know myself . If you 're wrong , it won 't be the first time , but it 'll be the last . All right , Borg . Let 's pick ' em up on the scope . There they are . Do you check me ? I check you . What 's that ? Check to the right by 20 feet . A tarpon weighing approximately 100 pounds . It was a tarpon . Approximate distance correct . Well , we 're going deeper . Check me . Directly below you ... a grouper fish or a large manta . Check . A fish directly below us ... and moving out . He 's still there . No , he isn 't . I can see him moving up and going off to the right . The fish is out of the picture but there 's another image . The density has changed considerably . What is it ? I can 't ... There 's nothing visible from here . We 're going deeper . The image is moving with you . The object is moving down . The image is off the screen . Something 's blocking it from view . Two hundred and ten feet . Probably a rock shelf . What happened , Morgan ? She went too deep . I 'm all right . How is she ? No harm done . No thanks to you , Grant . Well , you 've had quite a bit of excitement , you three . The image , the big object , did you see it ? It 's him , all right . - It 's your creature , Dr. Barton . - You found him ! Well , you came through for me , Grant . Now , gentlemen , I guess the rest is up to us . The creature isn 't going to be easy to capture . He knows how to fight us . There 's nothing to do for the moment except wait . And hope we can keep track of him . We 'll all have to be armed from now on . Yes , we 'd better . I 'm sorry I made so much trouble . You 're a very brave woman . You shouldn 't take such chances . Taking chances isn 't just a man 's privilege . Trying to kill oneself isn 't either . You take risks . I take calculated risks for a purpose . But what are you trying to prove ? I should 've known ! You 're a scientist . You need proof . You never take anyone 's word for anything . I deserved that . Forgive me . If there 's anything I can do ... No . No , there 's nothing anyone can do . Ten years ago , when I was 17 , when Dr. Barton married me I ... I 'm really feeling sorry for myself now , aren 't I ? Look , I 've managed to learn a few things . At least I know what the world under the sea looks like . It can be very beautiful . - Pardon me , but I have to prepare for dinner . - Yes . Well , I have some work to do . Excuse me , Mrs. Barton . You were with Dr. Morgan for quite a long time . Please , don 't start again , Bill . Don 't start accusing me ... You 're my wife , Marcia . Conduct yourself that way . I always have , Bill . I don 't know any other way . Don 't ever try to leave me . Don 't ever try to make a fool of me . Dr. Johnson , what 's your reading now ? The image is about 30 feet ahead of us . Veering 20 degrees left . Veering 20 degrees left . We 're getting into shallow water . I don 't like it . We can still go a long ways upstream . We 'll get him this time . He 's boxing himself into a corner . Could be the other way around . Not a chance . He knows his way around places like this . He 's dropping back of us . Reduce speed . Yes , sir . Dr. Johnson , what 's your reading now ? About 30 feet astern , but he seems to be holding his position at that distance . He 's following us . He 's stalking us now . Captain , increase the speed . Yes . The image is dropping back . Now it seems to be moving forward . He 's following us at the same distance again . He 's following us at the same distance again . - It doesn 't seem possible ! - The lion , the wolf , the shark , they stalk and wait for the kill . They sense when their victim is coming into a trap . He 's more than cunning . He reasons . Well , I 'm not going into a trap . You 'll take him alive ! If he lets us . If he gets too close , I 'm not gonna argue . I 'll kill him . When do you think he 'll attack ? I don 't know . But he led us into this river . Probably when we can 't move forward any further . This is as far as we can go . Drop anchor . Now we 'll wait for him . What do you think , Dr. Morgan ? It 's apparent he doesn 't intend to attack on our terms . No . We 'll have to go after him on his . We 'll take the viewer with us , Borg . Johnson , lower the range finder into the water . Grant , are your spears checked ? There 's enough sleep juice in one of these things to knock out an elephant . Well , the rotonone checks out . We 'd better review procedure . If he comes within toxic distance , Dr. Borg will signal and I 'll discharge the rotonone . If he comes aboard , Grant will try to get him with a spear . Grant , remember , the object is to capture him , not to kill him . Try not to hit a vital area . As far as using the guns , if we have to , we 'll be defeating our own purpose . So , I guess that 's it . He 's moving ahead of us . What was that ? Turn a bit to the left . There ! No , farther . Farther ! He 's making a full turn ! Grant , get the torches . We 've gotta have some light ! I think they 're dry . Let me have them . I 'll fill them with gasoline . Borg , you see anything ? No , not yet . Grant ! Be on the lookout ! Twenty feet ahead . He 's coming at us ! What are you shooting at , you fool ? I want him alive ! He 's at the right ! Look out , Morgan ! He 's coming at you ! Behind you ! Another one , Grant ! Are you all right ? I 'm all right . I hit my head against something . Watch out ! The drug knocked him out , all right . If it hadn 't , the fire would 've . These are third-degree burns . We 'd better get the boat over here . Bring the boat . He isn 't converting enough air into oxygen . If only we could reopen the gills and immerse him in water . The gills are too badly burned . He 's dying of suffocation . But so slowly . He 's getting a small air supply from some area . We were right ! There is a perfect lung formation . It shows much darker than average . They could be partially collapsed . What 's that light patch at the opening to the lungs ? Not a typical human formation . Some African lungfish use gills in rainy season . When the lakes dry up , their lungs open on reflex . A flap pulls back to let air in . He 's getting very little oxygen . We 've got to get those lungs inflated and working again . We 'll do a tracheotomy immediately . Respiration falling . Increase the oxygen . Now the tracheotomy tube . We are changing a sea creature into a land creature . We only used what nature offered . The lungs were there . We didn 't make them . You 'll see , Dr. Morgan . Just don 't move too fast trying to change him . Are you afraid of unknown things ? I 'm only afraid of misusing what I do know . Move him ... then administer a sedative . What was the last reading ? I 'm taking one more . Here 's the reading . The charting hasn 't varied much . This gap here and here , they show a disconnected thought process . He had a critically low supply of oxygen to the brain for more than an hour . It could have caused permanent injury . Ready for a reading . Morgan ! The metabolism rate shows several sharp changes . It was the method of breathing . By opening the lungs . We should have known ! The step from fish to amphibian to mammal , it had to be the method of converting oxygen . Take a look at the eyes . It 's a basic mutation , the major change . Unresponsive . That is correct . Please send the following wire ... to Mr. Edward Brown , foreman , Barton Ranch , Sausalito ... Saus-a-lito , California . " Going through canal tomorrow . " Arrival estimated on or about August 20th . " All fences and equipment must be ready . " Hire extra men , if necessary . Will need large truck . Signed , William Barton . " Thank you . Am I disturbing you ? No , Mrs. Barton . Would it be possible for me to see the ... I 'm sorry . I 'd like to let you into the room , but ... your husband doesn 't think it 's advisable . My husband doesn 't think very much is advisable , except his work . How 's it coming ? Hasn 't he told you ? No , not much of anything lately . Excuse me . We 're taking the bandages off today . Excuse me . Is that all you do , is ... talk ? No . I like to swim too . Doctor , look . The other one . Dr. Borg , raise the head . There it is , Doctor . The fire burned away the outer scale . There 's a structure of human skin underneath it : Two separate coverings , the way he had lungs and gills . Well , his sensitivity to pain is increasing . He needs some outer protection , some clothing that would ... It 's taking effect . You better prepare another dose . Well , Tom , I think this calls for a celebration . Oh , what about the clothing ? We 'll let Grant and the ship hands take care of that . He 's under sedation . Where is Grant ? Grant ! Grant ! Where were you ? What do you mean , where was I ? You didn 't need me . You and the other doctors were with him . I went on deck for a second . Never mind . I 've got some work for you . Go in the locker and get some sailcloth . Let 's see if you 're up on your needlework . Needlework ? Clothing for the creature . That was the point of the story . I missed it completely . You did ? How about a second ? No more , thanks . You 're trying to get me drunk . I 've had my quota . Are you sure ? I 'm sure . Come now ! A celebration isn 't a celebration ... if you use such self-control . It takes a lot of this stuff to even slow me down . How about you ? No , thank you . Alcohol hits some people faster than others because of metabolism , rate of absorption and ... you know . Change metabolism and maybe , uh ... Maybe eliminate drunk drivers . That 's not bad for me , is it ? We don 't have much laughter anymore , do we , Marcia ? Tom , we 've found the secret . Change the metabolism and man will change . Maybe . The demonstrable scientific fact is in that cabin . I 'd rather not argue the point now , Doctor . Let 's take it up some other time . A celebration isn 't ... Don 't be condescending . If I can discuss it , don 't you evade it . All right . As a geneticist , I know , the way any geneticist does , that nature hasn 't created a new , major type of animal on this earth ... for over 400 million years . The creature 's a different major type . You saw it yourself . It 's the interaction ofheredity and environment ... for millions of years that makes a new species . We changed the skin , not the animal . But we can bring out the best or worst in any living thing . Environment does that . If it threatens him , if he 's afraid of us , he 'll revert to the wanton killer . That 's why I 've gone along with you . I want to know for myself , 'cause we all stand between the jungle and the stars at a crossroads . We 'd better discover what brings out the best in humankind ... and what brings out the worst ... because it 's the stars or the jungle . Well , good night , gentlemen , Mrs. Barton , Doctor . Good night . How is he ? I don 't know . Take a look . Good night , Grant . Good night . I guess I 'll turn in too . Do you agree with Dr. Morgan ? It can still go either way . And you , Doctor ? I don 't know yet . Good night . Good night . Good night . " The jungle or the stars . " The fools ! Can 't they see I want to catch a star ? Such a good wife . Such a dutiful wife . You straighten up after parties , you drinks serve ... serve drinks ! You 're such a fine wife ! Don 't ! Bill , please ! Please what ? Please trust you ? Don 't , Marcia . You 're worthless , useless ! You know , the more reason you 've got to be friendly , the less friendly you get . You have a vivid imagination , Mr. Grant . Just because I haven 't spoken to my husband ... Come on , Marcia . Let 's be friends . Being a friend of yours isn 't going to solve my problems . Can 't you understand that ? No . Tell me again . Please ! Will you stop ? They 'll hear us . Okay then , tell me quietly . Please let me go , Grant ! Let me go , will you ? Grant , please let me go ! Please stop , Grant . Please , let me go ! Let go ! Johnson , call the bridge ! Tell them reverse engines and stand by ! Grant , you all right ? Why weren 't you at the door ? Look ! He 's going to jump . He 'll die underwater . He 'll use his lungs and drown . I 'll use the hose , Grant . Give me plenty of oxygen . Follow them on the scope , Borg . Right . The spaces here are the ones to watch . This is the first reading we took . The spaces between each peak are narrower . Much narrower . The block to his memory is lifting . You see ? He isn 't reverting . He isn 't reverting . He 's remembering . To what degree ? All he remembers is that he was part of the water once , and he went back to it , that 's all . He remembers being attacked ... by us . He remembers fear . And when he 's afraid , he tries to kill anything near him , animal or human . Stand clear . You think of everything , don 't you , Doctor ? Yes . Let 's go in . Do as I say . Go back to your room . I don 't want to stay ... I 'm not going to have you parading around in front of men ! You wouldn 't mind if I drive into San Francisco ? If I can find the time , I 'll take you for a drive myself . Until then , do as I say . Go into the house ! Sorry to have kept you waiting . This is a two-way mirror . We can see him , but he can 't see us . He hears the water but he doesn 't remember it . He doesn 't even know that if he returned to the water he 'd drown . His gills may grow back . Never . His features , his skin , they 're more like a human 's every day . He 's even lost the need for violence . Because we 've treated him kindly . The change is biological , not psychological . Forget the technical terms . It 's kindness , not pain . You mean he returns kindness with kindness ? I believe it . Do you think that 's always true ? Do you think that if I give kindness , I can always get kindness in return ? How do you mean ? Oh , come , Dr. Morgan , you 're a very perceptive man . I 'd rather not talk about it . It isn 't any of my business . Clinically , as a scientist , you should be interested . Imagine how often love is returned with hate ... and loyalty is returned with infidelity . Is that a proven fact ? I only deal in facts , in reality , only that . We make our own reality sometimes . The facts are that when love is returned with hate , loyalty is returned with infidelity , how long does it take before something has to be done about it ? Like what ? What do you mean ? Since we 're talking about people ... Are we , Doctor ? I thought we were talking about animals , about the creature . All right , about the creature . If he thinks all men are his enemy , if he can 't see things the way they are , instead of the way he thinks they are , he lives in terrible fear . He 's only an animal . The same holds true for man . If man , or animal , becomes too terrified to think , he resorts to violence . In the animal world , it 's called the law of the jungle . But when it happens to human beings , its name is murder . That 's very nice . Thank you . I didn 't know you could play the guitar . Well , I ... I used to . When you had more reason ? What is it ? Your husband , he 's a ... a very brilliant man . I 'm sure you know that . Yes . But he 's a deeply ... I believe the clinical definition is a " disturbed " man . I tried to tell you . I don 't know what my motives are for telling you this , but your husband needs help . He isn 't the kind that accepts help ... because he never admits he 's wrong . Besides , what can I do ? You 're his wife . It would take a great deal of courage . Maybe just patience . No , Dr. Morgan , courage . And I don 't have that kind of courage anymore . Swimming is wonderful . Someone once said it was ... it was like being born again . I can understand why the creature never wanted to leave the water . We all have to leave the past sometime if life is going to mean anything . Maybe . Maybe it 's too late too leave it ... for some people . As a matter of fact , I think I 'll take a swim right now . Well , be careful , Marcia . What were you talking to Morgan about ? Excuse me . What were you talking about ? Please , you 're hurting me . I have a right to ask these questions . I 'm your husband . I 'm going swimming . You 've become a cheap little tramp . Only to you , Bill . Only to you . Two minds with a single thought . - Uh , swimming , I mean . - Go away . I thought you liked company . Not yours . How can you tell ? We 're just getting to know each other . What was it , Morgan ? I don 't know . I thought I heard a bobcat . A mountain lion 's more like it . This is his first act of violence since we captured him . Yes , his first killing . We 'll have to get those dead animals out of his sight . The creature is what he was . I don 't think he reverted . I think he killed the lion defending himself . Oh ... yes . Get up ! Pack your clothes and get out ! Okay , but I 'll leave in the morning . Now ! Or I 'll have you thrown out ! Hurry up ! What 's botherin ' ya , Doc ? Your wife ? Get out ! Oh , it must be your wife , Doc . Shut up and get out . Okay . But it could 've been any guy she 'd get friendly with . She hates ya that much . No ! No ! Well , our experiment 's over and it 's failed . The beast remains a beast . I don 't think so . The creature moved a step forward . He didn 't attack until he was attacked . He killed a real enemy . And Barton ? He killed an enemy of his own creation . The whole world was his enemy . We 're not so far from the jungle after all . We 're not so far from the stars , either . The way we go depends upon what we 're willing to understand about ourselves . And willing to admit . Good-bye , Dr. Johnson . Good-bye . Dr. Borg , thank you for everything . Mrs. Barton . Are you ready to leave ? Yes . The officer 's taking me to the train . We 'll arrange everything here . Will I see you again ? Yes , of course . Yes ? Right . Got it . There 's an all-points call out on him . They sighted him five miles west of here , heading for the coast .

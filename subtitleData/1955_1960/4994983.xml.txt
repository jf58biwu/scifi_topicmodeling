 Ah , Satan , mon cher . You are late ce soir . Still looking for your girlfriend , huh ? Mademoiselle Dandelo has found another . You will never see her again . But don * t you worry . There will be others . Y en a toujours . Ne t * en fais pas . Madame ? Yes ? Yes , who is this ? This is Francois Delambre speaking . Helene ? How are you , Helene dear ? What can I do for you ? Francois ... I * ve killed Andre. I need your help . Oh , now look , Helene . It * s past midnight. I * ve had a hard day . I love you both dearly , but this sort ofjoke ... lt * s true. I * ve killed Andre . You killed ... ? But ... Please help me . Call the police and ... Come quickly ! I just can * t ... Helene ! Helene ? - Yes ? - Monsieur Francois ? Gaston . I tried to call you . Something terrible has happened ! A man is dead . His head is under the press ! And I saw a woman running ... running away ! - Yes , Gaston . - lt looked ... I think it was Madame Delambre ! You stay there , Gaston . I * ll get the police immediately . Atheneum Club ? is Inspector Charas still there ? Yes , thank you . Yes , I * ll wait . Check . Sorry to interrupt , sir . There is a call for you . Thank you . - Hello . - Inspector ? This is Francois Delambre . You may remember we met a few times at the club . It * s just ... I * m sorry to call you so late , but ... - Well , I * m in terrible trouble . - Trouble , monsieur ? My sister-in-law just phoned . She killed her husband , my brother , my brother Andre . What ? At our factory , Delambre Freres . And our night watchman called too . There is a body . Where are you , Mr Delambre ? I * ll pick you up in a few minutes . Goodbye . You * ll have to excuse me . - Helene lives ... - No , we ought to look here first . - But I * ve got to talk to her . - l * ve sent a man . She * ll be all right . It * s Andre . How can we raise the press ? - l * ll do it for you . - Would you like us to get one of your men ? I * ll be all right . Whenever you * re ready , monsieur . Dead about 30 minutes . - ls the downstroke fast ? - No . About the same . - No danger of it coming down again ? - No . It * s been set for 50 tons . lmpact zero . - Zero ? - Yes . That means level with the bed . It * s never been set that way . Never . But that would squeeze the metal to nothing . It * s been set for single strokes , too . She didn * t know how to operate the press . - Are you sure this is your brother ? - Well , he ... There was a long scar on his left leg , a war wound. I * ll ... - Would you mind ? - Doctor . I can * t believe it . Can you think of a reason why she would do this ? None . Absolutely none . They were completely happy together . They have a wondertul little boy , Philippe , whom they both adore . Helene was always so gentle . It just doesn * t make sense . Andre loved two things : his family and his work . It * s impossible ! - What is it , monsieur ? - The stroke count . That * s the stroke count . - l don * t understand . - Whoever did this to Andre ... lt reads two . They did it twice ! - Twice ? - Oui , monsieur . I heard the press come down two times . - Evening , Monsieur Francois . - Francois , mon ami. ls it true ? - Yes . - Mais c * est impossible . - Did Helene ... ? - Listen , I can * t believe it . Inspector , this is our family physician , Dr Ejoute. Inspector Charas . Your man called me . Helene told him , so I came . - How is she ? - Quite calm now . Almost in a state of euphoria , of relief , as though she * s happy about it . - ls she insane , Doctor ? - Helene could never have killed her husband . It * s impossible , unless she is or was insane . - Did she tell you anything ? - Nothing , except she killed him and how . No , nothing in her could make her do that . Nothing . Why , Inspector , I * ve known her all her life . I even delivered her . - She and Andre were devoted to each other . - Where is Madame Delambre ? In the living room . Francois , I * m sorry I called you . As you see , I could have called the police myself . - l * m all right now . - Helene , if there * s anything I can do ... You are the police ? Inspector Charas , madame . Helene , what * s going on ? - Why do you say you killed Andre ? Why ? - lt * s all right , Francois . - Everything * s all right now . - Madame , would you tell us what happened ? Of course , monsieur . I killed my husband Andre Delambre about half an hour ago in the hydraulic press shed . You understand the gravity of the crime . You say you killed him . That means you murdered him . I killed Andre , yes . - Why ? - l cannot answer that question . - How did you kill him ? - With the hydraulic press . How do you operate it ? First you put on the main switch , then you set the stroke to whatever tonnage you want . You set the stroke to maximum , that is level with the table , or zero . Then you press the release button . It * s the red one . You mean you put your husband under the press ? No , Inspector . He did that himself . He put his head and his arm under the press ? Yes . Why ? I cannot answer that question . - Coffee , Inspector ? - Yes , please . - Gentlemen , would you wait for me outside ? - Yes , of course . No , thank you . Now , madame . You were happy with your husband . There were no mistresses. I had no lovers . We were both very happy . That is the truth . - Then why did you kill him ? - l wish to help you all I can , Inspector . But I cannot answer that question . - You pressed the button and it was all over . - Yes . - Why did you press it twice ? - Oh , it was only once . The stroke count read two . A machine cannot lie . Oh , yes . Yes , it was twice . I was wrong. I did it twice . Why ? - Perhaps you will wait , madame . - Of course , Inspector . - What would you advise medically , Doctor ? - Rest . Maybe in a day or two her state of mind will improve . Very well . You understand the lady is under surveillance . I * ll arrange for one of our nurses to take charge of her . Thank you very much , Inspector . You can rely on me . What do you think ? Would you show me your brother * s laboratory ? Yes , of course . This way . This is the work of a madman ! There was over $ 200,000 worth of special equipment here . Andre was always so careful of everything . - Special equipment ? What was all this for ? - Well , I don * t know . It could have been anything , any one of a dozen ideas . Well , when he * d develop something , then he would show it to me . He was working on an idea for the air ministry . Perhaps they * d know . I imagine electronics is a profitable field these days . Yes , very . We own the business jointly . We both have more money than we know what to do with . They had no outside interests , none , I * m sure of it . That * s why it doesn * t make sense . You * re very attached to both of them , aren * t you ? Yes. Inspector , what does all this mean ? I * ve no idea . She would tell me nothing except that she * d killed him . There appears to be no motive , no reason , except insanity . And even that leaves several important questions unanswered . Perhaps he committed suicide . If he did , why does she say she killed him ? And why such a clumsy method ? And why involve your wife ? And she was there . She could hang for this . Poor Philippe . What will I tell him ? How does one tell a child ? Well , if I may suggest , you could look after the boy for a while . - What * s going to happen to her ? - We * ll keep her under observation . There * s plenty of time . Did your brother ever experiment with animals ? - Never . - Or insects ? Insects ? No . Though that would be funny , if ... No . Helene and Andre believed in the sacredness of life . They wouldn * t harm anything . Not even a fly . Lunch , madame . Oh , I * m eating much too much . At this rate I * ll gain pounds . - Can I get up today ? - Ask Dr Ejoute , madame . Every time I ask him , he says tomorrow . You * re coming along nicely . The rest will do you good . is Inspector Charas coming today ? He did not say , madame . I like him . He * s been very gentle . I hope Francois brings that nice little boy today . What is his name ? Philippe ? Yes , Philippe . A nice boy . They think I * m mad , don * t they ? They never tell me what they think about . Go away . Go away ! - ls it bothering you ? - No . No , it doesn * t bother me . - l * ll soon rid you of the pest . - lt * s all right . Please leave it alone ! But , Nurse ... ! Stop it , Nurse . Stop it ! Leave it alone ! Leave it alone ! No ! No ! Whatever ... ? Now you get back into bed . - Let me look at the fly ! - Back into bed , madame . Get out of my way ! Where is it ? Oh , there . Come on . Come on , madame . - lt * s just a common housefly . - Yes . Perhaps it symbolises something deep in her subconscious , as the psychiatrist believes . - Mr Delambre , do you think she * s mad ? - lt * s obvious , isn * t it ? In spite of what the doctors think , I believe Mrs Delambre * s mind is quite clear . - Even when catching flies . - How can you say that ? She must be mad . What about Philippe ? She acts as if the boy were mine and not hers . She may be trying to protect him . Perhaps she fears him , or even hates him . That * s impossible . Helene couldn * t hate anyone . You must be out of your mind . You * re in love with her , aren * t you ? Yes . - Why didn * t you marry her ? - Because she loved my brother . I don * t think she ever noticed me . I * m glad you * re being honest with me . You see , at first I suspected you . Me ? Why should I do such a thing ? Motive one , for his wife . Motive two , to control Delambre Electronics . What do I care about motives ? Helene is in trouble and Andre * s dead. lt * s a nightmare . I know now you had nothing to do with it , but I had to check , for her sake . I * m sorry , lnspector. I * m a fool . You * ve been so patient . Forgive me. lt * s just ... I understand , monsieur . Perhaps it * s i who should apologise . I have to pry into all sorts of personal things . It * s ... Well , it * s necessary , unfortunately . Thank you for coming. lf there * s anything I can do to help , I will . Did you discover what Andre was working on ? No . The air ministry scientists have been through all his papers . They didn * t mean a thing to them . We couldn * t decipher the ashes . Nothing there either . Well , I * ve delayed all I can . We * ve been quite patient with the lady . I * m afraid I shall have to ask for a warrant tomorrow . The courts can decide . Tomorrow ? The charge can only be murder . I * m sorry for you and the boy . But I cannot conceive of any verdict except guilty , or guilty but insane . Thank you , Yvette . - Uncle ? - Yes , Philippe ? - When * s Daddy coming home ? - Soon . - Can I see Mummy again tomorrow ? - Yes . She * s very sick , isn * t she ? Yes , Philippe , she * s very sick . Do flies live a long time ? I don * t know . Why ? Because I saw that fly Mummy was looking for again . - l didn * t know she was looking for one . - Oh , yes , she was . It * s grown quite a lot . But I recognised it all right . - Mm , this is good . - How did you recognise it , Philippe ? Its head is white instead of black and it has a funny sort of leg . - lt was on your desk this morning . - Oh ? I didn * t notice it . When did you first see that fly , Philippe ? The day Daddy went away. I had caught it , but Mummy made me let it go . And then later , she wanted me to find it again . She * d changed her mind . You know how women are . Excuse me , Philippe. I won * t be a moment . Inspector Charas . Inspector Charas . - Good evening , Nurse . - Why , Mr Delambre . Inspector Charas told me about her relapse . - How is she now ? - Resting quietly , poor lady . But , monsieur ... The inspector told me that I might speak to her for a few moments alone . - He knows I * m here . - But he didn * t say you were coming . But he has so much on his mind . I won * t be long . Francois , I didn * t hear you . - You look tired . - lt * s just the office . You know . - You shouldn * t work so hard . - How are you ? I * m fine. I feel all right . I * m glad you came . I wanted to ask you something . Of course , Helene . Anything at all . How long do flies live ? I don * t know. I think a month , two months . The fly you were looking for was in my study . Today . Did you kill it ? - No . - Well , you have it with you . - Give it to me . Please , give it to me ! - Helene , I haven * t got it here . You know now . What is this all about ? - You haven * t got it or you wouldn * t ask . - Yes , I have it . It * s locked in my desk . Now tell me what happened . - No , never . Andre wouldn * t want me to . - l know you * re not mad. I want the truth . Either you tell me or I * m going to give it to Charas . You swear you have it ? Yes . If I tell you , will you promise to destroy it ? - l can * t do that until I know . - Then I can * t tell you anything . For your own sake you * ve got to tell me . You * re all right or you can be all right , perhaps . As soon as they examine it , they * ll know . - And they * ll know that you * re not insane . - No ! For Philippe * s sake , Francois , I beg you . Don * t you see ? I was pretending to be mad , for Philippe * s sake . Better I should be declared insane than he be the son of a woman hanged for murder . I want to know . Either you tell me now , or I give the fly to Charas . If I tell you , will you tell them ? I only want to help you . I can only do that through them . Yes. I would tell them . Poor Francois . Call Charas then. I can * t tell it twice . So long as you kill the fly . You promise ? Yes . This is not a confession . Although I killed my husband , I * m not a murderess . I simply carried out his last wish . Who * s a ticklish boy ? - Why not pick on somebody your own size ? - Andre ! What a pleasant surprise . - Hi , Daddy . Are you gonna play with us ? - Later , Philippe . I * ve got to borrow your mother for a moment . I won * t be long , I promise . I tell you what . Before you go to bed , I * ll play with you . - Promise ? - Promise . - All right , then. I * ll play with Dandelo . - Good . Be gentle with her , Philippe . - Come on. I * ve got to show you something . - Andre ! We don * t see you for days on end ... - Now don * t argue with me . Come on . - But ... I * d no idea you * d made so many changes . - A completely new line of research . - Let me guess . The permanent battery . Not the portable reactor ? I * ll show you . But there must be no mention of this made to anyone . - Of course . - lt * s much too important . Helene , you * re the first to see a miracle . - Remember this ? - Of course . Our wedding present from my devoted and very rich Aunt Bess . The family heirloom . Hurry . Put them on . Now watch the box . You can take your goggles off now , darling . It * s gone . Come on . It * s the same one . - Have you turned magician ? - ln a way . For a split second , an infinitesimal part of a second , this was disintegrated . For one little moment it no longer existed . Only atoms travelling through space at the speed of light . Then a moment later integrated again into the shape of an ashtray . Oh , you * re joking ! Doesn * t sound possible , does it ? - But it is true . - lt is impossible . - You * re playing some joke on me . - Take television . What happens ? A stream of electrons - sound and picture impulses - are transmitted through the air . The TV camera is the disintegrator . Your set unscrambles or integrates the electrons back into pictures and sound . Yes , but this is different . - Why ? - Well , because it * s impossible . Fifty years ago , if my father were told he could sit in Montreal and watch a World Series in New York as it happened , he * d say it was impossible . - This is the same principle exactly . - But it * s not the same . - This is solid . - No , it * s not . To your touch maybe it is . But in reality it * s billions of atoms , which we believe are only a series of electrical impulses . You actually did this ? It * s no trick ? No. I can transport matter - anything - at the speed of light , pertectly . Of course this is only a crude beginning . But I * ve stumbled on the most important discovery since man sawed off the end of a tree trunk and found the wheel . The disintegrator-integrator will change life as we know it . Think what it means . Anything , even humans , will go through one of these devices . No need for cars or railways or airplanes , even spaceships . We * ll set up matter-receiving stations throughout the world , and later the universe . There * ll never be famine . Surpluses can be sent instantaneously at almost no cost , anywhere . Humanity need never want or fear again . I * m a very fortunate man , Helene . I * m a very fortunate woman . Don * t ever transmit me . I wouldn * t want to come out like this . What do you mean ? Well , it doesn * t matter , does it , Andre ? Andre ... lt * s pertect . Everything checks . It * s pertect . Pertect . Dandelo ! What * s the matter ? Are you hungry ? There we are . That * s it . You won * t feel a thing , Dandelo . And tomorrow you * ll be the most famous cat in all the world . Dandelo ! Dandelo ... Hello ? Francois , how nice to hear you . Important ? You * re getting married . No . No , not yet . No , I think I like it this way . No , it * s just that ... Well , there * s no hurry . - ls Andre there ? - Andre ? I * ve seen him about two hours in the last two weeks . He eats and sleeps in his lab . He won * t even answer the telephone . - l don * t want to eat ! - l don * t want to hear one more word . - You * re going to eat your dinner right now ! - l don * t want to eat ! Philippe * s delinquent , Dandelo * s disappeared , I * ve got to go to Professor Augier * s alone . You know how he is , Helene. lt * s just until he solves his problem , whatever it is . - Be patient . - How you men stick together . Anything I can do ? All right , Francois. I * ll tell him if I see him. I * ve got to run now , Francois . Bye . Well ! Where have you been ? Listen , darling . I * m sorry about the last couple of weeks . I had a little setback , but it * s all right now . I didn * t mind . Well , maybe just a little . Call Augier and cancel . We * ll celebrate by ourselves . Wondertul ! I didn * t want to go anyway . Oh , Francois called about some equipment . - He * s sending it over . - Good . - By the time you * ve changed , I * ll be ready . - Changed ? - l * ve got tickets for the ballet . - The ballet ? - And we * ll eat at Tour d * Eiffel . - Wondertul ! Now hurry . We * ll finish a delighftul evening with reintegrated champagne . - Finish ? - Well , not quite . Oh ? What , then ? Well , what do you suggest ? - You * re in an unscientific mood . - You don * t approve ? I didn * t say that . Will the champagne be as good as ever ? Exactly the same , bubble for bubble . Here . - The label * s pertect ! - Of course . And it * s still cold . And it * ll stay that way , until I show you something else . No , Andre , don * t . It might not work. I won * t allow it ! - lt * ll be all right . - Andre , please ! Put your goggles on , darling . - lt * s astounding ! It works ! - l test-ran it this morning . - lt * s all right . - You * ve succeeded completely ! - lt * s unbelievable ! - We * ll have to wait and see . - l * ll know in a few weeks . - l don * t understand . I have to see if it suffers from any ill effects. lf it * s alive in , say , a month , we * ll pronounce the experiment successful . - May I look after him ? - lt * s still a her . But you can . For one whole month she * s mine . Now don * t kill her with overteeding . It * s a little frightening , isn * t it ? Yes . The first live experiment was disastrous . - Dandelo . - Dandelo ! Andre , how could you ! She disintegrated pertectly but never reappeared. I don * t know why , even now . I redesigned the projecting device , and now it * s pertect . Well , where * s she gone ? into space . A stream of cat atoms . - lt would be funny if life weren * t so sacred . - Andre , promise me one thing . No more experiments with animals . I promise you . No more experiments with animals . It * s frightening. lt * s like playing God . God gives us intelligence to uncover the wonders of nature . - Without the gift , nothing is possible . - Andre , I get so scared sometimes . The suddenness of our age . Electronics , rockets , earth satellites , supersonic flight , and now this . It * s not so much who invents them . It * s the fact they exist . But you * re not frightened of TV , or radio , or X-rays , or electricity , or that the earth is round . No , but everything * s going so fast . I * m just not ready to take it all in . It * s all so quick . Just do like Philippe does . Accept them as part of our normal life . They * re facts . Wondertul facts . Which brings me back to the champagne . I love you so much , Andre . It * s wondertul being married to you . And to you , my love . You * re the healthiest guinea pig in the whole world . Andre ! - You * ll catch cold . - Not today . - What are you doing ? - Oh , just looking at the sky . - Looking at God , perhaps . - You * re a strange man , Andre . So precise and practical , and yet so ... I don * t quite know how to put it . So aware of the infinite ? The more I know , the more sure I am I know so little . The eternal paradox . You said you were frightened by progress . I * m filled with the wonder of it . - Spring will soon be here . - l like spring the best . All life growing , renewing itself . - lt * s fantastic to be alive . - How do you mean ? I don * t know. lt * s just ... I * m just so happy to be alive , that * s all . So am I . Would you marry me again if you had your time over ? I think so . Well , I * ve got a lot to do . Francois is coming to lunch . Bring him to the lab . We * ll show him now . Shall I call Professor Augier and the air ministry ? No . There * s no hurry. I don * t even know how or why parts of it work yet . It * s too important. lt * s too impossible . Poor Francois . He * ll never believe it . Don * t stay out too long , darling . You look tired . The last thing I am is tired . - And we * re finishing with crepes suzette . - What * s all the celebration about ? - Andre wants to show you something . - ln the lab ? - Well , what is it ? Flat screen ? - lt * s better . No more questions . Come on . I * ve only been into the laboratory three times . Each time I came out with a potential fortune . Oh , dear . We won * t see him for lunch . I see what you mean . His writing gets worse and worse . Mummy ! Mummy ! - Where are you ? - Coming , Philippe . Yes , darling ? - l got something to show you . - l have something to show you . I caught such a funny-looking fly . You want to see it ? You know how your father disapproves of you catching insects . But this isn * t like any other fly I * ve ever seen . It has a funny white head and sort of white leg . Now you let it go at once . Now go along , do as you * re told . Go on . Look at all that dirt you * ve brought in . Best fly I ever caught . - Anything else , madame ? - No , thank you , Emma . Good night . Shall I leave something for the master ? He didn * t touch a bite of his dinner . I fetched up his tray about an hour ago . It was still outside the door . Had his favourite pastry on it too . He probably didn * t hear you knock . I * ll see if he wants anything . - Thank you . Good night , madame . - Good night , Emma . Andre ? Andre , I * m going to bed now . is there anything you want ? Andre . * * Helene , I * ve had some trouble . * * Trouble ? Andre , what * s the matter ? Answer me . * * l * m counting on you not to lose your nerve , for only you can help me . * * * * l * ve had a serious accident , but I * m not in danger at the moment , although it * s a matter of life or death . * * Andre ! * * lt * s no good calling to me or saying anything . * * * * l can * t answer. I can * t speak . * * * * You * ve got to do exactly and very carefully what I tell you . * * * * Knock three times to show you understand , then fetch me a bowl of milk laced with rum . * * Bowl of milk ? Andre ! - Anything I can do , madame ? - No , I can manage . Go back to bed , Emma . Good night , madame . * * When you knock , I * ll open the door . * * * * Walk over to my desk and put the milk on it . * * * * Then go into the other lab and try to find a fly . * * A fly . * * You will easily recognise it . Its head is white . * * Philippe . Oh , Andre . * * Don * t hurt it , just give it to me . * * * * Before you come in , you must promise to obey me implicitly . * * * * Do not look at me . Talking is useless. I cannot answer . * * * * Knock three times to show I have your promise . My life is in your hands . * * You can depend on me , darling . It * s not in here . If you can * t talk , knock . Knock once for yes and twice for no . Do you understand ? We * ll find the fly tomorrow , I promise . Just as soon as it * s light I * ll start looking . Now why don * t you go to bed ? I * ll help you . No one will see you , I promise . Philippe caught a fly this morning . He said its head was white . I didn * t see it . I made him let it go . * * Come back in morning . Will type explanation . * * * * Need you fresh and strong tomorrow . Poor darling . Sorry . * * I * m all right now , darling . Don * t worry . I * ll find that fly . Do you need anything tonight ? Darling , please try and get some sleep . Good night , darling . Andre ? Remember the ashtray ? I * ve had a similar accident . I transmitted myself successfully yesterday . But in a second experiment , a fly which I did not notice was in the disintegrator with me . When we reintegrated our atoms were mixed . Now my only hope is to find the fly , go through the machine once more with it , and pray our atoms untangle . If you can * t find it , I * ll have to destroy myself . Can I come back in ? Don * t worry , Andre . I * ll find that fly. lt can * t be far away . But you mustn * t talk about destroying yourself . You mustn * t ! I * ll call Professor Augier and other scientists . They can help you . Don * t be angry , Andre. I only thought that ... Promise me that you won * t do anything . Let me see your face. I won * t be afraid . All right . All right , Andre . All right . - Flies , madame ? - Yes . Close the windows . - Catch flies ? - l told you , Emma . A fly escaped from the lab . We * ve got to find it. lt * s got a white head . Mummy ! I don * t know what * s gotten into this house . Mummy ! - Look ! Caught lots of * em . - Where is it ? - Are you sure you caught it ? - Oh , the white one . - No , I haven * t caught it yet . - l told you to find that fly ! I * m sorry , Philippe darling . But you * ve got to find it . The white one . Only the white one . - Gotcha ! - You fool ! I said catch them . Don * t kill them . I * m sorry , Emma . Please , just catch them . Madame ! There * s one in the hall . Where ? Where is it ? Oh , it * s no good , Emma . We * ll never find it . Philippe ? Make some supper , Emma , would you ? I * m sorry. lt * s just that ... Come on , Philippe . - Go and wash for dinner , there * s a good boy . - All right , Mummy . Oh , Philippe . I see it ! Don * t move . Go and get some sugar , quick ! Give me the sugar . And close those doors . Now stay back . - Caught him ! - Good boy , Philippe ! Careful now . Oh , no . It * s in back of the curtain ! Don * t harm it . Don * t hurt it . Oh , God , don * t let it get out . You try and keep it behind the curtain . I * ll get it from outside . Oh , no . Oh , God ! Please , God , don * t let it ... Don * t cry , Mummy . Please don * t cry . We * ll catch it tomorrow . Don * t worry . Please don * t worry . Andre ? We caught the fly today , but it escaped out into the garden . I * ll look for it again tomorrow . You eat. I * ll read this here . If you had caught the fly , you would not be reading this . I know you will never catch it now . It * s hopeless . There are things man should never experiment with . Now I must destroy everything , all evidence , even myself . No one must ever know what I discovered . It * s too dangerous . I * ve thought of a way . It * s not easy , but I need your help . Andre ! You can still reason , Andre . You * ve got no right to destroy yourself . You mustn * t think about it . You * ve still got your intelligence . You * re still a man with a soul . You * ve no right to destroy yourself ! We * ll find that fly tomorrow. I know we will . Think easy . But you * ve got to give me more time . Why ? Why won * t you wait ? Then see Augier and the other scientists . They * ll do anything to help you ! I * ve another idea . Remember the ashtray experiment ? Go through again. lt worked before . Why ? Please try it . You * ve got to try it . Please , Andre . For my sake . Maybe it will work. I beg you ! Darling , I love you and I want you so much . Please , please let this come out right . Hurry , darling. lt will work . It has worked , hasn * t it ? You * ll be all right now. I know it * s worked ! No ! No ! No ! A strange story , Mrs Delambre . It * s almost impossible to believe , isn * t it ? - Where are his notes ? - He destroyed them . - And the writing on the blackboard ? - l rubbed it out . I see . Well , I must be going . Thank you for telling me . Inspector , it wasn * t wrong to destroy the thing . A fly-headed human ? No . It wasn * t Andre. I couldn * t have hurt Andre . But I * m glad. I * m glad the thing is dead . I * ll see you out , Inspector . - Inspector ... - l * ll be with you in a moment . - Inspector . - Do you believe the story ? Well , it explains all the facts . The reason for the press , the fly , everything . True . But I asked you if you believed it . Oh , I * m only a policeman , I * m not a science fiction enthusiast . But I do not believe what she said . It can * t happen . But you don * t ... Well , I mean , you didn * t know Andre . He was a genius in some ways . Possibly . But matter cannot be transmitted . The story is impossible ! I * ll be back at ten with a warrant for her arrest on the charge of murder . The nurse is under strict instructions not to leave her for any reason . But , Inspector , it might be the truth . It is the truth to her . I * m satisfied now she * s insane . Don * t worry . She won * t hang . - Well , I * m not satisfied . - l wish I could help you . The lady * s in need of a doctor * s care , permanently . There * s no telling whom she might attack next . Perhaps the boy . But there must be something we can do to prove ... There is . Show me the fly . - Good morning , monsieur . - Good morning , Emma . - How * s the mistress , sir ? - As well as can be expected . - Such a lovely lady . - Yes . Emma , when you had that mad search for a fly , did you see it ? - Oh , yes. I saw it . - What did it look like ? Oh , just a fly. I * d say it was a bluebottle . You know , quite a large one . - But did it look any different ? - Not to me it didn * t . She and Philippe were saying its head was white . But it was just a fly . - Thank you . - May I fix you breakfast , sir ? - A nice cup of tea ? Some coffee ? - No , thank you . Help ! Help me ! Help me ! Help ! Help me ! Please help me ! Help me ! - We can manage , thank you , Mr Delambre . - Well , I thought I ought to be here . You wish to check the warrant ? As next of kin you have the right .

Yes . - l think I * ll have the silk one . - Take this one . - You must be warm . - But I * m not going out . Come in . Good morning , Mrs Delambre . Inspector . But I don * t understand . I have a warrant for your arrest for murder . And I must caution you , anything you say can be taken down and used in evidence . - But , Inspector , I told you everything . - lt is for the court to decide . But you said it was not wrong to kill a thing . - You have to come with us , madame . - Francois , didn * t you show them ? You didn * t destroy it ? - Inspector , you saw it . - l * m afraid I did not , Mrs Delambre . I lied to you , Helene . I never had it. I never had it . You never had it ? - lf you * ll just come with us , madame . - You never saw it ? Leave her alone . She doesn * t have to go with you . I demand that I have time to talk to my attorney . Dr Ejoute will care for her . I have consulted him . The patient is ready to leave . - l don * t believe it . - l have his diagnosis and his authority . - No , wait . Wait ! - Don * t make things more difficult , monsieur . - Here you go , ma * am . You * ll be all right . - No , Francois . Don * t let them take me ! Don * t let them lock me up !

Yes , I saw it. I thought she was ... As God is my witness , I saw the thing . It * s unbelievable. I shall never forget that scream as long as I live . You * ve committed murder just as much as Helene did . You killed a fly with a human head . She killed a human with a fly head . - lf she murdered , so did you . - l know . But who * s going to believe us ? They * ll think we * re both mad . But he could have started the press and got under it in time . It could have been suicide . Andre * s mind was deranged . Helene just tried to stop him . But the stroke count . I was the one who forgot to reset it , after it was used the last time . Yes . Yes. lt could have been suicide . A great shot , Philippe . - Francois . - Hello . You look wondertul . - Thank you . - Hi , Uncle Francois . - You taking me to the zoo ? - Yes , if your mother doesn * t ... You run along . We * ll have dinner together later . Oh , good . - Uncle ? - Yes ? Mummy told me about Daddy . Something she said to ask you . Why did he die ? Well , Philippe , he died because of his work . He was like an explorer in a wild country where no one had ever been before . He was searching for the truth . He almost found a great truth . - But for one instant he was careless . - That * s what killed him ? Search for the truth is the most important work in the whole world . - And the most dangerous . - l * d like that . I * d like to be an explorer like him . Will you help me , Uncle Francois ? Yes , Philippe . - You * d better run and get a coat . - Yes . Right away . You * re a dear one , Francois . So kind and thoughftul . Thank you . - Here I am . - Well , come along , you two . I * ll see you off .

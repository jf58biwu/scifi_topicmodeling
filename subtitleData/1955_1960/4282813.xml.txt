 While the mysterious hull found in the pit at Knightsbridge is being investigated by Professor Quatermass and his colleagues , a black-magic pentacle is discovered inside it . And a terrified sapper sees a dwarf-like figure pass through the wall . When an attempt is made to pierce a sealed compartment with a borazon drill , frightful sounds break out , demoralising and shocking the drilling party and sending Quatermass with Dr Roney on a search for early records of the place . As far as these go back , Hobbs Lane has been periodically haunted by sounds and hideous small shapes . Meanwhile , Colonel Breen finds a hole has appeared , as if melted in the closed bulkhead and through it an eye can be seen . With the hole to provide a purchase , the inner port is turned opened . The demons ! It 's all right . They 're dead . They 've been dead for a long time . Roney ! - What are they ? - Whatever they are , they 're decomposing fast . - Roney , I think this is a job for you . - Yes . Yes . Barbara , phone the museum and tell Klein to bring supports and sprays quickly . Give me a hand here . What 's in there , miss ? She 's got the wind up . I think I can ... Got it . What in heaven 's name ? Like a colossal insect ! In some ways ... more like a crab . - Yes , that 's the smell . Like rotting fish ! - Or locusts . - Quatermass , do you mind here ? - I can 't guarantee my stomach ! You can almost see it decomposing . I 'm sorry , sir . I think I 'd better go out ... All right , go on , get out . There seem to be legs . Three of them . It 's a tripod . That 's a strange formation . Antennae like a beetle 's . Where is that girl ? Look out for her , will you ? - What do you mean , insects ? - What sort of insects ? - I don 't know . They were big . - But you say they were dead ? Sarge ... you mean they 've been dead a long time ? - I don 't know . - But we ... we dug that thing up . - I don 't know , Gibson ! - Sir , what 's in there ? What are they ? - Let me help . He 's yelling for that stuff . - Take these . Give me that tray . Quickly ! - Keep it level . It 's leaking . - Yes . - Use number four 's plating fluid . - Is it safe ? We 've got to take a chance . Camera ! I want to use that in there before I get the others out . - You 're going in there ? - There 's no time to lose . Be careful of those ... those membranes . They may be some sort of instrument . Instruments ? Your imagination 's running wild ! Yes . Isn 't yours ? This one 's lying in some kind of a frame . If they were human , I 'd call that a bunk . Dr Roney ! - How long have these things been dead ? - I told you . I 'm asking him ! Pass me another tray . If ... If they 'd been dead more than a few years , they 'd have decomposed completely ? All the decomposition has been in the last hour . - That makes no sense ! - Don 't bother me now , please ! That compartment was sealed . If the things inside were completely sterile , without bacteria , they 'd be free from corruption . - Even if they were dead ? - Yes . They could be in there for a million years . Remain as they are unchanged until our atmosphere got in . Filthy London air . - Then they 'd rot as they have done . - Quatermass ! Dr Klein , this way , sir , please . All right , but they should have been here now . These things are disintegrating ! They 're here now . Klein , I 'm glad to see you ! Look here . - What are they ? How did you get hold of ? - No questions now . Get those boxes ready ! - How is that one ? - Not good . If you can just try to save the horny shell . Keep the body fluids separate and correctly described . Klein , come here . We 've only got two of them . - Professor ? - Hmm ? - Sorry to disturb you . - Oh , Fullalove . What 's in there now ? Those ... Those membranes and ... these . - It goes to powder . - Yes . Seems to be some sort of mineral substance . Do you , er ... Do you think it grew there like stalactites ? No , I think it was put there . These remind me of something , something I 've seen , photographs . - Of course , nerve endings ! - What ? Nerves ? Yes , if you see them enormously magnified , then the fibres terminate in this way . Those ... those creatures ... Could they ... Could they have belonged to this Earth ? No . Take external measurements , then compare them with the internal over the whole structure . I want every single cubic inch of space accounted for . Who 's this ? - Quatermass , who 's this man ? - James Fullalove , " Evening Gazette " . - How did he get in here ? Did you bring ? - Not exactly . - He 's got no business here ! - I think I have . Stop talking past me ! The military has jurisdiction here . There 's no bomb . We don 't have to protect the public , just inform them . Thanks . Colonel Breen , I 'd be glad of your expert opinion , too ... Get out ! Potter , get him out of here ! - Sir . Sergeant ! - Now look here , Breen ... I am in charge here and I want that man off this site immediately ! Sergeant , take him and escort him to the barrier ! Take him ! - Take him ! - Come along , sir . That was a mistake . A bad one , Breen . Don 't tell me what to do ! I 'm not gonna stand by while you feed wild theories to the gutter press ! There 's been enough nonsense talked about this thing already . Dead millions of years ! I know the smell of death and how long it lasts ! - Have you got a theory ? - Yes , I have ! - Are you going to share it ? - In my own time . You won 't be able to keep THOSE a secret for long . Jacko , be tough about it . You 've got to get these pictures in . Take it easy , James . Yes , sir , which headline ? Sam ! I 'll go and talk to him again . Sure . It 's that small head . " War Office Hushes It Up . " I 've still got the marks from being bounced through that barrier ! Is he scared ? - He thinks it 's not strong enough ! - Oh . Well , what about " Terror Stalks Whitehall " ? - These creatures are dead ? - He was scared . - Who ? - This Colonel Breen . " Blimp Blunders . " - Too personal . - I feel personal . " Fullalove ... Beats ... Army ... Ban . " How 's that ? Set it , Sam . Oh , nice late edition ! Apemen found ! Monster insects ! Get your " Gazette " ! Thank you . Monster insects found . Get your " Gazette " ! Read all about it ! They 've got them in the museum now . You can 't get in , but you can read all about it . " Gazette " ! I 'm sorry , the museum is closed . There 's no statement to make . This was the bad one ? Yes . That 's why we set it up that way . Seemed less danger of damaging the legs . Very dry and brittle . All soft parts and fluids were extracted . - These are ready for analysis . - Take them to Dr Klein . The Insect Department is working on our two good specimens . Insect ? Is that how you classify it , then ? - Call it an arthropod . - Arthropod ? Includes all insects , crabs , spiders . Except that none of them have three legs . These are interesting , too . Antennae shaped like horns . Yes . The horned demons in those old prints and manuscripts . Do you remember ? As if that image were somehow projected into men 's minds , that face . - Rather pretty . - It 's like a gargoyle . Roney , that 's not just a simile . Haven 't you seen it before carved on walls in a dozen countries ? Is it somewhere in the subconscious ? A race memory ? - How do you like our decor ? - Oh , damn your decor ! I agree , it is a bit chi-chi for a lab . It confuses the eye when you 're trying to read a measure . They 're copies of Palaeolithic cave paintings about 30,000 years old . Look at that one . A cave man in a ritual mask . I wonder where the idea of it came from ? You know , I think these are old friends that we haven 't seen for a long time . The mass and structure point to a low-gravity environment , a thin atmosphere . Correct . Perhaps a world that 's dead now , but a few million years ago was teeming with life . I wonder . Roney , when I was a boy , it was the great burning topic . Were there really canals there and who made them ? I remember my disappointment when somebody proved that Martians couldn 't exist . It 's a funny word . Worn out before anything turned up to claim it . Martians . - Sorry , sir , I 've got my orders . - Don 't keep on saying that ! - Bet my editor 's worse than your inspector ! - Found more insects ? - I don 't know what you mean . - He 's the only man that doesn 't ! - Here 's one . Sergeant ! - What 's the row about ? - Reporters . - Sergeant , is there still any danger ? - Why can 't we go down there ? - Did you see any insects ? - What 's happening ? - It 's secret , sir . - Secret ! Except from the " Gazette " ! - They 've got the whole story . - Have they bought the exclusive rights ? - Go on , let us through ! I 'll have to see about this , sir . You get your officer up here right away ! I said , " Did you see any of these insects ? " All accounted for , sir . No more sealed compartments . Good . Here , what 's all this ? Oh , I must 've rubbed against it in there . All this stuff 's coming loose . The professor seemed to think that it must be ... well , it might have been some sort of apparatus . Does it look like that ? Well , no , sir . Besides , it doesn 't connect with anything . But even if there had been external propulsion units , I still don 't see how ... Well , unless the hull itself did the thinking . - Are you out of your mind ? - Sir . I 've heard enough stark idiocy here today ! You leave that to civilians . Sir , have you finished with my gear ? Oh , later . - My gear in there , can I take it now ? - It 'll be all right . I can 't go without it , sir . It belongs to my boss . I 'm the one that carries ... Look at this . The work of Quatermass 's friend , I suppose ! " Army Impose Panic Censorship . " Just because I chased their paid hack out of where he had no business to be ! " Panic Censorship " ? What are they implying ? What are they trying to ? Are you all right , sir ? Yes , of course . I 'll show them what can happen when they start flinging implications ! - Phone , sir , for you . - Who is it ? - Somebody at the War Office , sir . - The War Office ? The War Office . It 's that skull formation that 's out of line . Otherwise , the creatures fit in with known evolution . Hmm . An ape with an over-developed cranium . Oh , huge , for its place in the family tree . Over 1,000cc capacity . - Intelligent ? - Hard to say . Mere size doesn 't mean that . But something had developed , some faculties . Or had been developed . Hmm ? Roney , how many of these ape creatures were there in the pit ? Seven . Six at least . Six or seven . In the rear compartment . - We don 't know that for a fact . - Let 's suppose it . And in the front compartment , there were these . What 's in your mind ? The will to survive . It 's an odd phenomenon . Roney ... Roney , if we found out , knew for certain that our Earth was doomed a thousand years from now or a hundred what would we do about it ? Nothing . Just go on fighting each other as usual . Yes . But ... if we weren 't just men . Oh , good , you 're still here . Is it possible to give out a statement of some kind ? That crowd out there , it 's getting huge . And a bit ugly . They 're convinced there 's something sinister going on . Laboratory ? Yes , he 's here . - Professor , it 's for you . - Hmm ? Oh . - Quatermass . - Look at them ! - Be a job getting through if this goes on . - You 'll get home . - I 've got to go back to Hobbs Lane first . - Why ? To get some notes . My own fault . I forgot them . Yes ? Yes . All right , I 'll come at once . Well ... Back to the War Office . We 're in trouble . I 've told Breen what I think . Perhaps he 's taken more of the brunt of it than he should 've done . I don 't know what shook me the most - this wild news story or you two being at the bottom of it ! Hello ? Oh , hello , Haynes . I 'm afraid he 's still not ... Just a moment . The PM 's Private Secretary . Sorry , the Minister is still not available . Will you try again in about 20 minutes ? You see ? And the Home Office badgering me about cordons and emergency police action ! Before they call a special Cabinet meeting , I want to get a few facts straight . Oh , hell , kill it ! As far as I was aware , you weren 't still in London . I thought you were going back to the Rocket Group for Breen to take up his new position . Why didn 't you ? It was my fault . I involved Breen in this . Don 't talk as if you 've been scrumping apples ! This is serious ! You don 't know how serious . You 'd better tell me . I take it that you 've an idea of the facts ? Well , only these press reports . And more from Breen before you came . But I 'm still at a loss to make any sense of it . When I was last in this room , it was to discuss planting military bases on the moon ... - Let 's keep to the subject . - And on Mars . What are you suggesting ? You 're demanding explanations that I can 't prove . All I can give you are guesses . Better than nothing . Tell them we 're taking no more calls ! Go on . Dr Roney and I are convinced that those arthropods are not of this Earth . Where , then ? One possibility is Mars . Mars is dead . There 's nothing there but a few scraps of lichen . Five million years ago , it may have been very different . Suppose at that time there were living beings there with advanced techniques . There 's no harm in supposing . Techniques that enabled them to visit this Earth at a time when the most advanced creatures on it , our own ancestors , were still only a type of Pliocene ape . Suppose ... that they had other techniques . - Biological ones . - Biological ? Those Pliocene man-apes found at Knightsbridge are freaks . Are you trying to make out there 's a connection between those apes and your insects ? YOUR insects . I think you saw them first . I suppose that they were unable to endure our atmosphere , the strong oxygen , the bacteria , so when they came , they stayed sealed in that compartment while in the other section were the ape mutations , the result of their own experiments , brought back to be released on Earth to take possession of it for them . You believe that happened ? I said it 's a guess . That apes were taken from this planet and ? And altered , yes , yes . By selective breeding , by surgical methods , perhaps both . I suppose the aim would be to increase the intelligence . I suppose ... It would have to be carried out on a huge scale . Yes . Oh , yes . Yes , if I 'm right , IF I 'm right , we 've come across just one single instance . An accident , a landing that went wrong and they all died . The Thames Valley was swamp then . You realise what you 're implying ? That we owe our human condition to the intervention of insects ? Yes . I suppose I am . Breen , do you accept any of this ? No . No , I don 't . Not a single word ! Quatermass , you asked me a while ago if I had a theory of my own . Well , I have and here it is . And it does not involve Martians or obscene experiments . - Go on , please . - Only Germans . And it goes back to 1944 and not millions of years . You can 't still be hanging on to that ... I suggest that once the Germans realised they were losing the war , they put out a propaganda scare . They sent over an experimental V-weapon that would produce exactly the effect it has produced , thanks to you . Except it was a little late for their purpose . What about those creatures ? Fakes ! Put there as a circumstantial touch . Like mermaids at a fair , made up of odds and ends of flesh and bone . The oldest trick in the business ! - Ingenious ! - Except that it didn 't happen . - I say it did . - Yes , yes . It has that black Wagnerian imagination . Methodical people , the Hun . - You must hear the expert testimony . - Experts ! - I 'm sure I 'm right , sir . - I 'm sure you are . I like the common sense of it . We 'll let the Home Secretary off his beat . - Get him now ? - Yes . That mysterious missile , is it safe ? - I 've had it checked , sir . - No danger to the public ? - None . I 'm certain . - Good . We 'll get things back to normal . Have that barrier down , people back in their homes , let the press see it all . - We 'll prepare a short statement . - Here he is , sir . - Think what you 're doing . At least wait until ... - How dare you ! Hello , John . Sorry you 've been led such a dance this evening . It 's all over now . It 's a gigantic false alarm . - That 's official . There 's no further danger . - What about that thing down there ? - There 'll be a full statement in the morning . - You mean it was a hoax ? - I don 't know , sir . Open the barrier ! - Excuse me , please . - A hoax ! - A hoax ? Oh , we come here specially ! Inspector , the bomb-disposal people . They 're still there . I can see their truck . They 're just packing up . Oh , come on ! Let 's get a wet ! - Too late to go to the flicks now . - Oh , come on . Oh , cripes ! Stuck here till the last ! - You 're only a civvy , son . - " Leave the lamps till I 'm through , " he says . I thought he had some delicate task on . He 's slinging out bloody sacks ! - A wonder he didn 't make US do it ! - He wouldn 't do that . They haven 't had us touch it since this morning . - That 's right . Why ? - Hands . Look ! Got me a bit . Yeah . That cream fixed it , though . Well , it didn 't fix him . Nor Captain Potter . I saw him when he took the bandages off . Still , he 's not a bad sergeant . Gibson ! Jones ! Till he starts bawling . Coming , Sarge ! I 'm glad this job 's over . - So was this a Jerry job ? - That 's what the man said . Funny , though . All them stories about this place . That was before they had Jerries . - Shove ' em down ! - Do you reckon little Westie seen anything ? Little Westie what ? He lost his nerve , son . Spent too long clearing beaches . - As soon as you 're ready , we 'll pull out . - Very good , sir . Come on , jump to it ! - Take my gear now , Sarge ? - Yes , and knock off the generator . - Have you got any gloves ? - No . - Take mine . - All right , ta . Are you cold ? Well , pick up that stuff and move ! Come on , at the double ! Keep you warm . - So long , boy ! - See you again ! If I let you go down there , they 'd all want to go . - But I must . I 've told you who I am . - What 's the trouble ? I 've got to get some notes . They 're valuable . - Where from ? - From the hut . We were just leaving . It 'll all be shut down . Sergeant , is anybody still below ? Yes , Sladden , sir . - There you are . I 'll be quick . - Miss ! No , it 'll be all right ... I think . Aaagh ! Aagh ! Aagh ! Aaaagh ! # Bring me my chariot of fire # I will not cease from mental fight # Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand # Till we have built ... #

 SPACEMEN APPEAR OVER TOKYO - Warning From Space - - Dr. Kamura ! - Oh , Kimika . I was hoping we 'd get a chance to talk . - Let me buy you a drink . - Alright . Thanks . SAKE RESTAURANT Utyu-Ken - Oh , good evening doctor Kamura ! welcome back . - Madam Ohana . Terrible weather , isn 't it ? But even when it rains outside , the sun always shines in here . Nothing to spoil your view of our sky ! Actually , doctor spends his days gazing at the skies through telescope ... So the rain gives his eyes a chance to rest . I believe you 're right ! - Doctor , shall I get you some hot sake ? - Yes . Here 's my latest newspaper article about the saucers . UFOs SEEN OVER TOKYO . Doctor , what do you think they are ? Sorry , I 'm afraid I have no idea . You must know something . I understand your position that you have no definite answers , but ... At least give me some quote for my next article . I 'd love to , Hoshino , but I can say nothing . Sir , please ! An interview with the Director of the Observatory would be very important to me . I suppose . If I knew anything I 'd tell you . Could you at least make a guess ? Science doesn 't work that way . You can know 90 % of something , but if you ignore the other 10 % you don 't know anything . - Sure , but ... - Mr. Hideno ! Leave him alone ! He said he does not know . A scientist is not like a politician who can answer every question . Good evening . Oh , you 're here , Mr. Hideno ! Do I still have that assignment ? - What do you mean ? - What ? You 've forgotten already ? - The photos . - Oh , yes , yes . Of course . Thank you ! Bye . What was that he asked ? Sankichi 's an amateur photographer . If he gets pictures of a UFO , I promised to publish them . How about unicorns ? Oh , I almost forgot . Dr. Kamura , I have a message . Your daughter called . She will be dining with her uncle tonight in Ushigome . - Ah , thank you . - Don 't forget ! I didn 't know you had a brother . He 's really my cousin . The physicist Dr. Matsuda . Oh , Dr. Eisuke Matsuda ? Everything looks delicious ! I don 't know where to start . - A little wine ? - Yes , thank you . Do you have a favor to ask ? Not at all . You know that 's not my style . Well , cheers . You spoil me . Don 't laugh . How long are you going to keep working in that nursery ? I love children . So you say , but isn 't it time to make your boyfriend your husband ? She has the look of love ... But maybe she 's waiting for another 's wedding proposal . They seem like such a good match . Transparency : 8 degrees . Image ... What is that ? Well , that 's odd ... What 's wrong with my transistor radio ? How many payments behind are you ? Don 't be funny ! It 's never had any problems before . What a strange signal ... - Thank you , madam . - You 're welcome . - It must be a problem in the power station . - I guess . - Well , good night . - Good night . Look at these readings . It 's crazy ! - Kimi , take over for me . - Yes , sir . Call Dr. Kamura and tell him I 'm on my way over . It 's urgent . Right . Yes , I 'm Mikawa . Dr. Kamura ? No , he was at Utyu-Ken . Yes . There 's just no good fish in the market these past few days . They say there are no fish in Tokyo Bay . - It must be because of the UFOs . - I guess so . - Good evening ! - Hi . You 're father just left . - Has he eaten ? - Yes , he has . Okay . So you went to Ushigome for a marriage proposal ? - Yes . - Congratulations ! - No , I did not accept ... - Taeko-san ! - Is your father still here ? - He just left . What is it ? Mr. Isobe needs to see him right away ! - Who ? Toru ? - Yes . - Goodbye . - Goodbye . - Hello ! - Hi ! Taeko , please excuse us . This meeting is quite important . Yes , sir . So you 're convinced ... this thing is a satellite from another country . Well , that 's what seems most logical . If so , wouldn 't we have known before ? Perhaps . But if it 's not a satellite ... Doctor , this may seem crazy but could there be any truth regarding the rumors of flying saucers ? A scientist should not jump to such conclusions . A flying saucer ! San-Chan , where are you ? I 'm here . Upstairs ! It 's exactly what I saw with the telescope . - It 's not a meteor . - You 're right . It was no meteor . I saw it very clearly . I need more data before I can formulate a theory . You still don 't think there are UFOs ? Well ... I guess I can no longer deny it . I must get back ! UFO SIGHTED ! COULD IT BE A NEW FOREIGN WEAPON ? A FLYING OBJECT FELL IN TOKYO BAY ASTRONOMERS KEEP SILENCE We understand that you cannot deliver a conjecture but there were many witnesses and people are becoming afraid . It 's your duty to inform us . We are doing everything possible to discover what it is . We hope to give you an explanation soon . - Have a little patience . - For how long ? You said you saw it last night ? I got it . Thank you . Tacabara at the Observatory of Mexico Saw the same luminous object last night . Dr. Matsuda is here . - Hello . - Hello . Yes , this is Tokyo . - This is Kodaikanal , India . - Yes ... Just last night we saw the same one over 200 miles . I got the same report from London . Yes , I got it . Thank you . India 's Kodaikanal Observatory also saw it . And , so ... Even our first step ia problem : How to identify the object ? Perhaps ... We could used a rocket to take a photograph . The University is making meteorological observations . - I 'll talk with Dr. Takashima . - Good . Yes , who is it ? Professor ! A call from Jyouhoku observatory . Bait 's still good ... What the ... Look there ! What is that ? A monster ! A monster ! What the hell is that ? - I 'll call Dr. Takashima . - Okay . - Have him stand by . - Right . Rocket range . Rocket range . - Ready for launch ? - Hold . Dr. Takashima , they 're asking if you are ready . Ready ? Give them the OK . Ready . Ready . Ready ! Everyone take cover ! - Launch ! - Launch ! Launch ! Hello . Thanks for coming . As I said on the phone , It may sound strange , but do not think this is a hoax . There 's an odd trace on the dock , as if the monster had risen from the sea . - Let 's take a look . - Come . Down there . - Yoshida . - Yes ? Bring a Geiger counter . Without your help we could not have gotten those pictures . Luckily it coincided with our launches . What 's taking so long ? The speed and distance Will be noted in these pictures . Here they are . Is that it ? A tremendous energy release . It can not be a satellite . No satellite emits such an intense light . That 's right . But it is hard to distinguish what 's in these pictures . - Sorry I could not be more help . - It 's okay . I 'll have prints sent to all the other observatories . - Toru . - Yes ? They sent your father to Banshu-Maru to investigate . Any news ? No . Since yesterday I have not been home . That 's true . " A Monster Invades The Earth ! " Sorry about your father . He and your mother should be laughing at that right now . - Hello , Mom . - Hi , son ! I am so hungry ! - Dad isn 't eating ? - I 've called several times . - Is he still working ? - He 's analyzing specimens he brought home . Has he found anything ? I don 't know . He hasn 't left his office . - When did you get back ? - Just now . - Any news on the UFO ? - No , we did not find anything . - Have you learned anything ? - Nothing at all . Oh , it 's so late ! Mama will complain that your dinner 's cold . You 're right . I 'd better go . - Toru , come see . - Yes . Bring the Geiger counter . Hello . Did you stop at Utyu-Ken ? - No . - Want a sake ? I do not feel like drinking . What 's happening ? The headquarters of the World Council announced they are suspending all satellite launches . The Attack From The Sky . The National Council announced to the world In case of air attack Jet fighters will attempt to bring the saucers down . - Mysterious Luminous Bodies Disappear . - Finally ! Oh . Come on . NEW STAR , HIKARI AOZORA Doctor , they 've reappeared ! The monster which appeared on the freighter in Shibaura , in Kawaguchi and Lake Biwa appeared again last night at the Teito theater during a concert by Hikari Aozora , creating panic in the room . End of news flash . It 's terrible . The whole world 's going mad . Everything is so strange . Monsters , saucers ... I can 't take any more . So I guess Dr. Kamura is too busy to come tonight . I guess so . Here you are . What are the results of your first mission ? Have you revealed the reason for our presence ? No , it was impossible for us . Upon seeing us , they scatter in fear As if they had seen something monstrous . What ? Are we considered hideous ? Are they more beautiful than us ? No . Examine this . This is what they consider a beautiful woman . This is their concept of beauty ? It has a very large lump in the center of its face . Yet , we can make immediate contact with them If we assume the likeness of an Earthling . We can not leave without saving the Earth . It seems dangerous but time is desperately short . Numbers 11 and 16 , begin immediate surveillance of Dr. Kamura . Number 18 will act as radio contact . I request , sir , that I be allowed to carry out this project myself . After all , it is my idea and I know the Earth better than anyone else . Negative . The risk is too great . Transmutation has never been attempted using a 2D pattern . We don 't know the effect it will have on you . You are too valuable a scientist To risk in such an experiment . I believe it will be safe if the transmuter provides a covering of artificial skin . Your sacrifice honors the Pairans and will be remembered throughout our history ... If we don 't perish in the coming catastrophe . Prepare yourself for the transmutation , then . Mira . Look at them . Like to schoolgirls again . It feels good to finally relax . I believe the whole world has had quite an awakening . Whatever they were , they were certainly not satellites . It is terrible to think one of those creatures appeared in Bansyu-Mal . I cannot stop wondering What became of those UFOs ? Why were they here ? I wish I knew . Maybe they came to invade . What ? And what would have become of Earth ? We would have be swept from space in seconds . You may have too much imagination , But for now we need not worry . There are no more flying saucers . You seem to be having fun . It 's good to hear you laugh . The way they 're carrying on They must be reminiscing about their schoolboy pranks . Looks like the youngsters are enjoying themselves , as well ! Isn 't it beautiful ? Look at the colors ! What a beautiful day . Yes it is . Should we head back ? What is it ? Let 's see . - What happened ? - We found a body . Excuse me , please . - What happened ? - A lady drowned . Wait ... Isn 't that Hikari Aozora ? - Hikari Aozora ! - Yes Miss Aozora . A few questions , please ! - It 's important . - Who are you ? I am a journalist . You just died in Nikkou ! - I died ? - Yes ! Like one ? Thank you . Apparently the girl remembers nothing at all . She 's even forgotten her name . Classic symptoms of amnesia . I feel sorry for her . How can we discover her identity ? It will be very difficult if she doesn 't even know . We have room at our house . Suppose she stays with us Until we find out who she is ? What do you think ? What do I think about what ? Where are you going ? Initial phase of infiltration is a complete success . Miss Kamura ! Mr. Isobe has left a message . Stop by the tennis court on your way home . Thank you very much . Mr. Isobe , call it your home ! Thanks , going now . Do not look around . Just listen to me . I 've been sent down to assist you . Soon others will be , as well . Signal if you need us . Right , I understand . - Is everything alright ? - It was my father . - He made a weird request . - What was it ? - That woman ... - Who ? - The Jane Doe . - Ah , Ginko-san ? Yes , Ginko . Did you forget her name ? It was you who gave it to her . He asked me to bring him Ginko 's cap and tennis racket . - Why would he ask that ? - Want a drink ? Juice . I do not understand . He told me not to touch the handle of the racquet . How strange . - Sounds like a detective novel . - Here she comes . - Let 's go home , Ginko . - Okay . The cap also . Isn 't that Hikari Aozora ? No , get away ! No , back up ! What ? Where is she ? Can I have your autograph , please ? Dad , is there a problem ? - Something wrong with the racket ? - No . With that woman . - Did something happen ? - Yes , I came about Ginko . Her cap , dad . Something very strange happened today . What ? What happened ? I hit a lob far over Ginko 's head and she jumped incredibly high and returned the shot . . - And then ? - And then I saw her go through ... - A closed door without even opening it ! - Without opening it ? Yes . I was right . How did you get in ? Through the door . Is that so ? - I didn 't hear anything . - You were concentrating . What are you doing ? Destroying this horrible formula ! That 's part of my research . It does not concern you ! Not me , but it is of vital importance to the future of Earth . What ? Do you mean you understand that formula ? Yes . It is element 101 . Urium . With enough of this element you could blow up the Earth ! Who are you ? Humans are already threatened by the atomic bomb , and now you are creating something much more devastating . My formula is for peace . And anyway , it 's still only theoretical . And what business is it of ... Mr. Isobe just called . He needs you at the observatory . It sounded urgent . Thank you . Is there something wrong ? He hasn 't told me anything , but I think it 's about Ginko . I have called so sit back and relax . I came right over . What 's going on today ? Everyone is here . I just witnessed something ... something I do not understand . Did something happen ? She took one look at my Urium formula and understood it completely . I only just completed it ! - You mean the Jane Doe ? - Yes . - That settles it . She is not human . - What ? What day is today ? April Fool 's ? I started thinking about this after she was found in the lake . The doctor told me she had too many white blood cells to be alive . And yet , she was fine . But we can not rely only on one test . Of course not . Look at this . Fingerprints taken from her racket . What do you think ? She does not have any fingerprints ! And if that were not enough , look at this . It is a sample of sweat from her cap . And this substance was found at Shibaura Pier . What do you say ? They are exactly the same . So dad , who is Ginko , really ? - An extraterrestrial . - What ? It comes from another planet . But when we examine the Solar System : Mars , Jupiter ... We 've never found a trace of other forms of life ... When my son played tennis with her ... it ... he saw it jump higher than even a trained athlete could . The gravity of its planet must be different from that of Earth . It must have reached Earth in one of those UFOs . All clues point to that . Then an alien Ginko can transform into a human being ? I can think of no another possibility . What 's that ? Where did that sound come from ? There ! Over there ! It 's you ! You surmised correctly . I am not a human being . Then it 's true ! You are not of Earth ! True . I come from a planet called Paira . I am a Pairan . Paira ... What name do we know it by ? Paira is unknown to the Earth . We are on the far side of the Sun ... Opposite the Earth 's orbit . Why did you come to our planet ? From our planet , we saw many atomic clouds on Earth . From your planet ? This is impossible . No . Our civilization is far older than yours . Thousands of years ago our satellites detected the presence of your Earth . That alone shows how much more advanced we are . This is incredible . I can hardly believe it . When you saw my formula , How did you know it was for element 101 ? Our scientists discovered it long ago , but it was too dangerous even in microscopic quantities So we destroyed our research . You Japanese who have been victims of a nuclear disaster should understand . We developed a safer nuclear energy after our physicists discovered the more stable element 102 . But why have you come here ? - To save Earth from destruction . - Destruction ? I do not exaggerate . Unless we cooperate to prevent it ... Both our planets are doomed . Long ago we fought as you do . Our weapons became powerful enough to burn our planet to ashes . War and aggression were banned . And with unlimited safe power Thanks to element 102 , Our culture leapt ahead immensely . We began to examine the depths of space And we found something terrible . What was it ? Was it the catastrophe you spoke of ? Yes it was . A runaway planet From a distant solar system . On a collision course with Earth . But we believe that if Pairans and Earthlings cooperate , There is a chance we can avoid the collision . Well ... What does one say when he learns of the end of the world ? There is one possible way out of this . If you could induce the countries with nuclear weapons to launch a barrage , you may alter the course of the rogue planet . Could it succeed ? Theoretically it should work . But if Earth is obliterated The debris will destroy Paira , as well . News flash . Today , Doctors Matsuda , Kamura and Isobe have sent a request to the Council of Nations . That they deploy their entire stockpile of nuclear weapons For the purpose of saving lives , Rather than destroying them , To protect our Earth from total destruction . A rogue planet called ' R' Is on course to collide with the Earth . This collision will take place within 90 days . To avoid it , The warheads will attempt to destroy R or to divert its path . This warning was delivered to us by the Pairans , The alien race who have recently been seen by many as they entered our atmosphere in their spacecraft . The planet has yet to be detected from Earth but is being tracked by the Pairans . Sounds like a joke , to me . What is a Paira ? I don 't know but it sounds delicious . Let 's contact them ! Paira , Paira ! Paira ! Paira ! Paira ! Attention , please . May I have your attention ? Gentlemen ... Unfortunately , the World Council has rejected our request . The reason is that they do not believe Paira exists . Now , wait . Patience , please . You have all witnessed the presence of the Pairans . But other countries , and even some Japanese , Do not believe in the reality of Planet R. So first we need to convince the Japanese , before resubmitting our request . And I 'm sure with our nation behind us , it will be accepted . My Pairan informant estimates that we will be able , within 15 days , to see Planet R from Earth . PLANET R APPROACHING EARTH IS PLANET R REALLY THERE ? THE COUNCIL OF NATIONS SILENT CAN WE PREVENT THE APOCALYPSE ? NEARING THE END OF THE WORLD TOMORROW , R WILL BE VISIBLE THROUGH TELESCOPES Tomorrow the planet should appear . Is there any other course of action ? There is only one solution , nuclear warheads . - Any news from other the countries ? - Not yet . I think that once they 're convinced the planet exists , They will realize that ours is the only option . And what if they do not ? Mankind will disappear forever . Are you certain nothing else can be done ? A Japanese scientist has discovered an explosive greater than the H-bomb . The H-bomb ? It was to be used as an energy source , not a weapon . - What is his name ? - Dr. Eisuke Matsuda . Have you seen this ? You 're in the newspaper . What does it say ? You discovered a weapon more powerful than a nuclear bomb . That changes nothing . It 's too late . We don 't have the technical capability to build it . It 's purely theoretical . A gentleman to see you , sir . I said I do not want visitors . Yes , but he says it is very important . Who is he ? - His card says George Saito . - George ? - Very well . See him in . - Yes , sir . I just can 't sit around here . I 'm going to the observatory . Bring the car around , please . Have a seat . Please be brief , I haven 't much time . Okay , I 'll try . - What is it ? - It 's about your formula . I 'd like to buy it . What ? Buy my formula ? I 'm offering a great deal of money . Who are you ? - Consider me a friend . - Why do you want my formula ? - Many countries want to buy it . - You would betray Japan ? - I did not say that I was Japanese . - Then what are you ? - I 've already said , I 'm a friend . - Get out ! I do not need friends . I have no time for you . - If you refuse , you 'll regret it . - Get out of my house now ! We shall meet again . - Who was that man ? - The devil . Attention , please . The day has arrived . Stand by for a report from the Observatory . I see it ! They 've spotted it ! Please , you cannot enter . Isobe . Attention . The body is moving at a high speed . This is the proof we needed , Mom . Yes , this is Tokyo calling . Is this Sydney Observatory ? - Yes . - Yes , I 've got it . - How it 's coming ? - Yes , we just saw . It 's coming ! Yes . Yes , I 've got it . Yes . Doctor , how soon before we collide ? Within 50 days . But the world will be scorched long before that . Could we survive underground ? That would only delay the outcome . Without those warheads there will be no survivors . Why not use the atomic bombs ? It 's insane to save for them war ! Do not abandon us ! Launch them now ! Get rid of them all ! News Flash . Foreign agencies have informed us that the defense ministries have convened in emergency session to reconsider Japan 's proposal to use bombs against R. Two worlds are depending on their choice ! Attention ! As chief of police , I shall issue orders To begin the evacuation of Tokyo . The basement of the observatory is too small to accommodate the parents . We understand , but thank you for taking our son . We 're grateful that he 'll be safe . - Okay , come with me . - Thank you . Heed the teacher and behave yourself . - Thank you . - Goodbye . - Goodbye . We love you ! - Goodbye . Be careful . Doctor ! Speed has increased to 200 km per second . I think ... within two days , it will be visible without a telescope . - Any news from abroad ? - No . - Soon we 'll have to go down to the basement . - Yes . Let 's begin moving all the important documents . What do you want ? Who is it ? Let go . Let go ! Who are you ? Be quiet . You ! Nice to see you again . - What do you want from me ? - To reconsider my offer . No way , you bastard ! This is kidnapping . Kidnapping ? You misunderstand . I 'm trying to do you a favor . Aren 't you sick of being a poor scientist ? Accept my money and you will be rich . Return me to my house . I have work to do ! We 'll return you once you 've given me the formula . Unless you can fly , you can not escape . I will not give you the formula under any circumstances . Do not want them to hurt you ? The formula is useless . Soon we will all be dead . Do what you want . I do not think your formula is useless . Nor do my clients . Make him talk . Carefully , children . Walk down slowly , one at a time . Really ? Right . I understand . Matsuda left to come here hours ago . Where can he be ? If the Council of Nations rejects the request again Matsuda 's new element 101 is our only hope . But according to him , we lack the ability to actually produce it . Quick , someone help me ! Hand me that ! Here ! Where can my husband be ? Do not worry . He must be at another shelter . That 's it . Okay , children , everything 's alright now . Let 's pick up these papers . Doctor ! - Come quick ! - What 's happening ? It 's accelerating again ! Quick ! Over here ! Radiation : - 15 . - How much time do we have now ? - We have only 20 days . What do we do ? We can only wait until other countries are decided . News Flash . The World Council has reversed its decision . Today at 20 hours , All Earth 's nuclear bombs will be launched against Planet R. At last ! Listen ! We 're saved ! Tonight , all countries will they launch their warheads at R. - Hurray ! - Hurray ! Hurray ! Alright , time for your nap . What do you see ? Doctor , what have you seen ? The planet is too big . The bombs did not work . She was so beautiful that the prince kissed her , and suddenly she awoke . The prince asked for her hand . And they got married , and lived happily ever after Until the end of their days . Did you like it ? Ok , now time for sleep . We have a big problem . The atomic bombs did not destroy the planet . Radiation has doubled . How much time do we have ? Only 5 days . Doctor , doctor ! He 's passed out ! Doctor ! - Are you all right , doctor ? - Yes , yes . - What 's wrong ? - Rats , there are rats ! OBSERVATORY It 's so hot ! Do not cry , be brave . I 'll sing a song , okay ? If only we had Matsuda 's Urium . Greetings . Do not abandon hope . Where is Dr. Matsuda ? He 's been missing for days . Never fear , Doctor . We 'll find him . Just how will you be able to do that ? Doctor Matsuda is wearing one of our rings . The ring contains a communication device . He will be visible on our radar . Doctor , are you okay ? We need your Urium to save the Earth . Please give us the formula . Matsuda ... Where are you ? Don 't cry , we 'll be okay . Matsuda ! - Dr. Matsuda ! - Doctor ! Matsuda ! They found him ! Sit . People of Earth . People of Earth . The Urium bomb of Dr. Matsuda 's has been built on our ship . We are preparing to launch . The weapon is ready . Please observe Planet R. Come on ! THE END

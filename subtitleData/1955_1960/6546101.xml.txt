 ( Suspenseful , mysterious theme playing ) Is it much further ? A few miles . Do you have enough gas ? Heh , I got plenty . ( Sighs ) All this ocean and sand , I feel as if I were in another world . Oh , you won 't mind it . Wait and see . Look , men , we gotta stick together . Tell you mother it 's going to be swell living at the ocean . Sure , Mom . Dad 's gonna buy me some flippers And I 'll let you wear them . ( Chuckles ) ( Mysterious theme playing ) ( Machine humming ) Hey , Mom , listen . Listen to what ? Dad , don 't you hear it ? Hear what , son ? ( Suspenseful , mysterious theme playing ) ( Engine sputters ) What in the world ? I warned you . Honey , I got more than half a tank left ! The electrical system isn 't working . Dad , listen . Not now . I gotta figure this out . There 's something wrong here . Mom , look up there . Yes , dear . ( Engine revs ) That 's funny . I don 't understand . It 's working now . But Dad , up there ! ( Airplane whirring ) It 's just a jet , Bud . It 's not . It wasn 't a jet ! It wasn 't anything like a jet ! Children , will you stop chattering ? Dave Brewster , Oakland Electronic Company , San Francisco . I 'm assigned to Colonel Manley . Brewster , Dave , family of three . Is this the last of the bunch ? Yes , that 's all . Here , let them through . Okay , go ahead . Oh , where is Unit 3 ? - We 're gonna live there . - Yes , ma 'am . Keep going right over the rise . You 'll find Unit 3 on your left . Thanks . Thank you . ( Children chattering ) Well , this is it , honey . Try to make the best of it . Yes . Come on , kids , let 's get out . Well , I put away most of the clothes . There 's good closet space anyhow . It 's not so bad . Sure , if you like living on the beach . It 's only temporary , honey . Doesn 't matter . The sand 's going to drift in And ruin everything anyhow . Look , honey , I 've driven over 500 miles today . Tomorrow I start a new job , an important job . I 'm a little tired myself . Of course . I 'm sorry . I guess I 'm just homesick for San Francisco . Well , where is it ? The launching platform . Is it on the beach ? Probably somewhere on the beach . When 's the first test ? I don 't know . Soon . Maybe this week . Will it work ? It 's got to . It 's gotta do a job better than theirs So if they start anything ... Dave , what you said about its accuracy ? We just got in , honey . I don 't know any answers . But you , your company . You worked on it for months . I worked on one part out of 35,000 parts . It 's much more complicated Than just an intercontinental missile . Is ours the only one ? We don 't think so . It 's almost funny , isn 't it ? I mean , the children living in the middle of all this . Would you have wanted me to say no When the company insisted I come here ? Of course not . I 'm just tired . Let 's go out and find Bud and Ken . Okay . I could use some air . Just wait until this project 's a few weeks old . You won 't recognize the place . A little grass , it 'll be like a vacation spot . It 's just the bleakness of it at first . It 's your fault for marrying a city girl . ( Chuckles ) I wish the children hadn 't wandered off . You think it 's dangerous down there on the rocks ? No . Besides , you know how the boys love the beach . The ocean , rocks , everything makes me feel So unimportant myself . Well , you 'll like it here . Wait till you meet the others . I guess we 'd better get back and straighten things out . JAMES : Mr. Brewster ? Hi . I 'm Mr. James , Security Officer for the Command . I just heard from the gate you 'd arrived . This is my wife . How do you do ? I hope you 'll be comfortable here , Mrs. Brewster . Thank you . I 'm glad I caught you . I hope it won 't be inconvenient , But you 're the last member to arrive And the Colonel 's giving a briefing And I think he 'd like you to attend . If you don 't mind , Mrs. Brewster . No , of course not . You 'll come back as soon as you can ? Sure , I will . FRIEDA : Hello . I 'm Frieda Johnson . I live in the next trailer . Oh , I 'm Anne Brewster . How do you do ? We just arrived . Everything certainly is strange and different here . I know just how you feel . I thought I 'd die the first few weeks Away from my folks and friends . It 's the feeling of living so close To the end of the world , maybe . After a while you don 't think of it like that . Do you have any children ? Mm-hm . Two boys . They 're on the beach somewhere . How old are they ? 12 and 10 . Oh , that 'll be great for Eadie . She 's 11 . Well , I 'd better get my laundry on the line . Oh , by the way , we 're having a weenie roast Out here tonight . Why don 't you come ? It 's really for the kids . That 'll be very nice . Thank you so much . Good . Then we 'll see you later . Mm-hm . Here , catch ! Just a minute . Come on , run . Hey , Bud , come here . Gee , Bud . I bet it 's a real cave . Yeah . Gee , do you think we discovered this cave ? Maybe . What a day . First that thing in the sky and now this place . Are you scared of what you saw ? You ? No . Do you think it 'll come back ? I hope so . So do I. You bet . Then we can show it to Dad And prove we weren 't making things up . ( Explosion ) Kind of spooky , huh ? Yeah . It 's awful dark back there . Maybe it leads to another cave . You better stay here , Ken . Hi . You scared me . Hi . Hello . So you found our cave . We didn 't know anyone knew about it . We have secret club meetings here . My name 's Eadie Johnson . I saw you move in next door to us . Who are you ? I 'm Bud Brewster . This is my kid brother , Ken . Hi . This is Buster , Tim , George , and Helen . ALL : Hi . Your father going to work here ? Yeah . He 's what you call a technician . He knows everything about orbits and satellites and hydrogen And missiles and warheads . So does mine . Have you seen it yet , the Thunderer ? It 's the biggest one in the world ! It 's a six stage rocket . It takes a satellite with a hydrogen warhead And the satellite will be hundreds of miles up in the air , And when it gets above any city you want All you gotta do is press a button and bang . Wow . Gee . Let 's show it to them . Yeah , come on . ( Marching theme playing ) TIM : There it is . Wow ! Man ! Isn 't it terrific ? Yeah , it sure is . All right , beat it , kids . You know you don 't belong here . Okay , okay . I was only showing them the Thunderer . Come on , let 's move . All right . Gentlemen , we 've been charged with a heavy responsibility In this technological race . We 've all worked long and hard , and it 's paid off With the development of the new propellant And other extraordinary advances . We have reason to be proud of the Thunderer . Because of this weapon we 're prepared 24 hours a day To retaliate instantly in case of enemy attack . The Thunderer is no stranger to you . You 've all worked on it in one way or another . You all know what the Thunderer can do , Send a satellite equipped with a hydrogen warhead Into the ocean of space , where for years , If you wish , it can circle on a path known only to us . A satellite containing the means to bring retaliation By the pressing of a button . TIM : Here , throw it to me ! KEN : Catch it . Hey , look up there ! ( Suspenseful , mysterious theme playing ) Come on ! ALAN : With pinpoint accuracy ... Let 's just wait a minute , gentlemen . The lights will be on in a minute . Probably a fuse . Check them , please . ( Machine powering on ) ( All chattering ) There . That 's better . Sorry for the interruption , gentlemen . It 's nice to know we 're no longer in the dark . ( All chuckle ) Getting back to the launching of the Thunderer ... How 's the fishing , Colonel ? Dr. Wahrman . Any luck ? Ha , ha , not a bite . Wonderful day . The sky looks so innocent . Doctor , will we succeed tomorrow ? I see no reason why not . Hmm , how time flies . Seems like yesterday The first satellite orbited through space . Yes . Now we launch my godchild . I suppose people will get used to the Thunderer , Its implications . SAUL : Hey , Dad ! Hello , son . PHYLLIS : Hi , Dad . Hi , Phyllis . How 's fishing , Dad ? Not very good . Catch anything ? Probably the sniffles . Water cold ? A little . Come on , Phyllis , let 's get dressed , huh ? See you , kids . SAUL : So long . Life 's a wonderful thing , doctor . Let 's hope we can preserve it for them . ( All chuckling ) BOY : Hey , Bud ! Ken ! FRIEDA : Hey , watch it , kids , huh ? Come and get them while they 're hot , boys . Plenty more where these came from . Oh , honey , just put them on the table . We 're up to here with hot dogs . Okay . Here you are . Thank you . Well , at this parent-teachers meeting They put me on the spot . They kept saying , " When is it gonna end ? " Year after year of racing , racing , trying to find something Bigger and better to blow ourselves off the planet . " When they ask me these questions , What do I tell them ? You just say to them that down there Stands the Thunderer , And what are we waiting for ? FRIEDA : Hank , dear , Let 's not be serious tonight , hmm ? It 's your first day here , Dave . What 's your viewpoint ? Same as my wife 's . In all its history our country has never started a war . The Thunderer is to prevent war . I still say that when that satellite gets up there With the Thunderer and it gets into its orbit , we should ... FRIEDA : We should take a vacation . That 's what you need , Hank , a nice vacation . ( All chuckle ) Dave , why don 't you and Hank take a swim , huh ? Come on , let 's take a dip with the kids . What do you say ? That 's a good idea . Eadie . Yes , Daddy ? Wanna go for a swim with me , honey ? Sure , Daddy , I 'll go , I ... ( Machine humming ) I think I had too many hot dogs , Daddy . I 'd better not go for a swim . How about the rest of you kids ? Anybody want to go for a dip ? Bud ? Ken ? No , thanks . No , thanks , Dad . Eadie , I 'll race you to the cliff . Sure . Our daughter sure got over her stomach ache In a hurry , didn 't she ? She sure did . You ready for the big plunge ? Yeah , sure . Hello , Joe , Peg . Hi . Hi . Hi , Frieda . Oh , hi . This is Peg and Joe Gamble , Anne Brewster . Hi . Nice to know you , Anne . Well , we 're a little late , but , uh , then of course , Nobody invited us . Joe ! We were invited . You fell asleep , don 't you remember ? Joe , stop carrying that chip on your shoulder . Well , he isn 't feeling very well tonight , Frieda . My wife is just trying to be polite . She means I 'm tight . Did you get that job , Joe ? No , I flunked the test . Peg will have to go on bringing in the bank roll . Please , Joe . Where 's Tim ? He 's with the other children . He 's always running off without telling us where he 's going . If I were that kid 's real father , I ... But you 're not his father And I 'm not your wife , So I can afford to tell you a few things That have been on my mind , Joe Gamble ! He 's a spoiled brat ! Tim ! Tim ! Tim ! ( Suspenseful , mysterious theme playing ) TIM : Where do we go ? Up this way . You knew it would be here . Did it tell you ? Yes . You 're going to be the leader . You 'll have to do what I tell you to . I 'm getting out of here . ( Gasps and whimpers ) I ... I can 't move . You can now . Try . From now on when I ask you to do something , We 'll do it together . Yes , Bud . Yes , Bud . Sure . DAVE : Hank , is Eadie back yet ? Just this minute ? Good , yeah . Yeah . Oh , it 's all right . Thank you very much . They just came in . Where have you been ? Sorry , Mother . I ought to wallop the both of you , Worrying your mother , staying out till almost 9 ! We were just on the beach . You knew this was our first day here , Yet you made me walk up and down the beach Hunting for you and your brother ! Dave , stop hounding at them . Go get undressed . Tell ' em , Bud . Tell ' em ! ANNE : Tell us what ? We can tell ' em , can 't we , Bud ? Yes . I know . What 's the matter ? What are you talking to yourself for ? Are you sick ? No , I 'm all right . Weren 't you gonna tell them , Bud ? We found something that fell out of the sky This afternoon . We know where it is . The sky ? Bud 's telling the truth . I saw it too . It fell out of the sky . Well , you 've gotta believe him ! How long did it take you to dream up that yarn ? I didn 't dream it up . You think a lie like that 's going to make it all right , Staying out until all hours ? It 's not a lie . Something 's wrong . I know it is . Something is wrong . You 're upsetting your mother . Let 's go to bed . Come on . Dad , you 've gotta believe me ! Believe what ? Some crazy story you made up for an excuse ! Listen , for two cents , I 'd ... I can 't move my arm . It 's not a lie , Dad . Please sit down and listen to me . You too , Mom . We were coming back from the rocket site And all of a sudden we heard this strange sound . ( Explosion ) What are you doing here ? I 'm ready . She knows , Dad . Come on . ( Thunder rumbling ) Where do you think you 're going ? I asked you a question ! I was just going out for a walk . You 're a liar . You 're up to something . Please , Joe , let me go . I 'll be back soon . You 're going nowhere except to bed . I 've got to go ! You little sneak ! Come back here ! Come back here ! Come back here ! TIM : Hey , Bud , Ken , wait for me ! ( Tense theme playing ) JOE : Come back here ! I 'll break your neck ! Hey , Bud , wait for me ! JOE : Come back here ! ( Thunder rumbling ) Come back here ! I 'll break your neck ! Come back here , you ! Come back here ! ( Joe grunting ) I 'll teach you to run away from me ! ( Tim screams ) ( Electricity crackles ) ( Screams ) ( Suspenseful theme playing ) ( Panting ) ( Slow theme playing ) Good night , Bud . Good night . So long . Goodbye . So long , Tim . ( Mysterious theme playing ) Oh , Timmy . ( Sobbing ) Don 't cry , Mom . I 'm not crying , Tim . Eadie ! Hi , Daddy . Brewster , what 's this all about ? Where have you all been ? You see , Mr. Johnson , I thought I heard something on the beach And Eadie saw me ... I couldn 't sleep so I ... I don 't know how you raise your kids , Brewster , but I ... What 's that you 're holding there ? Just an interesting rock formation I found . I don 't like my kids staying up Until all hours of the night . I 'm sorry . PEG : Hank ! What is it , Peg ? Hank , it 's Joe . He 's dead . Dead ? Yes , please come . HANK : Get in the trailer , Eadie . Don 't go , Dad . You don 't have to go , Mr. Brewster . BUD : Go home , kids . ( Soft theme playing ) It 's all right , Mom . We got it . We walked and got it . And Joe Gamble was killed . Killed ? Joe tried to hurt Timmy . It didn 't want Timmy to be hurt . Yes ? There . I don 't want this thing here . Take it back . Get rid of it , do you understand ? Get rid of it this minute ! I don 't care ! ( Siren wailing ) It 's the ambulance for Joe Gamble . We 'll have to wait . Get it out now . ( Mysterious theme playing ) Don 't be worried , Mother . We can 't take it out of the house tonight . It won 't let us . ( People chattering ) If there 's anything we can do , Peg , let us know . Thanks , Hank , you 've just been wonderful . Take good care of your mother , Tim . Good night . I 'm sorry , Mrs. Gamble . There was nothing that could be done . He must have died instantly in his chair . I warned him if he kept on living in this way ... I know , Doctor , thanks a lot . ( Siren wailing ) Good night . ( Suspenseful theme playing ) Dave . Good morning . Hi , folks . It 's grown , hasn 't it ? We 've had a night to think about it . What are we to do ? ( Knocks on door ) Don 't let anyone in , Mother . Don 't let anyone in . ( Knocks on door ) Yes , Frieda . Oh , there you are . The way kids drink milk , I 'm all out of it . Do you have any ? I 'm sorry , Frieda , the boys just drank the last drop . Is something the matter ? I 'm not feeling very well . That 's why I didn 't invite you in . I 'm afraid I wouldn 't be very good company . Oh , of course , dear . Did you hear about Joe Gamble ? Yes . Amazing . To be sitting in a chair reading And to go like that . He was still so young . I wish I could say I was heartbroken , but I 'm not . He treated Peg and the boy miserably . Well , thanks , anyway . ( Suspenseful theme playing ) All right , listen , I want answers , do you understand ? I must have answers . Don 't be worried , Mother , please . What is this thing that 's come into our lives ? Will you answer me ? Why did it come here ? What does it intend to do ? What have you kids got to do with it ? We have to keep it safe and warm until tonight . We 've got to do what it wants us to do until tonight . Why tonight ? Do you hear your father ? Why tonight ? Look , I 'm trying to be patient . I 'm trying to understand , but I 'm scared . Do you understand ? Your mother 's scared . Don 't be scared , Mother . How does it tell you , and why ? I don 't think you 'd understand . ( Phone ringing ) Hello ? Please , don 't be upset . We have to hide it . Come on . DAVE : Oh , yes , major . I was just on my way to the laboratory . What ? Yes , sir . Yes , I see . Right away . That was the major alerting me . They 're launching the Thunderer . And do you know when ? Tonight . Tonight ? Then what the children meant ... ? Yeah . Where are they ? They just left . MAN : Brewster . Hey , Brewster . Do want a lift down to the lab ? Did you see the kids ? Yeah , I thought that being your first day , I 'd drive you down to the lab , Show you around , introduce you ... Where 'd the kids go ? They went over the embankment . Hey , what 's the matter ? DAVE : Bud ! Ken ! Bud ! Ken ! Wait ! ( Tense theme playing ) DAVE : I just heard about the launching Of the Thunderer tonight . You knew before I did , didn 't you ? Yes . MAN : Yes . What time ? Yes , I understand . Thank you very much . That was the depot . Propellant for the sixth stage is on its way . Truck should be here this afternoon . Good . Tonight , we push this button . The most powerful sky horse of all Joins the celestial merry-go-round . Let 's hope we get that brass ring , Dr. Wahrman . Hmm . There 's a very interesting report , Came in from the engineering department . I 'd like you to go over it with me . It correlates all the figures I had ... Colonel . One of the technicians wants to see you . A fellow named Dave Brewster . What about him ? He 's waiting outside . He insists on talking to you . Not now , major , the press is on its way . Brewster says it 's urgent . A matter for security . He seems pretty upset . All right , I 'll see him . Now , who 's Brewster ? Sent him down from San Francisco . Oh . Oh , about this report . Look at these figures here . See column 7 ? Hello , Brewster . What 's on your mind ? You can talk freely in front of Dr. Wahrman . Oh , yes . Yes , go on . I 'm not sure you 'll believe what I tell you . Try us . It 's about tonight and the Thunderer . The launching ? Yes , Dr. Wahrman . Tonight ... OFFICER : Colonel . You know , Wicks from the news , and Lloyd of the Sentinel . Of course . Hello , Dan . Colonel . Richard . Colonel . Good morning , doctor . About tonight , sir . Uh , what 's the story ? Fire away . The doctor and I will try to answer your questions . Will the new type of warhead be inside the satellite When it 's launched ? Yes . You see without such a specialized kind of warhead , We 'd be merely launching one more satellite in space . There are already a dozen , as you know . How high will the orbit be ? Approximately 1000 miles . Can you tell us how many stages The rocket will have ? Yeah . Six . As it nears the orbit , The last stage will be the dropping of the nose cone . Dr. Wahrman , do you believe that another country Has already launched a satellite containing a warhead ? Well , we don 't know . You see , in this race , We may be only a few hours ahead of another country . What if the test is a dud ? Heh , we 're not planning on it . DAN : What if any enemy launches its own satellite With a warhead and it isn 't a test ? Well , let us hope no country in the world Would be paranoid enough to do what you suggest . There are constant rumors . Not a newspaper in the country this week That hasn 't had dozens of telephone calls . After all , you can understand , Colonel . Years and years of cold war nerves . Of course I understand . But isn 't it your job , gentlemen , To quiet rumors of that kind ? It isn 't easy . Not when every hour is a zero hour . Let us hope that the Thunderer Will be launched in time to discourage anyone From attacking our country or our allies . That 's all gentlemen , I have a busy schedule . Thanks , colonel . Dan . Good day , gentlemen . Thank you , sir . I 'm sorry , Brewster . Now , what was it ? Oh , yeah . Something about the Thunderer . Yes , sir . I 'm glad you 're here , Dr. Wahrman . What I 'm about to say ... It needs explanation from someone With a greater scientific mind than mine . Well , go on , Brewster . What is it ? I believe the Thunderer Will never get off the ground . What ? That 's a wild statement to make . Unless you know something we don 't know . Have you proof of sabotage ? Whatever either of you is thinking , you 're wrong . It 's beyond understanding . Last night , my two children , small boys ... Last night , down on the beach , They found something w ... How the devil did you get in here ? Top security for everyone but children , eh ? Hello , Dad . So that 's your boy ? So there you are . Sorry , colonel , I don 't know how he got past us . Neither do I. Take him out . Goodbye , Dad . Your boy will be outside . You can take him home in a minute . Now , what were you saying ? That ... That ... What 's the matter , Brewster ? You 'll be all right , Mr. Brewster . We 'll get you to bed right away . Here , sit right down here . No . I can 't . I 've got ... I 've got to get to the cave . The cave ? What cave ? The children . You 'd better sit down . No . Dave . ( Whimpering ) Darling . How is he ? He 'll be all right . All he needs is some rest . We 'll take good care of him . Would you mind waiting outside for a moment , please ? All right , doctor . Come on , children . ( Suspenseful theme playing ) What 's the matter ? There 's something wrong With the steering wheel . Stop it . I can 't stop it . There 's no brakes ! Get the brake on her ... They 're gone ! The steering wheel 's gone ! Stop ! We 're going off the road ! Watch out ! No control at all ! What happened ? Beats me . Heh , almost ran into the ocean , didn 't you ? Now , where 's the nearest phone , kid ? There 's a gas station down the road about a mile . Steering rod 's split wide open , and the brake 's gone . Anything I can do to help ? I have my bike . No , thanks . What 's in the truck ? Look , kid , we 're in a jam . Now please don 't annoy us , will you ? I was just asking . Well , don 't ask . Look , I better stay here . Uh , go phone the depot , Tell them to get another truck here as soon as they can . And phone Eagle Point . Tell them what happened . Right . ( Phone ringing ) Hello ? Hello ? Operator ? Operator ? ( Phone rings ) Hello ? Yes , this is Sergeant Cooper , speaking . Hello ? ( Indistinct noises over phone ) Hello ? Operator ? Operator ? Hi . Eadie ! Eadie ! I guess she 's still down on the beach . Oh , I 'll find her , hon . Eadie ! Eadie ! Eadie ! Eadie ! Eadie ! Hi , Daddy . You had me scared , honey . I didn 't know where you were . I found your jacket and a towel back at the beach . Come on , Daddy . Let 's go for a swim . I haven 't been all day . Wait a minute , honey . What were you doing in there all alone ? Just playing , Daddy . It 's so nice out . I bet the water 's warm . Come on , let 's go for a swim . Now , what 's the matter with you , honey ? What are you looking back in there for ? Nothing , Daddy . I 'm not looking at anything , honest . Eadie , honey . What 's in there ? Nothing , Daddy . Just an old cave . Come on , let 's get out of here . I will , honey . As soon as I find out what this is all about . Don 't Daddy ! Please ! Please ! Daddy ! Daddy , you all right ? ( Door opens ) Hello , dear . ( Door closes ) Did you find Eadie ? Eadie ? What 's the matter , Hank ? What 's happened ? Nothing , I went swimming . ( Mysterious theme playing ) We have to go now . Already ? Yes , it 's time . The other children have already started . Come on . 3 : 45 ... Phone out Of order . 4 : 30 ... Johnson In hospital . Now , I pride myself in knowing a little bit About permutations and combinations . As you say , this may all be coincidence . I 've studied these reports again and again , And I agree , there seems to be no connection Between any of these events . That 's what makes it so incredible . Except there 's one brightly-colored thread That runs throughout the day , tying all these events together . I couldn 't find any link . Now , listen , Alan . " In the presence of his little boy , " Technician Brewster collapses . A few hours later , according to this truck driver , As a child watches from his bicycle , The truck runs off the road . Two children watch a sentry try to phone for help and fail . Johnson goes searching for his little daughter on the beach , Collapses , and can 't remember anything . I know all that . You 're just saying what we already know . Now , just a second . Can 't you see ? A child or children was present At each of these events today . Well , what if that 's so . What are you driving at ? I don 't know . That 's all here in black and white . Children , children , children . What can the children have to do with it ? Has Brewster left the dispensary ? No , doctor wants him to stay overnight . Why ? Well , on the surface , everything seems calm . Yet , all day , the unexpected . Like pebbles dropping one by one , Ruffling the surface . Well , within an hour , the Thunderer will be launched . I better get going . I 'll see you at the Blockhouse . All right . Guard ? Why , yes , sir ? Why did you let those children inside here ? Dr. Wahrman , what children ? At least half a dozen children just walked out of that gate . Oh , no , sir . No , there haven 't been any children around here . Besides , the gate 's locked . See ? I thought the doctor told you to stay overnight . I wanted to be at the launching . Did you wanna see me about something ? What did you tell the doctor about , this morning ? The truth , that I fainted . The matter of your voice ? I didn 't tell him about that . Why should I ? It wasn 't important . Total paralysis of the throat muscle is not important ? Brewster . You see , a man of science Is like a deep-sea diver . He mustn 't be afraid to walk down Where it 's dark and frightening , In the hopes of scooping up a handful of truth . Brewster , this morning , What did you want to tell us about the children ? I 've made the obvious deductions . They don 't seem to add up . I remember very well what you said this morning . What did I say ? There may be trouble launching the Thunderer . Obvious deduction , a spy in our midst . But a few minutes ago , in front of the powerhouse , I saw the incredible . The unbelievable . Spies do not work in unbelievable ways . Always through counter-intelligence Can be drawn logical conclusions . But what I saw a group of children do a few minutes ago Is something for which there is no name , Unless you can name it . I can 't tell you anything . I see . Do you mean , your voice would become paralyzed again If you should tell me that some force , Still unknown to man , has been able , through children , To shatter a steering rod , To take away a man 's mind , Another man 's voice , To allow a boy to walk through a locked gate ? I don 't understand . Nothing 's happening to you when you tell me this . Well , that 's because I 'm talking to someone Who also knows the truth . Now , I wonder what would happen If I would try to tell someone else ? Just to satisfy my scientific curiosity . Mm-hm . Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Just as I thought . Dead . Where is it now , Brewster ? In a cave . And what does it look like ? I can 't describe it . The hideous part is it 's making the children obey Its every command . The children are completely in its power . Then we 're in the power of the children . ( Machines whirring ) I 'm warning you , doctor . I can 't be held accountable for what might happen If you go in there . I 'm ready if you are . All right . My life is more than half over . The worst you can do to me is to kill me . I 'm willing to face that , if I can just know Why you 're here . Why you 've taken our children And made them do your work . I 've spent a lifetime in the search For truth and knowledge , Trying to make this world a better place . A world where the very children You 're controlling can live in peace instead of fear . I 'm their friend . I beg of you , tell me what you want of them , What you 're making them do . Is there no man on this Earth , Who has the wisdom and innocence of a child ? Dave . Better hurry to the launching . Number 1 stage . Primary fuel valve is locked . Number 2 stage . Primary fuel valve is locked . Number 3 stage . Primary fuel valve , locked .

Okay . How 's it look ? Everything 's checked out . You 're positive ? Absolutely . ( Car approaching ) Hey , kids . Yeah ? How 'd you get in here ? Oh , we just walked in . When ?

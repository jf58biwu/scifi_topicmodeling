 In a builders ' excavation at Knightsbridge , London , a fossilised skull is found . This and other bone fragments are put under scientific examination . Dr Matthew Roney , an eminent Canadian palaeontologist , with his assistant , Barbara Judd , attempts a reconstruction of the creature . " An ape-like hominid " he pronounces it to be , five million years old . But Roney 's work on the site is interrupted by the discovery of what appears to be an unexploded bomb . When Captain Potter of the bomb-disposal squad is mystified by the thing 's appearance , Roney goes impatiently to seek help from an old acquaintance . Professor Bernard Quatermass is at the War Office , vainly resisting a plan to use his Rocket Group for military purposes . Colonel James Breen , a guided-missile expert , takes over ostensibly as his deputy . But when Roney arrives with his frantic appeal , Quatermass employs this forced relationship to enlist Breen 's aid . Roney , where did you say the skull was from ? Where exactly ? Well , in the earth that 's been dug away , two or three feet above this level . That 's right ? Yes . It was here . - You said " above " ? - Why , what 's wrong ? Well ... if it was above this thing ... Roney , tell me again . How long did you estimate that skull had been there ? Something like five million years . Five million years ? What are you trying to suggest ? That this thing 's been here ? Well ... Feel it . It 's hardly corroded . - It 's not corroded at all , sir . - Oh ? - Might be an experimental alloy . - But is it metal , sir ? I believe he 's right . It may not be . There 's something about its character . - What are you doing ? - I 'll be careful . No mark . It 's harder than diamond . Hello ! What have we got here ? It looks like the horn of a sea mine . Watch what you 're doing , sir . Let me get at that . Sergeant ! It joins the surface of the thing quite smoothly . Please , sir ! Quite featureless . An elaborate sort of knob , that 's all . Oh , test for strikers and fuses , by all means . I don 't suppose you 'll find anything . I think it was used to support some sort of external mechanism that was shed in flight or ... I shouldn 't wonder if you find more of those . - You think I ought to carry on , sir ? - For the moment , yes . - Right , carry on , Sergeant . - Carry on , lads ! Well , Breen ... Are you taking over ? Well , I can offer my advice . They can hardly refuse it from the principal expert . - We 're due at the Rocket Group in the morning . - They can spare us for a day or two . This is a problem and I enjoy problems . - Captain Potter ! - Sir ? - I 'd like to sit in on this case . - I 'd be very relieved , sir . - Good . Let your people know . - Yes , sir . Just a minute . Have you seen the civil defence records for this area ? - I 've got copies . - Have you ? Good man . Nothing fell on this street but a few incendiaries . Well , records can be mistaken . - Ask the people who live round here . - It would save time . - The street 's empty , what 's left of it . - Sure ? I thought I saw an elderly couple . I 'll find out . - You go with her . This isn 't a game . - Yes , sir . She knows that . Well ... Any guesses ? Perhaps ... a V-weapon ? A V-2 bomb , a flying rocket ? It 's not either of those . The Germans cooked up some pretty queer things , much more than we ever knew about . Sir ! Sir ! There 's a place here . A kind of hole . Hurry up . You 'll get us into trouble ! I couldn 't find his long woollies , you know , his clean ones . He 'd put ' em down somewhere in all the ... Oh , I 've got to lock up ! - Well , quick , then ! - Hold that . Oh , for Pete 's sake ! Getting you two evacuated is like trying to drive wild horses ! He had to have his long woollies . He may have to wear two pairs at once . It 's cold . - Come on ! - Just a minute ! - Sorry , sir . They shouldn 't be here . - It 's all right . I want to speak to them . - YOU do ? You hadn 't thought of it . - Go ahead , then . - You 've lived here some time ? - We have . We 're the rightful occupiers and we don 't leave here for builders or bombs until we 've got to ! - You were here during the war ? - Yes , and the other one , too , the first one . You want to ask about this bomb ? Well , there 's no one here knows anything of it . There was nothing but a couple of them little fire things . Didn 't do hardly any damage . We 'd have heard the thump unless it had been a small one . - It isn 't small . - What about that house next door ? It looks as if something hit it . No , it 's just been let fall down . Oh , that roof , it 's a disgrace . And the trouble we have with creeping damp , haven 't we ? Well , how long 's it been like that ? Donkey 's years . Ever since ... You tell him . Oh , about 30 years , I reckon , sir . People won 't live in it . - Why ? - Oh , a lot of ... Some tale about it being haunted . - Haunted ? - Oh , not just a tale ! It was quite a commotion at the time . We had reporters here daily . We 'd better be getting home . You 'll want your supper , won 't you ? - Oh , thank you for your help . - Oh , yes , thanks . Can 't find anything here , sir . Only clay . - Is it hard ? - Beginning to loosen up , sir . Looks like some sort of hatch , you know . For servicing or fuelling . Burst inwards when this thing fell and got rammed full of earth . In that case , there should be a mechanism there , fuel pumps and so on . - Did you find them ? - They don 't remember anything . The old man 's senile , the old woman round the bend . She started telling him a ghost story . Still , she was right about the incendiaries . - Stand back , Gibson . - On to something ? I 'm not sure , sir . Just bring that lamp in , will you ? I think it ... It might just be a stone , sir . It 's hard and rough . Here , let me have a look . - It 's one of them . Another one ! - Go gently with it . They 're so fragile . - It 's another skull . - Careful ! Let me go ! Yes . Yes , it is one . Let me do this , please . Barbara , get the things . - Inside it ? - What 's odd about that ? It was here in the clay . When that thing fell , it got forced there by pressure . It 's almost out . Quick ! Oh , magnificent ! A beauty ! We 've found nothing like this . It 's almost intact . Here , Barbara , you take it a moment . - Intact ? - If you strike anything else , tell me at once . I 'll take it . It 's pure chance it wasn 't smashed . It must have been forced in there . Dr Roney ! - There 's another bit of fossil . - I 'll take it to him . We were right . We were right . They can 't say now you were guessing . - Quatermass ! - They found another piece . Oh , Barbara , would you ? This proves everything . Just look at that cranium ! This past week I 've been accused of everything from gross ignorance to falsification . - Roney ... - One eminent colleague went so far as to say that if I reconstructed the bones of a boiled fowl , I 'd produce a monster . Got to get all this mud away . This is no freak , nothing freakish about it . A consistent but unknown species . - It 's remarkably preserved . - Yes , isn 't it ? Far better than the first . - How ? - Huh ? - What protected it ? - Well , obviously , it was inside the ... Inside it ? Good heavens ! Well , it couldn 't have been , of course . Not for very long . It just couldn 't . Well , if that 's some sort of a bomb ... Miss Judd , that woman you questioned , was she so unreliable ? She was chattering about a haunted house . - Oh ! Which house ? - The end one . It must be straight above us . It certainly looks the part . Professor , will you come , please ? The colonel would like a word . You 'd better pack everything up , if you will . Why ? - Geiger counter ? - Yes , I just thought I 'd check . Listen to it . - What 's your reading ? - A very low level , sir . Yeah , but there is some . It 's concentrated round that end of the missile . Seems to be in the clay . Do you think the Germans were on to nuclear propulsion in 1940 ? Clever fellows , the Hun ! - Quatermass , he 's ordering us out . - That clay is radioactive . - What ? - It seems very mild , but we must make sure . - How about a lab test ? - All right . Captain Potter ! Get me a sample of earth . There , where the sergeant 's working . Well , I 'd better get packed up , then , get that new skull safely away . Right , shut it , Gibson . Let 's get out of here . Are you there , sir ? - Good evening , Officer . - You 're one of them working on the bomb ? That 's right . I thought a look round here might help . - None of this is bomb damage , sir . - Oh ? I just told that young Engineers officer . Been empty since 1927 . Worked it out . Some kind of ghost scare , wasn 't it ? That 's right , sir . Nobody would live in it . Shows how soft people can be , what with the housing shortage an ' all . 1927 . - Did you live around here then ? - Just a few streets away , sir . I was only a nipper , but I remember all the fuss . Us kids used to run and touch that front door , just for dares . There were all sorts of tales . About noises being heard . Bangs and bumps . Even things being seen . Well , you know how it is , once they start . Look , see here . This used to be the bad place . The old kitchen . Look at those scratches ! What could have caused them ? Kids . They must be bolder than in your young day . Why shouldn 't they be ? It 's all quiet now . Er ... You yourself as a boy , I ... I suppose you never witnessed anything ? - I 'd better get back on duty now , sir . - Oh , Constable , that old couple ... - Could you tell me where they 've gone ? - The Chilcots ? Yes , I 've got their address . - Ssh ! - What is it ? I thought I heard ... I did hear ! Oh , it was nothing . Let 's go . Oh , this is a strange one . - What do you see , Miss Groome ? - Well , it 's hard to say right out . I shall have to consider . There 's a sea journey here . Oh , no ! How could I leave him ? Ah . Well , let 's do his . Sometimes they go together . What 's that ? They 'll disturb it all . I suppose I 'd better . Good evening . I 'm looking for Mr and Mrs Chilcot . - Oh , they 're here . Come in . - Thank you . Good evening . My name is Quatermass . I 'm a scientist . I 'm concerned with the ... with the bomb . - Oh , have you fixed it ? - No , I 'm afraid not . - May I sit down ? - I suppose so . Want some tea ? No . No , thank you . I , er ... I really want to ask you about the house next door to yours . Oh ? - Er , Mr Chilcot ... - No , ask me . He 's just a bit , you know , getting on . Well , you remember the ... the disturbances ? - Yes . - When did they first break out ? Well ... they was worse the year after the General Strike . - 1927 ? - That 's right . But they didn 't just stop , you know . They got less and less gradual . - What form did they take ? - I thought all you scientists were sceptics . Well , we 're open-minded , most of us , or we try to be . You certainly ought to be . Did you ... Did you hear sounds ? Yes . Dreadful sounds . People couldn 't stop in the house with them . They had to go . Terrified . There was a sort of tapping and knocking . Just like some person wanting to come in . Only there wasn 't nobody there . In the floors it come and in the walls . We could hear it . Made you feel quite queer , sick . And things would move about all by theirselves in rooms that had nobody in ' em . It 's a fact ! Chairs and tables and ornaments and even the bed was moved about . They had the police in and a parson even , but it didn 't do no good . I remember one night . Earnshaw come rushing in to us - the people was called Earnshaw . Come rushing in to us , yelling like a maniac . They 'd seen something . What had they seen ? A figure . Oh , give me some more tea ! Well , I ... I 'm sorry if this is upsetting . - Those scratches on the kitchen wall ... - Have you seen them ? - Were they made by children ? - Children ! Why are you asking all this , upsetting her ? They used to come day after day , the reporters . What had I heard , what had I seen ? I got my picture in all the papers . So had he . But they didn 't believe us really . Just made us look silly . Do you believe her ? I only want to find out the truth . I 'm sure Mrs Chilcot ... Of course it 's true ! If you 're no fool , you must believe in the whole world of spirits . His future 's in there . His whole future , if we can but read it right . Well , er ... thank you , Mrs Chilcot . You ARE a sceptic ! Thank you for your help . I 'm sorry to have disturbed you . I 'll let myself out . Goodnight . Come inside . - You 've got good company . - Company ? Oh , that 's Charlie . Oh , this delay ! I just hope your colleague 's quick with those radioactivity tests . - Colleague ? - Colonel Breen . Huh , yes . I 'm sorry to say this , Quatermass , but he 's the sort of man I don 't take to at all . - Good . - Hmm ? Well , I told you my Rocket Group 's been taken over . Well , he 's the official receiver . He 's a career militarist of the worst type . Cold , efficient , just biding his time . That 's my colleague . - What have you got here ? - Just a nonsense thing . Doesn 't really work . - Oh . Did you make it ? - Mm-hm . I didn 't know you had a mechanical streak . Oh , I don 't go grubbing in the dirt all the time , you know . Oh , it does me for a hobby . Or a vice . I like to fiddle with it . Or used to when I had time . It looks like a space helmet , a popular version . No , far from it . Oh , it 's an idea I 've been chasing for quite a while . Connected with my work in a way - the study of savage peoples , their beliefs , their customs . - What does it do ? - As a matter of fact , it doesn 't do anything . Properly , that is . The principle of it ... Well , you know the old business of catching electrical discharges from the brain . I 'm trying to go further , to focus in there on the optical centres , interpret subjective impressions , see what the subject sees in the mind 's eye . Oh , I 've even got a name for it - optic encephalograph . Grand enough for the Royal Society . If only it would work ! Well , when Breen boots me out of the Rocket Group , I 'll come and help you develop it . I 'm not laughing ! To business . What are these questions of yours ? Oh , yes . Last night , I lay thinking for hours . Then you 'll need coffee in that case . What about ? - Coincidence . - Yes , it 's a troubling thing . A breeder of false theories . - Here . - Thank you . These man-apes of yours - you put their age at between three and five million years ? Well , dating 's very difficult . I 'd say nearer five . How do you work it out ? Condition of the soil ? No , their place in the evolutionary line . Oh , we know of ape-like creatures older than these , others less old , both accurately dated . But you said that this was an unknown species . If the thought 's occurring to you that they weren 't of this Earth , put it out of your mind . You 've spent too much time with rockets , Quatermass . No , these hominids , these man-apes , are new to us , but they fit into the known scheme of things . You know , they 've a line of ancestry as far back as 30 million years and I believe a clear line of descent right down to ourselves . The oddest thing about them is the shape of the skull . I 've got it all charted - points of similarity to known species . That damn girl 's put them away somewhere ! - Your Miss Judd ? - Yes . Said she wanted a couple of hours to have her hair done or something ! Answer that , would you , please ? - Roney 's office . - I want to speak to Professor Quatermass . - Speaking . - Colonel Breen wants to talk to you . Right . It 's Breen . Thank you , Sergeant . Hello ? Quatermass ? I 'm at Hobbs Lane . I 've had work restarted here with mechanical excavators . I 'm taking the level down eight to ten feet all around the missile . It 's a risk , but I thought I 'd take it to get at the thing properly . We 're getting on fine . Uncovered a lot more knobs and bumps . All seem to be harmless . - So if you care to come over here ... - Care to ? Why didn 't you let me know ? - Couldn 't find you . - You could . I left messages ! - Mechanical excavators will ruin everything ! - Have you had the result of the soil test ? Yes . It 's negative . Harwell shot the report through . I 've got it here . There 's a whole lot of irrelevant stuff in it , but that radioactivity is harmless . - What do you mean , " irrelevant " ? - I mean irrelevant ! Well , tell me what it says , man ! Well , for instance , there 's a lot about the presence of beryllium and artificial isotopes of thorium . Artificial isotopes ? - That radioactivity is man-made ! - Go on , Breen . " These would suggest the presence of a nuclear reactor . " Reactor ? " But calculations based on the half lives of such isotopes give an apparent age which is absurd . " Please submit further samples . " Do you see ? Their own word for it - " absurd " ! Never mind the absurdity . Tell me what it says . Damn you , Breen . Tell me what 's written there ! Oh . All right , I 'll be along . Well ? The apparent age of that radioactivity is five million years . Still no sign of any mechanism ? No , sir . Those other pieces of bone , that 's all there 's been . Just a smooth mass of , what is it , ceramic ? No jets , nozzles , fuel pumps , pipes . I don 't understand it . - You still think it 's a German V-weapon ? - Well , what else is there ? Colonel Breen , why didn 't you send for me ? Allowing these to be washed out of the clay ! - We had to carry on . - It was criminal ! You 've got them , haven 't you ? Falling to bits because of exposure ! Their position in the clay is so important . Pieces of thigh bone , ribs , vertebrae , all flung together ! - Isn 't that rust ? - Yes . - Be careful . - Traces of copper salts . Everywhere ! Breen ! I think perhaps I 've found your mechanism . You see those green streaks and the red ? Suppose those are your fuel pumps , nozzles , jets , corroded out of existence ? In a few years ? Not in a few years . Decaying as the radioactivity decayed . - Hey , Westie , they 're stuck ! - Eh ? - They haven 't got a clue . - Well , have YOU ? They 're the experts . This Quatermass , he 's big stuff - rockets ! So ? Look , if he 's in a bewilderment , I won 't wait to say ta-ta to this lot . Wait ! - Where have you been ? Here ! - Is Professor Quatermass here ? Quatermass ! We 've got to get these into the hut . - I 've got some information . - Inside , inside ! Get your coat off . We 've got to try and save these . Yeah ? - Have a look . - Photocopies ? I 've been doing some research . They 're from newspaper files , year 1927 . " The Knightsbridge Spook , May 18th , 1927 . " " Figure that walked through the bedroom wall . " - Why did you do this ? - Get your notebook ! I thought you seemed curious the other night . " My night of terror by Mrs Anne Chilcot . " And there she is , 30 years younger . No , I 've had enough of that . We 'd do well to make sense of the known facts like that thing out there without dragging in the supernatural . - " Spooks " and " my night of terror " ! - Sorry . I tried to help . - It 's my fault . - One complete femur , 32 centimetres long . Diameter , 8 centimetres . " Crowds around the house in Hobbs Lane became so dense that traffic was obstructed . " Lorries were unable to proceed to work being carried out nearby on the new Tube extension . " Tube extension ... Hello ! What 's all the excitement ? Well , there 's still no ticking . Right . - It 's solid . I can 't find any way through . - Let me see . Corporal , give me that lamp . Yes , sir . - What 's going on ? - We 're up against a solid bulkhead . Here , take a look for yourself . Wash it down in case there 's a sign of an opening . Sergeant , water jets ! You see , Quatermass , there 's all this to be accounted for . It 's not very likely to be solid . - A sealed compartment ? - It could be a number of things . - A warhead , for example . - For a German V-weapon ? Well , that 's a little more likely now , don 't you think ? We 'll assume that 's what it is , take routine precautions and get on with cracking the nut . Quite a nut ! It 's filling up . Sergeant ! - Bring a pump ! - Very good , sir . Come on , lads . We 'll get the pump . I could 've sworn there was another scapula . I see they 've cleared it . Don 't stand there looking , Gibson . Get a hose ! Gibson ! No , West , get inside with that hose ! - Go and make it beautiful , Westie . - Here , take this , Corporal . Right , get all this water out , will you ? - There 's no way in . Only some markings . - Markings ? Yes , all over the surface . Come on , hurry it , laddie ! Quatermass ! It 's a pentacle . - Pentacle ? - Those marks . One of the ancient cabbalistic signs . They were used in black magic . Potter , give me a hand inside . Hold on , sir . It 's as slippery as glass . West ! It ... it was ... It was a kind of figure . It went through the wall !

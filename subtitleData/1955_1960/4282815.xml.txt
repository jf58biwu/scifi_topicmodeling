 The discovery in a builders ' excavation at Knightsbridge of fossil ape bones is followed by something more sinister . What appears to be an unexploded bomb at a deeper level is investigated by Professor Bernard Quatermass and his colleague Colonel Breen . Another ape skull is found intact inside the thing itself ... while tests show that the clay contains residual radioactivity , later estimated to be five million years old . Meanwhile , struck by a fancy , Quatermass visits an empty house above the site that is reputedly haunted . And neighbours tell him about the frightening sounds and apparitions there 30 years ago . In the deepened pit , the mysterious hole is laid bare . Inside it , a compartment is found sealed off by a solid bulkhead . And certain markings on this are identified by Dr Roney as a pentacle used in ancient magic . Potter , give me a hand inside . Hold on , sir . It 's as slippery as glass . West ! It ... it was ... It was a kind of figure . It went through the wall ! Get him out of here ! - What 's the matter with the man ? Is he ill ? - He may be . All right , West . Take it easy , lad ! I thought it was the wall shining . Then it moved and come at me ! And went ... And went ... The hut ! Little Westie , he 's got the horrors . - Roney ! - What did he see ? Nothing . The confined space got him . Claustrophobia . A man like that should never have been on the squad . Just now you said something to me about those markings . - They form a pentacle . - They had something to do with black magic ? - Yes . - Now , could he have heard ? - He was inside . I don 't see how . - Nor do I. Look up there , all around . Good heavens ! They 're all over it , those cabbalistic signs . - Corporal ! - Sir ? Issue picks and start digging another three feet ! Yes , sir . You heard , boys . Keep ' em busy , don 't give ' em time to think . Psychology ! - West , wake up . Did he hit his head , sir ? - I don 't think so . - How is he ? - He just passed out . Funny thing , shock . Try this brandy . I always keep a drop in case of accidents . - Aagh ! - West , pull yourself together , lad ! Sergeant , give me a moment . Now , what did you see ? - I don 't know . - You said a figure . It was little . Like a dwarf . - A dwarf ? - Yes . It went ... crooked . Horrible ! Oh , I don 't know . Just horrible ! - Was its head tucked underneath its arm ? - Shut up ! - I did see it , sir . I did ! - Very well , very well . " The figure was small , he said . Like a monkey or a dwarf . " It seemed to cross the room and go through the wall . " - What are you reading ? - A newspaper report . " The Hobbs Lane Ghost , June 1st , 1927 . " - What ? - Did you know about that ? Had you heard of it ? No . No , I never ... 1927 ? They saw it then ? What now , sir ? We 'll get him away . He 'd better go sick for a few days . I 'll write a note to his M.O. - Oh , and Sergeant ... - Yes , sir ? - He 'd better not talk to the other men . - Very good , sir . Something here , sir . Something hard . Yeah , smooth . Like the other stuff . Grey , shiny . - This clay 's soft . - It 's all that water we 've been using . I can feel an edge curving . Where 's Captain Potter ? He 's coming now , sir . I 've sent that man off sick , sir . Well , what 's this ? I believe we 've found the cover to that hatch opening . The edge is screw-threaded , thin and coarse , just like the opening . Yes . And this must have unscrewed from the inside . Corporal , get it clear quickly ! We can use it for testing . " People in neighbouring houses told the same story . " Said Mr Parker at Number 15 , ' There have always been bad tales about Hobbs Lane , " ' but I never bothered about them till now . " ' I was born in this street and I recollect my parents having stories about ghosts . " ' It was something over a hundred years ago . " ' " Cases of alleged haunting have been reported before in Hobbs Lane , " notably in the 18th century . " Any comments , Roney ? Well , I ... I don 't usually at this time of day , but ... Well , that should be enough . No effect . It must have ! - I don 't understand . - Not even warm . - You burned it for five minutes . - I held the same spot . - I know that . - Do you want me to try again , sir ? Not with that , no . It 's a good , stout door . Ceramic material of some kind , resistant to heat up to over 3,000 degrees , harder than diamond . Every rocket engineer has wanted a heatproof casing to get through the Earth 's atmosphere . What are you trying to say ? You think the Germans made it in 1940 and lost the secret ? Ask them . Ask von Braun . Go on . Why don 't you ? What 's the boffin up to ? Gonna open it up with his little pocket knife . - Funny if it blows us all up ! - Cut it out , Gibson ! You think he knows what he 's doing , Sarge ? He doesn 't . None of ' em do this time . Breen , look ! One of these circles is etched more deeply than the others . This one , the large one . - Let me see . - Here , use this . Yes . I wonder ... - Another opening ? If it could be unscrewed ... - There 's nothing to get a purchase on . - But just one small hole would do to start it . - Diamond won 't cut it . We know that . We could try borazon . It 's several times harder . Could you get hold of a drill with a borazon bit ? I don 't know . It would mean a civilian operator . Why not ? If I could get hold of a reliable man who 'd keep his mouth shut ... - Captain Potter ! - Sir ? I don 't want any scares started . Ah ! Now , listen , listen . A thing like this apeman story can 't just fizzle out . But it has . On everybody . But it mustn 't be let to . It isn 't a ha 'p'orth of good squatting humbly outside a police barrier ! Unexploded bomb ! You want me to rush the barrier and elbow them aside while they 're taking the fuses out ? No . One , that isn 't the story . And two , I don 't believe it . - Why not , Jack ? - It doesn 't feel right . - Don 't start having hunches . - It must be a bomb . Look at their gear ! Let 's stick to the point . One minute , it 's all the greatest discovery of the age . Apemen , five million years old ! And the next minute , not a peep ! And where 's our vociferous friend Dr Roney ? - I can 't find him . - Tried ? - Yes . He 's not at the museum . - Then where ? - Here . - Where ? I got him this morning . Yes , just going through the barrier . It 's not your best , but it is Roney . - Who 's that with him ? - I don 't know . George ? I don 't know . It 's got me . Hello , Jacko . Chaps . - What 's funny ? - Nothing 's funny . You look so glum , I thought you were secretly splitting yourselves . Or is it sad lasciviousness ? - George get something dirty ? - It 's apemen . Oh , apemen . I 'm sorry . Jacko , I came to beg help . One of the " Bruin 's " glittering ideas . " James Fullalove Investigates . " Tearing into angry young men or sex in the coffee bars . No , James . I 'm in conference . Conference ? With these two ? All right , lend it some tone . - Do you know who that is ? - The fellow with the glasses ? - No , the other one . - You don 't mean ? That 's Quatermass ! Our old pal , the professor . Missing from the papers of late , but ... What 's he doing there ? Yeah , I know that face . Big brass , War Office , guided missiles . Got it - Breen , Colonel Breen ! Unexploded bomb . - Jacko ... - Huh ? - Let me in on this . - What did I say ? Can you spare the time ? Number one in my series . " James Fullalove Investigates the Apemen of Knightsbridge . " - Do you want him ? - Better not . No reflection on you , but perhaps a little spy camera ? Right , I 'll see to it . Quatermass , eh ? Yeah , I reckon this 'll cut through anything that exists . I did steel armour plate with it , six inches thick . Oh , it was legal . Bloke shut in a strongroom . I got him out . Secret job , like this one . Then I 'm glad you don 't talk about it ! What 's in behind here ? Anything dangerous ? - Probably not . - It 's OK , I 'm insured . Are you insured , sir ? It 's a good thing to be insured . At least it cheers you up . - How 's she running now , Sergeant ? - She 's OK , sir . Just that bother at the start . Better to use this than the public juice supply , just in case of an explosion . Yes . Here , what are the men up to ? Another brew-up ? Well , I let them , sir . It 's getting perishing cold down here . Can I help ? You really ought to be on your way , but thanks . It 's rather awkward with no left hand . - What did this ? - I don 't know . The sergeant 's got it , too . It looks like slight frostbite , but it can 't be . That thing doesn 't feel ... - Captain Potter , we 're ready to start ! - It 's everybody out now . - Sergeant , get the men out . - Very good , sir . Ah , Dr Roney ! Will you leave now , please , and take Miss Judd with you ? - Can 't we wait ? - Yes , but outside the barrier . - About right ? - Yes , inside the main circle for most leverage . - Right , cleared for action , sir . - Right . - What 's the matter with your hand ? - Nothing serious , sir . Is Professor Quatermass staying ? I 've asked him not to . I could make it an order . I 'm staying . In here . - Right , all out , Sergeant . - All out , sir . Come on , come on . Do you mind , sir ? Thank you , miss . And you , mate ! - Funny echo , sir . - What are you playing at ? Switch on ! Right , here we go . Try again . Aagh ! Aagh ! Aaaagh ! There 's nothing . It hasn 't made a mark ! They 're in trouble . Come on ! What happened ? He ... he 's shaken . We all are . Breen ! - God ! - It was the vibration in there . Some ... freak acoustic effect . It must have been ... Breen ! Sir ? No , it 's probably the best thing for him . Well , are you all right ? Yes . Yes , I think so . I ... We had no ... no luck with ... the drill . It wouldn 't , wouldn 't ... I must get some of Roney 's brandy . It 's stopped now . Do you know what it meant , that noise ? There 's something wrong down there . Can 't we do anything ? - Strict orders . - They know what they 're up to . Do they ? - What 's going on ? - I don 't know . They 're in trouble . - Who are you ? - Fullalove . I 'm a reporter . Oh , not now ! - See the sign , sir ? No further , please . - I 'm press . What are they doing down there ? Quatermass ! - Mind out there ! You get back ! - Is everything all right ? Roney , you recognised the pentacle down there and those other markings . How much do you know about that sort of thing ? Occult practice ? - Just a little . - Come with me . Professor ! Potter , tell Colonel Breen not to attempt anything until I come back . - I 'll try , sir . - You 'll find he 's fairly amenable at the moment . Professor Quatermass ! Corporal , back on the job ! " Alarming noises and spectral appearances ... " September , 1762 . " " Our informant further states that grievous sounds emanating from the very earth ... " have so affrighted certain fellows employed in the digging of a well that one is like to die mad . " Digging a well ? - Do any of the others mention that ? - Not that I noticed . - Finding what you want , sir ? - Yes , some , some . Street pamphlets are your best source for nonsense stories and wild rumours . - Amazing what they 'd believe in those days . - Yes , yes . Oh , more of them . Thank you . Roney ... Roney , surely it 's possible for well , ghosts , let 's call them that ... to be phenomena that were badly observed and wrongly interpreted . " One inhabitant of Hob 's Lane doth assert " he hath several times descried the apparition of an hideous goblin and once several . " And that this place is long notorious for weird happenings . " Even in 1762 . " Hob 's Lane . " Notice they all spell it H-o-b . Well , spelling was pretty rough in those days . Where have I seen that before ? Of course ! There are two name-plates on that street . The recent one spells it with two Bs like that cricketer . But the other one ... What about it ? " Hob " was one of the familiar names for the devil . - Fullalove ! - Excuse me . - We haven 't met for some time . - You followed us ? Of course . From , uh , Hobbs Lane . Professor , what have you found down there ? I 've no statement to make . Roney ... Thank you very much ! Where next ? Well , we should get some earlier evidence . - Westminster Abbey archives , I think . Let 's go . - Now look here , Fullalove ! - All right , if you want another bash , I 'm ready . - Good man . Do you think we ought , sir ? Quatermass said ... - Is he in charge ? - No , but he seemed on the track of something . Oh , did he ? Well , I 'm inclined to agree with him about one thing . What shook us all up was an acoustic disturbance caused by the shape of that interior , that polished surface . - Now look here , Potter . - Sir ? - I 'll blanket out the sound . Got any sacks ? - Yes . Sergeant ! Very good , sir . Sacks just coming along , sir . We may not need them . Is Sladden still here ? Well , yes . Sladden ! - You said your drill took no effect ? - I 'm afraid so , sir , but next time ... Look here . A hole . But I never made that . - Are you sure ? - It 's wider than my drill bit . I don 't think it 's been drilled at all . It 's sort of ... melted . - Here 's the sacks , sir . - Just dump them there . Have you got a pencil , sir ? Thank you . I don 't think it goes right through . No . It stops . Any idea where they 'd go , your boss and Professor Quatermass ? - No , I 've tried the museum . They aren 't there . - You 're ahead of me there . - Something bad ? - Do something for me . Get out of here , please ! Hurry up and get that drill clear ! - I 'm doing me best , sir . - Look out ! It 's through ! " In the winter of the year 1341 , " the Abbot of Westminster ... " Damn , my Latin 's gone ! " The Abbot of Westminster strove ... struggled against ... " against an outbreak of evil ... " at Hob 's Lane in the village of Knyghtesbrugge ? " That 's Knightsbridge , 14th-century style . - " Imps ... " Yes ? - Right . " ... and demons did appear , " foul noises sent by the devil . " What 's that ? " Sorely afflict the charcoal burners that have lately come here . " Charcoal burners ? They 'd be felling trees . Heavy ones . In 1762 , a well was being dug . In 1927 , a new Tube extension , and now ... Do you see ? They 're all disturbances of the ground . Did you spot this ? " It has long been known as a troubled place . " In 1341 . Hey , wait for me ! Can you make out anything , sir ? I 'm not sure . There 's nothing bulky , no explosive . Then it 's not a warhead . Do you mind if I look , sir ? - No , let 's get moving . - Right . Sergeant ! - Captain Potter ! - What are they doing ? Didn 't Potter tell them ? - He tried to , but something 's happened . - Colonel Breen will explain . Sladden , where are you ? We want to use some of your gear in a different way . - Look here , Breen ... - Wait a minute ! Look at this . - How did you do it ? - It just appeared . I suppose the vibrations of the drill must have affected all this material in some way . Use this . When it opened , there was a rush of air inwards . - Inwards ? - Yes . I suppose the pressure in there was lower than here or non-existent . Do you see anything ? I 'm not sure . I ... My God ! It looks like an eye . Well , it 's not moving . - Did you see it move ? - No . What do you smell ? Corruption , decomposition . When did this open ? Oh , perhaps an hour ago . - We must be quick if we want to find anything . - I 've seen to that . Right , Sergeant , stand by ! Get clear , sir . - Potter ... - Sir ? You 'd better warn your men . Things may happen . Roney , they ... They 're going to try to open that inner hatch cover . - Did you tell them ? - Yes . It must have set up subjective impressions , seeing things , as West did or ... hearing things , as several of us did . - Where 's Fullalove ? - I don 't know . He sneaked in with us . Oh , well , never mind . Listen , Jack , I can see the thing . I 'm not 50 feet from it now . I don 't know what it is . I don 't think they do either , but they 're going to open it all up ... Yes . Well , they ... They seem to be trying to unseal some sort of closed compartment . Yes , that 's right ... Yes . - It 's moving . - I was right . It is a hatch cover . Keep going . Right . - Oh , what a stench ! - Good work , Sergeant . All right , keep going . Got it , sir ! The demons . It 's all right . They 're dead . They 've been dead for a long time .

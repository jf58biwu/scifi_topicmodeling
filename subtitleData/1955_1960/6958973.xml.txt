 This is a sacred pyramid in the dead city of tikal , 300 miles south of Mexico City . Here , for thousands of years , the Maya once lived , a civilised and peaceful people with a deep-rooted knowledge of mathematics and astronomy . But one day , in the year 607 ad , this people emigrated en masse towards the distant , wild north , abandoning the sturdy dwellings , the pyramids and the temples they had built . None of the Maya came back . The cities remained deserted and the jungle slowly swallowed the streets and buildings , erasing every trace of their civilisation . The scientific expeditions that tried to shed light on these events were never able to provide a satisfactory explanation . Some believed there was an enemy invasion , but what power at that time could have defeated the Mayan people ? There are no signs of natural disasters , and what catastrophe could have forced a people to build a new kingdom , abandoning the lands where they had always lived ? The mystery still remains today and the nomadic Indians who travel across the region speak of how their ancestors fled the land to escape the wrath of a terrible goddess , a bloodthirsty goddess ... Caltiki . Caltiki the immortal monster screenplay by Philip just from a popular ancient Mexican legend look . Sefior nieto . What 's happening ? Nieto ! My god ! And ulmer , what 's happened to him ? Who knows ? What happened ? Were they attacked ? Only nieto can tell us but he 's in shock at the moment . He won 't be able to speak for several hours . It 's empty . He fired all his shots . - Who could have attacked them ? - They went to the cave near the volcano . That area 's completely deserted . What could have happened ? Maybe nieto hit ulmer . That 's ridiculous . Ulmer and nieto are like brothers . I can already see the headlines . " Two archaeologists fight a duel in the tikal caves in Mexico . " Stop it , Bob . We need to go to the cave . Ulmer could be wounded and waiting for help . Ulmer ... The mummy ... the mummy ... Caltiki ... caltiki ... Caltiki ! Caltiki ! Caltiki ... Caltiki ? Caltiki is a Mayan divinity . - Let 's go , John . - Yes , let 's go . I 'll tell Ellen to look after him . Come on . The lorry will meet us at the cave . Good bye . Do you think they 'll find him ? I don 't know . I fear something h0rrible 's happened . That 's how the Indians feel too . They 're terrified . You know what they say ? We shouldn 't have come here and we 've provoked evil spirits . I 'm worried they 'll end up abandoning us if we don 't leave soon . I 'll tell John when he gets back but I know it 's pointless . And nieto ... How is he ? He 's still delirious . He keeps on repeating the same name . Caltiki . Yes , caltiki . Then he calls out for ulmer . It 's very distressing . Ulmer ... Can you hear him ? It 's best if we stay close to him . Ulmer ! Ulmer ! We 've already looked everywhere . Where could he have got to ? Ulmer ! It 's an inscription in Mayan characters . The ground 's given way here . There 's an opening . The eruption the other day must have opened it . Come here . Look . There are steps . They must have come this way . Give me the geiger counter . They 're ruins of ancient buildings . - Do you think there 's radiation ? - No , but it 's best to be sure . Come on , hurry up with that contraption . That 's the goddess caltiki . We 're in an underground Mayan temple . - That 's an amazing discovery . - Caltiki ? That 's the name nieto kept saying . They 've definitely been here . Wait a minute . Look at the dial . It 's showing high radioactivity . It must be coming from something in the water . This must be a sacred lake where priests drowned the victims they sacrificed to the goddess . If only I had my underwater gear . Maybe ulmer fell in there . This is his camera . - Show me . - No doubt . - It 's definitely his . - He must have dropped it . Yes , the lens is cracked . We need to explore the bottom of the lake . We must go back to the camp and get our diving gear . Before you give up on a search you have to try everything . Let 's go . How 's nieto ? Worse . His temperature 's rising . It 's very worrying . We must do everything we can to save him . Bob 's developed the film ulmer shot . Maybe we can work out what happened . Yes , maybe . Go and set up the projector . All right . - Can we begin ? - Yes , of course . Go ahead . Who filmed them ? The Indian who went with them to the cave entrance . - Did you question him ? - Yes , but he doesn 't know anything . He left them there and came back . Poor ulmer . Who knows where he 's got to ? Look . The eruption was still going on . There are the stairs we found this morning . Ulmer filmed this part . Look , that 's the goddess caltiki down there . What 's he found ? It looks like a bracelet . - What 's happening ? - Who knows ? Something must have hit ulmer . They 're in danger . They 've been attacked . Isn 't there any more ? This is all there is . These people are driving me crazy . I should never have come here . It was supposed to be a second honeymoon . How could I have known ? I 've been asking you to take me away for a while now . But work always comes first for you . I can 't stand it any more . I 'm going back to Mexico City tomorrow . Go on . I won 't make you stay with me even though you 're my wife . - I 'd have hoped you 'd understand . - You don 't even remember I exist . I 've got responsibilities . Duties . Not to mention the very important discovery we made today . An important discovery ? One man 's dead and another one 's dying . That 's exactly why we 've got to carry on . At least they won 't have died for nothing . What the devil are the natives up to this evening ? It 's a spell to placate the anger of evil spirits . A sacred dance ? Let 's go and see . I 'm not interested . - No , hold on . - Why ? What is it ? A white person can 't join in the ritual . It would bring bad luck . Not to me . Ellen , I 'm very sorry for what you 're going through . What does that mean ? Sorry , but I heard everything John said to you . I think he 's behaving very badly . - I thought you were John 's friend . - Yes , I am . But I 'm fond of you too and I 'd like to see you happy . A woman can 't live like this . You 're a very sensitive creature . You need warmth and affection . I think you 've taken our discussion too seriously . Maybe . But I hope one day you 'll seek refuge in my arms . Don 't kid yourself , Max . Good night . You didn 't have much success . Stop spying on me . Is this how you hope to conquer that little millionairess doll ? Poor Max , you 're aiming too high . So are you . I haven 't managed to get rid of you since I pulled you out of that third-rate joint . You 've no right to treat me like this . You promised me ... Men promise all sorts of things to someone like you . And anyway , I 'm sure I wasn 't the first . That 's true . I 've never hidden my past from you . But you won 't get rid of me that easily . I don 't want to lose you , Max . If you 're trying to tell me you 're looking for a husband , take me off the list . Find yourself a half-breed , someone like you . John . John ? Yes , darling ? Will you forgive me ? Forgive me . Both of our nerves are in shreds , unfortunately . But they say a good argument every now and then is the key to a happy marriage . I 'm sorry , darling , it was all my fault . I 'm moody , it 's true , but you knew that before you married me . And I spend more time on biology than with my wife . But I 'll change , you 'll see . Tomorrow we have to get back to our research . But I 'll make sure you and Linda can go back to Mexico City straightaway . Do you really want that , John ? Yes , darling , I 'd prefer that . - Pass me the tank . - Have you checked it ? Yes , all ready . I don 't like that lady . Luckily I 've taken precautions . Be careful . Up . There 's treasure at the bottom of the lake . We 're rich . We 're billionaires . They 're pre-columbian-style necklaces . They 'd have adorned the victims offered to the goddess . Who knows how many people drowned in there , all covered in gold and jewels ? - And ulmer ? - There 's no sign of him . Maybe I should go back down and ... No , I don 't want you taking any more risks . Who cares about risks with all that treasure down there ? Bob 's right . Well , be quick , then . I can 't wait to get out of this cave . Ok . Let 's go . I don 't want him to stay too long . Let 's pull him up . Something 's happened . Come on , you pull too . Go on , pull ! Easy . Nice and slow . Come on ! Look . Look , sefior . Look . Quick , up the stairs ! John , we 've left the bag with the jewels . Wait for me . No , Max ! You 're crazy . Come on , Max . We 're safe . We made it . Hey , you . Quick , come over here . Take him away . Don 't touch his arm , it 's dangerous . If you 'd been an hour longer we couldn 't have done anything for him . Luckily we managed to radio a plane . This case is completely unprecedented . An unknown being has entered the tissues of his arm and absorbed his vital fluids . Do you think there 's still hope of saving Max ? I hope so . But as a talented biologist you must help us determine the nature of this monstrous thing . What you 're telling me seems unreal . But your hypothesis is correct . It 's extraordinary . You take a look , professor fielding . I 'm telling you again that this is not a known organism but a fragment of an animal made up of a single gigantic cell . Quite so , but do you realise the audacity of your claim ? The discovery of a unicellular being like this would be a revolution in the field of biology . But an organism like this would need millennia to develop in this way . Can we establish its age ? - Yes , of course . Come with me . - Thank you . This apparatus is the fruit of 20 years of research . It 's an electronic brain that uses an isotope , carbon-14 , to reveal the age of any body , even a living one . In a few seconds we 'll know which period the fragment comes from . It 's amazing . You check the results too , please . Three , six , nine , ten , eleven ... No , it 's not possible . We 've never had a result like this with a living thing . 14,15 ... But ... professor ... 15 megavolts . That 's incredible . It can 't be a mistake . This fragment , this being , this cell must be 20 million years old . Prehistoric creatures still alive biologist 's incredible discovery professor fielding holds scientific conference gentlemen , our expedition had one purpose , to shed light on the reasons , in 607 ad , for the great migration of the Mayan people . During our research , and unfortunately following serious incidents , we discovered the mysterious being the newspapers are talking about and recovered a fragment of it . The journalists may have exaggerated in their deductions , but everything makes us think we have come across a living prehistoric being from the early geological eras . And this , gentlemen , is not all . Even more astonishing is the Mayan inscription we photographed at tikal . It says ... " Caltiki is one and immortal . " " When her bridegroom comes from the sky , " " the power of caltiki will destroy the world . " This description fits with the mysterious being 's characteristics . Caltiki is one and the being is unicellular . Caltiki is immortal . This being 's age is inconceivable to us . If I could leave scientific rigour aside , I 'd tell you that I brought a piece of caltiki 's body back with me . Ellen . - Ellen ! - Run to daddy . - Daddy ! - Welcome back , darling . My little treasure . Have you been good today ? Yes . Mama gave me a Teddy bear . Really ? Aren 't you going to show me ? Not now . He 's sleeping because he was very tired . No , don 't touch the bag . - Go to mama . - Come on , Jenny , it 's time for bed . Bed with your Teddy . - Don 't let Jenny go in my study . - Why ? Please , darling , on no account must she go in . Go with your nanny . - Bye , mama . - Bye , darling . What 's that ? It 's the piece of the monster that the professor detached from Max 's arm . Why are you keeping it ? Isn 't it best to destroy it ? I have to keep it under observation . We 've done some tests but we still don 't know enough about it . What 's made it live for this incalculable number of years ? And what guides it unerringly towards the organisms it drains of life ? If I can answer these two questions , maybe I can break new ground in biology . - How is Max now ? - Very sick . His life depends on the results of my work . It 's the only hope of saving him . And unfortunately it 's a slender hope . Linda , you mustn 't be disheartened . You should never give up hope . He 's regained consciousness . But he 's so strange . Sometimes he screams in pain . Then he turns , looks at me and laughs . And his arm . My god , his arm . It 's so horrible . - You need to rest a bit now . - Yes . Thank you . Come and stay with us until Max is better . Hello , Max . You 've had a very narrow escape . How 's nieto ? Oh , he 's better . Much better . He 's back on his feet and he 'll be at work again in a few days . You 're such a bad liar . He 's dead , isn 't he ? Yes . But you 're not going to die , Max . We 're going to cure you . Have you seen my arm and my face ? How am I supposed to kid myself ? Max , you need to have faith . - We 'll do the impossible , you 'll see . - Sure . Sure , you 'll use me as a Guinea pig and I 'll die like the others . It was madness to go into that cave . We 'll pay dearly for this , you 'll see . All of us . All of us . Calm down and drink this . It 'll do you good . No . I don 't want to . So , professor , the results of the diagnosis ? We 're in unknown territory here , mr fielding . The medical treatments available are clearly insufficient . It 's difficult to make a diagnosis . Why ? It looks like a third-degree burn but the tissue feels like parchment . As for the skin , it 's as if it 's been ... - Mummified . - Yes , that 's right . Mummified . Exactly . And the process has been very quick . It 's an incredible story . Yes , you 're right , professor . I wouldn 't believe it if I hadn 't seen it for myself . - But there 's worse to come . - What ? The poison has definitely entered the bloodstream and unfortunately ... Unfortunately ? Unfortunately we must expect it sooner or later to reach the brain . Oh , well ... Miss , tell professor Perez that the operating theatre is free . If we accept the theory that , millions of years ago , a primordial cell developed in a different way from all the others ... The amoebas had a similar structure to the being in the cave . Primitive unicellular beings developed by combining with similar creatures . But this cell could have got bigger without combining with any others . What natural biological force could have caused this abnormal development ? Oh , it 's you , Ellen . - John , darling , it 's late . - What time is it ? It 's almost one . Don 't you think you should get some rest ? No , not right now . I feel I 'm on the right track but I still can 't grasp the real substance of this being . What 's worrying you ? I need to keep analysing the material it 's made from and discover why it destroys every organism it comes into contact with . I 'll find a cure for Max 's condition . I can 't abandon him . Today the professor told me that he 's in danger of going insane . I have to find out why . It would be crazy to give up . So you intend to work all night ? Yes , darling . You know how much I love you . All of this is very important for me . I need to succeed . Good luck , darling . But perhaps ... Why not ? This could be it . There had been a big eruption and you know that the whole area is volcanic . We detected gamma radiation in the caves . Maybe that 's the source of that being 's energy . Radioactivity . But we can 't be sure unless we subject it to electron bombardment . Can you get hold of the betatron for me ? I 'll sort it out . You 'll have it this evening . Thank you . I 'm counting on you , professor . It 's very urgent . Ready ? If the conclusions I 've drawn are correct , under the influence of radioactivity that little fragment should definitely show signs of life . Start it up . The generators started , professor . Radioactivity zero six rad . Zero seven rad . Zero eight rad . Stop . Quickly . Generator back to zero , professor . Once the radioactivity stops , it will appear to be hibernating . But with a more intense charge I believe that it could not only develop more , but even reproduce . Linda ? Yes , darling ? You 're very caring . Everybody 's so kind to me . They 're trying to help you . I 'm sure . They 're afraid now . They 've realised what I 'm worth and they 've also realised that they 've ... They 've stopped exploiting me and making money from my work . Because it 's different now . Now they need to deal with me . Even that woman . That woman who dared to scorn me . Don 't think about her . I 'm here with you . She 'll be sorry she treated me like that . They 'll all pay for this , you 'll see . I 've been ill , I 've suffered , but now I 'm strong . I 'm stronger than all of you . You 'll be better off on my side . Remember that . Linda , how are you ? My god , you 're exhausted . Would you like a coffee ? No , thank you . Don 't worry about me , it 's not worth it . You shouldn 't torment yourself like this or you 'll end up being ill too . Today Max said some very strange things to me . He frightened me . It 's only natural in his condition . It 's up to you to cheer him up . There 's no point . He won 't listen to me any more . He hates me . He 's ashamed of me because I 'm ... a half-breed . - And he 's in love with you . - That 's ridiculous . I heard him that evening at the camp . He was trying to woo you . I 'm not surprised . You 've got everything I don 't have . You 're a lady , you 're rich . And you 're beautiful too . With me Max behaved the way he behaves with all women . Sorry to be blunt , but he 's not the man for you . He doesn 't deserve you . You should leave him . Leave him ? How can I leave him when he 's in that state ? One day he 'll be well and you 'll be free . Free and happy . Happy ? My happiness is with him . I know very well what he 's worth , but I love him . I 'd do anything for him . Anything so I don 't lose him . Yes ? That 's me . No , my husband isn 't here . Then you come , madam . Come to the hospital now . It 's about Max Gunther . What 's happened ? Has there been an accident ? Ellen , what is it ? Is it Max ? Has something happened ? Don 't worry , we 'll come right away . Was that the hospital ? Yes , they want us there now but they didn 't explain why . - Please stay calm , madam . - What 's happened , doctor ? Where 's Max ? Max ... where is he ? Where 's Max ? I don 't know . We 've searched everywhere . Come on , Linda . - Who 's that woman ? - Gunther 's wife , I think . Put all the street patrols on alert . We 're looking for a 33-year-old man , medium height , blond hair , blue eyes , wounded ... - In the right arm . - In the right arm . Dangerous . Dolores , come indoors and help me . What are you thinking ? The inscription said , " caltiki is one and immortal . " And these words contain a scientific truth . But who will her bridegroom from the sky be ? The one who , according to the inscription , will give caltiki infinite power to destroy the world . Aren 't you putting too much faith in the scientific minds of the Maya ? Well , who knows ? Maybe they knew more about this than we do . - Are you still immersed in your research ? - Hello , darling . We 've abandoned that now . We 're reduced to solving puzzles . We 're looking for a bridegroom . Is he that hard to find ? It seems he comes from the sky . Whatever you 're looking for , I hope you find it soon . You 've kidnapped my husband for a week now . I 'm truly mortified but I can 't do without his help . - Good night . - Good night . Good night . - I 'll see you tomorrow , then . - See you tomorrow . Sorry , darling . Hello ? Yes , it 's me , fielding . Who is it , John ? What ? Are you sure ? It filled the whole room and destroyed the betatron . It 's still growing . We don 't know how to stop it . Come right away . Set fire to it . Set fire to the whole laboratory . There 's no time to lose . I 'm on my way . - I have to go . - But , John ... The bridegroom from the sky . What does that mean , professor ? I don 't know . But I want to try something else . You want to know if there was a celestial phenomenon in the year 607 ad ? - Yes . - Strange you should ask . It 's interesting because it was the year of the Mayan migration . The passage of a comet was recorded . It was seen in Byzantium by the emperor justinian 's astronomers . The ancients called it arsinoé . They classified it as a malign star because it brought severe disruption and was covered by a radioactive cloud . So this caused an increase in atmospheric radioactivity ? We don 't have accurate data about it , but I 'll be able to give you that tomorrow . Why tomorrow ? Because tonight earth is in the same conditions as it was in the year 607 . In a few hours that comet will pass very close to us . The same comet ? Tonight ? Yes . That 's why I found your request so strange . Arsinoé comes near to us in its cycle every 1,352 years . We 're observing it right now . Arsinoé ... the bridegroom from the sky . That 's the cause of the Mayan migration . Radioactivity increased and activated the monster 's power . The area around the cavern was filled with terrifying bloodthirsty beings . The same danger is threatening us now . The radioactivity will make the fragments of the monster grow . Operator ? Professor fielding 's line . 3679 . - He 's not answering . - Try again . I need to speak to him urgently . 3679 is disconnected . We must hurry . I 'm going to fielding 's house . Go to the betatron . We need to destroy the fragments of the monster . When we arrived the betatron was in pieces and the watchman was dead . A new victim , like Bob and the others . Maybe he inadvertently started up the generator , making the monster grow . But we 'll never know . Nobody must touch him , for any reason . It could be dangerous . It 's astonishing how quickly the fragment developed . Another few minutes and I don 't know what would have happened . Inform his family . When her bridegroom comes from the sky , the power of caltiki will destroy the world . Mama ! Mama ! Mama . What is it , sweetheart ? Why aren 't you asleep ? I saw a man . A bad man . Jenny , there 's no bad man here . You mustn 't be afraid . But I saw him . You were dreaming , my love . Now lie down and close your little eyes . Mama will stay with you until you fall asleep . All right ? Sleep now , sweetheart . Have a lovely sleep . Linda ! Sorry , I didn 't mean to frighten you , Ellen . I couldn 't sleep and I was hungry . We 're all on edge . The little one woke up too . She was crying and said she 'd seen a man . It must have been a nightmare . - Yes , no doubt . Good night . - Good night . Max ? Max , I 've brought you something to eat . Did they see you ? No , don 't worry . Nobody knows that you 're here . - Max , you need to listen to me . - Start again . I love you and you know that . But you can 't stay here . Are you going to turn me in ? No , Max , I 'll never betray you . And John is your friend too . John " . He 'd be the first to report me . You 're wrong . You don 't know how much he 's done for you . Maybe you don 't realise now , but when you 're back to normal ... So I 'm not normal now ? Do you think I 'm mad too ? Remember , if you say one word , I 'll kill you . You 're here . Professor Rodriguez has gone to your house . How come ? He tried to call but your phone 's cut off . - The observatory gave us disturbing news . - What about ? Right now a comet 's passing very close to earth . It causes an increase in atmospheric radioactivity . It 's already reached zero eight rad . My god ... That fragment at my house ... Call the police and the army . We need flamethrowers . That monster can only be destroyed with fire . John ? Max ... Don 't run away , it 's pointless . No , Max . Don 't do this . I thought you were my friend . You 're so beautiful . Don 't be a fool . You were wrong to leave the hospital before you were better . After all the trouble we 've gone to for you . Why are you trying to run away from me , Ellen ? Do I disgust you ? No . Calm down . I 'll call Linda . She 'll be happy to see you again , you 'll see . She 's already seen me . She 's the one who helped me and hid me . But I don 't need her any more now . What do I care about her ? You 're the only woman I want , Ellen . And you 'll be mine . You 'll come away with me now . The telephone 's disconnected . I cut off the electricity . Nobody can come to your aid . - You 're in my power . - No ! Let me go ! - Help ! Linda ! Linda ! - Ellen ... Max , you promised me you wouldn 't come here . Get out of my way . Give me that pistol right now . I won 't let you hurt her . Stay where you are ! No , Max ! No ! Linda ... Linda ... Murderer ! Now you 'll do what I want . Obey me or I 'll kill your little girl too . John fielding ! I heard you . Come out ! Help ! John ! John ! Mama . - Mama , what is it ? - Nothing . Come on . Come on . Stop ! Stop ! That 's it . Good girl . Running a roadblock , resisting public order ... If you 're lucky you 'll get three months , sefion listen to me , inspector . I 'm professor John fielding , British citizen . Please let me go immediately . My wife and daughter are in danger . I don 't doubt that with a husband like you . Inspector , there are monstrous beings in the house that nobody 's seen before now . I can 't explain right now but they 're dangerous , not only for my family but for the entire city . - Get this madman out of my sight . - Inspector , listen to me . Take him away . If he kicks up a fuss , put him in a cell . Let me go ! Call the British embassy . Do something or you 'll regret it . For the love of god , open up ! Follow him ! Stop ! Stop ! There ! Over there ! Get him ! Get in the Jeep ! - Where are you taking me , mama ? - Quiet now , Jenny . Quiet now . - Mama , where 's daddy ? - He 's coming now . Attention . Attention . This is a message from the armed forces command . The city is in a state of alert . No-one is to enter the Southern district . Army tank divisions and flamethrower squads will be approaching professor fielding 's house . Clear the roads so that military vehicles can pass . No-one is to leave their home until further orders . People are asked to keep calm and all measures have been taken to confront the danger threatening the city . John ... Ellen ! Ellen ! Help , John . We 're here . I 'm coming . John ! John , help us ! Oh , god . Everybody , go ! Stop shooting , it 's pointless . We need flamethrowers . What is it ? Inspector , that englishman was right . The garden 's full of monsters . I know . The alarm 's been raised . The army will be here in a few minutes . Recall all our men . Tell them to keep out of the garden . We need to wait for the flamethrowers . Go ! Let 's go . Everybody out ! Surround the house . Get back , men . Make room for the flamethrowers . Quick ! Go ! - Look . There 's a way through . - Where are you going ? John ! Let me go ! - He 's crazy . - He 'll be burned alive . Stop firing ! - John ! - I 'm here , Ellen . Be quick . It 's breaking through the door ! Quick ! Give me the little one . - Daddy ! - I 've got you . Come on , quick . Quick . No ... Hold on tight . - They 're safe . - Quick , this way . Start firing again . Look , it 's enormous ! Get back ! Everybody , get back ! The city 's in danger . Send the tanks in and destroy everything . Advance from the north . Break down the perimeter wall . Group two , advance across the garden . Groups three and four , ready for action . Group five , don 't shoot . Use your flamethrowers . Order the tanks to use flamethrowers . All tanks , open fire ! Message from the operation command . The danger is over . We 're clearing the area . You can suspend the state of emergency . The companies are returning to base . Jenny 's gone to sleep . Please take us away from here . Yes , we can go now . You 've nothing to be afraid of now , darling . Caltiki is destroyed forever . The end

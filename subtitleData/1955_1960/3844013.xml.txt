In this ring there will be ... labs and living quarters . But it 's possible that this can be a hotel for businessmen . I imagine there wouldn 't be just a few . - Look here . - What is this ? These are letters . Letters from fans of space . Doctors , pioneers , engineers , miners write . In a word all ages and all professions . Here is a letter . This one is written by a " mature " person . He is already 13 years old . A Boy Scout . Very " experienced " . He wrote that he 's flown on a plane , a helicopter- - And now he wants to fly in a rocket ? He demands it ! The latest space fashion . Meet , our film operator , Aleksandr Listopat . Troyan . The costume is elegant . And moreover reliable . It protects from the cold of space and the sun . And a visor to protect from the sun . You want to try it on ? - Me ? - Are you afraid .

Kiss the kids . Yevgeni Peterovich . The heads of the Rocket Institute have asked me to say have a good flight . They have asked me to give you a farewell speech but I 'll just shake your hand . It is time , Yevgeni Peterovich . Good luck . Can you move a little to the right ? Maybe you take off the cover . Cover ? Oh , yeah , of course . Tell me , what is your name ? Olga . I 'm Aleksandr . A film operator . I want to film a story about the satellite . - I ... . - You are a science worker . What made you decide that ? Your magazine has such complicated articles , that it makes my head dizzy . I am a student . I 'm here for practice at the observatory . What is this ? This is the subject of my dissertation . The study of small space objects . What we call like meteors . Adonis , Cara and Mora . What , nervous ? A little bit . We can go back . It isn 't too late . What are you talking about ? Yevgeni Peterovich . But there in your " sky shop " it 's so " hot " . I don 't believe it . Attention . Be ready . Navigation station : Verify readiness for start . I 'm ready to receive . Ready . - First is ready . - Novosilkavo City , ready . Kubichev ready . - Leningrad , ready . - Kharkov , ready . - Moscow , ready . - Kiev , is now ready . Attention . Start . FLIGHT 17 . EARTH - SPACE STATION : ALL ACCORDING TO SCHEDULE AND PLAN . Welcome . Hello , Earthlings , meet me ! You 've forgotten to wear you magnet shoes . Ship . I congratulate you . I 'm jealous . We promise to send you everyday a radio transmission : Attention , attention speaking from space . - Kind of you . - Of course exchange with Earth 's voice . Of course . By the way , Our service predicts a meeting here . - You can meet the meteors here . - The meeting is not nice . We will try it as safely as possible . Well , this is the last step of the preparations . We require engineer Gordienko . I know I 'm waiting for him . Vasiliy Matveevich , Somebody wants to speak with you . - All right , open it . - Here it is . - Verst ? The correspondent of a large media corporation Astronaut , sportsman . He 's an important person . Interesting to listen to him . Let 's listen . Good evening , Mr. Demchenko . Very pleased to meet you . Very nice . And I am very glad to meet you Mr. Verst . Klark and I have decided to make a small trip into space . Is it possible for you to receive our rocket to the space station ? Next Thursday . You 're welcome . The space station is open for all . I am grateful to you . Until our meeting ... - On your " moon " . - Goodbye . - You want to underground ? - No , I want to be under the stars . - I 'm very glad . - Why ? Since you don 't want to go below that means no one is waiting for you . - Well , now I want to go under . - Why ? Because , here , there is nowhere to escape from you . I don 't think they will be very pleased with our coming . I thank for the meeting and for the pleasant reception . But we are businessmen . Allow me to speak this table about work . Please , Mr. Verst . Business is business . First of all , I wanted to tell you about the aim of our visit . Klark and I have decided to trek to Mars . Yes , gentlemen . We are flying to Mars . Well , from the bottom of my heart I wish you luck . I thank you . You know , with you message , you 've made us seriously interested . For such news any reporter would pay a lot . This is news with a capital " N " . And you know , I was just about to tell you this news but then ... I just recalled , fortunately , your impressive tradition : At first , do it and then later the sensation . - Correct ? - Completely . Continue . Continue . Oh , you think that I am full of sensation ? Allow me to make a request . For the mission to Mars , we wanted to use the launch pad from your space station . Please , please do , we are ready to help out . And we are always pleased with fellow travellers . We are also flying to Mars . Are you joking ? Not at all . The ship . Please this way . But why didn 't you announce the flight ? That is also a very remarkable tradition , Mr. Verst . First do it and then the sensation . Or as they say in Ukraine : First jump and then say " oops " . - When do you start ? - If it 's not a secret . We are waiting for necessary positions of the planets . According to our calculations the start time will be Wednesday , next week . And you when ? Our take off day is a secret . Well , it 's already late . All the best . - Goodnight . - Goodnight . I must contact Kharkim . I hate this news . And you think Kharkim will like it ? - Yes ? Please . - May I ? - I 'm not bothering you ? - No , no , please have a seat . Thank you . We 've both heard about each other forever . - And this is the first meeting . - Let 's get to know one another closer . You are an astronaut . I 'm an astronaut . Yes , I 've read a lot about you . Mr. Klark ... I have wanted to ask you for a long time ... Ask . How could you land on a rocket at El Paso ? By my calculations you should have passed El Paso and have landed near Japan . That 's what it cost me . I was howling from the pain but I put on the brakes . I put on the brakes just to land at El Paso even if I crashed . - Your mother ? - Yes . She is my guardian angel . When my father died and we lost everything my mother dedicated her whole life me . She made me what I am . That was harder then flying to the moon . I repeat Mr. Verst , don 't stop . You will proceed quickly . Mr. Kharkim , as far as I understand- - You understand nothing . The navigation station would receive the order to recalculate everything . We can not risk wasting anymore time . But we risk lives . That is your duty . No more arguments . Mr. Kharkim . Mr. Kharkim ! Mr. Klark , you know that we are flying to Mars . Between Earth and Mars we 've put in a radio connection . And using this you can easily control your course . I don 't understand you . We are opponents in groundbreaking competition . And you are worried that I don 't lose ? We have a great task . To open a path to other planets . To increase our knowledge of other worlds . To make space serve the people of Earth . Isn 't that wonderful ? If I tell Mr. Kharkim about that he will send me away to the crazy house . And if you tell Mr. Kharkim that we are joining forces in order to achieve our common aim . He will also put you into a crazy house ? No , he would put me behind bars . This is just between us , Mr. Kornev . A pity . It 's a pity that between us is a barrier and not friendship , Mr. Klark . - Understand , we must fly . - I wish you luck . - Yes . - Mr . Kornev . Goodnight . - Wednesday , we fly . - What ? Yes , and quickly . Kharkim yelled such that it wasn 't even necessary for the radio . If we fly with the planets in such a position there might not be enough fuel . But if we refuse Kharkim we won 't be flying to Mars , but to hell . What 's with you , Robert ? Forgotten how to take risks ? You want to teach how to take risks again ? Get ready . Mr. Somov , we are taking off . Why so suddenly ? It 's an order . Wait a moment . I must call ground control . No time . See you soon on Mars . Immediately leave the takeoff platform , we are taking off . Robert , Kharkim 'll give the order but we aren 't ready . I must warn everyone . Robert , God be with you . Attention . Ignition . Breaking news . Sensation in space . Typhoon has gone to Mars . The stars are winking at our guys . The Big Bear constellation is waving with its paw . Today poor . Tomorrow a millionaire . Buy land on Mars . It 's so , so cheap . Only with the Space Syndicate . The Space Syndicate . Ten dollars an acre . Ten dollars a acre . Buy land on Mars . Ladies and gentlemen , drink this space cocktail . The firm guarantees after the second glass We can achieve the condition of total weightlessness . And you can produce only one sound : Drink . Drink . Drink . Two glasses and you 're in space . Every 30 minutes we will repeat this transmission . From our special correspondent Verst who is aboard the ship travelling to Mars . Listen to Herman Verst . We 've passed the first million kilometres . No one 's disturbed the proud flight of our rocket . The sun is similar to a red-headed girl . Smiling and welcoming ... our victory in space . So what do you say ? To risk for a sensation , I don 't understand it . Listen . We have to speak with Somov . It 's better if you do it . Yeah , right . Understood . - How do you feel ? - A little in the head . In general I 'm ready to fly , like , today . Yes ? You- - Why , Yevgeni Peterovich ? I am completely healthy . Really , Gregory ? Lena Mikhailovna , tell them what you think . Gregory Vasilivich , you can 't fly , not tomorrow or the day after . After such trauma , you have to stay in bed . - But Lena Mikhailovna ... - I 'm a doctor . Another must fly . We will not risk your life . Andrei Gordienko will fly . I didn 't think that it would be so hard to part . I also didn 't think . I forgot , what about ... . Andrei . Don 't be angry but it seems to me that you aren 't upset about being apart . Even glad . What , Lena , I 'm upset . Honestly , I 'm upset . I see . I see . And understand . - And forgive . - Lena . I am so afraid for you . - Lena . - Andrei . What 's this ? Everything will be all right . We 'll return . It 's time . Well . Goodbye . Goodbye , Andrei . - Thanks . - Goodbye , take care of yourself . Have a safe journey , Yevgeni Peterovich . Get better . Here , Yevgeni , soil from your native land . Let it always be with you . Thank you . - Check the instruments . - Aye-aye . - Instruments are in order . - Get ready . Nervous ? Nervous . Attention . Takeoff position . Moscow speaking . Moscow speaking . The Soviet people congratulate you on the space ship " Rodina " And we wish you success on your daring journey to unknown worlds of the Universe . On this flight a lot of space separates you from your native land . But the thoughts and feelings of all Earthlings , your friends , will always be with you . Good luck , dear comrades . What are the instruments showing ? Just a second . Radiation ? What is this , Yevgeni Peterovich ? - Amulet ? - Talisman . You have a talisman ? Soil from my native land , Andrei . Our Earth . - By the way , you haven 't forgot ? - What ? We have a date today . Yes , a date with your old friend , wait , I 'm initiating , one second . Hello , tribesman . Young and unknown friend . Hello , dream ! Yevgeni Peterovich , that is also your baby ? This is flying our youth . You 'll hear from me again in one hour . Damn the wise guy who created these advertising transmissions . This means , old fellow , I 'm extremely tired . My imagination is finished . Where can I find here some breaking news ? Breaking news . Breaking news . You need a sensation , Verst ? There is . We 're off course . Are you crazy . Nobody trusts you . Our navigation system has gone haywire . It 's let us down . What ? - Are you joking , Robert . - I 'm not joking , Herman . We are off course and instead of Mars , we are headed towards the sun . Look , isn 't that breaking news ? What are you waiting for ? Do something . We 've already gone through the one third of fuel tank . What will happen ? - Robert ? - Calm down . We will try to figure it out . Sit down . Accelerate the engine . Get into start position . - Start ready . - Ignite . Andrei . Mars . SOS signal . Who is it ? " Typhoon " speaking . " Typhoon " speaking . We 're in trouble . We 're in trouble . Our coordinates according to the star Sirius are 24 point 5 . 97 point 3 . Help us . " Typhoon " speaking . The distance to " Typhoon " ? Twelve point four . Meteor Belt ? The density of the meteor belt has increased . Fuel ? Acceleration will be high , Yevgeni Peterovich . - We 'll take the risk . - Of course . People are in danger . Set a course to " Typhoon " . Aye-aye . Send a message to Earth we are coming to the rescue . Turn on the radar . Aye-aye , turning on radar . - Attention . - Aye-aye . - Get into start position . - Aye-aye . Engage . Power up the engine . This is " Typhoon " . This is " Typhoon " . Help us . We are heading towards the sun . We are heading towards the sun . Why is no one answering ? The help signal . No , Herman , that is a new danger signal . We are entering a meteor shower . What 's going to happen ? That is a question , old fellow , I can answer that only in heaven . Death . Live . Live ... " Rodina " speaking . " Rodina " speaking . We are coming to help you . We are coming to help . Hold on . Don 't loose hope . " Typhoon " speaking . " Typhoon " speaking . Can you hear me ? Quickly get away from us to a distance . We are in a meteor shower . We- - Quickly get away from us . Can you hear me ? Say hello to Earth and shake its hand . Well , will we take the risk ? What are you saying ? Herman Verst , that 's all . This is the end . What 's wrong with you ? I knew you were a man . I have no regrets . Only my dear mother waits for me . Moscow speaking . Listen to an emergency message . The space ship " Rodina " , is flying to help the ship " Typhoon " . - That 's them ? - Yes . - I am so worried . - And me too . How many years have I been worried . And die with him . You see ? He 's still alive . Attention . Bring us in closer . Get ready . Yevgeni Peterovich . I 'm ready . Maybe I 'll go , Andrei . You are the head of the ship . - Remember ... - Yes . Careful and once more careful . All right , until later . I 'm off . - Herman . - Let 's hurry . We have only a few minutes . SHIP : RODINA USSR . Yes , this is what I was afraid of . What is it , Yevgeni Peterovich ? We have used up way too much fuel . Why are they silent ? What 's happened ? Really , it 's a misfortune . I don 't believe it . I don 't believe it . No . Vasiliy Matveevich , wonderful news . Only I don 't know whether to smile or cry . We have used up all our reserves of fuel . The landing on Mars seems to be ending in catastrophe . We found an asteroid , Ikar , that is crossing the orbits of Mars and Earth . We approached it and landed on it . So Earth has received our message . They are sending us a rocket with a reserve of fuel . Yevgeni Peterovich . On those rocks we will install a radar for the rocket . Attention . Satellite , acknowledge if you are ready . The satellite is ready to be sent in an unmanned rocket to Ikar . Giving the order to take off . Mars . There is it . The famous Martial canals . It 's insulting . We have travelled a million kilometres and we are stopped right at the gate . You know , in the depth of your hearts you hate us . Let this be a cruel but useful lesson about useless competitions . Well , I think that 's all . Let 's sit . - Andrei . - Coming . Have a seat . Yeah ... What 's up ? What , Yevgeni Peterovich ? Ola . - This is right on . - Please , take a glass . My dear Andrei , this is a special day . - So happy birthday . - Thank you . - Happy birthday ! - Thank you . Thank you , friends . I never thought I would ever celebrate my birthday in space . - We will also celebrate your 25th wedding anniversary . - True . Friends , the Earth has sent us an unmanned rocket with fuel . To receive and attach the rocket to Ikar is a question of life and death . Prepare to receive the rocket . The rocket is on our radio waves . I hear you . Switching over to radio control . Send a signal to break off . Maximum break . We have received an emergency message ... The satellite observatory in space has observed a flash on Ikar . This flash matched the moment when the unmanned rocket landed on Ikar . Connection with the ship " Rodina " has ceased . It is obvious that the rocket couldn 't land on Ikar . The Committee for Planetary communications has organized a headquarters for the quick rescue of the crew of the ship . A second unmanned ship has been prepared . Our satellites have organized signals to get a connection with the ship . Communication stations all over the world will keep a continual watch of Ikar . Andrei , are you sad ? - Yes . - You bride is waiting ? - Of course . - Yes . Has the Earth noticed our signal ? - I don 't know . - The idea is amazing that ... to build such an amazing bulb in space . Pulkovo , 19th of June . Nothing was observed from Ikar . Crimski Observatory has nothing new to report . Delhi has picked up nothing . Los Angles the same thing . Prague , nothing new . The Milan Observatory has also not picked anything up . Attention . The satellite " Friendship " speaking . In observing Ikar we noticed there was light signal . The crew of the ship is still alive , that is what we noticed . The radar was destroyed , we cannot receive an unmanned rocket . Ikar is approaching Earth . Now we must think of some kind of help for the crew . Because later Ikar will go into the sun and then ... We must immediately ... Immediately find a way to help them . Return them to Earth . I know the way . Can you imagine , Herman , the interest there 'd be in returning this geology to Earth . Oh , you are still hoping to return to Earth . Why not ? You , yourself , know . In a few days we will start to move away from it . Further and further . And then ... breaking news Mr. Verst has died tragically in a space mousetrap . Mr. Kornev , I 'm tired . To hell with the Earth . You send to hell our Earth , our mother land . And you , what ? Grateful to her ? Yes , I am grateful to the Earth . It armed me with knowledge . She has given me wings to space . And the most valuable of all ... she teaches me ... to bring happiness to people . It is a great honour to be her son . Well , Robinson , have you met with " Space Friday " ? Emptiness . Fly to the stars ... . Get changed and relax . Earth . Earth . Earth . Earth . Mr. Kornev . Mr. Kornev ! What is that ? - Andrei , your space suit . - Aye-aye . Gregory Somov . There , Yevgeni Peterovich . A rocket with fuel . Gregory . Gregory ! I can 't understand how did he manage to get here with an unmanned rocket . That is a thought we can 't comprehend . Maybe he crossed the zone with an extreme explosion . And literally burned it out . We are ordered to return to Earth ... God be with us . Thank you . Thank you . I have imagined the people who saved my son 's life . Attention . Attention . The ship " Rodina " is approaching the Earth 's atmosphere . At a height of 287 tetrameters All instruments are working properly . - Andrei . - Lena . Well , that 's all , Vera . We are again together . - Smile . - You 're more grey . - What about the children are they healthy ? - Of course . - It was difficult for you , Robert ? - Yes , Mama . But I 've realized that people on Earth are much better than I thought . Well , you are taking a vacation . Definitely . - On Mars . - Wow , you are an industrious person . And you ? Mr. Kornev . Mr. Kornev , I want to thank you from all my heart . You not only saved our lives you have made us believe in the power of human friendship . That I will never forget . Well , that 's all . Not very complicated ? No , not very much . We are only spying on space . But after some time and people will own the space . Safe journey , younger generation . THE END

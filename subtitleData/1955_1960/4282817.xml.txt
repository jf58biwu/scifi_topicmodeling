 In the pit at Knightsbridge , three dead creatures , like huge insects , are removed from the sealed compartment of the hull and are treated with preservative fluids against corruption that has been delayed for five million years . They are transferred to the museum where Dr Roney and Professor Bernard Quatermass guess their place of origin as ancient Mars . Later , called to the War Office to account for his activities , Quatermass has to make another guess - that they have stumbled on one single instance of a vast Martian colonisation of the Earth , back in the Pliocene Age , using Earthly apes , changed by biological techniques . And we are the descendants of those apes . At Hobbs Lane , the bomb-disposal squad quits the excavation , leaving the drill operator Sladden to pack up the last of his gear . The whole place was shaking and things were flying about . - Earth and stones and metal ! - Yes , that 's when you got hurt . It was in there . I heard it when I was coming down . Sounds and screams and then ... - And then he came running ! - He ran past us up there . Here , Sergeant . You saw that it was Sladden ? Yes , I suppose it was him , but ... - But what ? - Well , it was the way he moved , sir . Look after Miss Judd . No ! - I knew something was going to happen . - What are you driving at ? Just before we packed up here , it got deadly cold . - It still is ! - It 's the time of the year . - Why doesn 't he hurry up ? - All right , he heard you ! All the lamps are smashed and the cables torn . Do you know the breaking strength of that stuff ? - Yes , sir . - Where 's Quatermass ? - He was called to a conference . - Could you find him ? I 'll try , but first I 'll get what I came for - those notes in the hut . Stick with her . Take her wherever she wants to go . Use the Land Rover . - And you , sir ? - I 'm going to look out for ... for Sladden . Roney ! Roney ! He wouldn 't listen . - Who ? - The Minister , of course . Behind that smooth front , he 's scared stiff . Scared of the press , scared of being blamed for something , scared of his colleagues . - All he wants are easy answers . - Easy answers ? About these ? - Well , did you try to explain ? - Yes , of course I did . Every word rang hollow . Martians . Biological experiments on apes in the Pliocene Age . Huh ! " You realise what you 're implying ? " he said . " That we owe our human condition to the intervention of insects . " Outraged ! His dignity affronted ! At that moment I knew the sort of thing that Darwin faced . - Some coffee ? - No . - So he wasn 't satisfied ? - On the contrary , he was ! With Colonel Breen 's theory . You may not have realised it , but that hull we dug up was a German propaganda weapon launched in 1944 and those are fakes ! If you look closely , you 'll find a little swastika on it somewhere ! He swallowed that ? It appealed to his common sense . So Breen 's busy on an official statement . Meanwhile , all precautions are cancelled , the barrier 's down . Well , I suppose there 's no actual harm in that . - Barbara ! - Professor ... Thank heavens you 're here ! - You went to the excavation ? - Yes , when I got there ... A drop of ... No , not coffee . What 's the matter with your head ? - Something hit me . - Here , try some of this . Thanks . The entire place seemed to come alive . Planks , cables , the earth itself being flung about . And there were sounds . Such sounds . Then out of the hull I saw this ... It was the drill operator . They said it was and it must have been , but it looked like that ... Running and running ! What happened to him ? Where is he now ? Captain Potter went to look for him . This outbreak , it quietened down ? - After he 'd gone , yes . - This ought to make ' em think again . I wonder ! Who 's in charge there now ? Hello ? - Hello . Have you found him ? Where ? - Is that Potter ? A church ? I see . Yes , all right . In about ten minutes . - I 'll go now . Potter 's waiting ? - Yes , let 's go . - You ? - I want to see Sladden . - See what he looks like now . I must ! - But look , you can 't ... Roney , you wait here in case anyone else tries to get in touch . Hello , miss . Sladden . Hello , Professor . - My name is Quatermass . - Mine 's Gilpin . I understand that you are this man 's employer . Well , I was today . Do you know what caused this ... this condition of his ? We were having a choir practice tonight and I went out for a breath of fresh air and I saw him . He was lying on the path . He was in evident terror . It occurred to me that he looked as if ... As if what ? As if he was seeking sanctuary . So I called Mr Edwards , our choirmaster , and together we brought him in here . He was quite exhausted , but agitated in a dreadful way . - Did you send for a doctor ? - No . When I saw those and heard those sounds I asked Mr Edwards to go to dismiss the choir . I knew I had to stay with this man . I was sure that he 'd been in contact with spiritual evil . But you were able to quieten him ? I think I helped him and then , after a time , this officer came . - I 'll have to question him . - Must you ? - Yes , he was alone when it happened . - Perhaps tomorrow ? No , there may be danger in waiting , danger to others . More cocoa , Sladden ? Sladden ... Can you remember what happened in the excavation tonight ? Do you remember being there ? You stayed behind to dismantle some equipment . Did you see her there , that girl ? She was hurt by something that moved . Did you see things flying about through the air ? I ran and ran ... to get away ! - They were coming ! - What were ? Stones ? Pieces of metal ? They ! They ! - Sladden , what ? - No more ! I remember . It started and then ... then I couldn 't see anything but them ! Like you took out of the hull . With eyes and horns ! - He saw the creatures . - They were alive ! Alive ? Hopping and running . Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds . They knew I was one ! - They ran ? - Jumping , leaping ... - Leave him alone ! - Where ? In and out of ... them big places . In and out of them ... Huge , right up into the sky . The sky ? What colour is it ? Blue ? No . Dark . Dark ... purple . It was like that down there . But far louder . - What fell ? - These . - I saw them jump out . - It was cold there like this ? Yes . You should have left him alone . He 's not free of it yet ! - Perhaps it was always in him . - What do you mean ? Perhaps it 's a faculty that 's dormant in all of us . - An inheritance , if you like . - I 'd have expected that from you , a scientist . Are you going to explain this away in fashionable terms , call it suggestion , hysteria ? On the contrary , I agree with you . You agree ? What has been uncovered is evil . It 's as anciently diabolic as anything ever recorded . I 'm afraid I ... I don 't understand . I believe that what he has just told us was a vision of life on Mars five million years ago . - I 'll have to take this further . - No . All right , not now . Sladden ... I want to make an experiment . Soon I want you to come to the excavation with me and show me exactly what you did tonight . - For what purpose ? - I 'll have apparatus to record what happens . Even though it means putting this man in peril ? Sladden , will you ? Hey , guv , it 's a queer do , isn 't it ? But you 're right . It is me . I can feel it . - When ? - Tomorrow . I 'll be careful . I promise you . - Would you come ? - Yes , of course , if you want me . - But I must advise you ... - OK , Prof. - Where does this door lead ? - To the church . Why ? There 's somebody in there . - Fullalove , what brought you here ? - What brought YOU ? To assist in identifying the machine , the West German Federal Government has agreed to make new searches ... Colonel , the news agencies are asking will there be a further statement ? No , there will not . Until tomorrow . They have that short denial which has turned the trick . First editions supplied by courtesy . " Space Machine War Hoax . " " German Fakes ... " You can 't come in here just now ! I 'm sorry , sir . I have something to tell you . I wonder what Captain Potter 's chances are of getting them to retract ? - Zero . - You 're probably right . - Once they 've put out a denial . Did you read it ? - No . As flat and bald as the Minister himself . That set me on the trail again . This thing was never properly completed . It 's still experimental . - Can you get it working ? - Goodness knows ! When did we run it last ? About six months ago , we made some tests . I remember . Some tests ! Hardly showed a thing ! Are these correct ? - What is it ? - He calls it an optic encephalograph . Good word . Sort of suggests all that tangle of ... What does it do ? Nothing . It 's designed to locate visual impressions inside the brain . What the eye sees or hallucination , whichever dominates at the time . The original aim was to use it on primitive types , the trance conditions they fall into so easily . It 'll take a couple of minutes . Barbara , clear that junk off the table , please . Are you going to use it down there tomorrow ? On a subject ? That hull or missile or whatever you call it , have you any idea how it works ? It 's not inert , it does work ? Oh , yes . Yes , it works . I think it 's activated by vibrations . Perhaps electricity , any source of energy . Then it has these effects on people ? - How long have you been a journalist ? - Reporter , please . - All right , a reporter . How long ? - 12 years , come Michaelmas . You must have often noticed reports of mysterious movements of objects . Yes . " Lead flung through roof . Boy denies he did it . Mysterious sounds continue . " It 's the same as at Hobbs Lane - poltergeist story . Telekinesis . It 's an odd faculty . - Faculty ? - Mm-hm . You may have it . We may all . The dormant ability to twist our energies into super-normal channels outside ourselves . Do you want to know where it came from ? Plus another old , strange talent . Second sight . Clairvoyance . That filled Sladden 's brain tonight with a vision of ancient Mars . I 've felt things in my head when I 've been near the hull . So have I. It may be that there are vestiges of it remaining in all of us from the time when they colonised this Earth at second hand . Oh , their experiment must have failed , collapsed , got lost in a reversion to savagery , but ... something remained . The occasional poltergeist outbreak that alarms a street , myths . Perhaps even witchcraft itself . - Those signs in the hull . - That 's right . So as far as anybody is ... well , we 're the Martians now . That just about does it . Now we need a subject . Well , Fullalove , you 'll be able to write about the experience . Here , sit here . - Is that all right ? - Is this safe ? Look at that lamp there . Now , Quatermass ! Damn ! There , that 's better . The lamp through his eyes ! It works ! By God , it does ! Roney , you 're a genius ! It 's rough , rough as can be . And that was an easy test . Maybe if we go over the circuits , we can make something of it . Let 's do that . Well , Mr Gilpin ? It all seems quiet and harmless . But there are the occult signs . There 's no doubt about them . May I ask what you 've got there ? I thought if perhaps it seemed wise to attempt exorcism ... Bell , book and candle , eh ? Yes , that was tried . In 1341 . What can you see ? The house up there . Steady ... Now close your eyes . Good . Good , that 's it . I think we 'll do . Now , Sladden , the first thing you did was cut the generator , right ? - That 's right . - When I signal , you do it . We 've got our own batteries . - Do I have to go in there ? - No . I 'm going to try to do roughly what you did . If I go wrong , you shout . OK , Prof. The current from the generator must supply the energy . And then when it 's cut , the hull reacts . The recording gear 's all set up . Right . Let 's begin . Nothing . Not a damn thing . Roney ! Roney , I ... I 'm not getting any impression . Only ... Only a kind of confusion . Roney ... Roney , it 's not working through me . I 'm not the one . It 's not operating through me . Barbara , get away from there ! Get away ! Come back ! - I can see ! I can see ! - Roney , come here quickly ! - Let me do it ! - All right , get this thing off me ! - It 's getting something now ! - We can 't let them do this . They 're madmen ! Don 't leave me ! Hold on to me ! Hold on ! Hold ... Aagh ! Aaaagh ! Get her out of it ! Quatermass ! Barbara , you 're all right . Oh , my dear ! - What she must have seen ! - I saw them , too . What you 've made these two people endure . You 'll be answerable . It was different this time , doing different things to what I seen last night . All that killing ! What 's happened to her ? What have you done ? Well , Quatermass , what HAVE you done ? Potter told me about some insane experiment . Let 's get out of here . I think I 've got something to show you . Roney ! What you 're about to see ... is a memory . A memory stored for millions of years in that hull . A machine at whose complexity we can only guess . And now picked up by the susceptible brain of a young woman . You 'll have to excuse the technical quality . Our apparatus is less subtle than that thing in the pit , if you don 't mind my saying so , Roney . What do you claim it shows ? - The Wild Hunt . - The what ? The Wild Hunt . It appears in legends the world over . The phantom ride of witches or devils . - Really , gentlemen ! - That is the legend . What you 're about to see is the fact . You 're going to see a race purge , a cleansing of the hives . Videotape ready . Please , carry on . Most curious . Yes , those insect creatures . Arthropods like those we found . Notice that they were killing and being killed . I think that what we 've seen is a ritual slaughter to preserve a fixed society , rid it of mutations . You find the same sort of thing on Earth among termites and wasps . Now , my concern is that this stored memory of killing should be coupled with another power that that thing in the pit seems to have . The power to redirect human energy . - Power to redirect human energy ? - Yes . Into force beyond control . - You mean that commotion down there today ? - Not only today . This young woman turned out to be highly susceptible , so did Sladden , but we 've all felt it . - Nonsense . A few vibration effects . - How can you say that ? - Because I ... - Gentlemen , please ! There 's really no need for this . We 're looking for rational explanations and I think there is one . Dr Roney , this truly amazing apparatus of yours was designed to detect , was it not , hallucination ? - Well , originally , yes , but we ... - Hallucination ? Exactly , sir , I think you 've hit it ! - It wasn 't hallucination ! - Let 's call it a mental image . The lady clearly has imagination and she 's overwrought . She had seen these creatures which Colonel Breen insists are fakes , so what more natural ... You can 't dismiss it like that ! - I should dismiss Colonel Breen 's theory ? - If you 'd witnessed what had happened ! Professor Quatermass , I believe that you are wrong in this matter . Ridiculously wrong . You 'll admit people to that excavation ? Tonight . The press , radio and television personnel . But you must not ! We all have a duty to relieve the public mind which has been wantonly alarmed . And I demand of you , as a loyal government officer , complete co-operation . Is the generator ready ? Set up in the street . Lot of stuff here . All these lamps and cameras . Don 't worry . Our genny will take all that load . Well , can you run an extra cable over there to the hull ? - What , inside ? - Yes , the TV boys want some shots inside . Well , we 'll do our best . Come on , Ted . Last three weeks , I 've done floods , frogmen and down a sewer . - When do they switch the juice on ? - Soon . When 's the programme ? - Seven o 'clock . - You 'll be all right . I hope so . Leaving everything till the last ! This place won 't do my bad leg any good ! Hey , isn 't that , you know , what 's-his-name , Quatermass ? My , the juice ! That 'll warm it up a bit . The West German Federal Government has agreed to institute new searches of existing wartime material in order to assist in identifying the machine . Thank you . Copies of the statement . Any questions , gentlemen ? Yes . Yes . What convinces you that your V-weapon theory is correct ? My experience . Madam ? Don 't you agree that this propaganda plan you 've uncovered shows the Nazis had no idea of the true British spirit during the Blitz ? - Er , well ... - Colonel , I made some enquiries of my own . Do you know that officials of German wartime rocket research deny any such weapon existed ? - You must allow time ... - Let him answer . Mr Fullalove , a day or two ago , you were enquiring into the activities of ghosts and demons . Did you get their opinions , too ? I demand an answer ! This is too serious a matter ... - Next question , please . - I 've got a question ! - Quatermass ! - Is Colonel Breen an imbecile or a coward ? - Go on , give it to him ! - What do you mean by that ? How dare you ! Wait ! Professor Quatermass , I thought it was ... I 'll ask the question ! Is Colonel Breen afraid of something , so afraid that he resorts to the thinnest rationalisations ? I say what I know and what I believe to be the truth . Tell them what you 've seen here and heard . Tell them what happened to West and Sladden . Potter , you were a witness . You tell them what happened . Cut the power , for God 's sake ! Cut it , cut it ! My mate , he 's still in there . - Potter , be careful ! - The current 's off . What happened ? Quick ! He had the live cable . He must have slipped . - Is he dead ? - Yes . Potter , did you see anything else in there ? No , nothing .

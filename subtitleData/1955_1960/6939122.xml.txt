Yes , sir , . She always appeared perfectly normal . Pure accident that I discovered this strange thing about her . Yes , Doctor ? Jane , I 'd like you to meet Dr - Lorimer . He and I were halfthe football backfield at med school . I did the blocking . - How do you do , sir ? - Very happy to know you , jane . I wanted Dr. Lorimer to be present at our research experiment today . - That is , if you have no objection . - No . Why should I ? Fine . Excuse me . WelLJane , here we go again . Okay . Got a nice sharp one for you this time . Now , jane , start counting backwards - From 20 . I know . That 's right . 20 , 19 ... 18 ... 17 ... I 've never known a subject under Pentothol to lie . - Nor have I. - Why the lie detector ? You 'll see later . What is your name ? Joyce ... Hatten . Joyce Hatten Webster . Then you are married ? I was . I was Mrs. Paul Webster . - That is - - Yes ? I 'm not sure ... whetherl am married ... or ever reallym . was married . I 'm not sure . I 'm just not sure . Would you tell us about itjoyce ? Everything about it . Everything ? That 's rightjoyce . From the beginning . I met Paul overseas . He was a lieutenant . I was nursing in a hospital . We made plans to be married ... after we were both discharged . Oh ! Ho-ho ! Very well done , steward . - Isn 't he an expert , Paul ? - Well , he gets lots of practice . After all , we aren 't the first newlyweds ... on this train , Mrs. Webster . Call me that again . - Mrs. Webster . - Mmm , that sounds so wonderful . You know , I was beginning to doubt ... whether I was ever going to get to hear that - . Youjust try and get away now . Will there be anything else , sir ? Oh , no . No , thanks . Thank you very much . Thank you , sir . Thank you . - Good night , sir . - Good night . Paul ... I love you so much . Why did we have to wait so long ? Well , I , uh ... I wrote you after I cracked up my plane - . And scared me halfout of my wits . You wouldn 't believe what that hospital doctor told me when I called . Well , what do you mean ? Well , according to him , you were more dead than alive . Almost every bone broken . Completely torn , mangled , smashed . And you don 't think it was true ? Well , now , how could I ? Look at you . You haven 't got a mark . You haven 't got a scar . You 're much more handsome than ever . Do you know that nobody would believe ... you were even in a plane crash ? But it was true , thoughJoyce . By all rights , I should be dead . You don 't mean that . Lookjoyce , you have a right to know . I ... I should have told you before we were married . - Told me what ? - How it was really . Why I made us wait so long - . You see , honey - - Who is it ? - It ' ; me again . - I have some more wires . - And nobody was supposed to know ... we were even on this train . Come in . Here you are , miss . - Thank you . Here , you open these . - All righty . You folks certainly must be popular . Especially with the telegraph company . - Oh . - Is something wrong ? Well , it 's from the girls ... at the hospital where I worked . You know , there 's such a thing as being too well-informed . - May I ? - You may not . Those devils . Oh , very nice - An old buddy of mine - . I didn 't know we had so many friends . Yeah , me , either . Oh , that 's nice . Ohh . That 's funny . When 's the next stop ? Well , let 's see . Yeah , 33 minutes . No , it 's 35 minutes . - We 're two minutes behind time . - Not until then ? Actually , there 's a mail pickup stop just up ahead . That 's why we 're slowing down . - But is there a phone ? - Yes . We only stop for a halfa minute . No time for anyone to leave the train . Just so there 's a phone . Paul , what 's wrong ? Please , honey , tell me what 's so important . Paul , I don 't understand . Please explain . Paul . Paul , hurry ! Paul ! Paul , hurry ! [ Bell Rings J Hurry . WW ' - ! We 're moving . What ? Conductor , you 've got to stop the train . It was supposed to be ... the happiest moment of my life - my wedding . And I 'd just seen my husband 's face for the last time . What did you do then , Joyce ? I was frantic . I got off at the next stop . I went back to that platform ... but there was no sign of Paul . Nothing . No one had placed a call . No one had seen him . He 'djust vanished . And then what happened ? You wouldn 't believe it was possible ... would you ? A man you thought you knew so well ... had married , even ... could just disappear ... completely Even after talking to all the people who knew him . Finding nothing at his last address . I told the police " . hired private detectives " . checked with the army . The only address they had was an apartment hotel . What about where he was born ? His family ? The army records said Georgia . Paul had never mentioned his family . I never thought to ask him . I loved him . That 's all that seemed to matter . StilLyou did find something . Months later . Going through Paul 's things ... as I had a hundred times . - His fraternity pin . - And how did that help ? Ichecked with the headquarters . Wrote them . They told me that Paul had belonged to their chapter ... at Louisiana State University . So ... I went there . They let me look at the records . I found an address Paul had given them ... when he enrolled in college . And where was that ? Bayou Landing - a whistle-stop in the middle ... of the Louisiana swamp country I was the only passenger to get off Strangely , there wasnt anothersoul to be seen . The only evidence oflife was a deserted day coach on the siding ... looking as alone and out of place as I felt . Well , I 'll be . Somebody meeting you here , sweetheart ? No . I thought - that is , I hoped somebody would come to pick up this . Well , that 's me - You just didn 't get off . You must have had some good reason . Do you know a place - I think it 's a plantation - Called The Cypresses ? Uh-huh . Would it be too much trouble to take me there ? I 'll gladly payyou . They don 't never have no visitors . - Was they expecting you ? - No , not exactly ... but they will know who I am . Well , for you , sweetheart , I 'll take a chance . Go ahead . just climb in - . Go on . Climb in - . Bet you never seen nothing like that before . You ever been in the bayou country before ? It 's so wild , so primitive . Yeah , and deadly . You know how long you 'd last ... if you got ' I O0 yards off of this road ? Maybe ' I O minutes - lfthe Quicksand didn 't get you - ... the moccasins would . And then ... then there 's always the gators . Dirty , nasty , slimy gators ! Why did you have to do that ? It wasn 't doing you any harm . No ? Well , how do you suppose I got this ? Anyway , baby , we didn 't do him no harm . - Yes , miss ? - I beg your pardon . I just arrived on the train . - The train was hours ago . - I know . - Were you expected ? - I did write , but my letter came back unopened . - Sol decided - - What is it , Toby ? This young person , shejust arrived - Have her come in . Come in . Yes , what is it ? This is your place ? Of course . Well , maybe you can help me . You see , for a long time ... I 've been looking for my husband . He disappeared the night we were married . I 've searched everywhere . I 've tried everything ... and this is my last hope - . But why should you come here ? At the university I checked the records . And at one time , he gave this as his address . - The Cypresses . - What is your name , my dear ? Mrs. Paul Webster . And you say that your husband ... this Paul Webster , gave this as his address ? According to the records . Whoever you are , I don 't know what your game is-. - ... coming here , making up fantastic stories . It 's the truth . I can prove it . You can ask anyone - Why should I ask anyone or care one way or the other ? Ofwhat possible interest ... could your sordid little lie be to me ? I was hoping your name was Webster . I am Mrs. Henry Hawthorne . - And your husband ? - I 'm a widow . I 'm sorry to bother you , Mrs - Hawthorne. - . But I had to know . Perhaps you are telling the truth . It really doesn 't matter . However , I must ask you to leave at once . Toby , get ahold of Manon . Have him drive her back to the station . - But , ma 'am - - What is it , Toby ? There won 't be a train till tomorrow . Oh , you 're right , of course . May we offer you the hospitality - . Of The Cypresses for the night ? I don 't seem to have any choice , do I ? Luann . Yes , ma 'am . Show Mrs. - What was your name again ? Mrs. Paul Webster . Show Mrs. Webster to the guest room . Yes , ma 'am . Anything you need to be comfortable ... just ask Luann . Thank you . One minute , Mrs. Webster . While you 're our guest for the night only ... I must insist on one thing . - Yes ? - Under no circumstances ... will you leave your room . As I said before ... I don 't seem to have any choice , do I ? There was something sinister about The Cypressesi . As night darkened the house , all the doubts and fears ... which had haunted the long , lone / y miles ... of my search returned What secret was Mrs ' Hawthorne hiding " . In this strange , unfriendly house ? Why had she told me not to leave my room ? Toby ! Toby ! Find the drunken fool . Tell him to stop that shooting . But , ma 'am - Doesn 't he realize the girl 's still here ? I 'll try , ma 'am . Dirty , stinking , slimy gators ! You bit my hand off , didn 't you ? I 'm gonna spend the rest of my life killing gators . The rest of my life killing ' em - . Mr. Manon , you better stop it . Huh ? Mrs. Hawthorne says stop . She says she don 't want you shooting at gators around here ... with that girl here . The one you brought . I ain 't never gonna stop shootin ' gators . They bit my hand off , didn 't they ? I ain 't never gonna stop shootin ' gators ! No , not never ! Sure , sure . I know just how you feel . I don 't like ' em , either , but not tonight . Come on . Do all the guests get room service ? I only do ... what Mrs. Hawthorne tell me , ma 'am . Now , will there be anything else ? Luann , those gunshots . What were they all about ? I don 't know , ma 'am . I must go now . Luann , wait , wait , please . Somebody has to help me . - How , ma 'am ? - Is it true , everything she told me ? Havel come to the wrong place ? I can 't - I wouldn 't like to say anything . Well , can 't you tell me anything ? I can tell you this . This is a trouble house . Real deep , big trouble . Like the old country woman in Big Bayou say - Mrs. Hawthorne , she deal with the evil one . She got big sorrow . Just like you 'll get if you stay here - . Go , child . Please go . This is a trouble house . Real deep , big trouble . Yes . Oh , thank goodness you 're back , Mark . Anything wrong , Vinnie ? She 's here , Mark . Paul 's wife . - How did she find us ? - School records . It was like being struck by lightning . We 've got to decide what we 're going to do about her . You wait there for me . I 'll be right over . - You ready , Doctor ? - Yes . Poor devil . You didn 't have to hit him . Quickest , simplest way , Doctor . But these are people . You don 't handle them like animals . How did it happen ? Only thing I can figure is someone forgot to wet him down on time . When he comes to ... give him additional hydro-spray therapy Yes , sir . Mark ! Oh , hello , Vinnie . We 'vejust had an emergency with number six . - Is he all right now ? - He 's quiet , yes . But the girl - what are we going to do about her ? So she found his school records . The one thing we hadn 't thought of . - Such bad luck . - Not entirely . I think we both knew ... she was bound to find out eventually . It 'sjust unfortunate it happened to be so soon ... when we need time . So much time . If she should tell anyone , the police , it would spoil our last chance . Do we have a chance ? I don 't really know . I feel so helpless , Vinnie . We know so little . So little . What about the cobalt treatment ? I said reaction to X ray was encouraging . Massive radiation from cobalt 6O might be even more effective . Well , you have the cobalt bomb . It arrived today . But don 't you see , Vinnie ? Before I can take the chance with a human being ... there must be months of tests - . Hundreds ofanimal experiments . We took a chance once before , Vinnie . No one knows better than you the tragic result . I have confidence in you , Mark . Every confidence . You 'll have time . All the time you need . The girl will leave on the morning train . I 'll be over before that to talk to her . I 'm as anxious as you are to have her go ... but we must make absolutely sure ... that she doesn 't know anything . G , ' ♪ ♪ Somehow I seemed drawn to the music . A theme that I had heard before ... somewhere . Who else lived in this strange household ? Who could be playing in the dead of night ? I couldn ? rid myself of the premonition " . that each step was taking me closer ... to the secret contained in this shadowy house . I had to know . I had to find out . ♪ ♪ Who was he , this man who had been playing ? And why would he run away into the swamp ... when he saw me ? Muddy footprints " . yet there had been no rain . And the piano keys - Still wet ... from his fingers . What 's she doing here ? I don 't know . She came on the train today - - No notice , no warning . - And you let her stay ? What could I do ? I couldnt turn her out in the swamp . Do you think I wanted her here ? There 's no train until tomorrow . - How 'd you find out ? - She was in the hall . Downstairs ? I locked her in her room . She 's got to leave ... on that morning train tomorrow . I 'm Dr. Sinclair . Uh , Mark Sinclair . I 'm sort of the swamp doctor . That 's my swamp buggy . I need to get around . I see . You must keep busy , Doctor . Well , why do you say that ? I mean , in an unhealthy environment like this . Oh , you mean the swamp . Well , actually , if it were as you say - unhealthy - None of us would be here . - Why ? - Well , a few million years ago ... most of the land of the earth ... musfve looked just about like this - One great , vast swamp . It was the cradle oflife ... where we all started - in the slime and ooze ... at the bottom of a swamp . - You 're completely cynical , aren 't you , Doctor ? - I imagine that did sound a bit depressing . I didn 't mean it to . I 'm sorry . Oh , is Mrs. Hawthorne inside ? Well , she hasn 't come down yet . Has she been ill , Doctor ? Well , not exactly . Vinnie - Mrs. Hawthorne - has a few emotional problems . I like to look in from time to time . Well , maybe that explains it . - Explains what ? - Why she locked me in my room last night . I don 't understand . I took you for a guest ofVinnie 's - . I suppose I am , in a way . I 'm Mrs. Webster . Mrs. Paul Webster . That name doesn 't mean anything to you ? No . Should it ? I don 't know . Let me explain , Doctor . Since my husband disappeared , I 've done nothing but search for him ... and I 'm going to keep on asking questions . - What brings you here ? - An old address - The Cypresses - that I found in Paul 's college records - . You came way down here , traveled hundreds ofmiles ... on nothing more tangible than that ? I 'd travel much farther on even less . I find that difficult to believe . You must 've found other evidence . Why ? Unless there is other evidence . Is that what you mean ? Of course not - I was only trying to say - You did know Paul , didn 't you , Doctor ? I can tell . What is it , Doctor ? Why won 't any of you tell me about him ? What are you all trying to hide ? My dearyoung lady , you 're obviously overwrought . That 's understandable in the circumstances . I wish I could help . Will you tell Mrs. Hawthorne I couldn 't wait ... but I will drop back later ? Thank you . Be extremely careful It generates 3,000 curie units ... ofgamma ray energy This is the equivalent of six million electron volts of X ray A few seconds of direct exposure " . would be fatal . Stand by for lowering position . - Luann , come here ! - Yes , ma 'am . - Her things are still in her room . - Yes , ma 'am . You mean she didn 't leave ? Well , Toby , he brought the car at train time ... but Mrs. Webster , she wouldn 't go . - Well , where is she ? - Well , I believe she in there . What are you doing ? Looking for answers . Answers ? You abuse my hospitality . You were to stay in your room . You left it . You promised to leave on the train . I made no promise . I was told . I 'm not leaving here , Mrs. Hawthorne ... until I get the answers to the questions that brought me here . I told you yesterday you were mistaken . - I thinkyou 're lying . - You can 't talk to me like that . I can say a lot worse . You had Dr. Sinclair come and talk to me today , didn 't you ? Why ? To find out how much I knew ? I know nothing about that . And another thing - Who was playing the piano in here last night ... in the dark ? Someone who left wet footprints in the carpet ? - Oh , you 're imagining things . - No , I 'm not - Any more than I 'm imagining you want to get rid of me ... that you 've got something to hide . Hide ? Oh , what could I possibly have to hide ? What have you done with my husband ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You did a good job , Mrs. Hawthorne ... wiping out every trace of Paul in his own home . You almost got away with it . Got away with it ? Got away with what ? Whatever terrible thing you 've done with Paul . Done to him ? Me ? Oh , my God , that 's funny . That really is funny . I ' d be the last one ever to hurt Paul . I 'm his mother . His mother ? Mother ? Has she gone ? No , Paul , she hasn 't . Paul , what is it ? What happened ? Paul ! Paul , come back ! Paul ! Please ! Paul ! Paul ! Paul ! Paul' Paul' Paul ! Paul ! Paul ! Paul' Paul ! Come on . You ought to have better sense , sweetheart . Nobody goes out in a swamp on a night like this - Especial / y a night like this . Come on . I 'll take you back to the house - . There , now . Now you sit down . You sit down . That 's it . What you needs a drink . Me too . I don 't understand why you brought me here - . I just naturally figured you 'd appreciate me saving you from that snake . I do . - Here - Have a drink - - I don 't think I want it - . Go on , baby . It 'll do you good . That 's it . Made it myself . Hey ... you 're cold . You ought to get them wet things off . Go ahead . Well , come on . Get ' em off . I 'll be all right . Thanks . All right , baby . Here . You get up . We 'll wrap this around you ... so you won 't catch cold . Now , come on . Get up . That 's it . Stop ! Let go of me . What 's the matter , baby ? Huh ? Didn 't I save your life ? Don 't you feel like you owe me something ? Why , sure , you do . You be nice to me . Maybe I 'll tell you some things about this place . Don 't do that . Don 't ever do that ! You 're dead ! I 'll kill you . alligator man ! Lust like I 'd kill any four-legged gator ! You hear me ? I 'll killyou ! Oh ! Paul , what happened ? - She 's not dead ? - Manon . He was drunk . We should 've fired him before . Toby , carry her upstairs . Luann , try and take care of her . Yes , ma 'am . We can 't keep her in the dark any longer , Paul . - I can 't do anything . - She could 've been killed tonight . Is that what you want ? - I love her , Mother . - Well , that 's why she has to know . - Are you going to tell her ? - I couldn 't . I 'll phone Dr. Sinclair . He 'll know what to say . Oh , why didn 't he just let me die ? It 'll work out somehow , Paul . There has to be an answer . Therejust has to be . Mark ? Paul . I understand it came . The cobalt 60 ? Arrived yesterday . When do we try it ? Not for months . I explained to your mother . Combined with the X-ray generator ... the bomb will approach the power of a betatron - A billion electron volts . So without extensive experimentation - But there 's no time for that . I want it now . You don 't think I 'd take the risk ... after the tragedy I 've caused already ? But you 're causing a worse one to my wife . You said yourselfthe X ray was definitely helping . Light positive indications , yes . Then combining X ray with gamma radiation ... from the cobalt might cure me completely . And it might kill you ! Paul ... who knows ? I just can 't do it , Paul . It 's too great a risk . We wouldn 't be alive at all , any of us , except for you . We 'd probably be better off dead , but - ... you can 't turn me down . You owe me this chance ... whatever chance there is . For my wife 's sake , I want it now ! Not tonight ! I 'll need at least a day to test it on live alligators ... to establish some sort of control standards - . You 'vejust got to understand , Paul . I haven 't the slightest idea what will happen . Tomorrow night . Tomorrow night . Paul ... your mother phoned about your wife . You should 've told her , Paul . I couldn 't . The thought ofjoyce ever seeing me like this - I just couldn 't . I 've agreed to talk tojoyce in the morning . - But - - She 's going to know everything . Yeah , get the big one . You 're Mrs. Webster ? Yes . Dr. Sinclair is expecting me . The doctor said for you to wait in his office . Take him out . Put him in a cage alone . We 'll run the test series on him in an hour . And bring in another specimen . I hope you 'll excuse me , Mrs. Webster ... keeping you waiting . This experiment was urgent - The most urgent of my life . So , you 're a trained nurse , Mrs. Webster ? - Yes . Yes , that 's right . - Good . Then you know something of the life processes ... of the higher and lower orders . In species like ourselves ... with a highly developed nervous system ... bodily functions are controlled principally ... by the brain and the nerves . But in creatures with a less complex nervous development ... life processes are governed by chemical substances ... secreted by ductless glands " . and carried in their bloodstream . Like hormones ? Being a doctor , I was tremendously impressed ... by the healing power ofjust one hormone - Hydrocortisone . And it occurred to me how much more potent this hormone would be ... in a creature with a simpler nervous system - One that depended on that hormone to live . For example ... there are some small lizards that when attacked ... detach their tails completely . Yet , in a very short time ... well , this little fella was well on his way to growing a new one . There are even one or two species ... that can replace an entire limb ifthey 've lost one . Here 's something intriguing - Two similar muscular charts . You might think they were the same animal ... but as you know , this is a man - This is an alligator . This is all very interesting , Doctor ... but you were going to tell me about Paul . Everything I 've said concerns Paul . I knew I 'd found my life 's work . I wanted to extract this wonderful reptilian substance ... and use it to cure human injuries . Mrs. Hawthorne - She was still Mrs. Webster then - She remarried after Paul 's father died - Mrs. Hawthorne financed my researches ... and set up this clinic . Well , did you succeed ? I isolated a protein chemical ... from the anterior pituitary glands ... of crocodilians . - Our common variety is the alligator . - Alligator ? I injected this substance into the veins ofvolunteers - Horribly injured , hopelessly mangled accident victims ... on the point of death . It was miraculous , Mrs. Webster . Not only 070 ' those dying men and women live ... but in an incredibly short time , they were completely whole - Mangled limbs as good as new ... as ifthey 'd never been injured . And Paul was one of these ? The worst of the lot . There was scarcely a bone in his body that wasn 't broken - face completely gone ... horribly burned " Nobody would even know you were in a plane crash . " That 's what I said to Paul the night we were married . Can you imagine my feelings ? I thought I 'd stumbled on the medical miracle of the ages . - It certainly seems so . - Then , over a year later - Doctor , can you come right away ? It 's number six again . Excuse me . I 'll be back soon . Maybe you 'd better come along , too . Another sedative , Doctor ? No . I 'm afraid the brain tissues have been affected . Try a sun ray . Yes , Doctor . Who are these ? My prize patients . My medical miracles . - Well , then , these symptoms are - - The aftereffects . They began to appear in varying degrees ... about a year after the treatment . Why ? How ? Isn 't it obvious ? There was an additional secretion ... in the pituitary injection besides the healing hormone - Something I didn 't know about ... but , in its way , even more powerful And the sun ray ? The sun ray has a strong depressant effect ... on reptiles . Makes them lethargic , dormant . Reptiles ? But these aren 't - They are , aren 't they ? Your patients are turning into - Alligators . In effect , you can say that . - Alligator people . - And Paul ? His symptoms were the last to appear . When his final test proved positive ... I had to wire him on the train . He 's quiet now . We can go . Is there any hope for ... for the people ? There may be a possible chance ... but a slight one - A shot in the dark and very dangerous . Your husband insists upon taking that chance tonight . What is it ? Massive radiation - Gamma rays from a cobalt bomb ... combined with high intensity X rays - . We 've already noted in Paul ... definite positive reactions to X-ray treatment ... but what will happen with this ... - I don 't know . - I want to be here . - I don 't think that 's wise - - I want to be here . I want to see Paul . I want to talk to him before - You can 't keep me away , Doctor . No , I guess I can 't . Maybe I haven 't even got the right . Paul , please . Don 't run away again . Dr. Sinclair explained you were coming tonight and why . I wanted to be here . Oh . Paul , it doesn 't make any difference . I 'm your wife , and I love you - . Oh , Paul , darling . You know all about tonight ? Dr. Sinclair explained . He told me about the X-ray treatments ... and how much better you are - . I know this 'll do it , Paul . Why , radiation therapy works wonders . It 'll have to . You 'll come out of that laboratory ... as handsome as ever . Joyce ... I love you . You know that . I wouldn 't have done this to you - let you see me . I 'd rather have died ! Oh , Paul , please . Don 't say that . We 're ... ready , Paul . If you still want to . I still want to . Very well . Stand by for lowering position . - Ready , Paul ? - Ready . Oh , Paul , do you have to do this - ... take this chance , knowing the danger ? Whatever happens , either way ... I 'm better off than the way I am now . Oh , Paul . I 'm sorry for the way I treated you . Paul was so desperate to keep you from knowing . We did everything we could . Now that I know you , I 'm sure we were wrong . I 'm sorry . Terribly sorry . Manon ! Where is he ? - Who ? - Paul . He 's not here . You get out of here . Mrs. Hawthorne ordered you off this place for good . I know where he is , where he 's got to be ! With the others ! Now you go on ! Get out ! Controls and timing must be precise . When you 're dealing with radioactivity ... and billions ofvolts of energy - ... the slightest deviational standard ... even a few seconds of excess time-. - ... and anything might happen . What 's the exposure interval , Doctor ? No more than 3O seconds . Absolute maximum . I determined that on my test alligators . Definitely . 30 seconds . No more . Paul . Yes ? I 'll never be able to tell you ... how sorry I am - . Don 't blame yourself . I certainly don 't . Who can know everything ? You 're not God , Mark . I feel as ifl 've been playing at it ... and been punished . Forget it . You all right ? Fine . Keep your eyes closed . Just relax . Where is he ? Who do you want ? That two-legged gator - Paul . You better get out of here . Aw . Wait ! You can 't go in there ! Manon ! You were ordered to leave . You have no right here . Now get out . Where is he ? I know you got him here someplace . I forbid you to go in there . Oh . So he is here , huh ? Get him out of here ! Why , you - Get out of here ! So that 's where you are . You can 't ! You can 't go in there ! No , you ain 't him . You can 't be him . You stay away from me ! Paul ! Paul ! Paul ! Paul' Paul ! Paul ! Paul ! Paul ! Paul ! No ! Don 't ! Don 't ! No ! Well , now that you 've heard the tape again , what do you think ? This indicates that everything she said is true . She was married to a Paul Webster who did crash in a plane ... and there was a Dr. Mark Sinclair who since disappeared . Do you believe her story ? That 's not important . Eric ... we were both taught that a psychiatrisfs function ... is to find mental illness and to cure it . - As simple as that . - Obviously . Now , jane 's case - This girl has lived through a horrible experience ... true or not , but she has made ... a satisfactory adjustment . She lives a normal , happy life by completely suppressing it . An obvious anxiety neurosis ... and amnesia suppression . You didn 't need me to tell you that . No , of course not . But what am I gonna do , Eric ? Shall I let her go on as she is now or attempt a cure ? Now , all I 've got to do is bring her back in here ... and play back that tape . Yes , and perhaps shock her into a complete withdrawal . Yes . I don 't know , Wayne . I honestly don 't know . Excuse me , Doctor . I 'm going offduty unless there 's something else . All right . Thank you . Oh , jane . One moment . Well ? Yes , Doctor ? That 's alLjane . Good night . Good night , Doctor . - Good night , Dr. Lorimer . - Goodn / ghzfljane .

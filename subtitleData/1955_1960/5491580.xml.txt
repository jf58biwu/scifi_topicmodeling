And even if there was , they wouldn 't come here now . Let us now observe some fiery meteorites . There are some facts about space which we don 't yet understand . - Is that so , sir ? - Yes , it is . Raise the telescope up a little . I see a flying object . If another man sees it , we 'd call it unidentified and solve the problem . - Is that clear ? - Yes , it is . You understand too , right ? L-L-Let 's go . - G-Go ! - Be quiet ! - I-I 'm hungry . - What ? Quiet ! - W-What can I do ? I 'm hungry ! - Goddamn you ! Long story short , gentlemen , we will struggle until we figure it out . But I 'm sure we will figure it out eventually . Take a look . You , too . I think it 's a tiny comet . - C 'mon , that 's enough . - Don 't touch me or I 'll scream . Alright , eat it then . It must be indigestion . I guess you ate too much this evening . What 's this ? I smell something . Yes , I smell it , too . You ate onions tonight . I 've warned you so many times not to eat such foods before meetings . Let 's finish here . Tomorrow morning we 'll meet here again . Let 's go . - All of them are gone . - Shut up ! G-get up .

It landed near the observatory . It did . It did . Let 's go . Yes , l-l-let 's go . I-I-I want to get near this weird thing . Be careful , it 's a long fall . You could get hurt . - Sapsal , t-t-they are a-angels . - Shut up ! This is Earth , as they call it . If the men here are as big and as strong as we think , we 'll take them to Merih . This is our chance to get real men on our planet . My queen , will we stay here long ? In my estimation , Earth women are very jealous . We must take the two men we spoke with and leave this planet right away . Come on ! Can 't we take more men ? Wait ! We 'll take men for each of you ! If we find more , we 'll take them , too . - Photograph them . - A-A-Alright . Let 's find the ones we spoke with . Either we 'll take them to Merih or we 'll find different men . Give me the man detector . Come on ! Photograph them , quickly ! - I 'm getting ready . - Come on ! - OK . - Come on ! - Wait a second . - Come on , quick ! There they are ! - What did you do ? ! - I couldn 't adjust it properly . Goddamn you ! Don 't be scared of us . Come here . - S-S-Sapsal ? - What is it , Kasar ? Look at them ! Enough ! - What is your name ? - Sapsal . - And yours ? - Kasar . - You are Sapsal and you are Kasar . - No . H-H-He is Sapsal , I 'm Kasar . - Take off your clothes . - Pardon me ? - I said undress . - I don 't get it . - Isn 't your name Kasar ? - Yes . Undress then . - What do you think ? - I don 't know . - My name is Kasar . - Undress ! Stelekami ! - W-W-Wait ! Don 't push me ! - You almost tore my ear off . - So , you 're a man ? - I 'm supposed to be . And you ? Are you the wife of this man ? S-S-Sorry ? I don 't understand . W-W-Who said I 'm not a man ? This detector indicates it . Look . - Yes , you 're not a man . - No , that 's wrong . You 're crazy . - My queen , could the detector be damaged ? - It could be . Adjust it and check him again . Maybe he is a real man . Amazing ! He is an extra-extra man . Take it . I can 't believe this . He is an extra-extra man ! Is that so ? He is extra-extra , huh ? - Really ? Extra-extra ? - Yes , he is ! My God , he is extra-extra . Yeah , extra-extra . What about it ? You are so rare . Your kind is not found on Merih . Sapsal . You hear them ? My kind is so rare I didn 't even know about it . - Excuse me , but what 's this about ? - You will belong to all of us . Come on ! Are you all crazy ? I 'm not that easy . - Sapsal ? - Be careful , you wouldn 't want to upset us . - Let 's move ! - Wait , we are not philanderers . - You have to obey us . - You 're our slaves ! You 'll do what we want ! Yes , but the world we live in has rules . They don 't allow us to marry all of you . They don 't , huh ? Don 't cross us . Once you understand our power , you 'll have to obey . Is that clear , Earthlings ? - Yes . - Do you still object ? Sapsal , tell them I 'll marry one of them if they want . My friend says he 'll marry one of you . I 'll marry one of you , too . Sapsal , tell them to answer right now . - Talk ! Answer us ! - A-A-Answer us ! - You 'll marry me ? - Yes . - And you 'll marry me ? - S-S-Sure . - What about us ? - Don 't worry . We 'll find men for each of you . - Is that possible ? - Sure it is . Sure it is , but first save us from this cold iron . - Stelekami ! - Stelekami ! We can talk now . - You first . - Let 's talk alone . You know you can 't speak of family stuff publicly . Alright , you can leave now . - How old are you ? - 28 . - And you ? - 23 . And you ? - 400 . - What ? - I said 400 . - And you ? - 500 . - Christ ! Wait a second and I 'll explain . Whoever drinks this elixir remains young and vigorous for 1000 years . It 's enough to have just a drop of it . We have many bottles like this one . Each one has a different effect . Listen , Sapsal . A bottle of this can make millions in the women 's club . - Sure ! - I don 't understand . If we take these bottles , we can get you a lot of men . Nice idea .

Being young and beautiful is such a great thing . If I hadn 't been so cocky , I wouldn 't be alone now . This loneliness ... I 'm so angry with men . They don 't visit here in spite of the attractive program . Look ! Two men showed up ! Let 's go sit at the bar . Wine , please . G-Give us wine .

We know the truth . - W-W-W ... - What did we do ? - W-W-What did we do ? - You wanted to sell the elixir . We wanted to sell ... huh ? You lie too much . I 'll show you your buyers waiting . Come with me . This is your Grand Hotel . Who is that tramp ? Are you English ? No . - French ? - No . - Italian ? - No . What then ? - You 're English ? - Yes . - French ? - Yes . - Italian ? - Yes . - Spanish ? - Yes . - Turkish ? - Sure ! Then give me 250 grams of it and we can talk . You are very playful . Why are they staring ? Why are you looking like that ? It 's Marilyn Monroe ! Come here ! Gather ' round ! - Can you sign my book , please ? - Can you sign this picture , please ? Please . - Who is that woman ? - M-M-Ma ... - You shut up , Kasar . Marilyn Monroe . - T-T-The whole world ... Stop stuttering ! The whole world adores her . She 's stunning . Shame on you . Shame on you . Excuse me . Pardon us . Pardon us again and again . Why is that ? Let her show off . Why are you blocking her art ? You 're right , but it 's a shame that it 's a shame because of its shame . Why is it a shame ? Why is it a shame to look at beauty ? - Please , gentlemen . - Why the pardons ? I 've never seen anyone more beautiful than you . Which number is my room ? It 's 226 . My God , what a beauty she is . It 's a shame to peep . This is a shame ! - Bye-bye . - Bye-bye . Go to hell ! - Bye-bye . - Bye-bye . So every man adores her , right ? You 'll pay for betraying us . - W-W-What did we do ? - Shut up ! You used our elixir to make money by selling it to women . Then you stole their money . Every single bottle here has a different function . This one makes you really happy , and this one makes you young and fresh , but you betrayed us and now you 'll pay ! Stelekami ! Carry on . I knocked out the others and can do the same to you . - Why don 't you say anything ? - W-W-We feel faint . You feel faint ? I 'll make you happy now . You see , you can 't escape . You 'll be coming back with us . But I will let you go if you promise to bring me men . Deal ? - Deal . - O-O-Of course . Here 's the deal . I will give you two bottles . - Sapsal , we are so lucky . - Slow down . W-W-Who 's hurrying here ? We always keep our promises . You give us two bottles , we bring you as many men as you want . - Here you go . - Give it to me . Bye . Goodbye . See you . Fellas ! We keep our promises ! Here are the bottles ! - Where did you get them ? - From the flying saucer . - Where is it ? - In the center of observation center . Good news ! I will write about it in my newspaper ! Here are the bottles ! Hey ! What 's going on ? Welcome . They sell the elixir of life . - Why the noise ? - None of your business . - What 's going on ? - None of your business . Are you in charge here ? I wonder if I don 't have a right to know ? You wonder , huh ? I 've got it now . Now then , if you drink a drop of the elixir , you 'll always stay young and fresh . Not only that , you 'll live 1000 years . What ? 1000 years ? Please let me drink first . Stop there . You 've been famous for one year and everyone adores you . If you live 1000 years you 'll seduce too many men . Give the bottles to me . You did well giving them the elixir of craziness . Otherwise you 'd be in trouble . I just do my job , my queen . - I 'll stop them if you want . - Yes . The ugliest woman in Merih is more beautiful than her . This means the men of Earth have no sense of beauty . Yes , if you look at her carefully , you see they have no sense . It 's quite odd . - It 's dangerous to stay here any longer . - Let 's go . - Take them to the saucer . - OK . - Where ? - Let 's move ! What are we gonna do in the saucer ? Long story short , gentlemen ... there are no such things as flying saucers . My long years of research illustrate this , but we humans can be mistaken . Professor , I hear some weird voices on the radio . Like what ? They don 't belong to humans . It 's not like our alphabet . These are weird voices . - Voices that don 't belong to humans . - Don 't belong to humans ? - Yes . Look at this . - Find its location . - Where is it ? - It 's very close . My God ! Lift it up quickly ! Wait a minute ! That 's not a meteor , it 's a real flying saucer ! We are going to Merih .

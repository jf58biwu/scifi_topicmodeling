 Every epoch dreams its successor . - Jules Michelet Presently , we as a nation , are about to touch the heavens ! I am thrilled to have the honour of announcing the culmination of mankind 's history of scientific achievement ! Our power will shine across the world across the universe ! May you be eternal ! Our Ziggurat ! Robots are so insolent these days ! It 's just outrageous ! Our economic future is inconceivable without robots . The problem is friction between robot and human labourers . I heard that an enemy nation has a new weapon . That is why Metropolis needs a stronger , more charismatic leader ! Congratulations ! Congratulations ! Congratulations on the Ziggurat . Will you be going into politics ? What a thing to say ! If President Boon remains healthy and in office our nation is secure . There 's nothing left for me to do . Any requests for Duke Red to go into politics ? Don 't egg him on like that . I 'm no match for Duke Red in popularity . There are rumours that the Ziggurat is actually a military facility . May we have a word from the mayor about this ? Address that to Skunk , the minister of state ! Hurray for Ziggurat ! Hurray for Metropolis ! Say , Uncle , what is the " Ziggurat " ? I 'm not sure . Hey , look at that ! What is that ? Marduk . The sign of the Marduk . Damn ! Hey ! He 's over there ! Oh , I see , I see ... It 's supposed to be ready tonight , Dr. Laughton ! Well ... I provided you with money and top facilities just as you asked ! You 've failed me ! Please allow a little more time . I 'm almost finished . I 'm tired of the same old excuse ! I 'll see it tomorrow night . But it 's not a place worth your trouble to visit . And besides , it 's a mess . I 'll see you tomorrow night ! It 's Rock . There was commotion in the plaza . Yes , a robot was out of his zone . No excuses . You 're in charge of security . Yes , Father . You idiot ! I am not your father ! I took you in , you were an orphan from the last war ! - You assume too much ! - Yes , sir . An accident has occurred in District 45 ! All cars , please rush to the site immediately ! Car 3 here . Pursuing a robot believed to be outside his zone . All cars in the airport area , take precautions and standby . HQ , HQ ! Car 8 here ... I am Shunsaku Ban , a private detective from Japan . Where 's Superintendent Notarlin ? I have a letter from the police commissioner . I see . So this Dr. Laughton is hiding here in Metropolis ? Is that what you 're saying ? Exactly . I heard from an organ smuggler who 's had dealings with him . And the international defender of human rights has issued arrests for the use of live animals in experiments and trafficking organs . I would very much like your cooperation on this . This is my first time here and I have no idea which way is what . Of course , I 'd like to help you but the celebration for the Ziggurat will continue for another week . It 's very busy amidst all this hubbub and we 're short-handed as it is . I have no one to help you on such a case . I have no men , but if you 'd be fine with a robot ... ? A robot ? ! Yes , a robot . It 's a very excellent robot . It has no authority to arrest humans but it can investigate , so I think it 'd be useful to you . I don 't have to return it with a full tank , do I ? No , it needs refuelling every five years . Soon they won 't need humans anymore . I 'm Kenichi . Nice to meet you . I am Model 803-D , RP , DM , 497-3C . - Nice to meet you . - Nice to meet you . Soon , with the completion of the Ziggurat we 'll lead in industry and culture . From this day forward it can be said that this is the birth of a 1000-year nation . I 'm thrilled to have the honour of announcing the culmination of mankind 's scientific achievement ! Our power will shine across the world across the universe ! May you be eternal ! Our Ziggurat ! Now , where should we begin ? 803 ... D , RP , DM , 497-3C . Don 't you have an easier name ? We are not given names like people . Some fear it would infringe on human rights . Oh , I know ! Starting now , your name is Pero ! Pero ! That sounds like he 's a dog . Yeah , it 's the name of a dog I had . He was a fine dog ! In my opinion , I believe there is no place for a criminal to hide in Metropolis . What are you talking about ? I heard he 's here . If Dr. Laughton is in hiding , he is unmistakably in Zone 1 . Zone 1 ? - It 's the underground world . - That 's your detective 's intuition ? Just a matter of probability calculated by my electronic brain . We robots each have our own occupation . Our activities are restricted accordingly . That robot was prohibited from any activity at surface level . But who are those people dressed like fascists ? The Marduk Party . They handle robots outside their zone . Traffic between levels is limited according to rank . People and robots not marked for certain zones may come and go . - So that robot we saw was marked ? - Correct . There 's a gate for every block , but smugglers guide others through passageways so incidents happen . Such a system shouldn 't exist anyway ! Well , well , I suppose light creates shadows . This level is still not that dangerous but depending on the location there are areas without police , so be careful . That 's all right . We didn 't come here to be tourists . Hurry up and come home ! Where in the world did that child go ? ! I was outside for a while , so I wasn 't at home . Where 'd you go ? I 've come back with some stories . Duke Red . Let 's see it , Laughton . She looks perfect . You 're sure she 's not finished ? Well , her fuel system is not stable , so ... Did you use organic machinery ? Not at all ! I would never use illegal means ! Organic machinery is a quick fix , but it doesn 't last long . I 've created her from mechanical parts . She is the greatest work of my life ! - When will she be complete ? - Within the week . If I activate her too soon she could overload and might even blow up . My little Tima . I 'm not going to hand you over to anyone . I 'll put the finishing touches on now and you 're gonna escape with me . I know you . You 're Rock ! How 'd you find my lab ? Guarding Father is one of my many duties . Father ? I don 't believe Duke Red has any children . Wasn 't the child he lost a girl ? Shut up ! I know what you 're up to . You 're trying to trick Father with your technology ! A mere puppet like this could never touch Father 's heart . What are you gonna do ? I am working on Tima at Duke Red 's request ! He has plans for her . The last piece for the Ziggurat . He will place her on the throne ! That 's a lie ! Father would never have a mere robot rule the Ziggurat ! Then ask him yourself . You 'll shoot her ? Knowing that " your " father is waiting for his little angel ? I won 't allow Father to be seduced by a robot ! No . Don 't . Don 't do it ! Oh , God , give me courage ! Give me the strength to guard my father from the evil machines ! A fire ! There 's a fire ! There 's a fire ! A fire ! A fire ! A Marduk set the fire ! I saw him with my own eyes ! I saw him ! Even the Marduks are trying to kill us ! Atlas is right ! They give us as much thought as they do trash ! Take up your weapons ! Now is the time to fight ! Everyone , please calm down . Work will soon extinguish the fire . It 's dangerous here ! Please evacuate ! This is no place for a robot ! We lost our jobs because of you bastards ! - And now you 're giving orders ! - This is no time to be fighting ! What the ... ? ! Hey , Atlas , why 'd the Marduks set fire to a factory ? An old guy was always coming and going from there . Is this the guy ? - Yeah , that 's him . - Thanks ! There 's someone inside ! Oh , my goodness ! - You go around back . - Okay ! Hurry ! - Hang in there , Laughton ! - My notebook . You want that notebook ? ! Laughton ! Laughton 's laboratory burned down ? ! It was an experiment . The fire burned very quickly . Everything was lost . - What happened to Dr. Laughton ? - They found his remains . And not much else . He was a criminal with many warrants so perhaps it was a dangerous experiment ? What 's wrong ? Did you have business with Dr. Laughton ? Shut up ! Leave me ! Let me be alone . Where am I ? Man , that was a terrible fire ! Terrible ? I don 't care about a factory . We got rid of something we didn 't need . Something 's wrong . No matter how much the place burned that robot was quality . Its skeleton should 've remained . Who is that man ? Rock of the Marduk Party . He 's young , but he 's influential . They say that Duke Red trusts him . Duke Red ? How is Duke Red connected with the Marduk ? Duke Red is the founder of the Party . They appear to be unrelated but their funding comes from Duke Red . It 's a secret , but they do it so openly , everyone knows about it . Where does this sewage go ? It dumps into Zone 2 up ahead and goes to a disposal plant in Zone 3 . If they got that far , they won 't be alive . They 'd be treated as waste . A normal human will always return to the site of the crime . People had some good sayings back then . Let us carefully look for Mr. Kenichi again . Who in the world are you ? Who in the world are you ? No . Listen , you refer to yourself as " I. " Who am " l " ? " I am . " You are I. No , listen . You are " I. " I am " you . " Wait ... Who am I ? Right , right ! And I 'm Kenichi . Kenichi . Kenichi . Well , just take your time remembering everything . Your name , your home and your mother and father . Home . Father . Thanks . I know that 's food , but it 's already gone bad , so ... Food . Yeah , you put it in your mouth like this and ... That 's how you eat it ... Oh , no ! If you eat that stuff , you 'll get sick ! No ? I can 't eat ? Sick . Disengaging dome . Time to radiation position : 40 , 39 , 38 , 37 ... The power system , cooling system , control system are all normal . Final stage . Taking aim . Magnetic aim , deviation error , 0.25 . Radiation mechanism , fixing final position . Radiation time is three minutes . It won 't affect humans , but robots working on the surface may malfunction . We will record everything . The data will be invaluable . Start at Level 3 . Yes , sir . Commencing irradiation . 3 seconds . 2 seconds . 1 second . Omotenium fusion ! Sunspot region expanding ! - Fraunhofer from the spectrum . - Positive 2 levels . 35,000 . 40,000 . 45,000 ... Sunspot flare at point R , 49 observed . Sunspot density at 800 and still rising . There is a disturbance in Earth 's ionization . No communication . What are you doing ? Level 3 radiation complete . Main control , discharging system . It 's a success ! The world will be in an uproar over this . After all , you have the power of God in the palm of your hand . If Dr. Laughton finished Tima , she now could have taken the throne . It 's a new weapon , sir . It creates sunspots that bathes the Earth in radiation . How dare they develop such a thing on their own ? It changes the balance of power ! Even with the Marduks hunting the robots the rebels are screaming for human rights instigating citizens by proclaiming change in Robot Laws . Even civilian groups in favour of robots are protesting causing minor skirmishes . This is a golden opportunity ! We could put the law for treason to good use . Do we have control of the military ? Some units are aligned with Duke Red but it should be fine . All right , leak some stories . Stir up anti-Duke Red sentiment then we will have him arrested . If you meet any resistance , mobilize the military ! I believe that he 's the one who killed Laughton ! I don 't understand the connection between him and Laughton . What in the world was Laughton experimenting on , I wonder ? What do you intend to do ? Now that Laughton 's been killed , I should report why he was killed . It 's the least I can do for my client . - Where does he think he 's going ? - Zone 2 , I believe . There are more underground levels ? What is up with this city ? Zone 2 is the area for Metropolis ' power plants . Zone 3 , below that , is the sewage disposal plant . Sewage disposal plant ? Actually , he was investigating the water drainage behind the rundown factory . I 'll go to headquarters and get permission to go below . I 'll also submit a search request for Kenichi . Okay . You bastard ! You 're too old for this ! How much ? Well , sure , if there was a strange guy down here , we 'd know . The administration keeps a sharp watch . - How often are you down here ? - Twice a week . For robot inspection and repairs . These are the Albert II models . They 're the last group to get inspected . Is anyone here ? No , this place always smells horrible ! We humans wouldn 't last a day down here . What 's the matter ? - Someone 's here . - You must be joking ! Hey , what are you doing there ? This area is off-limits ! - They 're alive after all . - What ? Hey ! What are you doing ? It doesn 't matter . He 's a criminal . Tell us where the exit is ! Stop it ! You might hit the equipment ! Are you okay ? Damn ! What 'll we do ? He 's trying to kill us . Damn . Move ! Move ! You 're in the way ! Move , you blockhead ! Move ! Is it okay now ? This place looks okay . What 's wrong ? I see . Fifi can 't go through the gate . Thanks for everything , Fifi . Let 's meet again . Move ! It 's him ! Carrying firearms is prohibited ! Your I.D. ? I 'm Rock of the Marduk ! Demonstrations during holidays are prohibited . Please break up immediately . I repeat , demonstrations during holidays are prohibited . Please break up . - Wait , Kenichi ! - Stop ! Pay up ! - I got some good stuff . - No , I don 't want it . Just try some out ! - They 're nowhere ! - Impossible ! Search the entire area ! That means everywhere ! What 's going on , Atlas ? There was no signal ! We 're cancelling today . Those Marduk bastards are everywhere . - Have we been ratted out ? - No , it 's because of them . Rock is looking for them . Hurry up , you two ! We saw them during the factory fire , didn 't we ? What are your names ? Where are you from ? My name is Kenichi . - I came from Japan with the detect ... - What ? My uncle is a reporter , I 'm helping him . - Why is Rock after you ? - I don 't know . He just started shooting . Are we supposed to believe you ? We should kill them . Cool it ! We 're not a gang . You heard him , he 's a reporter . He can let the world know about Metropolis . That 's more than we could have hoped for . It 's a time of life or death . We have no time to get our pictures taken ! But we 've got the right to choose how we die . I want to die as a revolutionary . Hey , look at that . She 's like an angel . Yeah , she 's an angel . Around here , two or three families live to a room . No schools and no work , either . We live on rations but with the celebration for the Ziggurat we don 't even get those . What does " Ziggurat " mean ? It 's the name of a tower built in Babylon . The most famous was the Tower of Babel . You know what happened to that . The king of Babylon angered the gods and it was destroyed . But history repeats itself . Duke Red will suffer the same fate . And this time , we 'll destroy it , not the gods . Did I make a mistake ? No , that 's not it . Just that your hair has grown . What kind of hair do you like ? What ? I like it the way it is . Come on , let 's practice . - Okay , next is ... - Tima . What ? What 's that ? Tima . My name . I see ! You remembered ! That 's great , Tima . Soon , you 'll remember more stuff . Thank you , Kenichi . Oh , I 'd forgotten . I borrowed these from Atlas . Kenichi . I see . It would be good if the military helps us . Most of the underground is in favour of action but everyone 's hesitant . We 're unsure of our strength . The last celebration for the Ziggurat begins with the Marduk parade . That 's when we 'll crush them , and I want you to storm the Ziggurat . The president will make an announcement that Duke Red 's been arrested for treason . We 'll invoke the right of command and place the military under President Boon . With that , Metropolis will have a normal government . And we will be able to participate as a new political party . Of course , my dear Atlas . The president will welcome you all . Damn , I can 't believe myself ! I 'd finally found him and look what happens . I am sorry for not being more helpful . What are you saying ? You 've been helpful in this place , I don 't know east from west . Don 't worry about Kenichi . He might not look like much but ... What ? Stop that ! What a terrible thing to do ! Be careful . Hide robots . Hide ... Coup d 'état . " Be careful . Robots , hide . There will be a coup d 'état . " What ? ! A coup d 'état ? Watch closely , Kenichi . I want you to tell the world everything ! Oops ! I 'm out of breath . We better get out of here , Pero . This isn 't something we can handle . Please request backup from HQ . Wait ! I can 't just go and leave you here . The first thing that crowd will do is go after robots like you . I 'll be fine . - What ? ! - More importantly I must ensure your safety , since you 're not from here . All right ! Try not to provoke them until I get back ! Got it , Pero ? ! What 's this ? You think you can guard this gate alone ? Demonstrations are prohibited during the celebration . Please disperse . Can 't do that . It 's almost time . Why do humans use violence to resolve issues ? Good question . It 's true that 's a source of our troubles : Emotions . We have no choice but to make progress in spite of them . Because without them we are nothing . It is almost time for the rally . When should we announce it ? Things will be settled by 1 p.m. Perhaps around 3 : 00 or 3 : 30 . What is it , minister ? Can 't sit still ? Actually , Mr. President , yes . I have been given an unpleasant task ... What is this ? ! Bastards ! You 're working for Duke Red now ! I am a fair man . To history , that is . Wait , I can explain ... Why ? Why do robots always get hurt by humans ? They call this a revolution ? The coup d 'état has failed . Metropolis is under martial law in the name of Duke Red . Disarm yourselves and surrender immediately . I repeat . The coup d 'état has failed . Metropolis is under martial law in the name of Duke Red . Disarm yourselves and surrender immediately . Kenichi ! Hey , Kenichi ! Uncle ! So , you 're safe ! I 'm glad , I 'm glad . Are you okay too , Uncle ? Oh , this is nothing . Who 's that ? Her name is Tima . She 's from the lab , and we 've been on the run together . Tima , let me introduce you . This is my uncle . Uncle . Atlas ! We were set up ... So , we meet at last . Don 't move ! Don 't resist . If you hand her over , you might be able to go home alive . Shut up ! You won 't keep your word ! I know what you 're up to . Why , you little ... Tima , get the gun ! Now , let 's have it back . Don 't give it to him ! You sure you can shoot me ? I 'm a human , you know ! Rock ! What is going on here ? What have you been doing ? You survived ? What is the meaning of this ? ! You said Tima burned in the fire ! You said there were no survivors ! And how do you know about Tima ? ! Answer me ! With all due respect you must be the one to sit on the throne . We can 't trust the Ziggurat to a robot ! - We cannot hand the future of ... - You fool ! A robot . Did you think you could manipulate me ? ! I trusted you . You took advantage of me ! On your feet ! Never show your face around me again ! So , you hired Laughton . What of it ? I came from Japan to arrest him . My name is Shunsaku Ban ... Now , get in . - What about Kenichi ? - When our business is done . I need to see Superintendent Notarlin . He 's been reassigned . There 's no replacement yet . To tell the truth the Marduk Party took my nephew by mistake ... Then make a statement through your embassy ! Presently , we as a nation , are about to touch the heavens ! I 'm thrilled to have the honour of announcing the culmination of mankind 's scientific achievement ! Our power will shine across the world . Sake . Make it a hot one . We have hot whiskey or gin , Mr. Japanese Detective . Hot whiskey in a 3l4 - pint bottle . Coming right up . Idiots , idiots , idiots ! To hell with the Ziggurat ! The Marduks are dog shit ! Those shits ! Here you go . Hey , that was Rock . I heard he left the party . Never thought he 'd be around here . - Thanks . - Take care . A man asked me to give this to you . I refused . He asked me without telling Duke Red or anyone . I told him I couldn 't , but he said his name was Kenichi . I just couldn 't help myself . " Dear Tima , I 'm sorry I can 't deliver this in person but I can 't move around . I 'll be leaving the country in a little while so I want to see you just one more time . " What is going on , Enmy ? Really , please send her back right away . If anyone finds out about this , I 'll be in trouble ! Don 't worry . This won 't take long . I didn 't want to do this . I 'll be going now . You tricked me . This is the only way I could talk to you . Where is Kenichi ? Please , let me see him . Uncanny . Talking to you , it 's hard to believe you 're a robot . There was good reason why Father chose Laughton . What are you talking about ? You being a robot . You 're wrong . I 'm not a robot . Then what are you ? A human ? Then who 's your father ? Where is he ? My father is ... Kenichi . And they think a puppet like you could sit on a throne ? ! If you don 't know anything about Kenichi , then I 'm going back now . What ? Tima is gone ? Yes , sir ! You idiot ! Watch it ! Let 's see the secret behind this superhuman that Father wants so much . Hang in there , Laughton ! My notebook . You want that notebook ? ! Don 't worry . I punished Rock a little . What about ? I 'm looking for Kenichi too . And that 's where I 'm going to need your help . Need ? I think he 's being held inside the Ziggurat . If you connect to the Ziggurat 's network you can find out where he is . I can do that ? Now try putting out your hand . How was it ? I know where Kenichi is . Inside the tower . You did it ! So he 's there , just as I thought ! What did I just do ? Oh , that 's right . You don 't know what you are . What do you mean ? Yes , sir . As soon as we find out . Duke Red ? How is it ? We 'll be able to trace the signal . The power was so intense , the line splitter was burnt out . - Found it ! - Where is it ? Zone 1 , South Block 17 , " Hotel Coconuts . " Please tell me . Am I a human ? Or am I ... ? It 's true , you 're different from the other robots . No , I 'm a human . A human , just like Kenichi . Right . Of course you are . In any case , we have to rescue Kenichi first . We 've been searching for you . Where were you going ? Explain or I 'll have you arrested for kidnapping ! You 're asking the wrong man ! Ask your son if you want the real answer . I don 't know what you 're up to but I believe you were definitely working with Dr. Laughton . And his murder was probably instigated by you or Rock . To keep your secret . - Take him in . - Yes , sir ! Come this way ! This is the throne that was built just for you . Soon , you will rule the entire world from here . I will ? Why ? Because that is your destiny . You will soon understand . Hang in there , Kenichi ! It 's me ! Look at me ! Hey , Kenichi ! You bastards ! What did you do to him ? He 's not dying . We just quieted him down a little . I 'll submit a protest through my embassy regarding this ! - It 'll be a diplomatic crisis ! - Really ? I had no idea you were such an important figure . You have my most sincere apology . But no matter where you are from , everyone will bow before Tima . - She 's growing the way we estimated . - Make Kenichi the way he was . What 's wrong , Tima ? Who cares about a little boy ? You possess the power to rule the entire world . What is my power ? Am I a human ? Or am I a machine just like those poor robots ? What a silly thing to say ! How could you be like those pieces of junk ? Then , I am human , same as Kenichi ? What are you saying ? ! You are no mere human ! You are not inferior , ruled by emotions confused by love and morality . You are a superhuman ! Then , I really am . I have brought Miss Tima 's new clothes . It is true , you are a robot . You are the greatest , most sublime creation ever ! That is a lie . I have the love and emotions that you say are human . You are still not complete . You just need time . The fluctuations of your power are taking the shape of love and emotions . One day , you 'll merge with that superhuman throne and become a computer weapon that 'll rule the world ! Then all your emotions and memories will be completely erased ! And where did you get that information ? I 'm still a detective . It 's time to change , Miss Tima . Father , please open your eyes . How in the ... ? What is the meaning of this ? You must sit on that throne . You are the only one that can be our leader , Father . What are you ... ? So you 're awake . I am an artificial human . A machine created to ruin the world . No , not to ruin ! To rebuild ! Stop it ! - Who threw the switch ? - It just started by itself ! - Switch to manual and cut the power ! - Controls are not responding ! Dr. Ponkotz ! - What 's the meaning of this alarm ? - The generator is out of control ! - What 's going on , doctor ? - Well ... Stop this , Tima ! You 'll destroy the Ziggurat ! This is punishment for fooling with robots . Tima 's memories are merging with our database . She 's beginning to go crazy . And God 's wrath descended on the Tower of Babel . Don 't ! She 's not Tima anymore ! All right , I understand . If we don 't stop the omotenium generator we will be done for ! In one hour , the probability of mankind 's survival will be 30 ° / ° . I control the Ziggurat , and all Earth weaponry will be activated within 30 minutes . Oh , my goodness ! Attack targets are the world 's major cities and 7586 facilities . Destruction of humans through irradiation and weapons will occur in 17 hours and 27 minutes . Did you hear that , Duke Red ? Your superhuman is saying it has no need for humans ! Don 't go ! Doctor , we 've lost control ... How can this be ? Get out ! Robots aren 't allowed in here ! Tima , it 's me ! Kenichi ! It 's Kenichi ! Stop ! I won 't let pieces of junk like you kill my father ! Tima , grab my hand ! - I 'm Kenichi . Who in the world are you ? - Who in the world are you ? No . Listen , you refer to yourself as " I. " Hurry , grab my hand ! Who am I ? Where did you find this ? Fifi ? Fifi ! Uncle ! Uncle ? I 'd like to stay for a while longer . Who am I ? Subtitles by Filou ; - )

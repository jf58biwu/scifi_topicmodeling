I tremble at the honour of announcing the culmination of humanity 's long history of intellect and science . Our power spans the earth . Now it will illuminate the stars ! May it stand forever ! Our Ziggurat ! Those robots are getting big ideas . They don 't know their place ! But our economy is unthinkable without robot labour . Yes , but they cause f riction with human workers . The enemy is developing new weapons . What Metropolis needs is a leader who will be a powerf ul symbol ! Duke Red , with the Ziggurat complete , will you be entering politics ? Don 't be silly ! As long as President Boone governs , our state is secure . Politics has no need of me . Mr. President , would you like to see Duke Red in politics ? Don 't encourage him ! How could I compete with anyone so popular ? Is it true there are military facilities in the Ziggurat ? Would the mayor care to comment ? Ask Minister of State Skunk about that . Hurray for the Ziggurat ! Long live Metropolis ! Uncle Shunsaku , what does " Ziggurat " mean ? Who knows ? - Hey ! Look up there ! - What 's that ? Malduk ! It 's the Malduks ! There he is ! You said she 'd be ready tonight , Dr. Laughton . Er , well ... . What is the meaning of this ? I 've given you the best facilities money can buy ! If you could wait a little longer , I 'm almost done . I 'm tired of hearing that . I 'll be at your lab tomorrow night . But it 's not the kind of place you 'd go to ! And the place is a mess ! Get back to work ! - lt 's me . - I hear there was trouble , Rock . Yes . A robot agitator in the plaza . You were supposed to have that under control ! Yes , Father . Fool ! I am not your father ! I merely found you during the last war and took you in . Yes , sir . I 'm Shunsaku Ban , a private investigator f rom Japan . I have a letter of introduction to Superintendent Notarlin . I see . So you 're saying this Dr. Laughton is hiding out here in Metropolis ? Yes . This is a reliable tip f rom an organ smuggler he dealt with . The International Human Rights Committee and other organizations have warrants for him for vivisection experiments and dealing in human organs . To which end I ask for your cooperation seeing I 've never been in this city and I don 't know east f rom west here . I 'd like to help , but with the celebrations for the Ziggurat going on all week it 's taking every single person I have to keep things under control . I don 't have anybody . Well , I could give you a robot if that 's okay with you . A robot ? ! Yes . He 's very good . He 's not authorized to arrest people but he can certainly assist you in your investigation . Do I have to return him with a f ull tank ? He only needs ref ueling every five years . Soon they won 't need us anymore . I 'm Kenichi . How do you do ? I am Model 803-D-RP-DM 497-3-C . Uh , how do you do ? The completion of the Ziggurat establishes our Metropolis as the world leader in industry , economics and culture . Thus is born a state that will last a thousand years ! I tremble at the honour of announcing the culmination of humanity 's long history of intellect and science . Our power spans the earth . Now it will illuminate the stars ! May it stand forever ! Our Ziggurat ! Well , where do we start , uh , 803 , uh ... . D-RP-DM497-3-C . Don 't you have an easier name ? We are not allowed human names , as it may inf ringe upon human rights . I know ! As of now , your name is Pero . That 's a dog 's name ! That 's right . I used to have a dog named Pero . He was a great dog . In my opinion , a criminal could not hide up here in Metropolis . I have reliable sources that say he 's here ! Dr. Laughton would not hide up here . He would go to Zone 1 . - Zone 1 ? - Underground . Hey ! You are a detective ! It is simply a calculation of probabilities . Robots are strictly forbidden to operate outside their assigned area . That robot was not authorized to operate at surface level . Okay , but who are those guys ? They look like fascists . The Malduk Party , vigilantes who started as a political group . Movement between levels is restricted . No one who carries the mark may pass through this gate . So that robot had the mark ? Yes . Each block has a gate like this . There are , of course , hidden ways and people who work as guides to them . Damn right ! The system 's wrong ! It takes light to create shadow , I guess . This level is not particularly dangerous but there are places in which police writ does not run . A void them . We can 't do that . We 're not here as tourists . Duke Red . Let 's see it . Very good . Isn 't she finished ? Her final-stage energy processor isn 't stable yet . Are you using real organs ? Dear me , no ! That 's illegal ! Real organs are quicker , but they don 't last very long . Hers are mechanical . I made them . She will be my masterpiece ! When will you finish ? Within the week . If I start her too early she 'll build up too much energy , catch fire and explode . My Tima ... . I 'm not giving you to anyone ! I 'll put on the finishing touches and together we will flee ! Rock ? What are you doing here ? Protecting my father is my most important task . Father ? But Duke Red has no children . And the child who died was a girl . Quiet ! I know what you 're up to . No mad scientist is going to deceive my father . And no mannequin like this will steal his heart . Stop ! It is at Duke Red 's request that I 've made Tima . Tima is the super-being who is to sit on the Throne of Power atop the Ziggurat . You lie ! He would never give the Ziggurat to a robot ! Perhaps you should ask Duke Red about that . Will you destroy the super-being for whom the one you call Father waits ? No robot will steal my father ! No ! Don 't ! O , ye Gods , give me courage and strength to guard my father from machines ! Fire ! Fire ! A Malduk set that fire ! I saw him ! The ones up there want to kill us ! Atlas is right ! They think we 're nothing but garbage ! To arms ! Now we have to fight ! Please remain calm . Fire-fighting operations are commencing . Everyone please step back . Robots out ! First you take our jobs , and now you 're trying to kill us ! This is no time to be fighting ! What the- - ? ! But why did he set fire to that old factory ? Well , that strange old man was around . An old man ? This one ? - Yes . - Thanks a lot ! There 's someone in there ! Oh , no . Kenichi , go round the back . Hurry ! - Come on , Laughton ! - Notebook ... . That notebook ? Laughton ! Laughton 's lab burned down ? ! I guess he was doing an experiment . The fire just ripped right through it . - What happened to him ? - His body was found . Whatever he was doing considering there are warrants for his arrest it must have been something dangerous . What 's wrong , Father ? What did Dr. Laughton mean to you ? Get out ! Leave me alone . Where am I ? That was sure some fire ! Well , it was just an old factory . Saves the trouble of tearing it down . This is strange . She was the most advanced robot there is . There should be something left . - Pero , who 's that ? - Rock of the Malduks . He 's young , but he 's one of their main men . They say he does Duke Red 's dirty work . Duke Red ? Is he connected with the Malduks ? He 's the party founder . Now there 's no official connection , but he f unds their activities . It 's a public secret . Everyone knows . Where does this sewer come out ? It merges up ahead with the sewage f rom Zone 2 and goes to the processing plant in Zone 3 . If she 's down there , she 'll have been chopped up with the garbage . Anyone else , yes . The criminal always returns to the scene . An old saying , but a good one . We should continue searching for Kenichi . Who are you ? Who are you ? No , no , no . You call yourself " I. " " l " am who ? - " l " am ... . - You are I. No , listen . You are " I. " I am " you " ... . Huh ? I am who . Yeah , that 's right . And I 'm Kenichi . Kenichi . - Kenichi . - Yeah . Anyway , it 'll all come to you after a while . Your name , your family , your father , your mother . Family ... father ... . Uh , thanks , I guess . I know this is food , but it 's all rotten . Food ... . Yeah . You put it in your mouth like this and eat it . No , don 't eat that ! It 'll make you sick ! No , don 't eat . Make you sick . Attention Control . Cloud cover 1 . 1 . Clear to proceed with experiment . Magnetic bias 3 . 7 . Continuing line adjustment . Commencing cooling . Opening dome . 40 seconds to radiation . 39 , 38 ... . Motor , cooling , sensor and operating systems , all go . Control authorization . We are go . Energy condensers confirmed at Level 3 , plus-33 . Roger . Observation Group to Control . Transmitting footage from city . Commencing final preparations . Magnetic target . : bias 0.25 . Optical target . : bias 1.06 . Radiation equipment in position . We 'll radiate for three minutes . Citizens won 't be affected , but aboveground robots will . I 'm having everything recorded . The data will be valuable . Begin at Level 3 . Yes , doctor . Commencing radiation ! Terminate Level-3 radiation at 180 seconds . Solar constant deviation at minus 24 . Five seconds to Sector R. 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 . Omotanium fusion ! Omotanium confirmed in Fraunhofer phase . 35 , 000 ... 40 , 000 ... 45 , 000 . Sunspot field density , 800 and rising . Ionospheric disturbance . Communications disrupted . Level-3 radiation terminated . Control disengaged . Success ! This will set the whole world on its ear ! You now hold the power of the gods themselves . If only Dr. Laughton had finished building our guardian deity ... . He 's caused anomalies in sunspots and bathed Earth in harmful magnetic radiation . It 's an outrage that he would endanger national security by developing such a thing ! The Malduk robot hunters are using this as an ex cuse to cry " human rights " and press for changes in the Robot Law . The pro-robot citizens ' groups say that 's reactionary nonsense . They 're organizing protests . There 's fighting breaking out . This is our chance , Mr. President ! We could make a case for treason here . Will the military support us ? Some units are under Duke Red 's influence , but I can handle that . We 'll stir up the public with a few leaks . Once sentiment is against Duke Red , we 'll arrest him for treason . Should military action be needed , you have my approval . I suspect he was the guy who did in Laughton . What I don 't understand is how they were connected . Just what was Laughton working on , anyway ? What will you do ? Laughton 's already dead . I want , at least , to know why . My client deserves that . - Where 's he going now ? - Zone 2 , I think . There 's another level below this ? How far down does this place go ? Zone 2 is the Metropolis power plant area . Zone 3 below that is the sewage-handling facility . The sewage facility . You know , he was looking at a drain behind that factory . I 'll report back and get permission to go below . I 'll file a missing persons report on Kenichi too . - Hey ! You 're old for a petty thief ! - Sorry ! If anyone was wandering around down there they 'd notice him right away . How often are you down here ? Twice a week , for maintenance on the robots . These are Albert II types . It 's their last check this week . Is anyone here ? You never get used to the stink down here , though . No human could last a day at this work . - What is it ? - Someone 's there . Impossible ! Hey ! What are you doing there ? ! This is a restricted area ! So she survived . Help ! - What are you doing ? ! - lt 's all right . They 're criminals . How do we get out of here ? Stop that , please ! You 'll hit the equipment ! Are you okay ? That guy 's trying to kill us ! Move ! Move ! Out of the way ! You piece of junk ! Move ! Is it safe ? It looks okay . What 's wrong ? Oh , I get it . Fifi can 't go through that gate . Thanks for everything , Fifi . We 'll see you again . Move ! It 's him ! Fifi ! No weapons through here . May I see your I.D. ? I 'm Rock of the Malduks ! Demonstrations are forbidden during Celebration Week . Please disperse immediately . Kenichi ? - Kenichi ! - Hey ! Pay up ! - They 're not here ! - They have to be ! Keep looking ! Look over that way ! What 's the matter , Atlas ? We 're waiting for your signal ! Not today . There are Malduks all over the place . - Was there a leak ? - They 're the reason . Rock 's after them . Come on ! He was at that factory . Who are you ? Where did you come f rom ? I 'm Kenichi . I 'm f rom Japan . My uncle 's a private ... . - A private what ? - A journalist ! I 'm his assistant . Why is Rock after you ? I don 't know . He just started shooting at us . I don 't trust them . Let 's kill them . Cool it ! We 're not a gang . He says he 's a journalist . If he can tell the world about Metropolis , that helps us ! We can 't waste time on nice uniforms and our pictures in the paper . The uniform I die in will be the uniform of the revolution ! Look at that ! - She looks like an angel ! - Yeah . An angel . Around here there 's two or three families to a room . There are no schools and hardly any jobs . They survive on food handouts , but with the Ziggurat celebrations that 's all been stopped . What does " Ziggurat " mean ? It 's an ancient Babylonian tower . The Tower of Babel was one . You know what happened to that . The king 's pride brought down the wrath of God on him . History repeats itself . The same thing will happen to Duke Red . But it won 't be God this time . It 'll be us . Is that wrong ? No , it 's fine . I was just thinking your hair 's grown . What kind of hair do you like ? Yours is fine right now . Let 's get back to your writing . Next comes ... . - Tima . - What ? Tima . My name . So you remember ! That 's great ! Now you 'll start remembering more and more . Thank you , Kenichi . Oh , I forgot . I borrowed this f rom Atlas . Kenichi ? So the army 's with us ? That helps a lot . The underground residents support us but they 're not sure if we 've got the strength to win . The Malduks are to move when the Ziggurat celebrations end . We want you to crush them and storm the Ziggurat . The president will announce the arrest of Duke Red for treason . He will invoke his powers to take control of the police and military . Then Metropolis will be governed by the rule of law . And we will participate as a proper political party . Of course , Atlas . The president will welcome you with open arms . The things I get myself into ! I finally find that kid and look what happens ! I 'm sorry I could not have been of more assistance . What are you talking about ? You 've been lots of help ! I don 't know east f rom west here . Don 't worry about Kenichi . He 's tougher than he- - Cut that out ! Just look at this , will you ? " Watch out . Hide , robots . Coup d 'état . " What ? ! A coup d 'état ? Oh , man ! Take a good look , Kenichi . Tell the whole world how angry we are . I 'm all out of breath ! We 'd better get out of here , Pero . We can 't do anything . Ask headquarters for backup . I 'm not leaving you here ! It 's robots they 're going to attack first ! - I will be fine . - What ? It is also my duty to ensure the safety of all visitors to our city . All right . Just don 't stir anything up till I get back ! Are you going to hold this gate all by yourself ? Demonstrations are forbidden during Celebration Week . Please disperse . Sorry , we can 't do that . Our time has come . Why must humanity settle matters by resorting to violence ? Yes , we all know that . I agree it is a problem . It 's our emotions . They vibrate , and all we can do is move forward within that amplitude . But without affirming them , we can 't survive . It 's time for the uprising to begin . When should we release a statement ? Things should be clear by about 1 p.m so I suggest 3 or 3 : 30 . What is it , minister ? Hard to relax , eh ? Yes , Mr. President . I have an unpleasant duty to perform . What the- - ? ! You 've gone over to Duke Red ! I am merely history 's agent . Wait ! We can discuss this ! Why ? Why do humans just go and destroy robots ? Revolution . The coup d 'état has failed . Martial law is in effect , under the command of Duke Red . Abandon your weapons and surrender . I repeat , the coup d 'état has failed . Martial law is in effect , under the command of Duke Red . Abandon your weapons and surrender . Kenichi ! Hey ! Kenichi ! Uncle ! You 're safe ! That 's great ! - Are you all right ? - This ? It 's nothing ! Who 's this ? Her name 's Tima . We escaped f rom that fire together . Tima , this is my uncle . Uncle . Atlas ! It was a trap ! We meet at last . Don 't move ! No trouble . Give me the girl , and you might get back home alive . Don 't make promises you won 't keep , Rock ! Don 't play games with me ! Tima , pick up the gun ! I 'll have that back , please . Don 't give it to him ! You going to shoot ? I 'm human , you know . Rock ! So it 's these people you 've neglected your duties to go chasing after- - Tima ! It 's you ! Rock ! What 's going on here ? ! You told me no one survived the fire in Dr. Laughton 's lab ! And how did you know about Tima ? Answer me ! I will . You are the one who must sit on the Throne of Power . No robot must ever rule the Ziggurat and Metropolis ! Fool ! Robot ? Do you think you fool me ? You 're out of line , boy ! Get up ! I never want to see you again ! Kenichi ! - So it was you who hired Laughton ! - What if I did ? I 've come f rom Japan to arrest Laughton . My name is Shunsaku Ban ... . Get in . - And Kenichi ? - You 'll see him later . I 'm here to see Superintendent Notarlin . He 's been transferred . His successor hasn 't been named . There 's been a mistake . The Malduks have taken my nephew away . Handle it through your embassy ! At this moment our state extends its reach to the stars ! I tremble at the honour of announcing the culmination of humanity 's long history of intellect and science . Sake . Make it hot . Hot whiskey or gin I can do , for a Japanese detective . Hot whiskey , then . Who gives a damn about the Ziggurat ? ! And those Malduks can eat dogshit ! Here . Hey ! That was Rock ! I heard he quit the party . What 's he doing here ? - Thanks . - Take care . Whoops ! A man earlier tonight asked me to give you this . I said no . He wanted it kept secret f rom Duke Red , and of course I said I couldn 't possibly , but his name was Kenichi . " I can 't move at the moment so I can 't come to you . I 'm leaving the country soon . I want to see you again . " Kenichi ! What 's going on here ? You will bring her back soon , won 't you ? I 'll be in real trouble if they ever find out . Don 't worry . This won 't take long . This wasn 't my idea . I have to get back . You tricked me . How else could I talk to you ? Where 's Kenichi ? If you know , take me to him . Well , well , well . To talk to you , you 'd never guess you were a robot . I guess Father chose his mad scientist very well . - What are you talking about ? - You being a robot . That 's not true . I 'm not a robot . So what are you ? Human ? So who 's your father ? Where is he ? My father is Kenichi . The super-being ? A mannequin like you ? ! If you can 't take me to Kenichi , I 'm going . Tima 's gone ? ! Watch where you 're going ! Let 's see inside this super-being that Father wants so much . Come on , Laughton ! Notebook . That notebook ? Don 't be alarmed . I taught Rock a lesson he won 't forget . Where 's Kenichi ? I 'm looking for him too . I need your help for that . You do ? I think they 've got him somewhere in the Ziggurat . I need to look for him on the Ziggurat 's data network . Can you do that ? Hold out your hand . Kenichi ! Well ? Kenichi 's in that building ! You did it ! I knew he was there ! What happened to me ? I see . You don 't know who you are , do you ? What do you mean ? I 'll report the instant we find anything , sir . - Duke Red ? - Yeah . - Anything ? - We can track the signal by where it burned out the splitters . - Got it ! - Where ? Zone 1 , South Block 17 . The Hotel Coconut . Tell me , please ! Am I human or am I ... ? Well , you 're different f rom normal robots . I 'm human . Just like Kenichi ! Uh , yes , of course you are ! Anyway , now we 've got to rescue Kenichi . Tima ! I 've been looking for you ! Tell me what 's going on or I 'll charge you with kidnapping ! I 'm not your man . It 's your son you want to talk to . Rock ? I don 't know what the plan is but I suspect Dr. Laughton was involved in it somehow . And I suspect you had him killed to keep her a secret . Take him away . Come on ! That is a special throne made especially for you . One day f rom here , you will rule the entire world ! Me ? Why ? That is your destiny . I 'll show you . Kenichi ! Kenichi ! Wake up , Kenichi ! It 's me ! Can you hear me ? Kenichi . Kenichi ? What have you done to him ? ! He 's in no danger . We just had to quiet him down a little . Kenichi ? Kenichi ? I 'll file a protest with my embassy ! It 'll be an international incident ! Oh ? I didn 't realize you were so politically important . My apologies . But soon every nation in the world will bow down before Tima . Make Kenichi the way he was . What 's one or two young kids , Tima ? You have the power to rule the world ! What power is that ? Am I human ? Or am I one of those poor robots ? Oh , don 't be silly ! You 're nothing like those piles of junk ! Then am I human , like Kenichi ? What are you saying ? ! You 're no mere human being ruled by emotion and feeling , torn between morality and love ! You are the super-being ! So then I am a ... . I 've brought you new clothes , Miss Tima . Yes , you are a robot but you stand at the pinnacle of all existence ! No . I have the emotions and love that you hate . That 's because your f ull capacities haven 't yet taken form . As your abilities evolve , they 're taking the form of emotion and love . In time- - You will become one with that throne , a computer weapon meant on conquest ! Your memories and emotions will all be erased ! How did you know that ? ! I fancy myself a detective . Come , Miss Tima . You should change . Father , open your eyes ! Rock ! What on earth ? ! What are you doing ? It is you who must sit on that throne . You are the leader we must bow to ! No ! Tima ! You 're awake ? I am a humanoid , a machine made to destroy the world . - Not destroy ! Make again ! - Stop ! Kenichi ... . Hey ! Who threw that switch ? It just started up ! - Cut the power ! - lt won 't respond ! It 's going into the red ! Dr. Ponkotz ! What 's that alarm ? The omotanium generator 's going wild ! - What 's going on ? - I 'm not sure . Stop , Tima ! You 'll destroy the Ziggurat ! This comes of trifling with robots . Her memory 's merging with the data network . She 'll go mad ! Thus God destroyed the Tower of Babel . Tima ! No ! She 's no longer the Tima you knew ! All right . The omotanium generator will explode if we don 't shut it down ! The chance of human survival will fall to 30 percent within one hour . My entire worldwide network of forces will be completely activated within 30 minutes . Their targets are the world 's major cities and 7586 other facilities . Estimated time period for eradication of humanity by biological warfare : 17 hours , 27 minutes . Hear that , Duke Red ? Your super-being says she doesn 't need us ! Tima ! Come back ! Kenichi ! Kenichi ! Tima ! Tima ! Doctor , we 've lost control of the underground power pl- - What 's happening ? Get out ! You robots are not supposed to be here ! Tima ! It 's me ! Kenichi ! It 's Kenichi ! Stop ! The likes of you will never kill my father ! Rock ! Tima ! Tima ! Tima ! Grab my hand ! - I 'm Kenichi . Who are you ? - Who are you ? No , no , no . You call yourself " I. " Kenichi ! Grab on ! I am who ? Tima ! Where did you find this ? Fifi ? Fifi ! Kenichi ! Uncle ! Uncle I think I 'd like to stay here a bit longer . I am who ?

 - It 's too soon to wake him . - We have no choice . I programmed the CLC for two hours . - Who knows when it 'll be open again ? - We 'll move him if he wakes up . If not , we 'll dispose of him the usual way . Please state registration code . Check . - Where was the subject found ? - In the woods a week ago . The capsule was fully intact . - Is the capsule dated ? - Yes . The subject was frozen in 1 973 . Which means he 's been under for 200 years . - Blood pressure . - 1 40 over 50 . - Encephalo activity ? - Just under normal . General life functions , acceptable . He should wake up any moment . Any information on him ? Just the usual data card and personal artifacts . The subject was 35 years old at time of initial cryogenic immersion . His name , Miles Monroe . It says he was part owner of the Happy Carrot Health Food Restaurant . Also a clarinet player with the Ragtime Rascals . Was his immersion voluntary ? According to this , " He was admitted with a minor peptic ulcer and complications set in . " The patient never regained consciousness . He was admitted for cryogenic immersion by his cousin . - The physical damage was repaired . - Totally . We 're getting a response . This is critical . If this isn 't handled carefully there could be trauma . Remember , this subject expects to be waking up in St. Vincent 's Hospital , in Greenwich Village in 1 973 . Swallow reflex is almost there . - Let 's move him . - He 's not ready . We 've got to get him ambulatory . Careful . Careful ! Now , just keep him on his feet . Get him to the farm . We 'll meet there tonight . Yes . Let 's try to take a step . Like this . One . Up it comes . Look at me . Up , down . That 's it . There you are . - Very good , Mr. Monroe ! - Good ! Up , down . No , he 's got it in reverse . You 're going the wrong way ! No , the other way ! There we go . Security is coming ! Please , Mr. Monroe , wake up ! We 've got to get him dressed . Stand here . Stay there . That 's it . Mr. Monroe . Here we are . Oh ! Sorry to bother you . Is everything okay ? Yes . We ought to be through here shortly . That 's funny . We 're getting a misread on the power function . Really ? I 'II order a check first thing in the morning . Any reason why anyone else would be using power ? No , it 's just Dr. Orva , Dr. Monroe and myself . We definitely registered an increase here . Uh , don 't mind Dr. Monroe . He- - He- - Oh . He 's feeling the effects of a new treatment . - What 's this ? - Oh , that ... . I think you should come with us . - We haven 't done anything . - I can explain . You 've heard of the Venus Project ? - Yes . - Well-- We had to finish some very important work . We were given no reason to believe that we couldn 't- - - Do you have authorization ? - Yes . We came through channels a week ago . - Don 't you believe- - ? - Dr . Monroe- - - This really is getting- - - It could be dangerous . Please just let us complete our work . He 'll get dizzy . This is getting worse . Can 't you see what a difficult- - ? The experiment is getting out of hand . If we hadn 't been interrupted , we 'd have this under control . Is this experiment authorized ? He 's fully recovered , except for a few minor kinks . - Has he asked for anything special ? - For breakfast he requested wheat germ ... - ... organic honey and tiger 's milk . - Those were substances that were felt to be Life-preserving . You mean there was no deep fat ? No steak or cream pies or hot fudge ? Those were thought unhealthy . The opposite of what we now know is true . Incredible . Well , he wants to know where he is and what 's going on . I think it 's time to tell him . I can 't believe this ! My doctor said I 'd be up in five days . He was off by 1 99 years . Think of this experience as a miracle of science . A miracle of science is , I have surgery I wake up and my rent isn 't 200 years late . That 's a miracle of science . This is a cosmic screwing . And where am I anyhow ? What happened to all my friends ? Everyone you knew before has been dead 200 years . But they all ate organic rice . You are now in the year 21 73 . This is the Central Parallel of the American Federation . It 's what you 'd probably call the southwestern United States . That was before the war . - War ? - According to history a century ago , a man found a nuclear warhead . You will remain in hiding here for two weeks for testing . When you 've recovered , we 'll discuss the plan . I still can 't believe this . What do you mean , " hiding " ? Who am I hiding from ? Well , you might as well know , Miles your revival was in opposition to government policy . What we did is illegal . And if we 're caught , we 'll all be destroyed . Destroyed ? Your brain will be simplified . My brain ? That 's my second favorite organ . Resisters to mind reprogramming will be exterminated . What is this ? This is worse than California . There is a growing underground , Miles . And someday we can overthrow our great leader . You must be kidding . I wanna go back to sleep . If I don 't get 600 years , I get grouchy . We 're moving too fast . He 's still unstable . I go in for a lousy ulcer operation . I 'm in tinfoil for 200 years , I wake up on the " Ten Most Wanted " list . We 'd better tranquilize him . It was too good to be true . I parked near the hospital . Smoke this . Get the smoke deep into your lungs . - I don 't smoke . - It 's tobacco . It 's one of the healthiest things for you . You need your strength . I bought Polaroid at seven . It 's probably up millions by now . Now we have certain artifacts here which we date from 1 950 to 2000 . We 'd like any information you can give us on them . Little exists . - For instance . - Joseph Stalin . I was not too crazy about him . Bad mustache . Lots of bad habits . This is Bela Lugosi , former New York City mayor . See what it did to him ? This is , uh- - Charles de Gaulle , a very famous French chef . Had his own TV show , where he made souffl√©s and everything . This is Scott Fitzgerald over here . Romantic writer . Big with English majors college girls , nymphomaniacs . This is Chiang Kai-shek , who I was also not crazy about . Billy Graham . Very big in the religion business . You know ? He knew God personally . They got him his complete wardrobe . Went out on double dates . They were once romantically linked . This is some girls burning a bra . You notice it 's a very small fire . Um , this- - I don 't know what that is . That 's Norman Mailer . He was a great writer . He donated his ego to the Harvard Medical School for study . And this is a centerfold from a magazine called Playboy . These girls didn 't exist in actual Life . They were rubberized . Then you could spread ointment or anything else that you- - I 'll just take this and study it later . Uh , and um would you tell me exactly what this is ? This is the " Chattering Teeth . " You 'd take this to a party if you wanted big laughs . And you put it down on a table . And you 'd set it off . And then ... . You see how funny it is ? The teeth chatter . They 're plastic . I am going , at this time to give to this TV and radio audience- - Some of us think he might once have been president but that he did something horrendous so that all records were wiped out about him . There is nothing in books . No pictures on stamps or money . He was the president . Whenever he left the White House they would count the silverware . Thank you very much . From the start , Muhammad Ali 's career was marked by controversy , and who knows ? It may have ended in the very same way . At first we didn 't know what this was but we have a theory . When criminals in your society were punished they made them watch this . Remember the way it began ? March of 1964 . - That 's where it began . - Yes , that 's exactly right . - Would you Like more ? - This is awful . - I could have sold it at my store . - Janus , some more for Mr. Monroe . Certainly , sir . Are you thirsty , sir ? - Me ? No . No , thank you . - Of course . - These robots are uncanny . - They 're a big industry . More sophisticated than any other labor-saving devices . - They 're plastic . - But they 're responsive . - I 've dated girls with less movement . - Watch this . Janus , come here . Yes , Dr. Orva . May I be ofservice to you ? Tell us about yourself . My name is Janus 414 . I 'm a domestic service menial , 400 series . I can cook , clean . I am a butler , gardener and chauffeur . I have been programmed to respond to a series of domestic commands . Clear the table and leave the room . Come on , Miles . Any females ? The possibilities are limitless . - You must get out of here . - Where am I going ? To the Western District . The underground movement is there . Have you ever taken a political stand on anything ? Yeah , sure . For 24 hours once I refused to eat grapes . We want to know about something called the Aires Project . - Why ? - It 's the leader 's plot to destroy the revolution . How do I fit in ? We woke you because you have no identity . Everyone here has a record . We 've been computerized fingerprinted , voiceprinted . But not you . You can be used to penetrate . And you don 't know anything . They could torture you . What could you say ? My name , rank and your name . You 've got to help us . I 'm not the heroic type . - I was beaten by Quakers . - You 're our chance . I 'd love to help , but I don 't do anything that involves torture . I 'm a screamer . It 's embarrassing . - I wake up shrieking . - Excuse me . The security police have surrounded the house . When do you want lunch ? - Go to the Western District ! - Find the Aires Project ! - You can do it ! - Out that way ! Fly , goddamn it , fly ! Goddamn cheap , Japanese flying packs ! No ! No ! No ! We haven 't found the alien . We need to check the van . AII right . Come on . I don 't have all day . Come on , come on . Here 's your new home . Oh , no . Is this all they had ? I 'd hoped for at least decent features . Next week I 'll have your head removed . Okay . Come on . Come on . What 's your name ? - Milo . - The alien is still at large . Anyone observing unusual activity or behavior should do our leader a favor by reporting it to the police . I 'm expecting company any minute now . You 'll help with the drinks and serve . The kitchen is on a single-circuit system . I 'm going to put rose oil on my fingertips . Regulate the aromatron . And make sure there 's lots of food . AII right . I think the way it was first explained to me ... . - Which one ? There were so many . - That very funny story . Hi , everyone ! Long time no see ! Long time no see . Come right on in . Wait , wait , wait . Come on . Hurry up . Where did you get that ? It 's gorgeous . - Hi . How are you ? - You look great . Luna . Thank you . It 's wonderful . You shouldn 't have . - I thought you 'd Like it . - It 's Keane . It 's pure Keane . No . No , it 's greater than Keane . It 's Cugat . It was white . And you know where she got it . - You 're kidding . - And you know who paid for- - - ... magnificent . - Oh , let 's go tell her about what- - Here it is ! - Let me get that for you . - Thank you . The Orb . Could I get a hit off of that Orb , Milo ? - Now , Milo ! - Let 's all go for a swim ! Where 's the pool ? Run , run , run , run ! Oh , that was wonderful ! I feel so refreshed ! We could have screwed if the crowd was bigger . - We 'll use the Orgasmatron . - Good idea . - Come on . - Beverly 's nose looked larger tonight . - I had such a good time . - I thought the party came off well . As good as last night 's . Maybe not as good as Saturday 's , but you know what ? I Love a party with a theme . What 's on your mind ? They arrested Dalton Porter today . - Why ? - He 's with the underground . It was horrible . They tried to reprogram his mind . - Now he 's a vegetable . - Stop . I saw it happen . He was babbling . He claimed he saw experiments at the hospital . Something called Aires . I don 't want to hear it . This world is full of great things . What makes people hate everything ? Why is there an underground ? We have the Orb , the Telescreen , the Orgasmatron . - What do they want ? - It 's hard to believe . We 're artists . - We respond only to beauty . - Oh , yes . I know . I wrote a poem today . - You didn 't . - Yes , I did . A little boy caught a butterfly And said to himself I must try to understand my life And help others Not just mothers and fathers But friends , strangers too With eyes of blue With lips , full red and round But the butterfly didn 't make a sound For he had turned into a caterpillar By and by It 's deep . You 're so obviously influenced by McKuen . - Do you really Like it ? - One thing they change from caterpillars into butterflies ... - ... not the other way . - They do ? They do ? Damn it ! Damn it ! I always get that wrong ! - Oh , shoot ! - Relax , relax . - Have some chocolate . - The evening 's spoiled ! - No ! - I 'm getting a headache ! - I hate to be wrong ! - Luna . - No ! - Sit down . - Luna , sit down . - Sorry . - It 'll be all right . Now just relax . - I was having so much fun . Come on . That 's better . And now , Channel 1200 leaves the air until tomorrow . Our leader wishes you all a good night . - Can I help you ? - Please change his head . - Something more aesthetic . - Right . And check his works . He acts peculiar . Any room for a head change ? Yeah , sure . - AII right . I 'II be back . - Let 's go . I need your help . I 'm Miles . I was frozen in 1 973 , but they thawed me . I didn 't do anything ! I 'm a nice person with good goals . I 'd never force myself sexually on a blind person . - You 're the alien . - Your government is evil . - What is the Aires Project ? - You 're him . You won 't give me up . You 're nice . I knew I could count on you . Are you hungry ? Do you want a cracker ? Take a cracker . You must be hungry ? It 's been hours . These space cookies were all you had . Eat something . You 'll feel better . Just take a cracker . Will you shut up ? Put yourself in my position . I 'm a clarinet player in 1 973 , I go for an operation I wake up 200 years Later and I 'm Flash Gordon . Plus , I 'm a criminal . I did nothing wrong . I ran a food store in Greenwich Village . Occasionally a customer got botulism . But that was very rare . I need you . You 're the only person I know . If you want to scream , scream because nobody 's around . - Help ! - Go ahead . Scream . - I Love it . - Help ! Alien ! Alien ! Help ! Help me ! Help ! If you don 't shut up , I 'II hit your head so hard something Like guacamole will come out of your ears . - What do you want ? - To reach the underground . I won 't help an alien or his ideas . - So go back to Greenberg 's Village . - Greenwich Village . That was 200 years ago . I can 't go back . You 're sick ! You must give up ! They 'll just restructure your brain . Nobody touches that . It 'd be Like getting hit by lightning . I want to go home ! I 'm getting a headache . I haven 't had a bath in seven hours . I 'm not accustomed to this ! I need my Orb ! I want to relax ! Look at me ! I 'm shaking ! - You 'd be great at camping . - Take me home ! They 'll Look for me . I 'm an important person . I am a poet . I sell 20 to 30 a week , plus greeting cards . - How far is the Western District ? - It 'd take days with a car . Take me and you won 't see me again . I 'm hungry ! I can 't think straight . I 'II promise you anything . If I get you some food , will you take me there ? I 'II find us something . Don 't try anything funny . - You know what you 'll get . - What ? What ? What will you get ? A large and painful hickey . I beat a man insensible with a strawberry . That 's a big chicken . How terrible , to be pecked to death . Pass the celery . - Here you go . - Couldn 't you get anything else ? It 's not easy to run with a canoe-sized banana . You didn 't get dessert . No seasoning , no wine ... . I can 't believe their size . I 'd hate to see the fertilizer . - What 's that ? A noise . - What ? Didn 't you hear it ? Are there any strange animals here ? Anything weird ? Like a crab 's body with a social worker 's head ? How do you know I won 't turn you in ? How do I know ? Because I think you trust me . Maybe because I got you food . And I 'm not really such a bad guy . Now we 're gonna get a vehicle . Don 't try anything funny or you 'll be sorry . Our car broke down . Could we borrow one ? - Sure . Come in . Are you okay ? - Just fine . Goodness , Look at yourself . You 're a mess ! I might have clothes you could jump right into .

Reagen , bring out my hydrovac suit right this minute . Here 's your silly old hydrovac suit . I could hardly find it . It 's such a mess in that bedroom . What am I gonna do with it ? The police will recognize you in that robot uniform . But what is a hydrovac suit ? Space travel . Use it as a disguise . I see you 're starting to think now . Why did we stop ? I think that we 're lost . Hey , Look ! What ? Over there ! - No , over there ! - Should we get rid of her ? I 'm not the one ! We 'll reprogram her . What do you mean ?

It 's the New York Times , from 1 990 . " Pope 's wife gives birth to twins . " Wow . - We don 't have cities anymore . - None at all ? I went to the university at a population center . You went to a university ? Hard to believe . For what ? Cosmetic sexual technique and poetry . They teach sex in school ? Yes , in case the machine breaks . What do you do , switch to manual ? - Where 'd you learn about sex ? - From my mother . I asked where babies came from . She heard " rabies , " so she said dogs . Later , a lady had triplets . I thought a Great Dane bit her . We 'll dump it in the water . They 'll never find it . What 's it feel Like to be dead for 200 years ? Like spending time in Beverly Hills . Don 't bother to help . It 's a light car . Were you scared ? Do you believe in God ? Do I believe in God ? I 'm what you call a teleological existential atheist . I believe in an intelligence , except in New Jersey . I never understand what you say . Do you believe in God ? I believe there 's somebody out there who watches over us . It 's the government . Miles , did you ever realize that " God " spelled backwards is " dog " ? - Yeah . So ? - It makes you think . Yeah . You want to push the car , please ? Push the car , will you ? - Ready ? - Yeah . AII right . Let 's go ! Nice work . Just my luck , it hit a turtle . Hey , this is where they first brought me . - It looks deserted . - Boy , we really have gone wrong . Hey . Hey , Look at this .

And vice versa . Come on . You are joking . I 'm always joking . It 's a defense mechanism . Do you want to perform sex with me ? Perform ? I don 't think I 'm up to a performance . - I 'II rehearse with you . - Okay . Because they have a machine here . I won 't get in that thing . I 'm strictly a hand operator . I dislike any strange moving parts . It 's hard to believe you haven 't had sex in 200 years . Two hundred and four .

Next , she 'll want robots . - Will you shut up ? - She becomes a pseudo-intellectual ... - ... fascist , Freudian monster . - Look , don 't get crazy . - Let 's do our parts . - Failure will be your fault . - " It 'll be your fault . " - You 're retarded . A retarded man . - Get your part right . - Get your part right . What am I doing ? I 'm 237 . I should be collecting social security . Look , do you remember ? Forward . Control . Manual . - Overheat . Rewind . - I know this . I want to make sure . I 'm going out a window . It 's a long drop . I 'd bruise my smock . AII right , don 't worry . I got it . This is the manual . - No , that 's rewind . - Then this is manual . That 's dual control . You said you had it . - I do . I have it . I have it . - Do you Love Erno ? Oh , Miles I don 't know . AII right , the coast is clear . Start lowering me . - This is manual . - No , that 's fast forward ! Oh ! Oh , Miles . Oh ! Look , I- - I got some of the tape around . And I thought you didn 't know how . Erno said to go north . I 'm in charge . Go my way . He knows what he 's talking about . He 's handsome , so he knows everything ? He has capped teeth . Did you know ? - He has capped gums . - He 's a mathematician . - Yeah , but can he do this ? - You 're an idiot . - We 're going my way . - Fine . Dr. Temkin ! The meeting is this way . Doctor . We 're doctors , not impostors . - Dr . Temkin , can we go ? - Big doctor . - Eye , ear , nose and throat . - May we ? May we , doctor , please ? - Nice work . - They think we 're someone else . I know . If we 'd followed Erno , we 'd be okay . Let 's not talk about it . It 's the only thing that makes me stutter . I 'm tired of hearing about him . - No more . - Shut up , shut up ! AII right . None of you have met before , for reasons of security . But now , Aires Day is here . I realize what I 'll say will be shocking . But I 'm counting on you to respond appropriately . Ten months ago , our leader was hurt when a bomb , planted by the underground , exploded . It was kept quiet . Since then , we have been virtually leaderless . Preparations for a successor were not adequately clear . We have been in the throes of a major crisis . As for our leader the Emergency Department rushed to the accident immediately . But all that remained of him was this . This is our leader 's nose . Using great presence of mind we rushed it to our Delta laboratory , which is here . Through massive biochemical effort it has been kept alive for a year . Our dream has been that by cloning we would reduplicate the entire leader again . For those of you unfamiliar with biology it 's a process by which using a single cell a duplicate of someone could be formed . Until now we 've only had limited experimental success . All efforts have been directed to cloning lately . We feel that we can reproduce our leader in perfect tact from his nose . Gentlemen , with God 's help , in a couple of hours we 'll have our leader . Then we 'll coordinate phase two which will terminate all dissidents on signal from our reborn leader . - It 's a nose . - I was here . - What will we do ? - Radio Erno . We must strike . The Leader 's handicapped . He has no body . - We 're not prepared . - No , but it 's chaos . We 'll win . Give me the radio . I dropped it . It fell out of my pocket . Stop repeating me . - Stop repeating . - Get a grip . - We must stop them . - We have to steal it . - How ? - I 've never stolen an organ before . - Wait ! I got an idea . - Yeah ? It 's in the operating chamber . We go below , get in the ceiling slide through , come up , and hide it under my coat . - Stupid plan . - Why ? Because it 's too subtle . We 're doctors . We go in ... - ... make a diversion and run . - Great ! - I 'm scared . - Calm down . You took some skin there . - Here . - What 's that ? A lighter ? You gave it to me at Melik 's . Where 's it been ? Don 't tell me . The trick is to remain cool . - Those are my nails . - You 're tense . The nose , I heard it was running . Dr. Temkin , we 're ready here . You don 't mind if people who aren 't involved in genetics observe ? No . I Like to be watched when I clone . The more , the merrier . I never clone alone . Hello , Dr. Temkin . So nice to see you . I 'm Biocentral computer 2100 , series G. I 'll assist you through the process . We 're all aware of your reputation . We look forward to a successful cloning procedure . - My assistant , Dr. Spock . - Janus . - Janus . - Spock . - Spanish . - Spanish . Let 's see the patient . Wow . It 's in worse shape than I thought . Better lay off Armenian women . You can see the medical history on readout four . I believe this will be a very difficult croning job . - Yes . Cloning , you idiot . - Cloning ! We 're ready to proceed . After looking at it I feel we ought to postpone the cloning . Doctor , that would be a tragic mistake . The computer didn 't account for the Pinocchio factor . The square of the proboscis is equal to the sinuses over seven . What is your opinion ? Do we proceed with cloning or postpone ? Ah , indeed . One moment . A moment . A medical moment . Yes . Well- - I think we should go ahead . Excuse me . I have to have a conference . If you 'll come over here . I want to talk . What do you mean , " go ahead " ? What can we do ? - I don 't know how to clone . - You 're crazy ! - Proceed . - Stop it ! - You stop it . - Get a grip . I 'm glad you put it to me that way . Now , if you 'll Let me have the lobster fork . What you have- - I diagnosed the situation . We 've got a nose . I think we 're in agreeance . I have it here . And what you want , basically is a person connected to that nose or you get your money back . Want me to Leave room for a mustache ? There 's a nice area there which will ... . What ? We 're placing down the garments because we 're going to clone . We 're going to try to clone the patient directly into his suit . He 'll be completely dressed at the end . It 's a first , and then we 'll get out . We don 't have to stay while he suits up . Time to check the cell structure . Checking the cell structure . Checking the cell structure ! Ah , checking the cell structure . - The structured cells to be checked . - Checking the cell structure . - Checking the structure . - The cell structure . The cell structure has been checked . I thank you so much . And now I 'II just take my mask , if you don 't mind and I 'II strap it onto my face . Excuse me while I give the patient a quick nostrilectomy . This is it . Keep your fingers crossed . Something 's wrong . There 's a current break in the life-support system . - What we should do- - - What 's that under your mask ? Pardon me ? Under my mask ? Nothing . Why ? Does it Look excessively bulbous ? - He 's got the nose . - Under his mask ! He 's got the nose . Quick ! Quickly ! Nobody move or I shoot your president . Come on , we 're getting out of here . Don 't come near me , or he gets it between the eyes . He 'll do it . I 've seen him shoot a nose . Please . Please be careful . You don 't realize that you 've been dealing with a great mind . Yeah , and his isn 't so bad either . Don 't come near us . Get out of here now . He 's bluffing . He wouldn 't shoot it . Bluffing , am I ? Okay , clowns , you asked for it . I can 't believe we did it . An eye for an eye and a nose for a nose . - That sounds brilliant . - You were absolutely wonderful . Erno 's plan worked . Erno 's plan ? What was I through all of that ? You ? It was Erno 's plan ? I can 't get into a discussion about Erno . I 'm getting a hostility ache . A migraine headache now . I haven 't seen my analyst in 200 years . He was a strict Freudian . If I 'd gone all this time , I 'd be cured . Erno 's going to head the new government . Don 't you understand ? In six months , we 'll be stealing Erno 's nose . Political solutions don 't work . It doesn 't matter who 's there . They 're all terrible . - Why are you Looking at me Like that ? - I think you really Love me . Of course I Love you . This is what this is all about . And you Love me . I don 't blame you . You know ? I 'm not knocking Erno . He 's great if you Like a tall , blond Prussian , Nordic , Aryan , Nazi type . But meaningful relationships don 't Last . That was proven by science . There 's a chemical in our bodies that makes us get on each other 's nerves . I don 't believe in science . Science is an intellectual dead end . It 's a Lot of guys in suits cutting up frogs on foundation grants . You don 't believe in science or that political systems work ... - ... and you don 't believe in God . - Right . So then , what do you believe in ? Sex and death . Two things that come once in my lifetime .

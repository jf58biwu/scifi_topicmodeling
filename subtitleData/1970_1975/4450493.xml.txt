 This way ! Split ! Get him ! Get him ! Go ! Tie him up . You two , ride to the nearest village . Tell them Virdon and Galen got away ... and to tell their local police to find them . Move ! This one we 'll take to Central City . - See how explicit it is , how detailed . - Yes . - [ Knock At Door ] - Come in . Zaius ! Have you heard the news ? - Burke has been captured . - Yes , just as I told you they would be . And what about the other two ? They 're going to come here and try to rescue Burke , and will fall right into our trap . - We 're waiting for them . - Let us hope so . This capture of Burke could not have come at a more opportune time . - We have an experiment . - Experiments ? Why must we always make a simple problem so complicated ? It 's not necessary to experiment . All our troubles stem from the two astronauts and Galen . Once they are destroyed , our problems are over ! The planet can return to normal . Can you guarantee that there will be no more Burkes or Virdons in the future ? Can you guarantee that next time there will not be five or ten ... instead of two humans landing here ? Perhaps in different parts of our land ? No more than you can guarantee that there will ever be any others . The prudent ape is prepared for the worst . Therefore , it is extremely important for us ... to determine once and for all why these two humans are different ... from the ones who live here now . I can almost promise I 'll get the answers . Who is that ? That is Wanda . Wanda . - Wanda ? - One of our most brilliant young scientists . She 's come up with a remarkable find . - Most valuable . - This book . This book was written in 1986 . And it was recently found in one of those time capsules ... so popular around that period . What has that got to do with Burke ? I 'm coming to that . This book is a book on brainwashing . Brainwashing ? The psychological method of washing out of the human brain ... old ideas and replacing them with new ones . And that 's what we 're going to do with Burke ! Ah , yes . I seem to remember hearing something vaguely about that . Brainwashing . Isn 't that where you take the brain out of the skull ... and wash it with cool water ? No , you don 't take the brain out of the skull . You don 't take the br ... How can you wash the brain if you don 't ... - take it out of the skull ? - Ye-Ye-Yes . I have looked over the book , and Wanda has explained the rest . She has the backing of the council , and will interrogate Burke according to this new procedure . No . No . All interrogation must be under my supervision . - That is the law . - You may supervise , but Wanda is to control the experiment . Ahh ! Why must we go to all this trouble ? Just let my surgeons ... perform the usual brain operation on the humans . Are you talking about the hole in the skull and the removal of the front bump ? Yes , that 's right , exactly . - But ... - Then the patient will be docile . And cooperative . He will tell us whatever we want and answer all our questions . - If he doesn 't die . - Or become a vegetable . At any rate , Burke will be no more trouble to us . What you suggest is our last resort . In the meantime , Wanda will proceed . - Aah . - And since this process is new to us , there is to be no public discussion . Only the three of us ... and your most trusted guards will know about it . Ahh ! [ Groaning ] Oh , Alan , I can 't . I can 't ! You 've got to . Central City is 19 hours away . Can you run all that distance ? Galen , by now Pete must be in Urko 's hands . We will be , too , if we keep running blindly . They 'll be expecting us , they 'll be setting traps . I know that . - We avoid them . - Stay off the main roads ? It 'll take us two days to get there . [ Sighs ] We go the shortest , fastest way , whatever that is . [ Sighs ] [ Banging , Ringing ] [ Banging , Ringing Continue ] Burke , my name is Wanda . I am your interrogator . Now this interrogation can either be pleasant or unpleasant . It is up to you . - Well ? - Pleasant is better . Hmm . We 're going to get along just fine . Good , good . Sit down , sit down . [ Banging , Ringing Continue ] Now , I want you to answer my question . The first one : Which humans on this planet have helped you ? Almost all of them , and , uh , many apes . Obviously , you 're not taking this interrogation seriously . Let me warn you . It 's very important that you cooperate with me . If I fail , you fail ... totally . You die ... or you become a vegetable . But I answered your question . You did not . I want names , places , times ! [ Sighs ] I 'm sorry . I can 't remember that . If you 're counting on your friends , forget it . They 'll never find this place . No one knows of its existence ... except Zaius , Urko , myself and a handful of guards . There 's no possibility of escape ... or rescue . I will ask a question . You will answer it ... fully . Honestly . Then ... [ Chuckles ] You will be allowed to go . [ Banging , Ringing Continue ] Which humans ... have helped you ? Say , that 's a lovely ring you have on your tapping finger . You have a contempt for apes , Burke ! You 'll change your mind before you 're finished . I have no contempt for apes . Nor for any other thinking animal on this planet . Hmm . [ Chuckles ] Then be sensible . Be sensible ! Answer my question . Which humans have helped you ? Well ... [ Grunts ] Whoa ! - Move and I 'll shoot . - I won 't move . Turn around real slow . Put your hands behind you . Okay , now walk . [ Wanda ] Who are the humans that have helped you ? I also want to know how you get their names , where they could be found ... and when you made contact . Simple questions . [ Banging , Ringing Continue ] [ Sighs ] I can see your mouth moving , but I can 't hear anything you 're saying . All those bells and drums are too loud . They 're deafening me . If they 're too loud now ... after four hours , think how they 'll sound after eight hours . - What ? Can you talk louder ? - After 24 hours . - [ Ringing , Banging Continue ] - [ Sighs ] Lieutenant , shoot . Hold it . Hold it . You 've gotta be kidding . I 'm quite capable of it , Burke . Obviously you can hear when it suits you . Look , there isn 't any list of humans to contact . We never expected to land here , and we don 't exactly want to be here now . All we want to do is get out of here . First you have to get out of prison . I want the names of the humans that have helped you . Look , I , I ... Names , places , times . I can 't answer that . They were just people . [ Urko ] Every entrance covered ? Nothing will get into the city without being stopped by our guards . Orders issued to stop and search carefully ... every cart and wagon , whether driven by ape or human . - Yes , Urko . - Now , inside the city , I want everyone available on patrol . Mounted units . Sweep the streets . Individual troops on every corner . - [ Guard ] It will be done . - [ Urko ] Good . Good . This time we 'll catch Galen . [ Laughing ] - Stand straight ! - [ Ringing , Banging ] This way . Now , once you have answered my questions , you can get some much needed sleep , food , rest . I 've been telling you the truth . All right , I will make it easy for you . Which apes have befriended you ? - There has been many apes . That is the truth ! - It is not the truth ! There is only one ape that has befriended you , and that is the traitor , Galen . - There were others . - Only Galen ! - Okay , have it your way . - Right . Now , which humans have helped you ? - No humans helped us . - The truth ! I don 't know what you want . I want their names ! [ Banging , Ringing Continue ] L-I can 't . My mind 's blank . [ Ringing , Banging Continue ] Lieutenant , you know what to do ? Yes , Wanda . Let him go . What 's your business in Central City ? My son . He raises hay for the troopers ' horses . - Give me that pitchfork . - Oh , yes , of course . He usually delivers it himself , but this morning he had this terrible cold . I said , " Now you stay in bed . I 'll deliver that hay myself . " Oh , yes , he 's such a good boy . He likes all of you gorillas . He 's so helpful and kind and considerate . All right , go ahead . Dump your hay and come right out . Oh , thank you . Good-bye . [ Knocking On Door ] - Ah , Galen ! - Oh , Mother ! Oh , ho-ho-ho . Galen , come in . Oh , how are you ? Oh , Galen ! - So good to see you ! - Wonderful to see you . Mother , I would like you to meet my very good friend , Alan Virdon . Hello . - How do you do , Virdon ? - Fine . Have you eaten ? Oh , you look so tired . We 'd love something to eat . Only tell me first , where 's Father ? He 's in his study . He has a great deal to do these days . He 's just been elected to the council . Sit down . I 'll get your father . Your mother seems very nice , Galen . Oh , yes . You may need to find another word to describe my father . [ Door Opens ] Father . Uh , Father , this , uh ... We need your help . Our friend , Peter Burke , has been taken prisoner . He 's a human ! I 'm an ape . He 's my enemy . He is not an enemy ! He is my friend ! You 'll be helping me ! Then it 's between you and Burke . I will give you shelter , but I won 't help you in any other way . I 'll send a servant to the roof as a lookout . If you wish to see me , I 'll be in the garden . Just you , son ! All right . Now . Tell me one more time . What happened ? The abandoned hay cart was driven through a checkpoint ... by a female chimpanzee . She said she was delivering hay for patrol horses . And this female , where is she ? Have you located her ? No . I know the situation was suspicious , but she was alone . There was no sign of the fugitives on the cart . What did you expect them to do , stand up and wave at you ? Ah , get three troopers . Ride to Councillor Yalu 's home . Search it from one end to the other . If he tries to stop you , go ahead anyway ! Tell him those are my orders ! Yes , Urko . Apparently it doesn 't matter to you that your mother worries . - Of course it matters . - Then , why aren 't you at home , instead of running around the country like a hunted human ? It 's not my fault that I 'm hunted ! My friends are willing to live in peace . So am I ! You are an ape ! Your friends are humans . Strange friends for a chimpanzee . Not if you know them . You 'd respect them , too , if it weren 't for your ... stupid prejudices . I am older than you . Perhaps those so-called stupid prejudices are based on reason . No , they are no . They are based on custom and on habit ! And you know it ! Even if I agreed with you , and I don 't , do you think you can change the whole world ? I 'd like to . We didn 't come to this city to visit . I 'm sorry . But we came to get Burke . Only a few more minutes . My husband is not entirely unreasonable . - Without your help , we 're going to have to ... - I don 't want to know ! You can help us get Burke out without compromising yourself . This conversation is over ! All right , Father . - Good-bye . - [ Knocking ] That 's a signal from Loomis . They 're coming ! The police are coming . We 'll leave now . We won 't risk your lives by being caught here . - Is there a back way out ? - It 's as big a risk for us if you 're found nearby . - Not as big as being caught here ! - Help me ! Help me ! Pick up the rug ! I put this in for security . Down you go ! Hurry , hurry ! One at a time , down . Hurry . Down . Open up . Police ! Open up . Police ! How dare you bang on my door ! I have orders to search this house . Search this house ? There 's a mistake . I am Council Member Yalu . I 'm sorry , Councillor , The order was given me by Chief of Security Urko . I demand you stop ! Where is he going ? - [ Policeman ] To examine the bedroom . - [ Yalu ] This is an outrage ! I will expect everything to be just as you found it . You think you 're pawing through a junkyard ? - You heard the councillor 's wife . - Thank you , Officer . That 's all right . - Have you found whatever it is you 're looking for ? - No , Councillor . Then I suggest you leave ... now ! I apologize for this intrusion . The apology is not sufficient ! You may so inform Chief Urko ! Have you had enough ? Enough ? Enough ? Untie him . Was one of the humans named Roras ? Uh , my name is Burke , PeterJ . Rank , major . - Stand up ! - My number is 0-0-4 ... - Stand up ! - 8-9-7 . Oh ! Haven 't you had enough ? - Do you want more ? - Burke , PeterJ . Rank , major . Number 0-0-4-7-3-6-6-8-9-7 . We know the humans that have helped you . [ Grunts ] Tie him ! [ Muttering ] Start ! I 've been looking for you ! I have this message from Council Chairman Zaius . Here . Of course , you can read it if you want to , but it is addressed to the commanding officer of the jail ! Is there any question you want me to answer ? Aha . Ah , okay . You announce your arrival as you normally would . Come on ! [ Knocking On Door ] Guard 22 , ready . All right , on the floor ! Face down . No , not by the door ! The wall . - Pete 's not here . - He must be ! Untie him . Where do you come from ? Where do you come from ? Burke , PeterJ . Number 0-0-4-7 ... [ Groaning ] Stop it ! How dare you interfere ! I was just trying to help . You weren 't getting anywhere . Obviously the prisoner is completely disoriented . And now that he is , there are certain methods which will yield results . " After a long period of severe interrogation , excellent results have been achieved by a feminine presence . " - The message here is ... - Oh , gibberish ! Book ! There 's only one way ... Leave him alone ! Zaius will hear of your behavior . Aah ! [ Grunts ] So why didn 't you tell us that Burke isn 't in the main jail ? I didn 't know . I have no idea where he 's being kept . Only Urko and Zaius know . It 's not like you to doubt your father , Galen . If your father says he doesn 't know , he doesn 't know ! Does Urko have any other place where he keeps prisoners ? - None that I know of . - But Urko knows . And he keeps records ! - That 's the place to look . - Son , I ... You 'll never get away with it . Still , we have to look in Urko 's office . [ Grunting ] [ Book Falls ] " After this long period of centrifugal force , " the prisoner has lost the feeling of the pull of gravity . " Also his sense of identity has blurred along with the identity of others . " At this point , a woman who is compassionate may be confused by the prisoner ... " with someone he has loved . " And by skillful questioning , may obtain information ... that could not be secured in any other fashion . " Stop the turntable . Untie him . Guard , you may leave . Wanda , he is a dangerous human . I can handle him . Go . I , uh , I have the feeling that we are strangers . There is so much about you I don 't know . Hmm . And I always believe that people in love ... tell each other everything . Not everything . [ Birds Chirping ] - Hey . - Hmm ? You 're quiet today . - Maybe I 'm all talked out . - [ Laughing ] Oh , no , no . That 'll never happen . You 're a bubbling spring . You 're inexhaustible . Well , springs can run dry . - Mm-hmm ? - Mm-hmm . Pete , our conversations are a one-way street . You never talk about yourself . Oh . Um , what do you want to know ? Everything . Where you were born . Where you went to school . You know . Pretty dull stuff . Not to me . And , um , the first time you fell in love . - This is the first time . - Oh ! [ Laughing ] Now I know you 're copping out . Come on ! I wanna know what 's inside there . What you feel . - [ Thinking ] Well , uh , what do you want to know ? - Everything . I love you . People in love tell each other everything . [ Gasping ] Guard ? Lieutenant , is it day or night outside ? The sun is about to rise . Mmm . Mmm . Well , inform Chief of Security Urko ... that the prisoner now belongs to him . " Five special guards sent to the Crystal Cavern . " Crystal Cavern ? Does that mean something ? Why would they send special guards to a cavern ... outside the city where nothing valuable is stored ? - That 's it ! - Yeah ... [ Urko ] Guard . Get to Dr. Malthus 's house . Tell him to meet me at the hospital as soon as possible . That 's all . Any other entrance ? No . What have they done to him ? That 's a hospital wagon . There 's no way to get to him , not with that mob around him . Our only chance is the hospital . Right . I promise nothing . This operation is still in the experimental stage . - I can 't guarantee success . - What do you mean by " success " ? If the patient survives and is docile . It 's not necessary . The patient can die , or worse ... be left with no brain at all . That 's too bad . This is the patient ? Yes . How long before you 'll be ready ? My associates haven 't arrived as yet . Nothing 's prepared . Instruments ! Scrubbing ! Operating room ! Nurses ! Thirty to sixty minutes . You have 30 minutes ! Then begin the operation . - I 'll be back in time to watch . - Yes , Urko . Thirty minutes . May I ask why you need the carriage ? Well , you see , we have found out that Burke is in the hospital . They 're going to operate on him . It 's that operation that Urko favors . Huh ? The carriage , Galen ! Why the carriage ? Mother , if I told you and if Father found out , he would be very angry . Possibly . But you haven 't answered my question ! We 're gonna break into the hospital , grab Burke and run . We wouldn 't stand a chance against Urko 's mounted patrols ... - Without my carriage . - Right . - Yes ! - You don 't stand a chance with my carriage ! Yeah , maybe not . We thought of every possibility and this is the best we could come up with . If you fail , Urko will kill you . You realize that ? [ Sighs ] Yes ! Son . Do you insist on attempting this-this impossible rescue ? We have to . Then you leave me no choice . [ Ann ] Open my door ! Human , come and help this ape . [ Guard ] I can 't allow anyone in . Lieutenant 's orders . I 'm not anyone . I am Council Member Yalu 's wife . - But only the Lieutenant ... - Then get him ! I 'm sorry , the hospital is closed . How can that be ? I have a badly wounded ape here . - Leave him . Someone will take care of him . - Are you a doctor ? - No . No ! I 'm a lieutenant . - Why am I talking to you ? - I need a doctor . What doctors are available ? - I don 't know . Lieutenant , I was on my way to see a friend who is ill ... when I came upon this badly wounded ape here . Apparently the victim of some accident . I went out of my way to bring him here to this hospital ... at great personal inconvenience . - I 'm sorry . - In that case ... let us proceed ! Back . While we 're arguing , this unfortunate victim could die ! - Do you want that on your record ? - No , no ! Come , human ! [ Grunting ] Ah , Doctor , I am Ann , the wife of Councillor Yalu . I 'm Dr. Malthus . But you shouldn 't be here . I want you to take care of this wounded ape right away . [ Whimpering ] I have an important surgery in about ten minutes . Do you mean a human patient is more important to you than an ape ? Urko 's orders . Well ... he must be a very special human ! Looks ordinary to me . - It 's as if nothing were really wrong with him . - [ Dr. Malthus ] Not yet ! I insist you find a bed ... and capable medical care . Very well . I 'll see what I can do . Oh , and you ! Tell Chief Urko I wish to see him right away . [ Ann ] Are you frightened of an elderly female and a wounded ape ? Do you believe that an armed police gorilla ... is no match for a mere human ? Aah ! Aah ! Help ! Help ! Open that door ! Break it down ! Get some of your gorillas and cut them off at the other corridor ! Hurry ! Urko , they have escaped from the hospital . Hyah ! Hyah ! Follow them . Mount up ! I don 't know how you two ever made it in here , but ... We 're not outta this yet . And I assure you it wasn 't Galen . After all , a mother should know her own son . And I was told that it was Galen . - You are being insolent ! - Not at all ! I 'm doing my job . Let me ask you a question . If it wasn 't Galen , how do you account for that ape 's actions ? It wasn 't . And I don 't . I was horrified by his actions , and ran into the corridor and called for help . - You saw me . - I 'm afraid that that doesn 't prove ... [ Ann ] Use your head , Chief Urko . If I have any brains , would I ruin my husband 's career ... and risk disgrace by helping mere humans ? Of course not ! May I take it that this matter is now closed , Chief Urko ? - Well ... - If you disbelieve my wife , I insist you arrest both of us immediately ! Arrest or total innocence . One or the other . I am not going to arrest you , Councillor Yalu , or your wife . - But ... - No buts ! Produce proof or shut up . All right . [ Ann ] Now that it 's all settled , won 't you have something to drink , Chief Urko ? Oh ! You were magnificent ! Both of you . Father . I couldn 't very well let them find you here . [ Sighs ] Urko didn 't even ask to search the house . He assumes we 're long gone . Perhaps . In any event , I was defending your mother . And very well too ! Father , you helped us . Now admit it . And allow me to be grateful . You 're my son . I don 't pretend to understand ... the friendship between you and those humans . But I do understand friendship . And I understand principles . Sometimes I am a little slow . Without your mother , I might never have realized the son that we have . I had more contact with Galen and his friend than you had . It 's heartwarming to know that our son is not only loving and intelligent , but also principled . I 'm proud of you .

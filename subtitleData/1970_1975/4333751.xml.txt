 PLANET OF THE APES 1x11 " THE TYRANT " Subtitles by subXpacio . Pete ! Alan ! The barn . Whoa ! - Farm of Janor and Mikal . Load the grain . - Yes , Daku . Our grain tax was paid last month . - The tax has been raised . - You leave us with nothing . Sweep up what 's left on the ground . You can use it for seed for next year 's crop , Hurry up ! I haven 't all day ! I have to meet the caravan at Hathor at sundown . Wait , Pete ! This is no time to be a hero . I could have you both shot for attacking a trooper , Move on ! All right , the next is the Darog farm , Move out ! Giddap . I 'm sorry , Janor , I wish we could have done something to help . No one can help . Does that gorilla have a grudge against you ? No , it 's all through the district . Aboro takes what he wants from everyone . Aboro ? The gorilla on horseback ? No , that 's Daku , his lieutenant . Aboro is district chief . Hmm . You know , if that grain wagon were to be hijacked , somewhere way out in the boondocks , nobody would be able to connect it with Janor or Mikal . You 're going to steal back the grain ! The less you know . the better ... for you . - It 's too dangerous . - I agree . Completely . Yeah , but I 'll be overruled ... completely . I know where you can do it . Not when they meet the caravan . That 's too well guarded . It brings gold from the mine . But there is a forest between here and Darog 's farm . - Which direction ? - I 'll take you . No , stay out of it . If you 're connected with it , there 'll be reprisals . - It 's our fight ! - Mikal , what we 're trying to do ... is bring back the grain without suspicion landing on you . - You might be recognized . - We want to be recognized . We want the gorillas to see who did it . That way , they 'll just be looking for a couple of strangers with a stolen wagon . You might as well say yes . They are very stubborn . - He says yes . - I 'll show you the shortcut to the forest . No , you just show us which way to go . Over to that road , then veer right . Great . Psst , something 's coming . Hoo-hoo ! - Mikal , what are you doing here ? - Joining you . - No way , man ! - Does Janor know you 're here ? I told him I was going into the village . - He won 't like it . - Janor is a coward ! No , he 's not . He 's just trying to protect you . I don 't want that . I don 't want to bow and scrape to gorillas . I don 't want just enough food to stay alive , I won 't be nothing , Well , all right , but stay out of sight . At least , cover your face . Here . Come on ! Come on ! Pete ! Hey , come on . Hyah ! Hyah ! Hyah ! Hyah ! Come on ! Hyah ! Hyah ! So , three armed troopers , one my own aid . allow three humans , three unarmed humans , to overpower them . Further , they allow the humans to steal a wagon-load of grain ... I promised would be delivered to the caravan . I explained , Aboro ! They surprised us ! Yes , and I am considering another surprise for you , Daku . I may have you taken out and shot . Aboro , wait . Nothing is lost by what happened today . I will find Mikal , and he 'll tell me where the grain is . And then I 'll make him tell me who those strangers were . And when I find them - If you find them . No , I will deal with Mikal . Humans have attacked apes , Daku . This has never before happened in my district . I don 't intend to have it happen again . Humans attacked gorillas ? Took a wagon , even weapons ? I did , with the other three , I took the grain . I wonder if I have been wrong . How ? Well , I have not fought apes . I did not think it was possible . Your troops already have all our grain , Aboro . Were you with your brother and the other two humans ? Someone Daku could not see drove the wagon off . Was it you , Janor ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . I have been here on my farm all day . Were you , too , on the farm all day . Mikal ? You 've taken all we have . What more do you want ? Who were the other two humans , and where is the grain ? This one may be less stubborn , I don 't need instruction in how to make a human talk , Daku ! You are the older human here . You are responsible . You will tell me what I want to know . I 'm telling you the truth . I have not left my farm all day . No , he was not there ! The grain is in the cave by the stream . - You should not pay for what I did . - Mikal - - Kill him ! - Why ? I told you ! You 're lying . Kill him ! Run . Janor ! Mikal ! Burn the farm ! It will serve as a lesson to other humans ! He 's gonna be all right . - Don 't try to get up , Janor . - Mikal ? I 'm sorry , Janor . I was wrong about not fighting apes . Mikal died trying to save me . It won 't end there . What are you planning to do ? I 'm gonna kill Aboro . - That 's suicide , Janor . - There must be another way to stop Aboro . There 's a prefect over him . Maybe he doesn 't even know what Aboro 's doing . Talk to him . - I will never talk to an ape again . - But I 'm an ape . I know you are , but you 're not like Aboro and the prefect , Augustus . - Did you say , " Augustus " ? - Yes . He 's my cousin . The last thing I heard about him , he was working on the council in Central City . Now , he 's honest , and he 's decent . - He 's an ape . - He believes in justice . An ape ... will never punish another ape ! You can say that after I have tried and failed . Yes ? Come in . - Prefect Augustus ? - Yes . Oh , I wish to report a theft . Two apples stolen from a lovely green tree . The thieves were observed running from the scene . Two chimpanzees about nine years old . Galen . Oh , Galen , I 've missed you . Oh , it 's been a long , long time . - No one saw you come in ? - Oh , no . No one knows me here . What happened , Galen ? How did you become a fugitive , running with humans ? Oh , well , a very , very long story . You wouldn 't believe it . Honestly . That is , unless you actually got to know humans . I do know humans , I have them around me all the time - as servants , laborers . No , that 's not what I meant , Augustus . There are things about humans I don 't know ? - I 'm afraid so . - It 's good to have you here . But I 'm not being very considerate . I 've not offered you food or drink . Oh , no , no , thank you . Later . Thank you . You , uh , you didn 't just stumble in here . No . Augustus , I need your help . And I think , I do think I can help you too . Ah . I don 't have any needs , but whatever I can do for you . Well , you 're prefect here and I think you need ... a decent administration . Um , I 'm not sure the change in you ... is entirely attractive . You should know me well enough to remember I take great pride in my position . Oh . Augustus . I wouldn 't be here unless I was sure of that . I don 't think you know what your district chief , Aboro , is up to . Go on . I can 't believe this is true . Augustus , I swear to you , it 's true . I am here to see the prefect . - The prefect is busy . - He will see me . Aboro . Aboro , I was going to send for you . I 've had reports of your activities . Something displeases you ? Did you shoot a human named Mikal ? Yes , I believe that was what he was called . Why was he killed ? For reasons I considered sufficient . - That is not an answer ! - Make the most of it , It 's all you get . As long as I am prefect here , Aboro , you will answer my questions . As long as you are ... Prefect . I won 't bore you with the introduction . " Effective immediately . Prefect Augustus is reassigned to Dorvado . " " District Chief Aboro is hereby promoted to prefect in place ... of Augustus . " I don 't believe that . Effective immediately . I will move in later this afternoon . Dorvado . It must be nearly the other side of the planet . Not a very nice place to be assigned . Oh . Augustus . I am sorry . If you have a problem in Dorvado , I 'll be glad to help you . Why was Aboro made prefect ? Our kind always fills administrative spots , not gorillas . He must have very influential friends in Central City . You belong there , Aboro , not that fool , Augustus . Yes , I can always count on you , Daku . - Always . - So long as I have gold or power . - You 're making a joke . - I never joke , Daku . Urko . Did you know he was coming here ? No . I made the usual delivery to Bulta , his assistant . I know we weren 't seen by anyone . He wouldn 't say anything to Urko . If you have made another mistake - I swear . - Aboro ! - Urko ! Aboro , look at you . Fat , lazy . You 're not the Aboro I remember ... - ... from my days at the academy . - And you ! Stooped with age . A trembling , old gorilla . Hardly stronger than a human ! It 's true ! If only I were young and strong . Yeah ! We all grow old and weak , Urko . Tell me , what brings you to Hathor ? You . You brought me here . I heard about your promotion . Since I happened to be in the district - Ah , yes , yes , yes , I became prefect today . I know , I was taken by surprise and pleased . - Thank you . - Well , you 're much too good to be , uh , district chief in some far-off province . I told Bulta many times to push you for a promotion , but , uh , that , uh , incident at the academy , uh , always stood in the way . - Yes , I know . - It was just bad luck . Anyone at that time could have been caught cheating . But it happened to me . And while my good friends , Bulta and Urko , moved up the ladder , I remained a district chief at Hathor . Yes , but this new promotion must mean that old foolishness is now forgotten . Only 20 years to erase the memory of " old foolishness . " Aboro . Aboro , you sound bitter . Sorry . Twenty-year-old habits take time to break . - Care for something to drink ? - No , no , no , no . I 'm on an inspection tour , but I 'll be around for a few days . Perhaps , before I leave . we 'll have a chance for a real visit . - Yes . - Talk over old days at the academy . I hope so . Aboro ... I 'm very happy for you . Thank you . He didn 't know . No . And a good thing . Urko never really approved of corruption . This whole charade is based on your hunch ... that Aboro 's promotion was bought . Apes are not corrupt . Maybe . You put the pieces together . See if you can come up with a better explanation . I can 't . But I don 't believe it . Galen , it adds up . Look , Aboro steals grain . Now , he can 't eat it all . And he was on his way to meet a gold caravan . Why ? He trades the grain for gold and buys your cousin 's job with it . Simple . Oh , I can 't believe it . Yeah , well , would you believe ... that I ... have absolutely never before ... ever ... sewn a collar for such a distinguished-looking ape in my life ? Oh. that I believe . There you go . - Oh , hey , that 's very nice . - Very pretty . - There you are . - Oh , thank you . - Now , you got it all straight ? - Oh , yeah . I know exactly what I am supposed to do . Tell the prefect that Octavio is here . Do you have an appointment ? Octavio needs no appointment to see the prefect of a minor province . Do as you 're told . Something I can do for you ? Yes . You can start by addressing me as " sir . " Yes ... sir . Hmm . Tell Aboro that Octavio , assistant to Zaius , is here . This way , sir . Mm-hmm . Thank you . You ... are Aboro ? And you are assistant to Zaius ? Get rid of him . Won 't you sit down ? Very well . Are you satisfied with your new position as prefect ? - Oh , yes , quite . Thank you . - Pity . Being satisfied with one 's position ... indicates a regrettable lack ... of ambition . Is this an official visit ? Absolutely not . Would Zaius send me on an official visit ... to discuss your clumsy attempts at bribery ? You did say ... " bribery " ? Yes . I did . And no denials , please . Exactly why are you here ? Well ... Zaius has had his eye on you ... for a long , long time . If Zaius believes I 'm guilty of bribery , why hasn 't he had me ... arrested ? He 's considered it . Zaius has not ordered your arrest ... because he believes you can serve a more useful purpose . What is it you want ? Zaius believes ... that you have the ideal qualifications ... to replace Urko . But as you probably know , Urko has acted independently of the council on too many occasions . He has gone over Zaius 's head , doubted Zaius 's authority . This must stop , But Urko is my very dear friend . Oh . Oh. well - Well , I hardly thought that would stand in your way . Oh , my heavens , I must have been mistaken . Hmm , Good afternoon . Please ! I may have been a little hasty . Oh . And I may have expected more intelligence ... than is usually found in someone in your position . Naturally , I-I would appreciate Urko 's job . but this has come as such a surprise , I would like a little time to think it over . Well-Well , that 's a remarkable - I mean , it 's amazing , I offer you ... power and prestige , and you - you want time , Oh , very well . Yes , I shall return later on . Daku ! I assume you were listening . Oh , no , Aboro , I wouldn 't listen - What do you think ? Well , I , uh - I did hear a little accidentally . - You in Urko 's place . Oh , it 's , it 's - - Impossible ? Oh. no. no. no . It 's wonderful . Great . If Octavio is telling the truth . Why wouldn 't he ? I don 't know . Now that I think of it , another question comes to mind . Who is Octavio ? He 's Zaius 's assistant . You heard him say it . Yes , one can say anything , Daku . That does not make it true . All I know about Octavio is what he says about himself . If he weren 't highly placed , how would he know about the bribery ? You know where Urko is camped . Ride to him . Avoid suspicion . But ask about Zaius 's assistant - his name , what he looks like . A good idea , Aboro . A very good idea . Go . Octavio , please . Oh , thank you . Hmm . What is he doing here ? Our business is private . Daku knows of your proposal , Octavio . You do not impress me as being very discreet . In fact , you do not impress me at all . Oh , well . Have you thought over what I mentioned to you ? - Oh , yes . - What have you decided ? Exactly what you knew I would decide , Octavio , after checking with Urko , Surely you didn 't think I would accept you without checking first . Checking what ? You , Octavio . However , Urko has indeed confirmed ... that the assistant to Zaius is , in fact , the crippled Octavio . I accept your offer . Good . Now , the council needs a method ... to justify the removal of Urko from office . Well , why can 't the council simply dismiss him ? On what grounds ? Even the council needs evidence . Zaius was hoping that you would provide that . How ? Must I give you all the answers ? You are the one who 's being promoted , not me . You must do something to earn your promotion . Zaius expects you to provide him with the evidence that can remove Urko , What sort of evidence would the council consider suitable ? I don 't know . Bribery . Bribery or something . Urko 's assistant , Bulta , accepts bribes . Daku , keep your mouth shut unless I tell you to speak ! Can you prove that Urko knows this ? No ... he didn 't . Oh , dear . Ah ! Suppose that we could , uh , find some incriminating evidence in Urko 's home ? Something like , uh ... contraband gold . Yes , yes , If we could make some connection between ... that gold and a corrupt act - Too risky . I 'm sure . Have you a better idea ? I have always favored ... a more direct action , Octavio . Direct action ? - I don 't understand . - Of course . And it would be much safer . What are you suggesting ? There is a human ... that Daku has used on various assignments . - His name ? His name ? - Amhar . From the village of Loben . Since I don 't know this Amhar . I will have to rely on you , Daku . Tell me , is he reliable ? Absolutely . He 'll do anything I tell him . That is unthinkable , unthinkably dangerous . Yes , but it 's permanent . This is the least dangerous way to remove Urko . I 'm-I 'm against the idea . This Amhar - He may talk , afterwards . No , Amhar won 't talk . He won 't be alive afterwards . Daku , arrange a dinner party for Urko here . Right . And Amhar ? Have him here an hour before Urko is due to arrive , Oh , and Octavio , I will expect you , too , as a dinner guest . That way you will have an eyewitness report to give Zaius . Oh , how very thoughtful of you . But I have never considered murder to be a spectator sport . I prefer not to be present . Daku on his way to Amhar . Let 's tie him up , put him in the brush . You , here , quick . Drop it . Go on . No . Stay where you are . Up on the table . - I want to help you . - Wearing a mask ? I do not want my identity known . Others in power , who are not friendly toward you . might want to revenge themselves against my family . Do you recognize this seal ? It is Aboro 's . Read this letter . This is hard to believe . Aboro planning to kill me ? That letter was taken from the assassin he hired . I 'm grateful to you . Let me show you my gratitude . Galen ! Did you think I would believe a forged letter delivered by a masked ape ? - That letter contains the truth , on my word . - Your word ? Word of a criminal , a renegade , a wanted fugitive . Don 't move , Urko . Don 't you move ! Your bullet couldn 't prevent my finger from squeezing the trigger . Drop that rifle by the time I count to three or I 'll shoot Galen . Urko. can 't you get it through your stubborn head ... that if I wanted you dead , I could have shot you ? That letter contains the truth about Aboro and Bulta . Truth . What do you know about truth ? You chose to live with humans . All right , Virdon . One . Two - - I wondered where you were . - Me too . Go ahead , shoot . Shoot and you 'll alarm my troops . Think , Urko , think . We walked in here knowing the risks . Why ? I don 't know , and I don 't care . You thought you were being clever , and you walked into a trap . You can 't shoot . And if you walk out of here , I call my gorillas . I don 't ask you to believe me . Can 't you believe your own ears and eyes ? I do . I see you , I hear you . And I know you are enemies of the state and will be executed . Execute ! Shoot ! Kill ! I am so tired of the kinds of solutions you find for all problems . Come with us to Aboro 's . We 'll prove he 's a traitor . You can 't . Look , Urko , while you 're with Aboro , I 'll call him out . I 'll pretend I 'm his hired assassin . I 'll get him to admit he 's planning to kill you . You can hear it yourself . What have you got to lose ? All right . But I won 't lose in any case . You 'll be the ones who lose . Mount up ! Follow me , There was no time to go for Amhar . When I was freed , I came back here . - And you don 't know who attacked you or why ? - Mm-mm . I don 't like it . I don 't like it ! Someone is trying to prevent my killing Urko ! As I didn 't see Amhar , Urko won 't be killed . I didn 't arrange it . You ! You , Daku . You will be Amhar . Tonight at dinner . when the wine is being served . you will light this . When it is lit , you will have plenty of time ... to come around to the front door ... with the message that I must come at once ... to settle a fight at the barracks . Understood ? You come inside with me . That will insure that they don 't run away . Octavio . - You 've met Octavio ? - Yes , yes , I had the pleasure earlier today . - I stopped by earlier to introduce myself . - Ah , yes . I insisted that he come . Hmm . Good , good . Come in , please . A place for Octavio . Aboro , I , uh - I know that I mentioned we would talk over old days ... together at the academy and that sort of thing . but Octavio is such a welcomed guest . You 'd be surprised at the incredible stories he can tell . - Really ? - You would be fascinated . Hmm . - Please , sit down . - Oh , thank you . See who that is . Thank you . A human to see you , sir . He says it is very important . A human important ? What could be important about a human ? Well , I 'll be right back . That 's Burke . Come on . Come on . You say your name is Amhar ? - Yes , sir , I 'm sorry I 'm late . - Late for what ? Daku said you wanted me to kill some important gorilla . - Guard ! - Why you callin ' a guard ? I don 't know this human . He 's either a lunatic or an assassin . Lock him up . Good work , Aboro . - That human 's name is Burke . Bring him in here . I 'll attend to Galen . G - Galen ? The fugitive , Galen . Burke is one of the two astronauts . The others are not very far . We 'll get them . I don 't understand , I - They took me for a fool , telling me you were trying to plot against me . I knew better , but I thought this was the best way ... to capture them without too much bloodshed . - They 'll be executed immediately . - Yes . - Wine is served , sir . - Ah , an excellent idea . Let 's celebrate the capture ... of our two most-wanted enemies . - Aboro . - To you , Urko . Excuse me , Urko . I forgot a quick errand , I 'll only be a moment . - What 's the matter ? - Nothing , nothing . Aboro . - I said , " What 's the matter ? " - Let me go , you fool ! Aboro is your loyal friend . He seems not to want to be with you , He seems in a big hurry not to be with you . - All right , Aboro , explain . - Please , Urko . - ... shoot the lock off ! - Why ? Don 't ask questions , you fool ! Shoot the lock off ! Please , Urko . Please ! - Tell me why ! - A bomb ! Explode anytime now ! Please . Urko ! Shoot the lock off ! . You mean this bomb ? I saw Daku light it . He 's outside right now . Put out the fuse , you fool ! As soon as you put down the gun and release Galen and Burke . Come on . Hurry , hurry ! - Cutting it fine , aren 't you ? - I kept this door unlocked . Nobody moves until you hear the door slam or I don 't rip out this fuse . You got it ? That fuse is getting close . It doesn 't matter , I disconnected it . Lock him up . I 'll take him back to Central City with me in the morning . I want him to enjoy my assistant , Bulta . Bribery , corruption , conduct unbecoming an ape . You 're finished , Aboro , Finished . Subtitles subXpacio

 ASSIGNEMENT TERROR Ummo 2-1-6 calling Earth . Reply please . Contact made . Kirian Zelner , surgeon , killed in the war action . Maleva Kerstein , PhD in biochemistry , killed in automobile accident . Both persons have the quite characteristics ... and have been reincarnated by embodiment . They will contact you . Remember , the success of our mission depends on exploiting to the full ... the superstitions among the Earth creatures . The first objective is the Blaustat fairground . This is the world we have to conquer . Its inhabitants are weak . Slaves of their own passions and uncertainties . We can use bombs ? Of course , we can even explode it with our nuclear arsenal . But we need the planet intact . - How much time do we have ? - Very little . Our planet is now nearly to freezing point ... and we still haven 't discovered how to create an artificial sun . Conditions of life here are similar to Ummo√©hoz . We must destroy or dominate the human race . And then our race may colonize this planet . - Do you think we 'll succeed ? - We must ! There are many other groups here , working on different objectives . But there succeed or failure , depends on us . These are the remains of Count John Mierhoff ... the fearsome vampire who , with its dizzying crimes ... led to anguish and panic to the people of the the fascinating lands of Transylvania . And the legend says that you only can kill him ... nailing a stake of wood in his heart . Know that the mysteries of the hypnotic powers ... that through the centuries has been passed and so I was given to me ... only by those who , like me ... descended from people which were dominated ... attacked and contaminated by a vampire . For some currencies , I 'll hypnotize you . And I will read about your future and how it is ... from love , passion , jealousy . Love , passion . The great weaknesses of the inhabitants of the earth . Feelings that have been overcome on our planet . Do 'nt be afraid , my pretty assistant is an experienced nurse . Tell him what is coming . And promise you will reveal it tonight . Who will be the first ? Do not worry , She 'll take care of you . Don 't be afraid , she 'll take care of you and if you pass out ... because of the terrible revelations of the unknown . Get up , please . Beautiful women are like powerful magnets . We use them to attract scientists , generals , heads of state ... with their vital secrets . We have very little material with regard to this case . But I 'll warn you , we don 't know our enemy . - It seems the work of a ghost . - Dispose of the ghosts . What about the gelatinous substance found at the stake ? - We took the clothes to the lab . - And ? We haven 't received the result of the analysis . There 's still a detail I 'm intrigued . The disappearance of the skeleton , and you know the old legend ... the only way to return the life of a vampire ... is to remove the stake from his heart . The skeleton is nothing more that a trick from a quack . But there must be a logical reason to explain the disappearance of the girl . What steps to take ? As you can see , I 'm always bogged down in mountains of paperwork . Why don 't you go and try to find something ? Okay . But don 't bring me vampires here . - Why ? - I 'm little anemic . I know . See ya ! You 'll be the first ... of a group of beautiful women who will obey blindly my orders . The prince of the night sleeps soundly . An excellent material for our studies . Do you think human beings may become infected ... if we inject in their veins the blood of a vampire ? We 'll know soon . - Good afternoon . - Good afternoon . Could you tell me if ... I 'm sorry , sir , we are already closing . Inspector Tobermann . Criminal Investigation . What can I be helpful ? Here has a book about monsters from Prof. Ulrich von Farancksalan ? That 's strange . For years I have worked here and nobody ever asked for it . And today , in just a few minutes , you 're already the second person . - How was the other person ? - Actually , it was a couple . A beautiful young lady , her skin was white like wax . The man was tall , slender . - His eyes were hard , cold . - Thank you . Climb the stairs and into the microfilm 's room , you 'll find Mr. Carl . He will give the book you want . Thanks again . This way , gentlemen . The sting penetrated the endocardium of the valves damaging a stained glass . Say was stabbed in the heart . I have one more thing to show you . Follow me . A sample of the gelatinous substance found in the victim 's clothing . A compound of living cells that we can 't identify . We have to do an analysis more detailed . Sure , as soon as possible . - It may be a clue . - Take your time , Henry . Beside the gelatin , there is some evidence ... linking this crime with the quack 's fair ? Yes . " The Anthology of Monsters . " This book is an exhaustive study about the legends about monsters ... created by man . The Mummy alive . They believe is in some hidden sarcophagus of the kings of Egypt . Nosferatu , the medieval wandering vampire from Transylvania . The Golem , a giant made of clay , set in Prague . The pages missing ... Thank you . Refer to the principle the creation of a creature artificial . Farancksalan 's own work . But listen . The end is intact . " I wanted to create a perfect human being selecting the best organs ... of different corpses . " " But it was here that God punish my presumption . " I inserted the brain of a killer ... " In a human being that I thought perfect . " Today I 'm going to the castle and be buried with this monster . " " May God have mercy of my soul . " - Do you think it 's a legend ? - Absolutely not ! It 's very interesting ! - And later : the werewolf . - The Werewolf ? Yeah , right , Another creature of nightmares . The only way to free him from the curse ... it was shot him in the heart with a silver bullet . Werewolf ... - Do you remembered something ? - Yes , I think so . When I was a litlle girl , my grandmother or my sister ... I don 't remember who , told me about this legend . It was about a man who transformed into a wolf at full moon . I think there is one word to describe it . - Lycanthropy ? - Yeah , right ! Lycanthropy . Honey , there are nothing but superstitions . Yes , but ... The flowers wilted . But the body of Waldemar , the Werewolf , remains intact . Hoping to resurrect . The silver bullet in the heart only stops him ... in an apparent death . His death would only be definitively if the bullet was fired ... by a woman who loved him enough to die for him . Ilonka , you will be responsible to administer the serum ... to prevent him to turn into a beast . The responsibility is yours . There will no power able to challenge the action of the vampire infecting its stigma about men . Neither the mummy . Neither monster of Farancksalan . We will release thousands of them ... against the race that inhabits this planet . I felt a strange sensation when I touched the Waldemar 's skin . The same I felt when I had to ... - He is a man or a monster ? - Both . It 's the eternal dilemma of the human race . The good or evil . Looks like a work of a wild animal . Four women have vanished an two murders in a peaceful town ... where nothing ever happens . Everyone expecting results from us . Mostly the mayor . Come in ! - The lab report , Sr. - Thank you . It 's incredible ! Scientists say they can 't identify the jelly substance ... after applying every test on the modern science . Because its structure is unlike anything they ever seen . I have an idea about this ! Give me a free hand to carry on my own investigation , just for few days . Go ahead , Henry . Try to find something concrete . - Thanks . - And good luck ! - I liked Hilda 's party , don 't you ? - Yes , I adored it ! Oh , thank you . Don 't spoil it , please . I 'm sorry . Do you want me to take you home ? - Oh , I left my ... back there . - I 'll get it . No , Inspector , Trudy was a good girl . All the customers liked her . - And yesterday was full moon . - What ? No , nothing . Anything else ? Yesterday came here a client who say bought the old castle . His name is Dr. Varnoff . That one ! Okay , thank you . - Whisky and soda . - Yes , sir . It 's an aspect harmless but it 's not . It 's used to make the guilty confess . To take secrets of the spies . Ultrasonic waves so acute that explode in the brain . Ilonka , I ordered you to watch him . The Waldemar 's escape could endangering our plans . Let this serve as an example . That 's enough ! That 's enough ! Never forget that ! Compassion is a weakness . Contact made . The tomb of the Tao Te mummy was found . It 's in the region of the Jehd-al-Karim . In the Amon Ra king 's pyramid . By the mirror in solid gold , found in the tomb of the mummy ... you will give your orders . Come in , Martha ! I was expecting a friend I thought it was her . I 'm Henry Tobermann , Dept . Criminal Investigations . I would like to talk to you about last night . Come in , please . I 've been in a second . You don 't remember me . Sit down . Don 't you remember me , right ? - I 'm afraid I ... - You graduated three years before me . Yes , of course ! So you ... Well , you was ... I know , don 't be afraid to say . I was a skinny little girl and you , captain of the rugby team . Well , actually , you changed a lot . But let 's talk about ... About what happened last night . In fact , I don 't expect you to believe , your colleagues didn 't believe me . Let 's say I 'm more in the know . Do you have any other information that you can give me ? About last night , nothing . But my father , the judge Sternberg ... had an amazing experience when he was younger . - Really ? - He met the Werewolf personally . Personally ? I hope to speak to your Father . - Come in . - No , no ! - Why not ? Come on ! - No , no ! I can 't ! Dr. Varnoff 's controlling their movements . As you can see , sir , This is the official report ... of the attack on your daughter . But it was full moon that night . Your daughter told me that you met the Werewolf personally . Yes , it 's true . And I can assure that was a horrible experience . Something that the human mind refuses to accept . But it happened . My wife ... died seven years ago . Waldemar Daninsky was in love for her before we met . He was a normal man . Like you or like me . A man of good family , cultured and intelligent ... but without knowing , fell on him this terrible curse ... of becoming a wolf in all nights of full moon . It 's unbelievable . That such horrors can even happen . I will help you all I can . You was almost being hypnotized . I wonder if we live this planet ... much younger than ours ... and being exposed with more intensity to the solar rays ... occupying the bodies of these fragile beings ... won 't ending transforming us also ... into stupid and sentimental beings like them ? It was only a moment of weaknesses . On this planet we 're trying to dominate , there were wars which destroyed empires ... through moments of weakness . The Mummy is our ideal . His heart is dry . He doesn 't speak , don 't live , don 't feel . A corpse that only obeys and destroy . Tomorrow we go in search of another ideal . The being creature by Farancksalan . Wich too has no heart , blood , feelings . Only your brain as the base . His power is electricity . But we should make it even more powerful with our atomic sources of energy . I shall take Waldemar with me . You and Kirian can look out the things here . Maleva ! Maleva ! Kirian ! Kirian ! Any news ? I have the report of the girl dead in the street . The hair found under her fingernails don 't correspond to human hair . Perhaps some kind of unknown animal . Well , that explains a lot . We 'll make a visit to the cemetery . I would like to prove a thing . But I don 't want to leave Ilse here alone . She won 't stay in the house of Commissioner Gliuck ? - Yes , there is more safe . - Of course . Untie him ! It 's just a test , just to confirm if he obeys my orders . No ! I said it 's only a test and the result was satisfactory . Ilonka , soon will be full moon . Inject the serum into Waldemar . - Double the dose . - Yes . - It was a cruel test . - Cruel ? In our decomposing galaxy nothing is more cruel . We fight for survival , between killing and dying . There is no doubt . I 'm afraid that our reincarnated into earthlings ... will cause us problems . Why ? Why are you helping me ? I don 't know . I really don 't know . Maybe I do this because I am a woman . - But you 're a Varnoff 's slave . - You 're mistaken , I 'm no longer their slave . Let 's get out of here . Don 't be afraid . I didn 't come to stop you . Flee ! Flee ! - What do you want , sir ? - A brandy . There you are . Give me another one . Last night , when I held you in my arms ... I felt a strange sensation . Something , I don 't know ... Undefined , obsessive . Yes , but how can we forget about something ... we felt for a long time and we had forgotten . Like ... a lost dream . But one day without knowing why ... strikes and fascinates us . Maybe it 's the sleeping passions ... the weaknesses that Dr. Varnoff ... told us . No ! Kirian ! Kirian ! Hello ? Who ? Where ? When ? Stay there , I 'm coming ! Why didn 't you go to the Gliuck 's house ? I 'm tired of feel like a prisoner . My father told me nothing of what is happening . You need to go , it 's unwise to stay here alone . Oh , I 'm not alone . Why you have to go ? You 're awesome . Don 't take this as a punishment , although you deserve it . For let Ilonka and Waldemar escaping . For let yourself win by the passions . So we can 't accomplish our plan . You must to kill your feelings . And forget everything , absolutely . Understand why I do this ? Yes . I 'm a woman and you 're upset for this . For the same reason that you killed Kirian . Jealousy ! And now , you want me to forget ! You 're also contaminated . You love too ! You can 't deny it ! You better get dressed . Superintendent Gliuck ? Superintendent ? No , no , no ! She 's alright . She is already on house . How do I know ? Well , I ... You better get up and get dressed . No , she 's alright , chief . Get dressed ! I have full responsibility . Get dressed ! No , chief ! No , no ... I haven 't been drinking , no , sir . One other thing ... I found out last night that some strangers bought the monastery . Yes , sir , that 's right . Dr. Varnoff . I think we have to check it out . Yes , sir . Yes , sir . Right away , sir . Ilse ! Will you please get dress ? Don 't you like me without freckles ? With or without freckles , you 're going back to Gliuck 's place right now . I found out Sternberg 's address . He is the district judge . You 've decided ? If you 're caught you 'll be arrested . You know that . I know . I 'm cursed . We 've no future . None . For either of us . I 'll only find peace ... - If a silver bullet ... - Have been shot by a woman ... who loves you enough to die for you . That 's strange . Since I was a little girl I always dreamed ... Dr. Varnoff ? Come in , please . He 's waiting for you . We will be visited for one of yours . One of my ? In a such way , yes . There 's a failure in the reincarnation system . Something from the subjected race , remains . A certain sensitivity to physical contact . Perhaps an imperceptible hue on the voice tone . In the expression of the eyes . Something I can 't define accurately . Consider me an enemy ? No . How can I consider you as my enemy if you 're under my complete control ? Come in . - 287 . - Speed up the preparation ? Yes , do it . Take note . Two cubic centimeters . Good afternoon , Inspector Tobermann . Good afternoon , Dr. Varnoff . I think we 've met you before . Yes , in the club . I 'm sorry for not meet you personally , because as you see , I 'm very busy . I believe you 're wondering Why I come here ? I know why . Your suspicions are well founded . Even though there isn 't all clear , am I wrong ? - No . - I 'd say you 're confused , Inspector . The monitors behind you , will clarify some details . You will find it strange if tell you that I came from the Ummo planet ... There are 14 light years distant ? It would be presumptuous on our part to think that the Earth ... is the only inhabited planet in the whole universe . And what about the legends of vampires , mummies , werewolves ? The monsters of Farancksalan , what 's your opinion ? Many stories came true thanks to modern science . Heart transplants , kidney , cornea ... Virtually all it 's replaceable . I have no doubt it will be possible to create Farancksalan 's monsters . We practice these techniques for centuries . And our mission here is to study the creation of monsters ... which then destroy humanity . Without having to expose ourselves . Why don 't you discover for yourself ? If all this is true , then why this says to me now ? Because I know just the future , including your own . Do you want to know what will happen to you tonight ? Do you recognize her ? Ilse ! You didn 't expect to witness her kidnapping , isn 't it ? Tonight ... she will be our guest . - What does this mean ? - Positive coefficient . And now , the most interesting . Your own future . Look . You 're not the first human being trying to disrupt our plans . The bones you 're seeing that 's all that remains of other intruders . The Bats awaken and begin to fly ... and when they feel hungry ... will attack your eyes letting your eye sockets empty ... Bloody . Unbelievable , isn 't ? Yes , unbelievable . Commissioner Gliuck , we 're absolutely concerned ... in the circumstances that your department ... not solved any of the cases of recent murderes and disappearances . And besides , this Dr. Varnoff ... Mr. Mayor , one of my best men , Inspector Tobermann ... was to make a visit to the castle and I hoping his report . Gentlemen , I have an information ... that I hide until then for personal reasons . And I want to remind you that since the disappearance of my daughter ... I have more personal interests on this subject than all you here . Judge Sternberg , we 're dealing to locate your daughter . Her disappearance restless all of us . But tell what 's this information and why didn 't you tell us before ? Because I knew no one believe me . Gentlemen , do you remember Waldemar Daninsky ? Well , we thought he was dead , but he 's alive . I saw him and talked to him . It 's related in some way with the strange happenings at the castle . Commissioner Gliuck , we can 't waste time with legal procedures . All right - go into the monastery , and if anyone Wants to keep us Shall I follow the commandments , Is that clear ? Hurry , go away from here ! Where is Ilse ? I don 't know . Perhaps lost in the galleries . Ilse ! Ilse ! Ilse ! - Go to arrest Dr. Varnoff ? - No comments ! Ilse ! It 's useless . They 've escaped from my control . The monster of Farancksalan ! Get ready to surround the castle ! Dr. Varnoff , if you don 't get out the castle immediately ... we 'll invade , by the door if necessary ! Back ! Back , please ! - Watch all the exit doors ! - Stay away , don 't approach , please ! We 're surrounded ! Let 's run away before the two gas streams join . It 's useless to try to escape , Dr Varnoff . Failure has a price . Could you tell us something useful ? Yes , it 's not easy to destroy them . His passions , that we thought were weaknesses ... are what make them really strong . Much more than its nuclear weapons . Do you believed that we can stop these feelings ? Without it , will be worth living . We need to stay alive . We must try other methods . I 'm fully responsible by failure . Could you not save her ? Forget about Dr. Kerstein . Long ago she no longer belongs to this world . While exist men on earth able to sacrifice themselves for the others ... nothing can destroy us .

 Cough . This hurt ? This ? This ? Oh , that 's all right now , Sarah . I guess I 've poked and pushed at you enough . Come on in , now . You get yourself dressed , then come on in here . Then we 'll have a little talk . Oh , Sarah , I haven 't seen you for quite some time . You know how it is , Dr Thomas . Frank and the children have been going to the new doctor . You 've been going to him , too ? Oh , no . No . I told Frank , " Dr Thomas has always been the Kane family doctor , " and I 'm still right satisfied with that arrangement . " Thank you , Sarah . Well , I do wish you had been seeing someone , though . You must have been suffering considerable pain . Some . You raised a fine family , Sarah . Fine . Just fine . Oh , you heard from your brother John lately ? No . Just a card last Christmas . It 's been seven years . Well , now , what are we going to do about you , Sarah ? Let 's see . I think you better see Miss Fanny Jeffers , and tell her you 're not coming in to work tomorrow . I want to put you in the Memorial Hospital this afternoon just for some tests . You see , I want to give you some tests to find out what 's causing all that pain . Nothing to get upset about now . Just some tests . - Lloyd ? - Oh , how do , Reverend MacGill ? - Evening , Mr Thomas . - Come in . Come on in , boy . Papa , have you got a minute ? I want to talk to you . - That 's why I asked you to come by . - You asked me ? Yes . I called your office . Well , I didn 't get it . I 'm going straight to Hill-Donaldson . - Any trouble there ? - No . No , nothing much . Seems to me like you ought to get that strike settled . Why don 't you get Perry Kermit out on the golf course and tell him to give those men the extra $ 1 and get it over with ? Oh , Papa , you just don 't understand . They recognise this union and then they got trouble in Birmingham and Gary and ... Well , look , I didn 't come here to talk politics . What is it you want ? I already told Reverend MacGill part . It concerns one of my patients , Sarah Gabriel . You know , works for Miss Fanny Jeffers . - Oh , yeah . - It 's a tumour , malignant . She 's got maybe a few more days to live at most . Poor sister . A true Christian . But what 's troubling me started 35 years back . Thirty-five years . Oh , Papa . A delivery , Aunt Ella Kane , Sarah 's mother . I was troubled about a breach presentation . So I brought her in here at the office . A sudden storm , considerable wind damage . But there was a sudden surge , and the main transformer on the relay line at Marion Road just blew . Well , I just finished cutting the umbilical cord when the lights came back on again . John . Seven pounds , three ounces . Well , he grew up like any other little coloured boy in town . Measles and chicken pox and all that . Then , when he was about halfway through high school , he quit . Now , there wasn 't anything too unusual about that . Not in those times and other , but at the age of 16 , he just disappeared . - What do you mean ? - He left town . Papa , lots of coloured boys left town . There wasn 't anything to wonder about then . There was no trouble at home or with the police . Then it was ... Oh , yeah , seven or eight years went by . Then Aunt Ella Kane had a sudden stroke . I didn 't like the signs , so I put her into the hospital for observation . That afternoon , Sarah 's brother , John , dropped off the Trailways bus from Marion . Few hours later , Aunt Ella had a sudden embolism and died . The next day after the funeral , he left town . Is that it ? I mean , this boy showing up at his mother 's deathbed ? If you 'll indulge your father for a few minutes further . It was again years and years went by . How many , Papa ? I got an appointment . Then Sarah , Aunt Ella 's daughter , came to me . The father , been a brick mason , travelled from job to job . There 'd been an accident in a five-storey business block in a small town in Indiana , Columbus or Frankfurt . Lafayette . Anyway , the man died in the fall . But there was a small insurance policy , and Sarah asked me to see if the Indiana authorities signed certain papers . So , I was going to a Bloomington medical conference anyway , so I stopped off at Columbus . It was Columbus . Everything had been taken care of . The man 's son had arrived a few minutes after the accident and was with his father when he died . That boy John , wandering God knows where , had come back to his mother 's deathbed and his father 's deathbed . And now his sister Sarah was in the hospital . Not a soul in the world who knows she has just a few days maybe to live at most . And yet as sure as I am standing here I feel that boy will come back to his sister 's deathbed . Papa , there are holes in that story you could drive a truck through . He could have found out in a perfectly ordinary kind of way . A long-distance telephone call , telegram . - No one knows where he is . - But you don 't know that for sure . The family doesn 't know that she 's dying . I was just talking to Reverend MacGill about how to break the news to the family . That 's the very important thing you had to tell me ? I mean , that 's it ? You 'll excuse me , Reverend , I have to get along . - Papa , could I see you ? - Yeah . - Yeah , can I see you , Papa ? - Excuse me , Reverend . I swear , I don 't know what 's the matter with you . - I 'm sorry , Lloyd . - I tell you ... Well , no , I don 't have time now , - but I got something to tell you . Papa ... - Hi , Harry , Peter . Papa , would you listen to me ? George Howard was talking to me about your driving again . And look , you put another dent in your fender . It cost me $ 48 to straighten out two weeks ago . Well , I 'll take care of it in the insurance . Papa , they have cancelled your insurance after the last accident . I 'm carrying you as an assigned risk . What 's the use ? Papa , would you just take care ? Drive careful . - What do we want ? - Union wages ! - When do we want it ? - Right now ! - What do we want ? - Union wages ! - When do we want it ? - Right now ! - What do we want ? - Union wages ! - When do we want it ? - Right now ! - What do we want ? - Union wages ! - When do we want it ? - Right now ! - What do we want ? - Union wages ! - When do we want it ? - Right now ! Where the hell have you been ? - Union wages ! - Union wages ! - When do we want it ? - Right now ! Well , I came right out here . We 've got a court order , no mass picketing . - Now , are you going to ... - Orly Ball 's coming right out . - Are you going to enforce that injunction ? - Now , just take it easy , Archie . Then we sure elected ourselves one hell of a county solicitor . Now , wait just a damn minute . You didn 't elect anybody . You 're sure as hell gonna find out in the next primary . - What do we want ? - Union wages ! - When do we want it ? - Right now ! - What do we want ? - Union wages ! - When do we want it ? - Right now ! If you think you can get along in this county without the company ... Now , look here ... Perry , Perry , would you let me talk to Orly ? What do we want ? Now , there 's a court order . Twelve pickets at the main gate . We got a call from the New York office , and they say they heard there was a field representative coming down here from the Southern Labour Rights Council . Now , you know damn well ... When somebody crosses the line into Calawah County to incite violence I 'll take care of him . Now , in the meantime , I 'm going to keep the peace . Hey , Bill , old Sheriff Orly Ball 's coming over here . Now , you keep them going , but keep them down low . Keep them going . - Union wages ! Right now ! - Union wages ! Right now ! - Hey , Charley Gray . - Hey , Sheriff . - What do we want ? - Union wages ! You 're gonna have to ask your boys to kind of thin themselves out a bit . - When do we want it ? - Right now . They don 't always do what I tell them to , Sheriff . - What do we want ? - Union wages ! - When do we want it ? - Right now ! On the other hand , what the hell good is it going to do us , getting heads busted at this stage of the game , huh ? - Right now ! - What do we want ? - Union wages ! - Union wages ! Look , you 're entitled to have 12 pickets . That 's legal , right ? Now , it don 't make no nevermind to me if the rest of them watch them right out there . - Right now ! - What do we want ? - Union wages ! - When do we want it ? - Right now ! - What do we want ? - Union wages right now ! - Union wages right now ! It wouldn 't be a bad place to watch from , Sheriff . - When do we want it ? - Right now ! Nice talking to you , Charley Gray . Hey , it 's always a pleasure , Sheriff . - Union wages ! - When do we want it ? And he ordered adrenaline lM on top of the oxygen , but she didn 't respond . So he called Dr Rhorbach , because he didn 't want to take the responsibility without a senior head of service . I 'm sorry , Mr Gabriel . I did think that she would have more time . I told her time and time again to stop dosing herself with that damn pink medicine . I don 't think that would have made much difference . - Did Sarah have any other kinfolk in town ? - Just let it all out , honey . - No . - Her brother , John . I guess you 'll want to get in touch with him if anybody knows where he is . Sit down , Frank , sit down . You 'll have to sign for the PM , Doctor . John . John Kane . Dr Thomas . I didn 't know if you 'd remember me . I didn 't think anyone knew where to reach you . I suppose they didn 't . I was just passing through . You saw Sarah ? I mean , before she died ? It must have been a comfort to her , although I don 't think she knew . I think maybe she guessed . Were you far away ? How long will you be staying in town ? Just a little while . Excuse me . And I will dwell in the house of the Lord , forever . Amen . Who 's that , Doc ? Oh , John . John Kane . Sarah 's brother . Why ? I just take a kindly interest in all strangers in town these days . Even at funerals ? Oh , hell , Doc . I 'm sitting on a goddamn powder keg out there at Hill-Donaldson . All I need is some outsider coming in to blow it up . Are you expecting one ? So I hear . When did he come to town ? John Kane is no outsider . He was born and raised right here . Well , then where 's he been , Doc ? That 's what I always want to know . Now , try some of Sister Addy 's rice here , and this is some of Sister Georgette Dexter 's melon relish . Now , you come back for some more ribs , you hear ? Hey , Louisa , let me have some ... - Henry , get off me ! - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Oh , hey , hey , hey , hey . John , come on back here and have a drink with the boys . Oh , listen , I 'm sorry about your sister , Sarah , but when you get through with all them condolences , you come back here and have some fun with us , all right ? You just trying to make me do all the work , and you 're not doing nothing . - I do everything . - You know Papa 's not feeling well . Let 's don 't start an argument , okay ? This is my niece , Louisa . Louisa , this is Miss Sarah 's brother , John . - Oh , good evening , Reverend . - Welcome , Doctor . Thank you . Can I fix you a cup of coffee , Doctor ? A little plate ? Well , I would appreciate a cup of coffee , Miss Dunbar . Thank you . - All right . - Frank , I just can 't tell you how sorry I am . - Thank you , Doctor . - You , too , Jimmy . Marsha Jean , I know your mother had every confidence that you two would grow up to be the kind of people that would make things happen . Now , I 've got the two plates now . Mr Thomas , I believe it 's this John Kane . Yeah , but ... Look , it is my job to find out who he is . Well , I don 't want to say right out . Just a minute . Do you want to move back there like I said ? I just don 't want no trouble , Sheriff . I told you , just move back there . You told me to look out for somebody moving on Hill-Donaldson , right ? Look , I ain 't gonna take the responsibility , Mr Thomas . You just come out here like I say . - Henry , I have to wash up the dishes . - No , you don 't ! What 's the matter with you ? Come now . Come on ! Hey , talk to me . Ask me something . - What ? - Anything . You still play shortstop rougher than any boy in town ? I haven 't played recently . I didn 't think you 'd remember me that well . Yes . You were a good deal smaller and not much account back then , but I remember . - It 's all right now . Thanks . - What is ? Henry Birkhardt . He owns a GMC dump truck and a Pontiac Judge , and he can 't understand why I don 't find him irresistible . - You don 't ? - No . I ... To hell with him . Why 'd you come back here ? My sister died . Why did you come back ? How do you know I was away ? Was it Chicago ? San Francisco ? - New York . - What were you doing there ? I was a teacher . And until the city and the schools fell apart , I provided a broadening cultural experience for upper middle-class children . But that city is so uptight , like it 's choking to death . It doesn 't work any more . None of them do . At least not for me . You know what I mean ? Why am I telling you all this ? Maybe you want to interest me . Why would I want to interest you ? Well , for one thing , I don 't own a GMC dump truck . I 'll buy that . What about you , Brother John ? What have you been doing ? Working . It 's finished now . I 'm going to cool it for a few days before I split . - You teaching here ? - Stuart Street . - I went to grade school there . - Yes . I know . You carved your name over the toilet . Yes . And old Miss Hattie Drew , she beat my bottom with her bamboo pointer . Oh , goodness . - They still do that ? - Not in my class . I withhold approval and affection . It 's more devastating . Right . I 'd like to see that , my name carved over a toilet . Well , come around and visit our john , Brother John . It 'd be like Hannibal returning to Carthage in triumph . Hannibal returning to Carthage in triumph . - You talk like that to ... - Henry Birkhardt ? No , he 'd only laugh and try to unbutton my blouse . He 's not all bad , is he ? Well , at least I left my name someplace . Come around and visit . We 're very advanced here in Hackley . We 're integrated as far as the second grade . Would you come ? Hey . Big John ? Hey . Number two . I still don 't like it . Oh , hell , we lean over backwards . When I worked for Mr Lowery Yaw , I would have run that boy in , charged him with anything handy and then booted his butt over the line into Tarbridge County . Damn . The London Times . What 's that one ? Der Spiegel , that 's German . L ' humanitã © , that 's the French communist paper . Son of a bitch . Look here . Hey , that 's Arab writing . That 's the same writing on my Shriners hat . " This Bible was placed by the Gideons . " Property of the Hilton Hotel , New York City . " I told you that bastard came from up there . " To John , truth , like beauty , is in the eye of the beholder . N.W. " - Well , I 'll be damned . - Hey . I got something . Passport . That 's him , all right . My , my , my . My , my . I 'll be damned . God damn it . The rest is just socks and underwear and crap . When you went to the funeral , now , did you find out anything about him ? Well , now , why on earth ... Papa . Papa . - A funeral , of all places . - Papa . Would you kindly put in your teeth ? All right , now , did he tell you anything ? Where 's he been , what he 's doing here ? No , no , just that he 's passing through . - You would like to have some milk , Son ? - No , no . - Orly ? - No , I 'm fine , Doc . Thanks . I thought you weren 't interested in him . I thought it was just some sort of old man 's story interfering with more important things , like golf games with Perry Kermit and Archie Fanyon . Never mind that . Now . His passport expires August 5 . That means he 's had it five years . You got any idea where he 's been ? London , Paris , Frankfurt , Germany , Krakow , Prague , Moscow , New Delhi , Bombay and Kuala Lumpur , Saigon , Dar es Salaam , Mexico City , Quito , Havana , Nairobi , Singapore . And that isn 't all . There were two more pages of stamps I didn 't even copy down . Now , what in the hell is he doing in all those places ? Moscow and Prague and Havana . - Hell , you can 't even go to Havana . - Maybe he hijacked a plane . Now , look , it just don 't make sense . Here he is , a black man , as far as we know he never finished high school , so you 'd figure he 'd be driving a Payloader at Hill-Donaldson , sharecropping out in the county , on the food stamps . All right , say he goes north . Have the same kind of job in Cincinnati or New York . I mean , where does he get off going from Paris to Saigon ? How does he pay for it ? What was he doing ? What 's he doing back here ? Sarah was about to die . Oh , I 'm serious , Papa . And you said it yourself . Nobody knew she was that sick , not till the operation . That 's what you said . You told me yourself , Mr Thomas . There was that advisory from the State Bureau saying there was a fella coming down to make trouble at Hill-Donaldson . No . No . Now , you take your ordinary outside agitator . Who is he ? He 's some kid lawyer fresh out of Harvard , living on $ 30-a-week expense money . That don 't pay for this . You travel like this , you 're either a millionaire , or you 're working for somebody who 's paying the bills . Maybe for the airlines . No . That 's different immigration stamps . You see , there just aren 't that many possibilities . - A newspaper , or something like that . - Good night . An oil company . But they aren 't hiring any black kid who dropped out of high school . It just don 't make sense . Damn it , I sure intend to find out . Well , I say get him the hell out of town . Let Joe Beckett over in Tarbridge County worry . Oh , no . No , this is something . A black man from Hackley in Prague , East Berlin ... God damn . What the hell you got a hold of down there , Lloyd ? - You said it 'd be confidential . - Well , yeah , but my God , man ! Look . You want to spend the next 10 years in a district office ? - What do you have in mind ? - I 'm telling you . Old Lowery Yaw 's on his last legs . He still thinks Lyndon Johnson 's president . All I need is one good break . What do I need ? State 's attorney general , maybe lieutenant governor . - What do you want ? - I told you . Come on . I got myself out on a limb getting this stuff for you . - What is it ? - Okay . As far as we know in the district here , this John Kane is unknown in connection with any civil rights organisations or foundations and crap like that . And Washington got nothing , either . That includes subversive front stuff and black militants . Now , wait . Under another name . They got a pretty good cross-index up there , Lloyd . Well , could he be working for something like the ClA or maybe a courier or something for the State Department ? ClA , no . We cross-checked . And I called Marv Duberly on the security desk at State . Yeah . You really started something down there , boy . They are running around that passport division like somebody squirted them with boiling water . I mean , for God 's sakes , man , Havana , Albania . You know one of those marks turned out to be the stamp from the City Clerk 's Office in Peking ? - But they don 't know him ? - Hell , they don 't want to know him . They are , and I quote old Marv , " At a loss to understand how this could happen . " In fact , it couldn 't . I 'm dead . Hey , hey , hey ! That 's enough , that 's enough . Don 't kill the man . Soccer , soccer , play . Let 's move it . Scoot . Come on , come on , put your shoe on over there . Go on , go on , scoot . You know , I haven 't been able to find any source material down here for African culture except for Tarzan , which is hardly appropriate . - ls it on a record ? - No . I 'd like to use it . Is it published ? - I don 't think so . - Where 'd you learn it ? I happened to be there at the time . You never got married ? No . I 've been differently occupied . - With what ? - My work . - But that 's finished now , right ? - Yes . You said you had a few days . What do you plan to do with them ? - Nothing . - I think you 're a liar , Brother John . I think you 're a very hungry man , and I think you 're afraid to taste anything . Talk to me . Oh , hell , you 're doing pretty good by yourself . You 're a very different breed of cat . Right now , Brother John , the drums are pounding . You hear ? The jungle is alive with messages . Miss Pettinghill is now going to phone Miss Henrietta Johnson , and Aunt Patience Brown can hardly wait till the Ladies Aid meets tonight . Why ? " Because dear Reverend MacGill 's Louisa , " you know , the one that was away , is walking down Huguenot Street " with Sister Sarah 's Brother John . " And it 's about time , too . I don 't like to say it , Sister Williametta , " what that girl needs is a man to settle her down . " Fair warning , Brother John . I only have a few days . Want company ? Yes . Well , that 's all it is then , just a few days to kill . That 's all . Okay . Then I stay here and let them wonder , and you go wherever you have to go . Fair enough . Yeah . - Thank you , Helen . - Sheriff 's office . I got me a good set of prints off that bathroom glass . - Well ? - He 's got a record all right . - Where ? - Ludlow , Texas . Vagrancy . Did three months on the road gang there , and then just walked off . And there 's still a fugitive warrant out for him . - That 's all ? - Well , he was in the Army . - You want one ? - Where ? - Korean War . - Anything there ? I don 't know . He got a medical discharge . Agnes Day , I told you , I got to work . Atterberry ? Hell , no . No , he always wants to play . He wants to play bridge instead of pinochle . I ain 't playing no damn ... Lloyd , there 's a fellow out at Hill-Donaldson from the Montgomery office of The New York Times . - So ? - Well , when The New York Times takes an interest in a town like this , we are in trouble . Just don 't start anything . Me ? They 're gonna have a strike meeting this evening , and I 'll give you goddamn long odds that boy John is gonna be there . Maybe . - Let me pick him up on that Texas warrant . - No . No . If we move too fast , we 'll never know . Well , I 'll tell you , Lloyd , because I 've got my areas of responsibility , too . I 'm gonna keep him under surveillance , and if I get anything on him , I ain 't waiting on you . - Jimmy , you cut that out . - Sarah leave insurance ? Just enough to bury her . You working steady ? Just three days , part-time . She made more money than I do . She never told nobody , but it 's the God 's truth . She said to me , " My mama was the strong one , " and my grandmama . " And the world put them down , and they put down their men . " She said , " Frank Gabriel , that 's gonna stop right here . " My children is gonna know the man is the man . " And they gonna respect their daddy for the head of the family . " When I wasn 't working , I 'd meet her down on Stuart Street , and she 'd bring me her money from Mr George Baylor and Miss Fanny Jeffers , and I brought it home . She said , " Hard times for the black man ain 't your fault , Frank . " And I ain 't gonna see my man get cut down in front of the eyes of the children . " I got it , Papa . Marsha Jean , you best put on another pot of coffee . Papa ? Can I help you ? - You Frank Gabriel ? - Yes . You ain 't never been in trouble before , have you , Frank ? No . I mean , you ain 't one of them troublemakers , are you ? Anything you want in particular , Officer ? Don 't rush me , Frank . Don 't rush me . You know that 's not good manners . - Anybody else here ? - Now , look , Officer ... - Who are you ? - That 's my brother-in-law , John Kane . I asked him , Frank . I 'm gonna tell you something , John . You 're under police surveillance . I 'm gonna save the both of us a whole lot of trouble because I don 't believe in pussyfooting around . You know what I mean ? Now , you 're gonna have to watch your tail around town , or you can get it whipped . You get out of my house . Oh , now , I thought you were a smart negro , Frank . My name is Gabriel . Your name is shit , you talk back to me . You get out of my house . You red-necked cracker , get out of my house ! You work down at the Harris lumberyard , don 't you ? Hey , Frank , I 'm talking to you . - You work down at the lumberyard ? - Yes . - I can 't hear you , boy . - Yes ! Mr A.L. Harris , he 's very strong for law and order . Now , how long do you think he 's going to tolerate an employee gets arrested for interfering with an officer in the performance of his duty , huh ? Hey , what I mean , boy , is you can be replaced with any buck negro with a strong back and a weak mind . You want me to tell him that you talking back ? Well , let me hear you , Frank . You got anything to say , Frank ? Then you gonna be a good nigger and keep your liver lip shut ? Officer ? - Yes ? - You want to talk to me ? - Yeah . - Private ? - Frank , can we use your ... - Look , John , you don 't ... Now , Frank . Oh , no . You go right ahead . - I told you a couple times . - Thanks , Mr Kidd . Don 't think it 's too funny , boy . Just go on over like I told you . - Any trouble ? - Not yet . These boys don 't finish right now , they 're gonna pee their pants . All right , I see any pop bottles flying , you boys are going to get whammed good . Just keep them separated , that 's all . - Now , where 's George ? - George ? - Well , he had to go home . - Why ? He wasn 't feeling too good . All right , now give me attention here for a moment . I want you all to know that they 're having a legal meeting over here . It 's their right to have it . - Johnny ? Johnny Kane ? - Johnny Kane ! I just knew that was you sitting in the back row . Hey , Charley Gray . How are you , Charley ? What do you mean , how are you ? Give it to me . Give it up like that . Johnny ... Hey , Bill , this is Johnny Kane . Johnny Kane , Bill Jones . Hi , how are you ? Glad to meet you . Hey , I 'll see you over at the Ark . I 'll be over in a minute . Man , what are you doing down here ? I 'm just passing through . My sister died . Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . I heard . I 'm sorry about that , man . Yeah . - Well , where are you running to ? - Nowhere . Yeah , well , how come you didn 't come up and say hello ? You were conducting the meeting . I didn 't want to bother you . Jive ! Lou , you know how long ... Me and this dude was in high school together . Boy , you still just as big and black and ugly as ever . Is that how you make friends with everyone ? Damn , Johnny Kane ! Johnny , if anybody told me just five years ago that we 'd have a function alliance with that bunch of second-generation crackers ... - You think you can win ? - Got to , got to . - These are boiling times down here , man . - Even in Hackley . Down here is where it 's all happening . Compliments of Local 747 . Man , I 'm telling you , ain 't nothing like chairing one of them meetings to dry you up . Hey , I 'm sorry , John . No , thanks . In fact , if you 'll excuse me a minute . Yeah . Which reminds me . Where in the hell have you been when we needed you ? - Working . - Hey , baby . For the man ? No . Planning on staying down here ? Sure could use you . You 've been dabbing around long enough . Time to squat and pay some dues , man . I 've paid . I 'm going over to Marion tomorrow night to meet a man who 's come in from New York with a pocketful of good , northern New York integrated money . Sheriff Orly Ball thinks he 's coming here , but I 'm going to fox him . I 'm going there . Come on , go with me , ride shotgun . You expecting Indians ? Hell , I don 't know nothing about no Indians , but I tell you one thing . Last time , I was chased by four crackers in a ' 67 Plymouth . But if they ever catch me , they got a surprise coming . I got an over-and-under shotgun sitting right on the front seat beside me , loaded with rusty nails . Boy , if they ever catch me , God help them . Come on with me . Look at that . Look at that . Give me a drink . Hey , hey , look , now . Come on , sit down and let me buy you a drink . No , thank you . Oh , come on , now , sugar mama ... Henry , please . You saving it for the city folks , huh ? It 's just that I 'm overwhelmed by your charm . Excuse me . You weren 't so goddamn fussy before you went off to school . You remember , huh ? Behind ... In the Chevy behind the gasworks . It is one of my most poignant memories . What did I tell you ? Look , Henry . Let me put it in words of one syllable . I am not the same girl you screwed at the age of 16 . Now , let me by , or I 'm going to knee you right in the groin . She 's got balls , hasn 't she ? Johnny . Whose side you on anyway , man ? Look , look , Lou . Lou , will you tell this dude he gotta come with me ? You kidding ? Nobody can tell Brother John anything . He is the dude that walks by himself . John Kane . He in trouble ? Now , I want you to know he is a good boy . He ain 't in no trouble , Miss Nettie . Then what did the police want with him ? This ain 't no policeman , Miss Nettie . This is Dr Thomas . I told you , remember ? 'Course I know . I remember Doc Thomas . John Kane , Miss Nettie , do you remember anything unusual about him ? No . That 's what I told Mr McCullough when he proposed him for the scholarship at the Tubman Institute in Marion . I said John seemed very ordinary , but don 't you be fooled . But John didn 't go to Tubman . Isn 't that a shame ? You know , I remember he came to see me before he left school . I stressed the importance of the opportunities at Tubman , but he said he didn 't have time . I remember that . Sixteen-year-old boy just smiling and saying he didn 't have time . - His name was John , Ella Kane 's boy . - Yes , Miss Nettie . If he goes to Tubman , he can qualify and be of service to the people . But he told me , " l can 't teach them . That 's not my job . " Why , I gave him the sharp edge of my tongue , all right . I said , " John , your father is away working , " and your mother needs you . " And he said he couldn 't help that . He had to go . I asked him when he 's coming back . " When the wind comes again . " He 's back now , Miss Nettie . Oh , isn 't that nice ? Although , I do believe the scholarship to Tubman is already awarded . I 'm afraid it is . You ask him to come to see me . - I wanna see his journal . - Journal ? I gave it to him for a going-away present . I told him , " John , you keep your eyes open " and your mind busy , and you write down something worthwhile every day . " It 's a lovely journal . Brown Morocco leather with gold design , and a pretty silk ribbon to keep your place . Did you write anything in it , Miss Nettie ? I always do . I write the same thing . " To , " you know , whoever it is , " truth , like beauty , " is in the eyes of the beholder . " Signed , " N.W. " For Nettie Wheelock , of course . I do hope he hasn 't lost it . He 's still got it , Miss Nettie . I warned you about Uncle Earl 's sermon . I think he meant you personally . He was looking right at you when he said , " Are you saved ? " Poor Uncle Earl . He 's not too relevant . All that talk about hellfire , damnation , judgement day ... Oh , I believe in hellfire . I 've seen that . Oh ? How about damnation ? That 's possible . And judgement day ? Are you ready to answer for your sins ? Maybe it won 't be that way . Each man answering for his own sins . Maybe man will answer as a species , not so much for what he was , but for what he might become . That 's not fair . Maybe . Anyway , it won 't be tonight . Do you know who they are ? My man , he is scared . Hold it , now , hold it . Now , hold the water . Here we go . I got them ! He 's scared now . Get off the road ! Goddamn fools . " Let me out of this car . I wanna get back to Henry . " Go on , get him again . All right . I 'm driving . I know what I 'm doing , fools . Give me some of that water . Give me that stuff . Hit it . Come on . Don 't be scared . Everything 's under control . Hey , you fool ! What 's he doing ? Okay , okay . Okay , okay . Hey , boy ! I wanna ... Come on out of there ! - Come on , get out ! - Get out . We are damned tired of you agitators coming down ... Open up . Open up this door . Coming here like King Shit , thinking you can take everything over . - Stop it ! - Who in the hell do you think you are ? Just ' cause some fancy-ass whore is putting out for you , you think you can take everything over ? Get out of there and fight . What the hell . Get out of there , nigger ! You tell him now , John . Come on out , big man . - Big man . - Thinks he is . I don 't think so . I got it . This is gonna be nice . I am gonna rip your ass . All right , now . Just what the hell is going on here ? What 's it all about ? Ain 't nothing . We just having a little discussion , that 's all . Is that right ? What are you doing around here anyway ? I was just passing through . This thing still running ? Yes . I think so . Keep on passing through , then . - Get in it , and get the hell out of here . - Wait a minute . Hey , man , you won . Louisa ... - All right , now , come on , come on . - Wait a minute , wait a minute . All I can say ... I don 't know how to say it , except that all I can give you is what I got . I love ... You 'll never know . You 'll never know . Come in . I 'd better not . Tomorrow 's my last day . Tomorrow ? Well , well ... What the hell , Brother John ? What the hell ? Yeah , what the hell ? What do we have to lose , huh ? Well ... We really had them going there for a while , didn 't we ? Old Miss Pettinghill , Miss Henrietta Johnson , Aunt Patience Brown . " Praise the Lord ! " Louisa done found herself a man before it 's too late . " I don 't want you to go . Stay with me . Marry me , or don 't . I don 't give a damn . But stay . You said you understood . Well , I 'm a liar . Look , man , you can 't just split . I mean , you can 't go walking with a girl and then just cut out on her . I love you . Stay a little longer . A week , another day . I can 't . All right . I 'll go with you . I got nothing here . I 'll go with you . I have to go alone . When will you be back ? I won 't be back . Just like that ? " Bye , baby . " lt sure killed time between buses . " Did I come on too strong , Brother John ? Give me time . I 'll back away . I 'm not proud , just tell me you love me when and if it creeps up on you . I love you now . But there 's no time . There is no time at all for anything . Not for making love or living together , getting married , having kids , fighting , making up , sitting down to dinner . I would like to be a father and sit at the head of a table and slice the meat and pass it to my son . I would like to leave my name someplace besides the toilet of the Stuart Street school . I would like to live and die . A simple life like my father and my mother and my sister and Charley Gray . However hard it was , I 'd buy it . If I had the time . What do you mean , Charley Gray ? He isn 't dead . I love you , Louisa , but it makes no difference . Oh , well . Love sure kills the time till the last bus . I don 't understand , Brother John , but will you say goodbye to me before you go ? Yes . I promise . But he said he didn 't have time . I remember that . Sixteen-year-old boy just smiling and saying he didn 't have time . I said , " John , your father is away working , " and your mother needs you . " And he said he couldn 't help that . He had to go . I asked him when he 's coming back . " When the wind comes again . " " When the wind comes again . " Now , you drink this , Papa . The car is a total wreck , Mr Thomas . You 're gonna have to send out a wrecker for it . All right , I 'll take care of it . He said he was coming here , but he was out on Route 16 , heading north . I told you he was going to hurt hisself someday . Yeah , yeah , thank you . It 's over $ 50 damage . Now , I gotta file a 326 . Now , just look at that . Don 't worry . He 'll surrender his licence tomorrow morning . Hope he does . - Papa , were you drinking again ? - No , no . Just my usual bourbon and branch , that 's all . - Are you sure ? - Mr Thomas , you wanna come out here a minute ? Come on , Papa . Now , you drink . He 's trying it under the ultraviolet . I don 't want them damaged . Oh , don 't worry . I got a regular executed search-and-seizure warrant from Judge Picker . You tell him what for ? Hell , no . I can 't find anything , Mr Ball . You got anything else you can use on it ? Not in the field kit . You ought to send these things up to the state lab at Marion . - No . - What the hell are we looking for ? Well , I thought it might be some kind of record . - lt is . - I could try a stronger solution . Why should you think his secret would be so conveniently listed in that manual ? - Oh , Papa . - Oh , yes . Who knows what they do where he comes from ? Oh , yes , he comes from somewhere else . He 's gone all over the world , making those records that you can 't read . - What for ? - Well , that 's the interesting question . Well , then , where 's he supposed to be going to now ? Papa , I 'm going to drive you home . He 'll make his report on what he 's observed all over the world . - Boy , how you going to like that , boy ? - Come on , come on . And you , Orly Ball and old Lowery Yaw . - He 's the one . John Kane . - Yeah . - I brought him into this world . - I know . That little kinky-haired black baby , and what happens to every damn one of us depends upon what he puts in those journals . - You 're a stubborn old man . - Those blank pages . Come on , I 'm going to put you to bed . No , I am going to stay right here . - I want to see him . - Papa , Papa ... I want to be here tomorrow when the wind comes again . What tomorrow ? That 's when he 'll leave . He said so . Is that right ? Well , that 's what I heard . Well , now , listen , Orly , you pick him up . You don 't let him get away . Now , you wait just a minute , now . When I said before to pick him up and get him out of the county , you said no . Now he 's going out on his own steam . Now , you just get him . You hold him . Now , look , Mr Thomas ... Till I find out who the hell he is and what he 's doing . Now , do I have to get Judge Picker out of bed and get a bench warrant ? No . Where is he ? - Who ? - John Kane . He 's gone . Where to ? Now , look here , John . You 're in trouble . Now , look here , John . You 're in trouble . You want me to ship you back to Ludlow , Texas ? - No . - Well , then , you better answer my questions . - I have been for some time . - All right . Now , you tell me why you 've been travelling to all these places in this passport . To see the world . - Who paid for it ? - I did . Where did you get the money ? I worked . And what about this Cuba , Albania , China ? You know , American citizen isn 't supposed to go there . Nobody stopped me . Say , what 's this book ? It 's ... It 's in Arabic , right ? - Yes . - What is it ? It 's the Bible . - That is quotations from the Koran . - Can you read that ? Do you speak Russian ? Yes . Chinese ? - Yes . - What else ? Swahili . French . Spanish . German . How did you learn ? I listened . What 's this ? A journal . Well , you 've been carrying it around for years . - Yes . - Why are the pages blank ? I haven 't written in them . - Why not ? - lt wasn 't necessary . Well , then why 'd you keep them ? To remember . - Good morning , Orly . - Good morning . Yep ? Yeah , he 's here . Yeah , I 'll tell him . Mr Thomas ? You got company . Reverend MacGill . Damn it . All right . Put him in a cell . Mr Thomas , I 've had a lot more experience than you , interrogating niggers . You wanna see what I can get out of him ? No , I don 't want any smart lawyer pulling a Miranda and Escobedo on me . Now , just put him in a cell . Morning , Reverend . - Morning , sir . - Good morning . You 'll have to excuse me . I haven 't had a chance to shave . I was told you arrested John Kane this morning . - That 's right . - What for ? - He escaped from a county road gang . - When ? Oh , some years ago . When did you first know about this , Mr Thomas ? Now , look , I don 't have to account to you for my official actions . Well , he 's been here never about a week , and I ... Well , I just received word on the Texas case . Sheriff Ball 's man told John he was under police surveillance several days ago . Why ? I don 't have to tell you that . Because they think he 's an outside agitator come to cause trouble at Hill-Donaldson . Papa . I 'm not making any comment . Mr Thomas , he spent a great deal of time with my niece . John has not been involved with anything here in town . - That 's right , ain 't it , Louisa ? - Yes . Brother John is not at all involved . I 'll be honest with you , Reverend . I 'm holding him on that Texas warrant because I want some information . - Now , how much do you know about him ? - Very little . - I don 't think he 's a Christian . - I don 't mean that . Louisa ... Miss MacGill , is it ? Do you know why he came here ? His sister died , and he had a few days to kill . George ! - George , George ! - Yeah ? You get Calvin and the Oakes boys and Logan Pierce . Tell them to get their tail out to Hill-Donaldson . Mr Thomas , I gotta talk to you . Reverend MacGill , you , too . Get me the highway patrol barracks at Marion . - What is it ? - I tell you , we got a damn mess on our hands . Tarbridge County Sheriff 's Office just called . They found that Charley Gray about three miles outside of Monroe . Dead ? Blew the middle out of him with his own shotgun . - Son of a bitch ! - Reverend MacGill , I gotta talk to you . God rest his soul . Yeah , well , I 'll tell you , God 's gonna be pretty busy . Now , look . White is white and black is black , and I 've always been straight with you . And I 'm going to tell you straight now . I don 't know who killed him , and I 'll swear to that . But if I get him , he 's gonna stand trial . And there ain 't gonna be no phoney jury turn him loose . You believe me ? ... right down through the middle . I believe you . All right . Well , now , your people are going to be damn mad , and I don 't want to have to call in the highway patrol , because those boys are mean , and there 'll be heads busted - and gas and every damn thing . - What do you want me to do ? They ain 't going to believe a damn word I say . I want you to come with me , and Folsom from the Baptist church , and Davis Higbee from the NAACP . And we 'll all go out to the main gate at Hill-Donaldson . I 'm trying to get Perry Kermit out at Hill-Donaldson now . You tell Perry we 'll be out there in about 10 minutes . Did you get the highway patrol batch yet ? No , I 'll get them right away . I gotta tell Lottie Gray . He knew . He knew about Charley . He knew Charley was dead . What you talking about , girl ? Last night , John knew Charley was dead . He listed them , his mother , his father , Sarah and Charley , all dead . Before it happened ? You hush your mouth . You don 't know what you 're talking about . It seemed like a slip . He knew about Charley . You want to get John in more trouble ? Oh , Mr Thomas , how long you going to hold John here ? Just a few days , till I can get the answers I want . Excuse me . - Orly . - Come on home , Louisa . I 've got 12 men here . Will you let me handle this ? Well , just tell them to lay off until ... Damn it , I didn 't ask for any help yet . I do not want them in here . That 's all there is to it . I 've got enough men to handle it myself . I don 't know what 's going to happen if those highway patrol boys come in here . I 've got more than enough to handle it ourselves . No , no , I 'm not . You bet . - Sheriff Ball here . We 've got problems . - Papa . Papa , you go on home and ... Willy ? Hold on , Doc . Say , I 'm glad you come down , Doc . I 've got a drifter over in the back cell with the diarrhoea , and it 's a goddamn mess . I 'll take care of him later . - Who are you looking for , Doc ? - Kane . John Kane . Hey , boy ! Drop your pants . The doctor 's coming . John Kane . Holler up when you want out , Doc . Charley Gray is dead . They just found him . Now , you told Louisa he was dead last night . Now , the trouble is , my boy , Lloyd and Orly Ball are going to think you had something to do with it , 'cause you knew about it beforehand . They 're not going to understand . The weather report on TV says , " Fair and warmer . " Poor Lloyd . He 's hoping you 'd be some kind of foreign agent , so he could run for congress against old Lowery Yaw . Well , I guess maybe you are . It won 't do him any good . I told him what you 've been doing , going all over the world , observing , making records in your journals . Don 't worry , he doesn 't believe me . See , it 's not that I 'm afraid . I 'm about done for anyway . I get sick and tired of lying awake in bed at night , listening to my own arteries harden . I 'll tell you , more than once , I 've thought of running 10 , 15 ccs of morphine into a hypodermic , cutting my losses . But all the same , I do wonder . You see , I brought you into this world . I mean , I kept you alive . When you were six years old , you stepped on a rusty nail . I did that for you . They couldn 't . And so I must be part of whatever the hell it is , and I do wonder . What have you seen ? Oh , I won 't tell anybody . They wouldn 't believe me anyway . What have you seen ? What have you seen ? I 've seen people all over the world . I 've seen death and starvation and cruelty . I 've seen a county road gang in Ludlow , Texas , and beggar children shovelled off the streets of Calcutta into the river , and the fat and sleek oiling their bodies in the sun . I have seen prisons in Africa and China . And I have seen war in Korea , in Sinai , in Biafra , in Vietnam . And I have smelt flesh burning and the stink of excrement when a man is killed and his gut squeezes out the last of life . I have seen people swarming all over the world like maggots on a rotten apple , getting ready to leap off the Earth . First to the moon , and then to the stars . Is that it ? They just don 't want us out there ? Will it be fire ? What 's the difference ? Fire , ice , fallout ... I guess maybe you don 't care . - I care . - I wondered if you did . What do you want from me , Dr Thomas ? I can 't tell you anything . I know . You might just be a paranoid schizophrenic , and I might be a senile psychotic , sharing your delusion . That 's possible . I thought it might be some comfort to you to talk to someone who knew . They kind of stacked the cards against us , didn 't they ? Send you to be born black in a town like this . Was it ... Did they plan that , or was it just the luck of the draw ? It sure come home to roost , didn 't it ? There are certain faces that I would like to see at the appropriate moment . Well , I don 't want to argue the point with you . I 'm just an old man , and when the time comes , I got things in my bag I can take . But I do wonder . Have you seen any ... Have you seen hope ? Improvement ? A chance ? I 've seen what 's there . And what about the innocent ? Children ? Just good people ? Don 't they count ? What about love ? Man isn 't just an animal . He is capable of love . That might not be enough . Lloyd . He 's going to have duck fits . He 's counting on climbing over you to get to Washington . You don 't have to do this . I figure , but I brought you into the world , didn 't I ? And I ought to be here when you go . That makes sense , doesn 't it ? - Willy ! - Right with you , Doc . What will they do ? How long will it be ? When will it come ? Tomorrow ? The day after ? When ? My God , there must be something we can do even now . We won 't be seeing one another again , will we , John ? No , Dr Thomas , we won 't . Goodbye .

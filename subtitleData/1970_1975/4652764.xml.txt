 Dawson , Medical Technician , SHADO HQ . I 'll be on duty in an hour . Earth blast-off , 15 minutes precisely . All personnel for leave report to Control Sphere immediately . 'Will Paul Roper report to Control Sphere immediately ? 'Countdown is proceeding . ' 'Liftoff complete . All read-outs are go . ' - ' Have you made a decision ? ' - The answer 's no . I won 't do it . - ' You 're being stupid . ' - I can 't . Do what you want to . - ' Temper , temper . ' - God , I won 't tell you anything ! - ' There 's always Carol . ' - My wife ? Leave her out of it . Paul ? Paul , is that you ? Paul ? Paul ? - Carol ! - Oh , Paul ! - What happened ? - Oh , it was horrible . When you came in the door , I thought he 'd come back . It 's all right , darling . Come on . It 's all right . Come on . Come on . It 's all right , darling . It 's all right . - Sit down . - I 'm sorry ... Now , calm down , darling . It 's all right . I 'm here . Look , look . Take one of these . Yes . Shouldn 't we phone the police or something ? The police ? Yes , yes . I 'll phone them right away . All right , darling ? Leave the door open ! 'Hello , Roper . How 's your wife ? ' You swine ! All right . You 've convinced me . - I can 't talk now . - ' I 'll call again . ' No . Tomorrow night . 12 o 'clock . My car . I 'll give you all you want . But if you come near my wife again ... Carol ? Hello , darling . How do you feel ? Fine . Ooh , that pill certainly did the trick . Listen . You mustn 't worry about last night . It 's all right now . Thank you , darling . Tea ? - You phoned the police ? - Yes . They came round . You were asleep . They think your scream frightened him off . You did scream ? - Oh , yes . - Well , you can forget it . They caught him a few miles along the road . - What did he want ? - Just an intruder . - They 've been after him . - Will they want a statement ? I don 't know . Maybe not . It 's an open-and-shut case . Look , darling , I 've got to go . I 'll ring you . - Are you sure you 'll be all right ? - Yes , really . Bye . Bye , darling . Drink your tea . 807 Roper for debriefing tests , Doctor . Thank you . This way , Roper . I assume you 're familiar with this test ? It measures how much strain goes into your decisions . Yes . It 's amazing how hard we work , even on simple decisions , like whether to have a cup of coffee . This is your monitor here . On big decisions , the stress can render a man useless . Right . All set ? Start the test . Stop ! Thank you , Roper . Paul ! Just the man I was looking for . - Me ? - To ask you to come for a drink . Oh , no , I ... I 'll take a rain check on that . - Something on your mind ? - Oh , these kid 's games . - The debriefing tests ? That 's not like you . - Maybe I 'm getting old . - They 're not for amusement . - Forget it . I 've got to ring Carol . - How is she ? - She 's fine . Fine . Look , I 'll see you later for that drink , Alec . OK ? Sure . See you . Oh , Doctor , how did Roper make out in the decision stress ? Too early to say for certain , but he seemed ... Well , he seemed a bit strung out . Indications of supernumerary stress during his last tour of duty . - Any ideas ? - Not at this stage . Could be anything : boredom , misses his wife ... See you . - Ready ? - Ready . Hold it . I can 't take you out looking like that ! What do you mean ? ! People might say , " Why 's that beautiful girl with that old wreck ? " Well , don 't worry . I 'll tell them I married you for your money . - They didn 't ring . - Who ? The police . Come on , cradle-snatcher . I 'm hungry . Well , what do they say ? Not good . The stress decision tests are positive . Signs of anxiety , traces of tension and traces of neurosis . The observers report similar findings . Decision-making below par , reflexes bad , impetuosity , nervousness . - I don 't believe it . - It 's all down here . He 's an out-and-out risk , Alec . We can 't take chances . - I 've known Paul Roper for years . - Look at the facts , Alec . The man 's a mess . I don 't know why . Check him . Lovely evening , darling . Thank you . - Hey , I 'm not Cinderella , you know . - What ? Don 't drive so fast . I don 't have to be home by tonight . Sorry . Don 't be long . - I thought I saw someone . - What ? It 's nothing . We 're both tired . It 's nothing . Come on , I 'll see you into the house . All right ? Come on . All right now ? Yes , fine . Thanks , darling . I 'll put the car away . All right to close the door ? - ' Roper ? ' - Yes . - ' The calculations ? ' - All right . - But you must never contact me or my wife again . / - OK , on those conditions . - Ready ? - Begin . 42 degrees , 2 minutes , angle 84 . 58 degrees , 7 minutes , angle 65 . Go down 2 . '68 degrees , 7 minutes ... 'Position , 33 degrees . 'Down 2 . 'Alternate coordinates : 2742 . 'Now down 3 ... ' 'For the last time , Roper , I want answers . 'Who are they ? What did you tell them ? 'What do they want ? 'Come on , come on . ' You 're pushing him too hard . We 've got to make him talk , Alec . Let 's try another angle . Money ? - No . - Blackmail ? - I don 't see it . - Threats , violence ? - His wife , maybe . - All right . - Tell me about her . - Carol ? She 's young , attractive . Roper 's crazy about her . - I could understand ... - Understand ? ! Can 't you see ... ? That he 's a traitor ? I know that . But it 's a matter of degree . Degree nothing . It 's what he told them that matters , not why . Well , you say he 's crazy about his wife . We 'll see just how crazy . 'OK , Roper , take it from the beginning . Just a moment , Doctor . 'All right , Roper , so it 's your wife . 'Naturally , you don 't want to see her get hurt . 'You think by keeping quiet , you 'll be able to protect her . 'You tell us what we want to know , 'that 's the best way to give her protection . ' ' ... 7 minutes . Position , 33 degrees . 'Go down 2 . 'Alternate coordinates : 2742 . 'Now go down 3 ... ' Numbers , angles ... What do they mean , Roper ? I was given programme numbers for SID , told to feed in information , memorise the results . So , we 've got a batch of data , but how do we apply it ? I can give you the data , not the significance . You didn 't know what you 're doing when you gave those figures ? ! No . Then we 're going to have to put everything into finding out . - Get me Commander Straker . - Yes , Lieutenant . Keep working on it , Lieutenant . Is there any deal from SID ? So far , we 've got a series of 3-D direction indicators . What does that mean ? It 's a navigation course in three dimensions , for some sort of space vehicle to steer . - ' A UFO ? ' - Could be . Well , as you say , Lieutenant , it 's not much , but maybe it 's a start . Let me know the moment you have anything . Flight path ... But to where ? Now , let 's see what we 've got . Some sort of a flight path ... And the fact that they chose Roper to do their dirty work . Why ? 1 ) because he had access to SID and understood its operation . 2 ) they knew he was vulnerable where his wife was concerned . He 's told us all he knows . Except who his contact was . Who was on the other end of that phone ? I want a yellow alert on all SHADO installations . - ' Yes , sir . ' - Let him go , Alec . - What ? - Let Roper go in one hour 's time . - ' Your key is still down . ' - Oh , thank you . Neat . You 've let the whole base know we 're releasing Roper in an hour . Yes . I 've been thinking about Roper 's contact , Alec . Whoever he is , he would have to be able to radio Moonbase . He 'd know Roper 's movements on earth , have access to his records . There 's only one answer . You mean someone on this base ? Yes . Someone on this base . Let him go , Alec . We must draw them out into the open . OK . Roger , I 've got that . One moment , Moonbase . Lieutenant Ellis for you , sir . - Straker . - I 've had Joan work on the figures . 'What does she make of them ? ' - They 're planetary positions . - ' For which planets ? ' Considering the urgency , we had to make an educated guess . All right , educate me . The relative position of the sun , moon and earth fits Roper 's figures . One snag : the last set of information is a time reference , but still doesn 't make sense . It 's enough to scare the daylights out of me . Keep working on it . Out . Did you swing this ? It seems suspect . If Straker says you can go , don 't ask questions . - But he 's not the forgiving type . - Don 't push your luck . Just go . Sir , you wanted to know when Roper left . - Do you mean he 's gone already ? - Yes , sir . My orders were to release him in one hour 's time . - Yes , but Colonel Freeman ... - I see . Signal a maximum security alert and get Carlin on Skydiver . Right , sir . Attention , all defence systems . This is a maximum security alert . Attention , all defence systems . 'This is a maximum security alert , condition red . ' 'Instructions received and understood . Standing by . ' 'This is Straker . We are faced with a probable UFO attack 'against an unknown target . 'Until further notice , all SHADO defensive vehicles remain on alert . ' Maximum security alert operational . Captain Carlin is standing by . - Captain Carlin ? Straker . - Carlin . Reading you . 'Launch Sky 1 for possible interception . ' - Area ? - ' Green , 0B . 'Make a 20-mile radius sweep around SHADO HQ . ' Sounds close to home , Sr. What 's going on ? 'That 's our problem , Captain . Concentrate on being ready . Out . ' - Launch stations . - Yes , sir . Clear 1 . - 1 clear . - Clear 2 . Check boosters . 'Have relocated UFO in area 427 blue . - Get me Captain Carlin immediately . - Yes , sir . SHADO Control to Sky One . - ' Carlin , it 's Straker . ' - Receiving you . 'Suspect driving east on Route 4 in SHADO car . Follow and observe . ' Roger . Out . Sky 1 to SHADO Control . I 'm positioned over target area . 'Building below destroyed . Can see no sign of life . ' Request UFO fix , attack coordinates . 'Roger , Sky 1 . ' Right . Right . They 're bringing him in now , sir . Thank you . Hold it a moment . All right , Paul ? Yeah . I 'm fine . 'Maintain surveillance for SHADO medic Dawson . ' This is a war , Alec . People have to be at risk . I don 't buy that and I never will . It 's too complicated for people like me . And too simple for people like you . Well , how is Roper ? Conscious . He 'll be all right . - He gave us two wrong figures . - Two wrong figures ? Yes . Must have been a memory lapse due to the strain he was under . We got our figures from the tape . That means the aliens have the same false information . Yes . We finally managed to sort it out about an hour ago . Would have taken them about ... five minutes ? I realise that . But they obviously thought he did it on purpose . - It could have cost him his life . - It could cost him his wife . Carol . Stay here . I 'll send guards to his house . We 've just passed the Rampton Flyover . ETA Roper 's house , 6 minutes . 'Data and figures from flight plan 'passed to aliens by Roper have been analysed . 'Input information incorrect . 'Result negative . ' - What do you make of it , Joan ? - Nothing . Straker won 't buy that . Re-run it . It won 't alter the result , Lieutenant . Permutate it differently . If you insist , Lieutenant . Dawson died 10 minutes ago . Yes . Shotgun makes quite a mess . The doctors found this . It 's some sort of electronic probe . It had been inserted into his temple . Well , I think the picture is almost complete . Come over here , Alec . Watch this . Here . There ! - Sunrise on the moon . - Exactly . That 's how they plan to make the attack . Flying across the lunar horizon at sunrise , keeping between Moonbase and the sun . - Visually undetectable . - Totally . But it would be picked up by radar as soon as it crossed the horizon . Not if the attack coincided with heavy sunspot activity , like that predicted in two days ' time and with Roper 's flight plan to guide the attacker . - Moonbase wouldn 't stand a chance . - Chance ? We have Roper 's flight plan too , remember ? - I don 't see how we can stop it . - One man on his own at a pre-determined position on the moon surface , a rocket launcher , polarised visor ... It 'd be suicide . - Possibly . - You can 't expect a man ... - I don 't need a volunteer , Alec . - You mean Roper ? And I suppose you used this to twist his arm . I didn 't have to . He 's doing it to try and even the score . - When are you going to tell him ? - Maybe he 'll never need to know . Right . One hour . Now , once you 're outside , maintain radio silence . One favour . I couldn 't tell Carol , my wife . If you could book an earth call , either way ... You know what I mean . I 'll sort things out when you get back . - ' All set ? ' - All set . 'Good . Begin stage one . Oh , Roper , good luck . ' Safety check 1 . Safety check 1 . Prepare for exit procedure . Good luck , Paul . Depressurized . Open outer doors . Stand by for exit . Is there any chance of the radar trackers operating ? Not with this sunspot activity . 'The time is now 075,49 . 'Sunrise is in 10 minutes . 'This is Moonbase timecheck at 07,6 precisely . ' Roper 's on his own . 23 seconds since sunup , Lieutenant . UFO destroyed . He 's done it . Get a Moon Hopper out there fast . Right . Losing a little air . 'Damage ... only slight . ' Paul , is everything all right ? 'Yeah ... Sure . ' Listen . A Moon Hopper is on its way . It 'll be with you in minutes . 'Fine . ' Tell ... Tell Straker ... Tell ... I hope ... this evens things up . - Paul ... - ' Tell ... ' Car ... Car ... Carol ... - ' Carol ... ' - Paul ? Roper ! Roper ? !

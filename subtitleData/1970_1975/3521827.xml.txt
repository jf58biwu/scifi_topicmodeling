 - We 've got to get out of here . - Simon , how can we ? I don 't know but we 've got to . We 've somehow slipped into the future and we 're not going to stick around to be guinea pigs in their experiment . - Will the the time barrier still be there ? - Look ! If we wear these when we 're on the ice , we won 't collapse again . Ah , Dr Bukov , I wanted to ask you about Liz and Simon . - You discovered them on the ice ? - Yes , Beth . And there was no indication that they could have come from the drop shelter ? There 's nowhere else they could have come from . I 'd better have another word with them . Get the door open ! We 'll have to make a dash for it . ( Simon ) Not that door , fathead ! No ! Simon ! I won 't ! Mu ... Hey , you two , what do you think you 're doing ? Stop ! - Come back ! - ( Door sliding ) ( Wind howling ) Pull yourself together ! But Simon , you know who was in that room ? It was Mummy ! Thank heavens , the barrier . It 's still here . Get your suit off . Liz ! Simon ! It 's all right . We 're back in our own time . - Yes . - What 's the matter ? - l told you I saw Mummy in that room . - You were imagining it . No , I saw her. I know I did . But , Liz , it 's not really possible , is it ? - lsn 't it ? - That was the future in there . 1990 . - l know . - This is only 1970 . You made a mistake . I didn 't. lt was Mummy . Now , look , don 't cry . Crying 's weak-minded . It 's all a bit weird , I know , but we 'll find the answer . We 'll try , anyway . All right , Simon . Thank you . You 're so nice to me . I 'm not . What makes you say a stupid thing like that ? Because it 's true. I know you like to pretend you 're weak , but you 're not . Now , look . It was just such a shock , Simon , seeing Mummy in a place like that . Come on . Oh , it 's extraordinary . This time I don 't know whether to believe you or not . It 's true , Daddy . We went into the future . 1990 . There was this place called the ice Box . They were doing queer scientific experiments . - They weren 't queer , just ... - Just advanced , Simon ? Yes . For one thing , they 'd perfected brain-computer links . That was in 1985 . At the moment , brain-computer links aren 't talked about in science . All right , then . How do people get into the future ? How exactly is it managed ? - You say I was there , Liz ? - Yes , Mummy . - ln this ice Box in the Antarctic ? - Yes . Well , darling , how ? Why ? Was I alone ? What about Daddy ? Come on. I want to know . How do people get into the future ? When you explained about the children going into the past , you said it was because energy had been released and triggered off their hallucinations . You can 't say that about the future . It hasn 't happened . No , so we 'd have to think in terms of possible energy . - Possible energy ? - Possible or potential . - Energy that is released in the future . - Doesn 't make sense . - Doesn 't it ? - Of course not . How could energy that hasn 't been released have an effect on people now ? The fact that they went into the future explains why Mrs Skinner lost touch . - l don 't see that . - You 're a telepath . You can communicate with other minds , but only in your own time . Or in a time that you 've known , such as 1940 . To communicate with minds in the future , you need a different gift . A thing called precognition , or second sight , as you would probably call it . ( Chuckles ) What scrapes you two get into . But really , I don 't understand how I could be in this ice Box in 1990 . Goodness me , I 'd be a very old lady then . No , Mummy . That 's the funny thing . You looked just as you look now . - Oh . That would be the effect of HA57 . - Of what ? HA57 . That 's a longevity drug they told us they 'd been developing . It means that you don 't age . He 's barmy. lf he was older , I 'd say he 'd been on the bottle . - Frank . - That 's what they told us . A drug that prevented you from ageing . It was worked out by the director . A man called Devereaux . Devereaux ? What was his Christian name ? Oh . M ... Morgan . Morgan C Devereaux . Director of Experimentation . That was the name on his door . This is all beginning to be fascinating . - lt 's giving me a pain . - Frank . For heaven 's sake , Jean . The children are back safe and sound . The questions about 1940 have been answered. lsn 't that enough ? Can 't we leave the whole business alone ? Scientific Ice Box . Yes , I think I 'm beginning to understand . A place apart where new techniques could be tried out . New developments initiated . A place constructed around the progress of science , with a major scientist in command , to direct the experimentation . Fascinating . And you 're beginning to find it all quite fascinating , too , aren 't you Simon ? You seem to have observed rather a lot in this laboratory of the future . - And science is your subject , isn 't it ? - Yes . - No . - What do you mean ? You 're working round to say the children must go back to this place. lt 's not on . - Oh , my dear fellow . - The last one did us the world of good . - This could be worse . - What makes you think so ? Because I feel it . Jean not able to keep in touch with them , an atmosphere that sounds ... I don 't know what it sounds like . - The progress of science ... - We know all about that . What did our little investigation into 1940 teach me ? Except that I 'd been mug enough to get in the way of one of your developments and been made to suffer for it ever since . So you can 't expect any sympathy from me for the progress of science . No , Commander , we 're going home . My family and me and Simon . Leaving St Oswald and the time bubble for good . I should be back at the usual time , but if old Cooper calls , do you mind ... Yes , Frank , I know . Try and persuade those kids to do something to amuse themselves today . - They must be bored silly . - Simon may have to go home . Oh , well , anyway . Bye , Jean . Bye-bye , dear . Simon , I dreamt about the ice Box again last night . Why would Mummy be there ? Not that again . I 've told you , I don 't know . Well , why don 't you know ? Forget about it . We can 't go back , so what 's the good of talking about it ? I see . What 's the good of talking about anything to you ? I 'm tired of the ice Box . You 've always got so much to say . Fantastic conversation we have . You sparkle from dawn till dark . I would if I had someone decent to talk to . You squash everything I say . You 're a wet blanket . I am not . You turn everything sour . I 'm too kind to you . You said yourself at the barrier . - Never mind what I said . - Didn 't you mean it ? I hope you didn 't cos l 'm sick of all this . Sick of going off into other times and being told what to do . Sick of you . ( Doorbell ) - Good morning , Mrs Skinner . - Commander Traynor . I hope it 's not too early. I was anxious to catch your husband before work . I 'm afraid he 's gone . I tell you what . How about a film today ? - l don 't want to go to a stuffy cinema . - There 's a good double feature on . One by Renoir . Another by Jean-Luc Godard . - Oh , no . Films in French and with you . - ( Jean ) You 're not to go in there . - Morning , Simon , Liz . - Commander Traynor . I asked you not to . I know what you want . You want the children to go into the time bubble . My husband has forbidden it . I may sit down , I take it ? I haven 't had any coffee yet . We know they can 't come to any harm . That isn 't the point . Frank 's against it and so am I . - Are you sure ? - Yes . Come , now . Surely you must be anxious to know what you 're doing at a research establishment at the South Pole in the future . Almost as anxious as Liz is . That 's unfair . Of course there are mysteries . Everyone admits it . But we 're not concerned about them any more . Can 't you understand ? Your loyalty to your husband is touching . It 's nothing to do with Frank . I came to the same conclusion . It 's a simple matter of making up one 's own mind . - No , it isn 't . - l 'm sorry . It 's a matter of making up several minds , like Simon 's . - What about Simon ? - Well , my boy , that longevity drug , eh ? All sorts of intriguing developments . Commander Traynor , stop talking to the children like this . You want them to go back so they can find out things that will be of use to you . I can hardly deny that. lf we know the future course of science , we can start plotting the graph . - You want information for yourself . - Oh , really ? If Simon discovers the longevity drug 's secret and gives it to you . - Mrs Skinner . - There 's nothing to talk about . Liz is our child and she 'll do as we say . Simon 's under our care till his father sends for him , so that 's an end to it . You look forward to your future life with equanimity , then , I take it ? Strange life , enclosed in an Antarctic ice Box . No , I 'm not going to talk about it . If you 'll excuse me , I 've got a lot to do . - Can I come and help ? - Thank you , Liz . When you 've finished your coffee , I 'll see you out . Well . Rather sad , don 't you think , Simon , that we shan 't find out ? Oh , I don 't know , sir . You surprise me . I thought you 'd be on my side . I 'm not on anybody 's side . I 'm just puzzled . I didn 't like the ice Box much . It was a creepy sort of place . That 's an unscientific attitude . Yes , but come to think of it , it 's just about the right word to use for it . Creepy . Simon , you mentioned the director of the ice Box earlier . - Morgan C Devereaux ? - That 's right . - You 're certain ? - That was the name on his door . This is very interesting . Devereaux was the world 's leading authority on biology for several years . - You mean in our time ? - Yes . Well , he invented HA57 , so I suppose after that he dosed himself on it first . Yes , yes , quite , but I wonder how ? What 's the difficulty about that ? In June of last year , Morgan C Devereaux died . Oh , yes , no doubt about it . He was a close friend of mine . I attended his funeral . - Well , Simon , sure in your mind ? - Yes , Commander , quite sure . The Skinners will play hell . I shall be in terrible trouble . Probably finish up in clink on an abduction charge . Look , I want to go back now . It wasn 't only what you said . But there are things I 've got to know about . Exactly . A scientist at heart . - Anyway , I think Liz is fed up with me . - Why ? She 's says one thing one minute and another thing the next . Women , dear boy , women . Even when they say the same thing to you all the time , they mean the opposite . You like Liz , eh ? - Like her ? - Mm . Oh , I don 't know . Just now I got the idea that ... Forget it . Well , Simon , a man has his work . You bring back anything you can and Liz will be proud of you . Yes , I suppose so . - Good luck , son . - Goodbye . See you in jail . You took him back to St Oswald ? Let him go into the time bubble in spite of what I said . Let 's not get into a state. I had very little to do with it . The boy insisted . - l don 't believe you . - Mrs Skinner . He would never do it without telling me unless you pressured him . - l should never have left you alone . - Why did you ? Frank , I was more concerned for Liz . I had to stay with her . You mean he tried to persuade her , too ? There 's no need for all this anxiety . You 're making me out to be some sort of Svengali . I 'm interested in what people want to do themselves . Simon has an inquiring mind . You must realise that . He needs to know the answers to puzzling questions . Right , Liz ? What ? Doesn 't Simon fret until he 's found the solution to a vexing problem ? Oh , yes . He never stops trying to work things out . You 've put me in a nice spot , haven 't you ? What do I tell his father ? He shouldn 't be gone more than a day or two . You don 't think I 'm going to let you get away with it ? No . Knowing the man you are , I imagine you 'll want to hit back . I 'm glad you realise it . - l 'm going to telephone the police . - Frank . - Frank . - Don 't you think I have a right to ? You have the right . Nobody doubts that . The only question is can you bring it off ? - The facts will speak for themselves . - What are they ? I kidnapped a member of your household and projected him into the future . A boy has gone missing but is unlikely to be found because he 's in the year 1990 . If any such hare-brained notions are put to me , I shall deny them outright . Say it was a fabrication on your part . The unfortunate result of a war injury . Commander , I 've always known you were ruthless . They said I 'd be prime minister if I didn 't get hanged first . - This is more than I 'm prepared to take . - ( Frank ) Forget it . He doesn 't care whom he hurts as long as he gets his own way . He 'd kill someone if he had to . - lt 's time he knew what we think of him . - Stop it ! All you 're worrying about are yourselves , but Simon 's back in that awful place . That awful place . We can 't dismiss it as easily as that , can we , Mrs Skinner ? We 're all involved . Liz . - What 's happening ? - Nothing. I 'm all right , Daddy . Oh , no , you 're not . What 's the matter ? Why did you start crying like that ? Who 's crying ? Here . I 'm not crying . It 's nothing , really . Simon can go where he wants , can 't he ? Anywhere . Look , the only reason I didn 't want the two of you to go back was because I thought we 'd all had enough of it and it might be dangerous . But it isn 't . Mr Traynor says we can 't come to any harm . Well , we don 't know that , do we ? But Mummy 's there , isn 't she ? Do you honestly believe that 's so ? I saw her . Anyhow , Simon can be a fool at times . I know he studies a lot and knows things nobody else would want to know , but he 's not much good at looking after himself . Last time he depended on me a lot . You mind very much what happens to Simon , don 't you , darling ? I see . So the world changes and my little girl suddenly becomes a big girl . - No . - Oh , it 's a fact . So it looks as if this is something we shall have to discuss , whether we like it or not . I don 't understand it . Liz seems simply to have disappeared . All the boy Simon will say is that he 's been for a walk . Hah . Been for a walk . - That 's strange , isn 't it ? - lt 's more than strange . They really are a most unusual pair of volunteers . You say they just vanished into thin air out there on the ice ? Yes . I want you to know I take a most serious view of all this , Simon . You 're a volunteer here , but we expect everyone to have a gravity of purpose . - We serve science . Check ? - Check , sir . Now , back to your companion . Director to computer . Field report on missing volunteer . Radar and beam code check . Hm . I hope we 're not put in the position of requesting a new volunteer . We should be starting on the AB experiment almost at once . I feel privileged to be here . I 've admired your work for a long time . - l beg your pardon ? - Your work is terrific . - What does a kid know about my work ? - l read everything about science . I got interested through the works of Charles Traynor . - Traynor ? - Yes . Traynor . Traynor , wait a minute . A couple of decades ago , minor physicist or something . - Don 't you know more about him ? - Why should I ? Well , I thought he said he was ... I mean , wasn 't he a friend of yours once ? - Are you all right ? - Yes , sir . Then kindly stop babbling , will you ? Traynor means nothing to me . I 've barely heard of the man . We 'll take another check . Mummy . Mummy ? Mummy , what 's wrong ? It 's me . Liz . No . Don 't come near me . What 's the matter ? You 're not real . You can 't be . Mummy , don 't. lt 's all right. lt 's only me . I thought I saw you before at the door , but I told myself I was imagining it . We came through the time barrier . Simon and me . Simon ? Simon Randall ? Yes . You remember how we used to be able to go in and out of the time barrier . This time it 's brought us here . - You 're not here. lt 's not possible . - Why not ? Jean , the director asked me to ask you ... Why are you here ? I thought you 'd gone . - Don 't hurt her . - She had no right to come . Leave her alone . She came through the time barrier . Just as you were able to do once . - Just as she was able to do ? - Yes , Liz . Try to understand . Beth is you . You when grown-up . You 're one and the same person . Two people , but my only daughter - the trick the time barrier 's played on us .

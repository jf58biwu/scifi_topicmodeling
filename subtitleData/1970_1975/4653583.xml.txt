 - " A " circuits ? - Check . - Primary boosters . - Check . 'Ship 534 to Moonbase commander . - Go ahead , 534 . - Approaching earthly re-entry and feeling blue . All right for Saturday night , darling ? 'Your communication 's against standard procedure . ' And yes , it 's still all right for Saturday . Now that 's more like it . Ship 534 from Moonbase approaching re-entry . Normal pattern . 534 . That 's Craig Collins , isn 't it ? - Yes , sir . - Have him call me when he gets down . Yes , sir . - Pilot reports fire in cabin , sir . - Let me in there . - Craig , this is Ed . How bad is it ? - I can 't tell . It 's just a lot of smoke and it seems to be getting worse . Try cutting your " Q " circuits . - SID reporting three alien craft . - No good , the heat 's building up . - Sighting confirmed . - ' Warning lights are on . ' 'Aliens five million miles , closing at SOL 8 . ' Hold on , Craig . Back in a minute . Stay with him . Yes , sir . 'Range 4 million miles , closing .

'I 've been hit . 'Stop operations . ' Morning , Miss Holland . Good morning , Mr Strake . Miss Holland ! Yes , sir . I ordered this file transferred to the morgue . - Why is it still here ? - Sir , it isn 't certain . You know space personnel are presumed dead 48 hours after failure to re-enter . - But it ... - Miss Holland ! Craig Collins was one of my closest friends . We were astronauts together . We have enough to worry about without trying to keep the dead alive . Please get it out of here . Let 's get this straight before he gets here . When it comes to SID 's brains , Craig knows more than anybody , so as of now , he 's on the project . All I 'm saying is that Craig Collins and I ... Your feelings for him are your own problem . - Just tell me who 's in charge . - Well , overall , you are . But when it comes to SID 's engineering , Craig is God . Straker . - ' Colonel Collins to see you , sir . ' - Send him right in . - Craig ! - Hi there , Ed ! - Good to see you . - It 's good to see you , too . Mind you , it 's good to see anybody after 8 weeks of jungle cats . - John . - Craig . - Well , come on . What happened ? - I don 't know . I sort of lost consciousness on re-entry and then I came to and I was floating down over the sea . We went smash into the sea and I got out and swam ashore before she sank . Tell your boffins that their survival course really works . Colonel Grey , thank you . See you later . You heard what happened , Craig . I had no choice . Yeah . I would have done exactly the same . Sure . Hello , master ! I 'm just off to Moonbase to get things started . What ? I thought we 'd go together tomorrow . There 's a lot to do here . I thought I 'd be more use up there , and besides , I have , shall we say , a little unfinished business to attend to . So if you 'll excuse me , I 'll see you later . - Hi , Craig . - Hi , Nina . - Good to see you , Craig . - Thank you . - Missing the jungle , Craig ? - Not with you tigers around ! Craig . I was so glad when I heard . It takes more than a little barbecue to fry me . Oh , dear . I 'm sorry . I do hope I haven 't cracked a rib . I just don 't know what came over me . Well , Foster . Nice to see you again . I 'm glad you 've been keeping an eye on things for me - while I 've been away . - I can 't say I know what you mean . - Come on , course you do . - Craig ! How about getting this old jungle cat a cup of coffee , - now that he has returned ? - All right . - If it 's all right with you , Foster . - Yeah . See you later . Still making it with moon dust , I see . I wanted to say ... that there 's , um , no reason to feel guilty about anything . I don 't feel guilty , Craig . I cried a little when I thought you were dead . After a while , I stopped crying . - People do . - Yes , they do . And we weren 't exactly Romeo and Juliet . Virginia ... Ginnie , you make it ... I mean , you make it very hard for a man . All he wants to say is , no hard feelings . I 'm sorry . If that 's what you 're really trying to say . What else would I do ? How was the jungle ? I tell you one thing , there was no one there who looked like you . You know , I used to lie there at night and look up at the old moon and I 'd say to myself , " You know something ? " Old Ginnie 's up there " . I did think about you . Did you ? You mean there 's still a chance for this singed old astronaut ? I never said there wasn 't . It 's just that I resent you looking upon me as your property . Now you know ... I 'd never do that . You didn 't leave the jungle . You brought it back with you ! You wanted to see me , master ? What 's this request for a two-man mission ? Fixing SID is a two-man job . I need a partner . I want Foster . Why Foster ? He 's the only man available with the necessary know-how . Also , he 's got the basic astro-training . I know he 's rusty but I reckon I can lick him into shape in time . - Is that the only reason ? - Why else would I want him ? All right , you 've got him . Thank you , sir . Yes , sir . Please , sir . You ran a computer check on my relationship with Craig - a long time ago . - I know . The read-out said it would not affect my efficiency . And two weeks ago we ran one on you and Foster - and it said the same . - So why the inquisition ? Yesterday we ran one on you and Craig and Foster . The computer seemed to think a triangle was the nastiest emotional shape there is . You can tell the computer to relax . There is no triangle . Who got dropped ? - Craig . - May I ask why ? That is my business . Come on , old man . You can do better than that . Come on . Come on . Come on . - 15 ? - Oxygen . - 16 ? - Altitude ! - 17 ? - Boosters ! - 1,014 ? - Cooling system . - 33 ? - Digital count . - 943 ? - Retro rockets . - 5 ? - Helium ratio . - 517 ? - Abort button ! Wrong , wrong , wrong ! Sorry . Sorry 's just not good enough , old man . Sorry can kill . When we 're up there , I don 't want to be sorry . I want you to be right . Let 's try that again . All right ? All right . Come on , come on . - 200 ! - Manual control . - Is Ginnie in there , darling ? - Yes , she is . Thank you . Good evening , my lord . How about a little game of chess ? You 're a glutton for punishment . You 've never won a game with me . How about a little bet ? You want to throw your money away ? Shall we say ... 50 ? If that 's what you want . - You take the white . - All right . You ready ? - You really wanna play that move ? - Just get on with it , Collins . Checkmate . That 's 50 I owe you . I 'll let you have your revenge tomorrow . We 're due on earth tomorrow . I 'll ... I 'll take my revenge when we get back here . Anything you like . I thought we 'd been through all this yesterday . You told me you dropped Collins . You didn 't tell me you hated him . Who says I hate him ? Virginia , I was watching your face when he came in . People do move away from each other sometimes , you know ? Look , Collins is on a vital mission . If there 's ... If there 's anything you know about him , his attitude , state of mind , anything . It 's your duty to tell me . He 's different . You 're trying to tell me that because he beat you at chess he 's a psychotic ? Come on , John . What are you , a sore loser ? No , it 's not just that . It 's the way he 's been riding Foster . He 's training Foster for a tough mission , not for a game of ping pong . Foster has to shape up . And Virginia Lake ? Virginia Lake is a girl who fell out of love . Look , I know he 's a friend of yours , but all I 'm saying is that what he went through in that jungle . Dr Adams : full clearance . Dr Jackson : full clearance . Dr Blouden : full clearance . All those reports have been computerised . - Full clearance . - Computers aren 't God . Are you , John ? I just have an instinct about him . Just now you implied my friendship with Craig could warp my judgment . Just make sure that your personal feelings don 't bend yours . Blastoff for SID 's in 5 days . You going to be ready ? I 've just about finished down here . I 've got one or two things still to do at Moonbase . - We go back there tomorrow . - Right . Excuse me , can you direct me to " D " stage ? Yes , of course . It 's over there . Take the second turning on the right . - Oh , thanks . Mr Grey , isn 't it ? - That 's right , Sir Esmond . Yes . I never forget a voice . And who ... - Come along , Charles . - Yes , sir . Can 't have you standing about all day . There 's something I 've forgotten to do . - I 'll catch up with you later . - Very well , master . Sir Esmond ! Excuse me ! Excuse me , Sir Esmond , I couldn 't help noticing . Something seemed to upset you back there . It was nothing . It was just one of those inexplicable moments , like walking over a grave . - Well , if there 's nothing I can do . - That 's very kind . How about that game of chess ? No , thanks . I 'm tired . I 'm going to turn in . All right . See you tomorrow , master . Get me Straker . - Where 's Commander Straker ? - ' He isn 't in the building , sir . 'I can put out a trace for him if it 's urgent . ' " ' ... warp my judgment . " " Just be careful , John , that personal feelings don 't bend yours . " 'Shall I put out a trace for him , sir ? ' No . No , don 't bother . Central computers , please . - Control panel , terminals 4 and 5 ? - Power supply . - 11 , 12 ? - Cooling system . - 21 , 22 ? - They stop at 20 . You know something , old man , I think you 're gonna make it . I know I 'm gonna make it , old man . You didn 't invent efficiency . Oh , dear . We 're getting uptight , are we ? I know just the thing for that ... old man . Nothing like heaving a few ... weights around ... for sweating out the tension . After you 've lifted a couple of hundred , it makes even you begin to look human . Well , why don 't we try 225 ? All right . But that 's my lot . I 'm not pushing for the bandiest astronaut title . Look out ! Are you all right ? What do you think ? You clown . How bad is it ? There 's a rib gone . The right tibia 's cracked . - He 'll be strapped up a fortnight . - No ! - What the hell were you doing ? - It was a mistake . The mission goes in two days and you knock out the only man qualified to fly with you ... some mistake ! There is another man equipped to fly the mission with me . Who would that be ? Ed Straker . He and I put SID out there in the first place . You can 't go with a man who 's unstable ! He 's only unstable in your mind ! What can I do ? Cancel the mission ? - Leave earth undefended ? - Train somebody else to go with you . There isn 't time ! Collins is right . I 'll go . I said I 'll go ! Two nights ago he tried to kill me . He what ? He blew the pressure in my sleep sphere . That incident was reported as a mechanical failure . And why didn 't you tell me immediately that happened ? Because I can 't be completely certain . Do you have one piece of tangible evidence ? No , not yet . All right . My top priority is to get SID back into commission . I 've no alternative and ... that 's what I 'm gonna do . You 'll have to look after things while I 'm gone . I 've doubled the alert readiness on Moonbase and I suggest you do the same thing here . The weather at the Cape is clear , the countdown looks good . I hope they 've got those transducers I asked for . Yes , Colonel Grey is taking care of it . Say , Craig , what is it with you and him ? I don 't know . It 's , you know , chemical . Just one of those things . I just wanted to check and make sure there 's nothing we 've overlooked in Collins ' clearance tests . No . He passed all the regulation tests perfectly . - All the regulation tests ? - Yes . Are there any others ? - Officially , no . - But ? I 've been pursuing a line of research . Nothing official . Just an idea of my own . I call this an isolator . What does it do ? It cuts you off from all outside influences : sound , heat , light , microwaves , even cosmic rays . I wanted to study the effect on the brain of a total absence of stimuli . What has this got to do with Collins ? One of the things I do is record the brain 's electrical patterns , both inside and outside this cabinet . Well ? Usually , there is very little difference . - Doctor , please get to the point ! - All right . Now , that 's the kind of pattern I usually get . That 's one of my colleagues . That 's the pattern outside the isolator , that 's the pattern inside . Now I 'm going to show you Collins . That 's Collins outside the isolator , that 's Collins inside . - What 's your conclusion ? - It 's too early to have one . I 've got central computers on it now . Have you told anyone else ? There 's nothing to tell . It 's a purely unofficial experiment . When do you expect your computer analysis ? - Probably late tonight . - Call me as soon as you get it . If I 'm not at home , I 'll be at Collins ' apartment . Hello , Craig . Hello , master . Please enter . I 'm afraid I can 't spare you much time . Ed and I are flying off to the Cape in an hour . Did you know we still haven 't located your ship ? - The one you crashed in . - Really ? Are you sure the map reference you gave us was the right one ? I was pretty groggy . Could have been one mile , two miles either way . Do you remember anything more about what happened ? No . My mind is very much of a blank still . - Don 't you find that worrying ? - No ! No . - I 'm still the same fella , you know . - Are you , Craig ? - What 's that supposed to mean ? - Virginia thinks you 've changed . - Virginia 's just ... - And you give blind men the creeps . Are you out of your mind ? And you tried to kill me . Now , what the devil are you talking about ? - Jackson did a test on you . - He does lots of tests . One in particular , where he put you in a cabinet . Yes . What about it ? When you were inside that cabinet , you were isolated from all communication of any kind , - even radio waves . - Really ? Inside that cabinet , your brain pattern stopped . You were inert . A nothing . A body without a will . Now , look . I know that you have never liked me . I think the aliens snatched you out there . I think they burned out the personality centres of your brain and then programmed you so that they could control you with radio waves . I think they sent you back here as a kind of guided missile ... to kill Ed Straker . Now , if that is really the case , master , then you 're wasting your time , aren 't you ? I mean , you can 't reason with a robot . - ' Colonel Grey ? ' - Speaking . The computer confirms : Collins has had surgery . I 'll be right over . # Dum-da-dum # Here we go into the bright blue yonder # Dum-da-dum , da-da-dum ... # Here we go again , old man . Not so much of the old , if you don 't mind . - After you . - Thank you . 'We have a range of 1 , 2 , 3 ... ' 'Roger . 'Data correct . Count continues . ' 'Countdown proceeding normally . 'Liftoff : minus five . ' 'Coordinates correct . Shut down inner valves ... ' I hope I can still drive one of these things . Yes , so do I. 'We have retract on 1 and 2 . ' Mr Collins ? Mr Collins ! Mr Collins ! 'Will you confirm your link is correct ? ' 'B link correct . ' 'Liftoff minus 120 . ' 'Closing inlet valves . Onboard computer exciting 109 . 'We are counting . ' 'We have go on all internal systems at minus 50 . ' Sometimes he will not tell me he is not coming back , but always he leaves the key over the door ! Silly thing to do . It 's the first place burglars look . But he likes the place left clean and ti ... 'We have ignition . We have liftoff . ' 'A-OK from here . How about you boys ? ' Thank you , Houston . This is SID 2 reporting : all systems go . How long now ? 7 hours , 19 minutes , 27 seconds . - He said anything intelligible yet ? - No , Doctor . No identification on him . There she is , there 's old SID . Not only old but ... - Must warn ... - Get the doctor , nurse . - Please ... - It 's all right . Sedate him please , nurse . Hold him down . - It 's all right . Lie down . - No . Don 't . No , please . Come on . No . No , please . Please , no ! Please ... Well , time to go for our walkies , old man . 'We have satellite on positive track . Lunar orbit is correct . ' 'Hawaii has just confirmed position . ' - Time ... - Lie down . - What 's the time ? - Lie down , sir . Lie down . You 've had a nasty concussion . If you didn 't have a concrete skull , you wouldn 't be with us now . - Get me a telephone . - Nurse . We can do all that later . Get me a bloody telephone ! 'We are 5 hours and 7 minutes into mission . ' 'All systems OK . ' 'A-OK from here . ' 'Commander ! Collins ! Collins is trying to kill you ! ' So Grey was right . Listen , Craig . You can beat this thing . " They burned out the personality centres of your brain ... " Craig , listen to me . Listen . We can help you . " ... to control you by radio waves . " They may have your mind , Craig , but they can never get your soul . 'Craig , listen to me . Craig ! ' Commander ! Commander Straker . Are you receiving me ? 'Commander , come in , please . 'Come in , Comm . Straker . Are you receiving me ? ' " You were inert . A nothing . " " A body without a will . " Ed . Come in ! Are you receiving me ? 'Are you receiving me ? ' Receiving . - ' Are you all right ? ' - Yes . Thank God . What about Collins ? He 's ... He 's out of it . He could have killed you . Yes ... He could have killed me .

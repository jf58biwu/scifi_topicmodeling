 That 's it , Mr. Thorpe . Lower it away . Aye , aye , sir . Okay , boys , lower away . Yes , sir , Bill . Everything 's all set outside there ... for the next team comin ' down . First thing you know , you 'll be calling up your real estate boys ... startin ' to set up all your factories , high-rises , the works . - Start right in polluting ? - Yeah . - A bonanza of opportunity . - Yeah , for everybody except swimming pool salesmen . Here . Rest and recreate , Mack . You 've earned it . Haven 't you learned yet , buddy ? You just can 't do both at the same time . - How you doing , old man ? - You know a few gray hairs don 't count , Doc . It 's what a man has in here . That 's why we 're taking this electrocardiogram . What 's bugging you , Mack ? Stevens . Oh , yeah . What are you gonna do , fire him ? I 'm afraid I 'll have to . Excuse me , Doc . But I want this man taken off my team . - I 'm sorry , Stevens . - Come on , Mack . So I popped my cork . One of these days , it 's gonna hit somebody . You 're trying to knock me out of a $ 100-an-hour job . No . Stevens , you just don 't have the temperament for this kind of work . - It 's not up to you , Mack . - I think it is ... especially when he tried to hit his buddy with a wrench . I 'm sorry , Stevens . I 'll see ya . Okay , let 's go . Look , Doc , you make the rules . It 's your word who works down here . Well , you and Thomas go up as soon as you 're ready . I 'll be on deck tomorrow morning . We can go over it then . - See you guys up there . - Right . Leah , Don MacKay and Bob Cousins up in two stages . Minimum time in decomp for the test . Okay , Hal . Is Dr. Andrews there , Leah ? Bill Bradley wants some last-minute instructions . - Dr. Andrews ? - Uh-huh ? Thank you . Andrews here . Have Bradley send up some more manganese nodules , will you , please ? Corporate request for Mr. Shepherd . Engineer Bradley here . The corporation has spoken . I wonder if Einstein meant his theory of relativity ... to encompass the relativity of beauty ? Has anyone ever observed , Dr. Andrews ... that you have a very fishy way of flirting with the ladies ? Decompression chamber two . The divers are on deck , Dr. Andrews - Mack and Cousins . Andrews here . You two all right ? Yeah , we 're okay . Is this trip really necessary , Doc ? For the test of that last breathing mixture . - You waited two stages coming up , right ? - Yeah . We 're growing gills . Be the first in your neighborhood . Take them down to 50 feet . We can dispense with conservative decompression . Steve ? Take it in easy stages . Well , I guess maybe I should 've stood up for him more , but - It wouldn 't have made any difference , Tom . Mack 's right . He 's not cut out for the job . Yeah , I know . But he was planning on gettin ' married this time up . - Girl comin ' over from England . - Well , there 's no law that says he can 't . - Have a good time ashore . - Thanks . These are good . Leah likes her specimens alive . Yeah , well , nobody can say you don 't qualify on that count . Okay , Brad , ease off . Oh , come on , Hal . When are you and Leah gonna get together ? As soon as she says yes . Sometimes , I think I 'd be better off just to forget the whole thing . See ya up top , fellas . - Same old headache , Dave ? - Yeah . Must be quite a mind-bender . You know , you 've popped your weight in aspirin since your tour began . Dave ? It 's like having a one-man plague . I keep wanting to ask , hasn 't anybody noticed how slimy the walls are ? The place seems to be getting smaller all the time . I can remember when claustrophobia used to be just a word . It didn 't beat you . You fought this one to a standstill . I 'll talk to Dr. Andrews and get him to line up a replacement . - You can surface right away . - Some of the stuff I tried , you know ? Transcendental meditation , deep breathing exercises ... even prayer . Oh , well . At least I never once asked to be sent up , huh ? And don 't think that won 't go into my report . Earthquake ! Good God ! Ocean Lab , this is Triton . Do you hear me ? Ocean lab , come in . Ocean Lab ? Ocean Lab , do you hear me ? - Sound general quarters ! - Aye , sir ! We 've lost contact . The umbilical cable snapped . Oh , no . Two men surfacing - - Thomas and Stevens . - Oh , my God ! Attention , Mr. Thorpe . Launch the dory . Circle and search . Two divers were surfacing . - Aye , aye , sir . - Urgent , all divers . Suit up immediately . Repairship-to-Ocean Lab umbilical line . What 's this all about , Doc ? We 've lost contact with the Ocean Lab . There 's been an earthquake . - We 're going back down . Check us out . - You 're not ready yet ! Oh , the hell we 're not ! - I 'm going too . - Leah , Leah . Listen to me . It 's too dangerous without propulsion vehicles . - Mr. Thorpe ? - Hal and I have been a team from the very beginning . My dear , I know how you feel - Well , then you know why I can 't stay up here . MacKay and Cousins are going down too . Assign all three to one team . Be careful you don 't go too deep . Thanks , Mack . - Divers away . - Aye , aye , sir . Get more divers over , fast . Aye , aye , sir . Suiting up now . It 's gone . It 's gone ! What did she say ? Nothing but broken wires and cables . Leah , are there pieces of the habitat ... the pressure chamber , anything from inside ? Pieces offering ... anchor cables some surveying gear . Nothing from inside so far . Had any signs of a hatch ? A-A-A broken port ? No . It 's as if the entire Ocean Lab was swept away . I 'm gonna go deeper and check . Newfoundland , sir . Atoll . Atoll , Newfoundland . Earthquake . - 7.5 Richter earthquake . - Send a Mayday , Briggs . Advise Halifax we 've lost Ocean Lab . Mayday ! Mayday ! Mayday ! Halifax , this is Triton . Whiskey-Zulu-Quebec-8-8-7-1 . Over . Mayday ! Mayday ! Mayday ! Halifax , this is Triton . Tidal wave affirmative . This is Glace Bay . - Mayday ! Mayday ! - Tidal wave affirmative .. We have a cruiser arriving Sydney 0-6 , 2300 . Over . You 'd better grab this one , Lieutenant . We 've got a Mayday from the Triton now . Go ahead , Triton . This is Halifax Day Officer . Over . Halifax , this is Triton . We 're at fixed position ... at latitude 35 degrees , 45 minutes north ... longitude 57 degrees , 40 minutes west . We 've experienced undersea earthquake ... and have lost contact with Ocean Lab . Repeat : Have lost contact with Ocean Lab . Divers unable to locate . Over . You are over Muir Seamount . How far down was your equipment ? Less than 250 feet right on top of the guyot . Now , we must have submersible rescue craft . Ocean Lab has rescue hatches . Over . Yes , sir . If she was thrown eastward by the quake , you could be in serious trouble . She could 've gone into the abyss . That 's inaccessible . Or imploded . We think our Sea Lab is intact . They 've only got breathing mix for seven days . Repeat : Seven days . Less if they panic . Over . Captain , you 've got to understand our problem . All ships in this area are on rescue service . What about the company that made Sea Lab ? They must have other submersibles that could help . Good thought . We 'll contact them . - Lieutenant ? - Hold on . Captain , submarine Onindaga is available and proceeding to you . - They just picked up your Mayday . - This is Triton . Roger . Good man . Send him along as fast as you can . Over and out . I 'll pick those flowers . She 's gone too deep , Doctor . You 're not flowers . Leah . Leah , listen to me . You are below your pressure limit . Look at the color . She 's getting narcosis . Where are the companion divers ? - Leah ? - Leah , now , listen to me . You are too deep . Swim up - UP - Captain Williams ... they 're bringing Dr. Jansen aboard now , sir . - How do you feel , Leah ? - Oh ! You 'll survive . Captain ! Two floaters comin ' alongside in the day . In you go , Leah . I 'll keep you posted every minute . - Who are they ? - Thomas and Stevens . Leah ? It was Thomas and Stevens . Halifax , this is Onindaga . Over . Onindaga , this is Halifax . Go ahead . Slow ahead together . Captain . Area of seamount unstable . Aftershocks frequent . No signal or pinger detected in , uh , 42 hours of search . Magnetometer 's negative . Bottom scanners negative . You have traversed the Muir Seamount how many times now ? This 'll be coming up to three full passes . All that 's left is to start down into the trough . Negative . The area 's too unstable . Starboard three ! I 'm sorry , Doc . - Come in , Mack . Come in . - Thank you . I was , uh , just dozing , I guess . - Waiting is sure hell , isn 't it ? - Oh ! Awful . Coffee , Doc ? No , I-l don 't think so . Thank you , Mack . Triton , this is Onindaga . How do you hear me ? This is Triton . Hear you loud and clear . Captain , I 've got Triton . We 've completed our search . The results are negative after four days , 11 hours . We request your permission to leave the area . We regret having been unable to help you . We think Neptune two is better equipped as a search vessel . We hope it arrives soon . Wish you the best of luck . Best of luck to you too , Captain . We thank you . You did all you could . - Welcome to Canada , Commander Blake . - Ex-commander . Haven 't had a uniform on in four years . Well , I 'm Norton Shepherd , Triton Enterprises . Uh , no coat ? I left it at home in Atlanta . - How is it down there ? - Warmer . - Well , we 'll be flown to the disaster site . - Uh-huh . Neptune 's on its way . Yeah , well , I hope those people on the Triton ... - aren 't expecting ' any miracles . - Ah , but they are . - This is very bad timing , Mr. Shepherd . - Why ? ls something wrong ? Well , the Neptune , it 's had a complete overhaul ... but hasn 't had a sea trial yet . Well , I 'll tell you . If fit does spring a leak ... you 'll be the first to know . Well , when you 're workin ' a mile down , you don 't spring a leak , Mr. Shepherd . You implode . No survivors , no remains . How 'd you like to cruise up to the yacht club in that ? Hmm . At 120 meters there is considerable debris ... here at the lab site . Now , our divers have been as deep as equipment permitted ... and the navy submarine has worked the slope of the seamount ... to , uh , 500 meters . Our problem is strictly one of time . If the pressure hull is still intact ... there 's life support remaining , oh , I 'd say ... for just under 48 hours . Doctor , I 'm sure this has occurred to all of you ... but if someone were still alive in the Ocean Lab , wouldn 't he have activated a pinger ? - May I answer that , Dr. Andrews ? - Please do , Leah . Commander , because of its size , the navy sub couldn 't possibly have cruised low enough ... to see if the lab had fallen into a fissure or a deep growth . As for a pinger ... we all know that sound underwater is scattered by obstacles - by fish , by rocks , by plankton . And in spite of what you see here , the top of the seamount is really very rugged . I 'm aware of all that , Doctor . Commander ! Your submersible ... can cruise into areas that sub could never go . If your Ocean Lab did go into the trench ... no ordinary pinger would be operative at that , uh , pressure . But we have no proof either way . As long as that clock says there 's still hope , we 've got to try . We have 47 hours 51 minutes , 26 second 's . No argument , Doctor . We 'll try , all right . But just for the record , the purpose of this dive ... is to find and photograph proof of the loss of the environmental structure ... for the insurance underwriter . Good God , man ! There are three men down there who may still be alive . - Now , let 's get our priorities in order . - Oh , come - The Neptune has not had a sea trial since its overhaul . There 's also a danger of aftershocks , landslides . Now , I don 't know your three friends ... but I will know the men who are diving with me in the Neptune ... and they are my responsibility . And whenever there 's a choice ... their safety comes first . Now , Captain , I would like to meet my crew . Excuse me . Ready the hoist . - Medium oxygen mixer . - Medium oxygen mixer . Check . Lighting control circuit . Lighting control circuit . Check . - Stern access . - Stern access . Check . Bottom scanner . Bottom scanner . Check . - D.C. Load generator . - D.C. Load generator . Check . CO , detector . - CO , detector . Check . - All right , let 's take her down . Muir Seamount coming up . I 'm gonna see if I can get some pictures . Holding at dead slow . Neptune to Triton . Neptune to Triton . - Come in , please . - Come in , Mack . We 're approaching the site , Dr. Andrews . We 're startin ' to take photographs . That site was damn close to that slope . It 's almost as though somebody was lookin ' for trouble . We were lookin ' for trouble . Believe it or not , we were trying to determine what causes earthquakes . Plus , the full ecology shtick - biological research , sediment sampling . Tests and evaluation of navigation and homing devices ... deepwater fishing and farming , full-scale housing . 'Cause all God 's children gotta have food and a place to live . Cruising at 100 meters . Cruising , 100 meters . - Right , Mack . - Log time and depth as he gives it . - Aye , sir . - Now , Mr. Shepherd ... I 'll show you just about where they are now . They 're getting nearer here . Descending , Dr. Andrews . Three knots . Aftershock . Sounds like a hailstorm . Neptune to Triton . Neptune to Triton . Do you hear ? Over . We 've lost contact . Neptune , do you hear me ? - Sharp aftershock . - Mack , Cousins , come in ! Neptune to Triton . Do you hear me ? Over . - Easin ' up any ? - Not yet . Look at that stuff . It 's gettin ' heavier . Neptune . Neptune , come in , please . Can you hear me , Neptune . If you do get contact , order them up . Full port thruster . Full port thruster . - How 's she handling ' ? - Can 't get her away from that damn cliff . Ease back on the port thruster . Easin ' back on the port thruster . I think she 's clear . Neptune to Triton . Neptune to Triton . Come in , please . Neptune to Triton . Neptune . Oh , come on , fellas . Get off the line , will ya ! - Doggone fish . - Repeat ? - Leah ! - Will you repeat ? - Is that you , Mack ? - Yeah , this is Mack . - We 're doin ' just fine . - Excuse me . Commander Blake . Blake here . 350 meters . Surveying slope . Over . Dr. Andrews expects more aftershocks , Some Severe . Strongly recommend you surface . Over . Repeat : Suggest you abort the dive . Over . Negative . We 've just gone through a river of sand . Avoiding cliffs and danger spots . I 'm continuing the dive . Thanks , Skipper . No gung ho gesture intended , gentlemen . I wanna find what I came for . But if this dive gets any stickier ... I 'll abort it fast . You can count on it . Huh . Hey , Skipper , can you hold it here ? I think I picked up something . Come here , will ya ? Hold it on 1 - 5-3 . - I 'm gonna go out and take a look . - Right . It 's metal , all right . It 's below us and maybe a little to port , Mack . Okay . We 're locked on it . - See him ? - Yeah , I see him . Damn ocean 's a junkyard . Triton , this is Neptune . - Do you hear me ? - Go ahead , Neptune . Yes , we hear you . We are discontinuing our search . Received your message . We 'll try again tomorrow . Shouldn 't take no more than 10 , 12 hours to recharge our batteries . Negative . All we can do now is go deeper . How do you think we would have stood up under that sand avalanche ... with another 500 feet of water on top of us ? Yeah , but that was in that narrow canyon . - The farther out we go in the trench - - The less there is to see . Unless you look straight down . And I 'm afraid that 's just where the Ocean Lab is . And if it 's that far down , it 's imploded . I 'm sorry , gentlemen . That 's it . Triton , this is Neptune . Stand by . We have extremely low battery voltage . What time do you estimate breaking surface ? We 're on auxiliary batteries now . Estimate surfacing - Thirty-three minutes , sir . - Thirty-three minutes . - Hold it down ! Listen to that ! An echo , Mr. MacKay . Inversion layer . No . Not on this wavelength , Commander . And not on a keel-fixed transponder . I am familiar with the equipment , Mr. MacKay . I supervised its installation . Well , good . Then I can talk in shorthand . We 're going up , right ? - Right . - Inversion layers are fixed . Listen to that . There is no Doppler effect . Triton , this is Neptune . I am halting the ascent for further investigation . Will advise . In view of your power situation , suggest you - Will advise . It 's something . I don 't know . It 's awfully weak . There are six sets of conditions that could create that sound ... all of them natural , not man-made . Yeah , but you heard it too , Commander . Mack , take a look down here ! Those imprints in the sand - by the sea growth . Do you see them ? Bring it around to port a little , will ya ? There it is coming up here now . Look at the imprints in the sand . We had an earthquake , Mr. MacKay . Yeah , but it could 've been made by the Ocean Lab . I am running out of time and power and patience . Now we are resuming our ascent . Pictures then ! I 'll circle once and then surface . You better take ' em on the run , mister . Activate that . There . There . Now , those markings could 've been made by the Ocean Lab . If the lab slid by that area ... it would have left far more disturbance than that . Look there . Flora not found at that depth . I believe it 's a species of Macrocystis ... we were cultivating at the Ocean lab site . I believe you 're right , Leah . There 's no other way that specimen could get there ... unless the Ocean Lab dragged it . Now take a good look at that rock wall . Vertical . And what do you think would happen if we close on that wall ... during another aftershock ? We 've got friends down there . Any risk is worthwhile , and we 're running out of time . Panic and time are inseparables , Doctor . Now why don 't you try Looking at this situation ... with a scientific detachment ? Doctor . I don 't mean to be unkind . Uh , you are involved with Dr. Hamilton , is that correct ? Yes , Commander , that is correct . And so much for your scientific detachment . There is a way of going down that would , uh ... lessen the danger , if you 'll agree . You could dive tethered using the bridle and cable . Aw , tethered - like a dog on a leash . It would cut way down on our range . Well , you can see a long way through those ports . It 's better than nothing . You wanted insurance . Now you 've got it . There 's plenty of cable . The equipment 's good , so there 's no problem . All right . To the end of the cable . But I want someone on board who can make an accurate , scientific evaluation ... of that damn piece of seaweed . Dr.Jansen is the authority in that field . I would have bet on it . All right , hand me up the tether hook . Okay . Tether attached . Hoist away . Neptune to Triton . We have nothing on the bottom or the side scanners , Dr. Andrews . Over . Understand your search is negative . Over . I heard it again . Did you hear that , Dr. Andrews ? You probably picked up the thin beam of a scattered sound . No , it 's the pinger . I 'm sure . Well , what about the visual ? The-The bottom ? The displaced growth ? Not a thing . Nothing yet . Leah , take a look at this . Now , that growth right down there - You see it ? I can 't tell from here . Let 's move closer . Oh , no . We 're at the end of our cable now . Isn 't there anyway to get in so I can get a better look ? And if you did make a positive identification , what would that prove ? That somebody passed this area on the way down . Down is a hell of a long way . You 're quitting . We made an agreement . We struck out . Get your hands away from there ! - Take the controls . - Got it . Main power port . Main power starboard . - Full starboard thruster . - Full starboard thruster . - Flooding the port ballast tank . - Bottom pressure 's okay . - Full port thruster . - Full port thruster . Flooding the main starboard ballast tank . Comin ' in on an even keel . Port and starboard thrusters full . Reduce speed to dead slow . Reducing speed to dead slow . Maintain course . Do you know what you did , lady ? You know what the pressure is at this depth ? And do you know what could have happened if we 'd gone deeper ? We would have been crushed like an egg ! Oh , come on , Skipper . We 're loose now . The hell with playing it safe . Okay . We 're in this together . But I want you all to remember : I anyone of us goofs , we have had it . Understood ? Neptune to Triton . I have released the cable . I 'm investigating further . - Coffee , Skipper ? - No , thanks . - Mack ? - Oh , thanks , Bob . - No , thanks . - Dr.Jansen ? Yes ? Is this close enough for you ? It 's Macrocystis . I 'm certain . Look at that . That Ocean Lab must have gone down into that fissure . I think we better go down and have a look ... before that seawall winds up in our lap . Hey , look ! Those yellow marks . Then they did come this way . Three-second pulse . Very narrow band . I 'm sure it 's the pinger . Hey , hey , look at that ! Take a look at this coming up . You see that ? Broken right off at the top . Hovering . Mack , get over here . - What 's the matter ? - Help me out with these controls . Hey . We 're caught in a current . I never felt one at this depth before . We 'll put her at full ahead . I 'm at full ahead . Hey , hey , Skipper ! Watch it ! We 're gonna hit ! Check for damage . Pressure 's holding . - Check the lock-out chamber . - They 're still not answering . Lock-out chamber 's okay . I think we 're coming out of it . Just like that . Yep . Just like that . Hey , Skipper , swing it around the port a little , will you ? Incredible . Listen . That 's a ping , all right . And it 's on automatic . But where the hell are they ? In all my days of diving , I 've never seen anything like this . Look at the size of this stuff . The light is iridescent . At this depth , that 's phenomenal . Circle until we find that sound again . This is fantastic . It 's coming in again . E.D.O. is only 1 - 5-O-7-5 . Why , hell , that puts them Less than 300 meters away from us . Anything on the bottom scanner ? - Bottom scanner 's negative . - What about sonar ? Variable . Nothing . Not a trace . - They 've only got about two hours ' life support left . - Maybe less . Not much hope . What 's the outside temperature ? That 's strange . The deeper we go , the hotter it 's getting . You know , there could be some volcanic activity deep down . Hmm . Maybe that explains the size of that stuff out there . But where is that lab ? What 's that sound ? - Dr.Jansen. - Holding . You know what they are ? Yes . They 're all familiar . But they 're huge . Well , they look harmless enough . - Let 's keep going , Mack . - Right , Skipper . Cousins , you better get yourself something to eat . Depth-3-O-7 meters . And those jawfish ! The ones I 've seen have only been two inches long . Look at them ! There 's something we ought to be thinking about . When are we gonna be willing to call it quits ? We got 90 minutes battery power left . We 're gonna need half of that to get to the surface . Let 's go the limit . Okay . - Hold it right here . - Holding . Magnetic reading . Metal object right below us . You wanna take over , Skipper ? I 'll go out and take a look-see . - Careful . - Right . I 've got it too . And it 's close . Mack . Watch yourself . There 's some big game out there . Just keep that hatch close . Any sign of him ? Nothin ' . Man ! Did you see that ? What , Mack ? Never mind . Hey , Bob . This piece is definitely off the Ocean Lab . Looks like a piece offering off an outside locker . We 're getting out of here . Man your stations . - Anything ? - No , sir . Oh . Are you sure you know how to work that bloody thing ? Yes , sir . I 'm sorry , lad . Sorry . Damn it . According to my figures ... they 've just run out of life support in the Ocean Lab . Ooh , I pray to God I 'm wrong . - Get out of here , boy . - Hold on . Give it all you got . Full thruster . Listen to that thing . - Trigger fish . - Where ? I never knew one of those things to be friendly . We better play dead . - There he is . - Stay away from that port . - Get over ! Get over ! - Don 't move . Stay away , boy . Stay away . - Get out of here . Go on . - Shh . Think we should move on ? No , no , no , no . Don 't move it . He 'll ram us for sure . Son of a gun . - He 's coming at us again ! - Hold on ! Cousins , get over here . Mack , emergency power . Right . No power , no control , nothing ! Let 's hope she settles on an even keel . Mack , give me a hand here . - What 's that noise ? - Catfish . We 're in a school of ' em . Well , it 's still hot . We 're approaching the bottom . Ah , you rascal ! Let 's try this . Now try it . Nothin ' . Look . - Hey . - Yeah ? - Looks like the voltage regulator 's gone . - It 's one of the ICs . - Got a spare ? - Component box . He 's pushing us . Hey . All right , try it now , Mack . Stand by . Cousins , I 'll take over . We 're goin ' over ! No sign of the pinger . We have 15 percent power left . I 'm sorry , but we have to surface . Let 's take her upstairs . Listen . That 's got to be close . Let 's go get ' em . It 's in the Ocean Lab . It has to be . I hope so too . There it is ! Over to port ! Oh , my God . No sign of anyone . The hatches have blown . Maybe they 're using their reserve tanks . Can 't we circle the area ? We sure can . There they are-1 : 00 . They 're alive . Those eels-They 've got ' em trapped . Maybe we can draw ' em off . Cousins . They 're low on air . Hamilton and Bradley are buddy breathing . Moulton 's drawing the eels off . He 's trying to help the others get away . God ! The eels ! They 're attacking Moulton ! Cousins , we 've got two of them - Bradley and Hamilton . That 's great , Skipper . - Let 's take her upstairs . - Yes , sir .

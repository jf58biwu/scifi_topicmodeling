I haven 't eaten like this in years . I never ate like this . And now you know what you 've been missing . - There was a world once . You punk . - Yes . So you keep telling me . I was there . I can prove it . I know . I know . When you were young . People were better . Oh . Nuts . People were always rotten . But the world was beautiful . It 's late . I gotta get to work . What have you dug up on Simonson ? I 've got a handful of reference work 20 years out of date . You throw out a name and you expect a miracle . Simonson . Sol . Report . Huh ? Schmuck . Biographical survey . 2006 . Last one they published . Simonson . William R. Born 1954 . Evidently unmarried . Graduated Yale Law School in 1977 . Principal partner . Simonson . Borden and Santini . - Governor Santini ? - Hold still . There 's more . In 1997. he was the director of Holcox Manufacturing . Norfolk . Virginia . Specialist in manufacturing freeze-drying equipment for commercial food processing . And in 2018 Holcox was acquired by Soylent and Simonson became a member of the board . The board of Soylent ? Your dead one was a very important man . Soylent controls the food supply for half the world . - What about those ? - Oh . Very technical and highly classified . Unnumbered copies . Officially . They don 't exist . Perfect . - What else do you want ? - Everything . Well . Law . Soylent . Oceanography ... ? Across the board . Across ... ? Oh . That 's impossible . Check the Exchange . Check the Exchange . I need you to tell me that ? You know . I was a teacher once . A full professor . A respected man . Make a special effort . Will you . Sol ? This case is for real . For a lot of marbles . - For who ? - Never mind . - Don 't forget to pick up the water ration . - I 'll do that . I 'll die if I don 't get water . - Taste that . - Taste what ? Taste it . Strawberries ? Hundred and fifty bucks a jar of strawberries . Thorn . ID is RC105 . Get me the 14th Precinct . Thorn . How about paying us a visit ? I can 't . I 'm following up the Simonson thing . - Well . What have you got ? - For openers . He was a director of Soylent . - What else ? - Well . Right now . Somebody 's tailing me . He 's damn good at it . Big deal . Would you believe bodyguards are buying strawberries for 150 D 's a jar ? You 'd better report in here right away . Yes . Sir . First thing in the morning . That was Thorn . He 's a damn good cop . Appreciate the difficulty . Ed . But the department wants to cooperate with the governor 's office . Right ? Whatever you say . Sir . It looks like a fair-complected man . Maybe someone close to you . A protector . And if we refer back to this card back here and if you look at it . The time sequence indicates a three-month period . The cards indicate a secure trend should follow shortly . So things are looking up a bit . Kathy . Thank you . - Your hair looks beautiful . - Thank you . Who is it ? Thorn . Detective Thorn . I had a few more questions I wanted to ask . Having a party ? Just my friends . It 's okay . Ice . Jeez . That 's great . It 's still over 90 out there . You know . If I had the money . I 'd smoke two . Three of these every day . Come on in here . On the bed . This is a nice place . The way it 's fixed up . Perfume . He was murdered . You know . Assassinated . Robbery had nothing to do with it . You understand ? Yes . - Did he have any relatives ? - I never heard of any . - Do you know who he worked for ? - No . - You were with him for three years . - He never talked about his work . Did you meet his friends ? Sure . I met some of his friends . What were their names ? - I was never really introduced . You know . - Oh . Come on . Shirl . Well . There was a Mr. Lempeter a man called Tompkins and somebody called Santini . That 's all I remember . He didn 't bring people up here very often . Santini 's the governor . So ? Where did you go with Simonson ? No place . Shopping once in a while . - Except ... - Except ? He took me to church . Church ? About a month ago . And then again a few days before he died . What did he do there ? He prayed . And he talked to a priest . That 's about all . - Why would he take you to church ? - He didn 't say . Why do you think ? I think he just wanted to have somebody along . He was very strange towards the end . He didn 't touch me for months . And sometimes for no reason at all . He 'd start to cry . I saw him cry more than once . Old people do that . Do they ? I can 't figure this Simonson . If I was like him . Rich . Important plenty to eat real bourbon and a girl like you you wouldn 't see me in church . What are you doing here ? I 've been looking all over the building for you . I 'll teach you to break my rules ! Furniture stays in units ! I 've told you before . - No ! - I mean it ! - I 'll get rid of the whole ... - Hold it ! I didn 't know you were here . Mr. Thorn . We give them a day off a month . We don 't have to . And they break every regulation in the book . You 'd think they 'd be grateful for what they 've got here . Wouldn 't you ? I 'll tell you . Charlie they 're here because I called them for questioning . - Is that so ? - Yeah . Don 't you believe me . Charlie ? You should have told me . Why ? Regulations . You wanna file a complaint ? What do you say . Charlie ? No . I don 't want to do anything unfriendly like that . Mr. Thorn . I wonder if any of these girls want to file a complaint against you . Maybe not . Maybe they want to keep it friendly . I hope so . Don 't you . Charlie ? Don 't you ? Yes . Get the hell out of here . Look . Maybe we better all go . Come on . Come on . Come on . Baby . Charles isn 't as bad as some . Don 't you ever get mad ? What for ? I left my stuff in here . It 's still dark . You could stay a while . You could wash up . I 'll make you breakfast . Why should you ? There 's plenty of food in the refrigerator . Charles wouldn 't dare make trouble for you now . I got work . I don 't wanna be alone . I 'm frightened when I 'm alone . There 's nothing I can do for you . Furniture . I got nothing to give . The new tenant is coming to look over the place . He may not want me . Well . I got a place . But it 's nothing like this . This is like my home . I 've been here a long time . You could take a shower and let the water run as long as you like . You got ... You got hot water here . Very hot . Jeez ! I haven 't had a hot bath ... I 'll rub you down afterwards . All right . You turn that air conditioner on all the way . All the way up . We 'll make it cold . Like winter used to be . - What about breakfast ? - Anything you like . - Strawberries . - An egg . - No . Strawberries . - I 've never seen strawberries . All right . An egg then . Who the hell needs strawberries ? Mommy ! Mommy ! - Hey . Sister . - Mommy ! Mommy ! Mommy ! - Where 's the priest ? - I think you 'll find him over there . Thorn . Father . 14th Precinct . My name is Paul . Have I done something ? No . I 'm investigating the murder of Mr. William Simonson . - Who do you say ? - Simonson . Quite an important man . A rich man . I have no recollection . - You talked to him . - Did I ? No doubt about it . A rich man . Yes . I remember . We don 't see rich people here anymore . There isn 't even enough room for the poor . There 's just too many . Far too many . - Fa ... - My memory 's eroded . Chiefly . I assign space to people who need space . Do you need some space ? I need to know what he said to you . - Are you sure he 's dead ? - Yes . - Really dead ? - He 's dead . - What did he talk to you about ? - Come back tomorrow . I 'm very tired now . Father . Father . Did you hear his confession ? There should be a requiem mass . But there 's no room . - Should I make room ? - This is very important . I can 't help you . Forgive me . It 's destroying me . - What is ? - The truth . The truth Simonson told you ? - All truth . - What is it ? What did he confess ? Sweet Jesus . - We 're closing the Simonson case . - The hell you say . You heard me . The Simonson case is officially closed . Felonious assault . Sign . Yesterday you agreed it was assassination . There 's been 137 reported murders since then . And we won 't solve them either . I 'm not gonna falsify that report . Got a suspect ? I 've got leads . This isn 't somebody you scratch after 24 hours and forget . I told you there 's been a tail on me . Something stinks here . - Look . You 'll sign this . And I 'll bury it . - Like hell you will . A member of the board of the Soylent Corporation was torn apart with a meat hook ! You can 't sweep that carcass under the rug . Who bought you ? - You 're bought when they pay you a salary . - Who 's they ? High and hot . They want this case closed permanently ! - Now sign this . - You sign it ! If I close it and somebody higher and hotter wants to know why . It 's my job ! Sign it . I 'll cover for you . I won 't put my job on the line for you . Hatcher . Not my damn job ! Hey . Big shot . Hatcher says you 're on riot control . Great . That really makes my day . This was once called Gramercy Park . Now it 's the only tree sanctuary in New York . Governor . Sorry to disturb you this way . Sir . Not at all . Donovan . Not at all . Your secretary told me where to find you . It 's urgent or I wouldn 't have come out here . - I understand . Now . What is it ? I 'm to inform you the board is determined to resolve the Simonson investigation immediately . Sir . - I thought it was resolved . - Yes . Sir . But the police officer involved refuses to close the case . Perhaps because he went to church yesterday . - What does that mean ? - It was Simonson 's church . The cop spoke 20 minutes with the priest . So ? The same priest who heard Simonson 's confession . I don 't wanna hear any more about it . I can 't hear any more about it . Just do what you have to do . Bless me . Father . For I have sinned . It has been six months since my last confession . A real bargain . Folks . Synthetic footgear . Plastics . Plastic ware . We have a large assortment of plastic ware . Some are a little chipped . Others have hardly any cracks . Quick-energy yellow Soylent made of genuine soybeans . Soylent crumbs ! Two D 's a kilo . Nothing cheaper in the market . Come and get it . Soylent buns ! Get your genuine Soylent buns ! Keep moving right along . Step right up . Soylent Green . Soylent Green right here . They gave me a quarter of a kilo . I stood in line the whole lousy day . And they gave me a quarter of a kilo ! Do you believe that ? Let me go ! Are you gonna put up with this ? They 're running out of the damn green . - Idiots . - Some foul-up at transport . - This crowd will blow . - I know . Got the scoops standing by . But I don 't know if they can handle this . When you gonna make the announcement ? As soon as I get up the nerve . About five minutes . I guess . Better pass the word . Right . This is the police . This is the police . This is the police . I am asking you to disperse . The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted . You must evacuate the area . The scoops are on their way . The scoops are on their way ! I repeat : The scoops are on their way . Today is Tuesday ! Why would you leave that door open ? Mr. Fielding . - Why did you set up Simonson ? - I didn 't . You 're all there is . - Who pays your bills ? - I do . Oh . No . I won 't hit a cop . Bastard . Yeah . I know . You get life for that . Jerk ! Life in a waste disposal plant in a Soylent factory someplace . How about that big . Fat Soylent Corporation ? Do you work for them like Simonson did ? How much did they pay you for that one ? Does Soylent buy your strawberries ? Anybody tails me . Bothers me one more time I 'll come back here and kill you both . Got it ? Get off my back ! Thorn . I was worried about you . - What happened ? - Never mind . It doesn 't matter . It doesn 't matter . - Good evening . Mr. Roth . - Good evening . Thank you . - Good evening . - Good evening . Mr. Roth . - Mr. Roth . - Good evening . Mr. Roth . Good evening . Your Honor . I assume you have a priority police problem . Yes . Your Honor . It 's about William Simonson . And these . Thorn . Thorn . It 's curfew . How do you feel ? A lot better . I did the best I could but I still think you should go see the police doctor . He might relieve me from duty . You need a rest . More than two days . And I lose my job . - We could go to another city . - What for ? They 're all like this . - The country ? - That 's not allowed . Those farms are like fortresses . - Why ? - Good land 's gotta be guarded the way they guard the waste disposal plants and Soylent factories and the plankton ships . You know . There are idiots in this world who wanna take everything we 've got . - Maybe Simonson was one of them . - I don 't believe it . It means there 's no place for us to go . That 's right . Why should we ? You be careful now . Keep the scanners on . Don 't go anyplace without a bodyguard . The new tenant comes tonight . He 'll like you . You 're a hell of a piece of furniture . Don 't talk to me like that . Please . Okay . It 's horrible . You must accept it . I see the words . But I can 't believe them . Believe . The evidence is overwhelming . Simonson was a member of the board . He learned these facts . And they shook his sanity . The corporation knew he was not reliable anymore . They feared he might talk and so he was eliminated . - Then why are they doing this ? - Because it 's easier . I think " expedient " is the word . What we need is the proof of what they are doing before we bring it to the Council of Nations . Good God . What God . Mr. Roth ? Where will we find him ? Perhaps at home . Yes . At home . I waited two whole damn years for an apartment to open up in this building . It 's a nice place . - How long have you been here ? - A long time . How old are you ? Twenty-one . Charles said you were 24 . That makes us both liars . All right . All right . I sleep late . I like a big breakfast and no lunch . I 'll organize the menu for dinner . Three or four times a week . I have guests . Sometimes it 's business . And then we have to be alone . Sometimes it 's fun . And then we like a girl who 's fun . Are you fun ? May I help you . Sir ? - It feels good . - Yes . Sir . Won 't you come in ? And your favorite color ? Orange . I guess . - Music ? - Classical . - Light classical . - I 'm sure you 'll enjoy it . Sign here . Please . Mr. Roth . - A full 20 minutes ? - Oh . Certainly . Guaranteed . Thank you . This way . Please . Mr. Roth . Good evening . Ma 'am . May I have your name . Please ? Well . I see that orange is your favorite color . - You want Mr. Solomon Roth ? - That 's right . This way . Please . My God . It 's truly unfortunate that you missed the overture . - I want to see him . - That is prohibited during the ceremony . Well . I can assure you ... Open that damn thing right now or I swear to God you 'll die before he does . All right ! All right . Sol . Can you hear me ? - Thorn ? - Yes . Thank you for coming . - Oh , dear God . - I 've lived too long . No . I love you . Thorn . I love you . Sol . Can you see it ? Yes . Isn 't it beautiful ? Oh . Yes . I told you . How could I know ? How could I ... ? How could I ever imagine ? Horrible . Simonson . Soylent . Listen to me . Thorn . Thorn . Listen . I can 't hear him . Do something . Damn it ! Yes . Sol . You 've got to prove it , Thorn . Go to the Exchange . Please , Thorn . You 've got to prove it . Thorn . The Exchange . Go to ... - Dispatch . - Thorn . ID RC105 . Get me the 14th Precinct .

Apartment 22A . - Cut in if you get the 14th . - Understood . - Hello ? - Shirl . It 's me . Oh . Thorn . I 'm so glad . I have to talk to you . No . There 's no time . - The new tenant wanted me . - Good . Stay with him . I want you to stay with him always . Oh . Thorn . I want to live with you . Just live . - I have Lt. Hatcher . - Plug him in . Thorn ? Thorn . - Thorn . Where the hell have you been ? - I 'm at the Exchange . Hatcher . Help me . There 's another one over there . - Hey . Punk . Are you with us ? - Hatcher . - Did I get him ? - Yeah . You got him . All right . You don 't listen too good . But you 're a damn good cop . Hatcher get to the Exchange . You gotta tell them they 're right . But let 's take care of you first . You don 't understand . I 've got proof . They need proof . I 've seen it . I 've seen it happening . They 've gotta tell people . - Tell them what ? - The ocean 's dying . Plankton 's dying . It 's people . Soylent Green is made out of people . They 're making our food out of people . Next thing . They 'll be breeding us like cattle for food . You 've gotta tell them . You 've gotta tell them . I promise . Tiger . I promise . I 'll tell the Exchange . You tell everybody . Listen to me . Hatcher . You 've gotta tell them ! Soylent Green is people ! We 've gotta stop them somehow ! [ ENGLISH ]

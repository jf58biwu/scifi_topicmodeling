 ( Bleeping ) What are you doing ? Commander Traynor . is it ... - lt 's not ... - lt 's Simon . Simon . Good God , what are you doing here ? - l came through the time barrier . - l forbade it . - What ? - That day in my office a long time ago . I told you it was pointless . You should stay in the present . - How do you remember that ? - Still asking foolish questions . No , it 's just that sometimes in these projections , people don 't remember . I 'm not too sure whether Controller 2957 does . It was room 209 he took me into , his office he said ... Controller 2957 . So you 've met your future self . Yes . Commander , are you all right ? Don 't stay here , Simon . - Go back . - Why ? What 's happened to you ? You 're so changed . Well ... I suppose you could say that things haven 't been altogether normal for me lately . I haven 't been permitted to be normal . But a man must fight back , Simon . Always fight back ! ( Sighs ) I 'm getting old . Old . And very tired . Simon , I want you to give me your solemn word of honour that you won 't tell anybody you 've seen me today . - l hardly know anyone . - Your future self , Controller 2957 . Your word especially that you won 't tell him . - Why ? - Will you promise ? I wouldn 't ask you if it weren 't for a very special reason . You 'll have to trust me . The way you used to . All right . All this . I created all this , you know . - A Ministry of Forward Development . - Yes . That day in your office . Yes , yes , exactly . The moment in time when the foundations were first laid . In the years since then I 've built vigorously , I 've built well ! Today ... I 'm not even supposed to be a part of it all . I 've fallen from grace , Simon . I suppose you could say I 'm a Misfit . Not a word . This hasn 't happened . Remember . So , that 's the tape . That 's the tape relating to the production of synthetic rubber for the sea Curtain . Yes , Controller. I thought I 'd look it out . If you 'd care to scan it . No , if you say there 's no positive order on it of mine to begin manufacture , that 'll have to be good enough for me . But it 's extraordinary . 17 , surely you remember my issuing that directive last Thursday ? As you were , Controller . 16 here . 17 there . 16 , are you completely sure of that ? My memory for faces is wonderful , 17 . Yes , yes , yes. I made a natural mistake . I apologise . We 'd better have the Atlantic progress map . Very good , Controller . - That 's the current situation ? - Yes . The Americans are well ahead , as you say . They must have laid 1 , 000 miles of Curtain . 1 , 082 . Now you tell me we haven 't even completed laying the cable for our section of Curtain . - lt seems not . - For goodness ' sake , Four . I had a completion signal on it . I 'm not saying you didn 't , but there 's no record . I 've sent for the relevant tape . ( Controller ) This is a serious matter . Water is being pumped into the southern Atlantic at the rate of billions of gallons a day . If that Curtain isn 't ready to hold the excess by the time the general level rises , we 'll get it all back in tidal waves . ( Alpha Four ) Precisely , Controller . Then we 'd better buck our ideas up . - We seem to be losing efficiency . - Controller . - l 'm in earnest , 16 . - Careful . - What ? - 17 here . 16 there . What does that matter ? I 'm serious . The melting polar icecaps have created danger of flooding in lowland Europe . The Master Plan tells us what to do about that. lt has clearly foreseen that ... Oh , I 'm awfully sorry . I only came back ... Simon , no . That 's all right . We 'll complete our tour . Study the whole question , Alpha Four , and have a report on my desk by noon . Just as you say , Controller . We seem to have upset our controller . It must have been his mistake about not starting synthetic rubber manufacture . - Perhaps he 's tired . - He did mix us up , 17 . Yes . Now , why on earth should he have done that ? - We 're quite distinct . - As different as can be . Especially since you gave up wearing calf-length boots . - Which never completely suited you , 16 . - Yes , 17 . It may be a little more than his just being tired . I 've looked this tape over fairly carefully . At a certain point , I find it 's been edited . ( Alpha Four ) Edited . ( Gasps ) No , Rosie , stop . Not like that . Do you want to kill them ? Like this . It 's to help them grow . If they ever will in this heat . ( Paul ) Today we 're going to talk about poultry . Beth wants you new ones to learn as much as you can because some day we hope to have more than a pair of chickens . Now , to begin at the beginning , this is an egg . - ( Chicken clucks ) - E-G-G , egg . If most of you haven 't seen one before , it 's because before you became Misfits , you were fed on formula 6 , vitamin plus albumen substitute , instead . The Technocracy invented that to replace eggs . A scientific breakthrough . Hm . Yes , Arthur . I suppose that 's all right , but do you have to hang around the city so much ? Polluted atmosphere , many Technocrats to talk to . Jenny , for a girl of your age , you 've got an awful lot of thumbs . Dominate it . Show it who 's boss . Like this . Keep going . Oh . There . What on earth 's that ? It 's so hot I was trying to remember the last place we were in , the ice Box . - But I 'm no good at painting . - Of course you are . Who told you that ? - l never was at school . - That 's a Technocratic fallacy . You were brilliant . Your teachers didn 't know how to encourage your talents . - ls that the truth ? - Go on , Liz . Be abandoned . Have fun . Let it flow . - Beth . - Yes . How did I ... I mean , what was it that made you turn round and start this community ? Community ? That was a question of noblesse oblige , really . I don 't understand . Well , you see , Liz , at a particular time in your life , you ... I mean I decided that education was a charade . It only existed to make more Technocrats . So I thought it would be good to get away with a few unspoilt youngsters and bring them up to be themselves . Wasn 't it dangerous , having to go against the law ? - Throwing in my lot with the Misfits ? - Yes . Well , if I 'd been alone in the way I felt , then I might have thought twice about it . But I wasn 't and I 'm not now . There are communities like this all over England . In France and Germany , too , by all accounts . So there 's hope . There . What do you think of that so far ? - Yes . Yes , I rather like it . - ( Bleeping ) What on earth 's that ? There , Simon. I won 't come any further . The hovercraft can be seen out there and I can 't risk being found with Beth . Thanks a lot. I found out a lot today . There was just one thing , though . Commander Traynor ... - Don 't mention that name . - There , but it 's all right here , isn 't it ? Now , Traynor founded the Ministry of Forward Development , right ? - Yes . - What went wrong ? How come he can 't be talked about if he 's really the boss ? Something happened where Traynor was concerned . Something unfortunate . All right , Simon , you knew him , but Traynor betrayed us . That 's the truth . He sold out on the Technocracy . It 's true. I happened to be his personal assistant at the time so I know . He brought disgrace on his ministry . He tampered with a Master Plan . He got away before we could deal with him properly . Society still has a score to settle with him . As it may yet have with poor Beth . Yes . Poor Beth . Hm . Back from the citadels of progress . I only hope Simon 's a little wiser about the kind of time server he 's going to be . He doesn 't have to be Controller 2957 . Honestly he doesn 't . Doesn 't he just ? You know more about the time barrier than I do these days . All I can say to you is you 'll be wiser not to be me , if you have the option . - Why do you say that ? - You wouldn 't want to be me . Oh , I would . You 've done some wonderful things here . No . Only drawn a bow at adventure and made some classic mistakes . Not least of all where my childhood friend Simon is concerned . Oh , yes . Now , there 's a thing , Liz . A few years ago , Controller 2957 and I were engaged to be married . Married ? Me and ... I mean , you and ... Wait a minute . You can 't say something like that and walk away . - What more do you want me to say ? - Why were you and Beth engaged ? - Why ? - Yes . The usual reasons , but in the event , we discovered we were incompatible . - incompatible ! Gosh ! - ( Beth giggles ) That takes a load of your mind . We weren 't just plain incompatible . We were demonstrated to be incompatible . - l don 't understand what that means . - By the central computer . - Couldn 't you find out for yourselves ? - Not allowed to . 2957 's brilliant idea , so that neither of us made a nasty mistake . Our statistics were taken and fed into the wondrous machine . 2957 came out with an A for everything . Intelligence , ability to adjust , emotional security . - And you ? - Well , I got ... - D minus . - D minus . Yes . A lucky escape , Simon . Mind you , I 'll always like and respect Beth . Naturally . - Marriage is not just tea and sympathy . - Yes . Science saved us from a terrible mistake . D minus , though . Hey , now , wait a minute . If Beth is Liz , then a D minus makes Liz ... A moron ! An idiot ! Practically a screaming nitwit ! Right . Thick as a log and twice as wooden . Lucky we 've got our own teeth . - That 's the worst thing I 've ever heard . - No , Liz , it 's progress . But even to go and do it , to go to a computer and ... Oh ! That 2957 ! That Simon ! Poor Beth . Poor Liz . An old friend with a rating like that , running a secret community outside the law . Yes , I can see what you mean . - l 'll kill him ! I 'll murder him ! - ( Beth giggles ) Be my guest . ( Beth giggles ) I tell you , it 's hotter . Brighter . It can 't be brighter . We 'd better get on . All right , kids , foraging now . Let 's go . - ( Kids mutter ) - Hurry up . No moaning . Quickly . Move . Get your baskets . No arguments . Forward . - We 'll go together , shall we , Liz ? - What ? - l said we 'll go together . - Why are you suggesting that ? - You think I need help ? - l didn 't say so . No , but a D minus could hardly be expected to pull up roots without help from a winning A plus . D minus . How did you find out about that ? A little bird told me and I was sure your wonderful Controller 2957 wouldn 't let you go without passing on the information . - lt 's nothing to do with me . - lt might be one day . - No ! - How can I be sure ? ( Paul ) Let 's go . That kind of thing 's you all over . If I 'm a D minus , I 'm happy to be one . I don 't need your kind of grading . It must be awful stuck up there with the A pluses . ( Laughing ) That 's the way . You don 't want to take any part of it too seriously . I don 't go much on these computer classifications . It 's all just to make people worried . Does everybody have to have a computer test ? Not everybody . They tried matching me once at school with a boy . - To be married ? - Don 't be silly . They were pairing off boys and girls to work on a special course . You know the kind of thing . But population redevelopment caught up with us and I got declared a Misfit . - But what rating did you get ? - B plus . B plus . That 's great . That 's wonderful compared with a ... Look , I 'm sorry , Liz. I didn 't ... mean ... it . What 's the matter with her ? ( Buzzing ) Oh . Paul 's right. lt 's ten degrees hotter than it was yesterday . The others aren 't back yet . They must have gone the other way from us . This is so lovely . What are you doing ? Well , I felt chilly and naturally lit a fire . What does it look as if I 'm doing ? Trying to save our food stores before the heat destroys it completely . - Boiling up preserves . - Why 's it getting so much hotter ? It 's all in the mind . I say , did you see those dancing lights a few minutes ago ? - What dancing lights ? - They weren 't in the mind , anyway . And yesterday that queer thunder . It 's funny all the changes there are in these times . Kills me every time I think of it . And not just things to do with the cloning programme . - There 's other developments like clones . - Clones ? Now , how on earth did clones creep into the conversation ? I heard something about them the other day . You needn 't mention clones to me . As far as I 'm concerned , they 're the dead end . Soon we won 't need to bear children any more or even be born . The Technocracy will just print us off from our previous selves . Providing we 're the right sort of previous selves . Alphas down to Deltas . Deltas the hunters , you mean ? I didn 't know they were clones . Yes . Anyone who served the Technocracy and asked no questions is a good subject for cloning . Perfect civil servants or thick-headed slaughterers . It makes no odds . This is really a killingly funny time we live in . Does ... Controller 2957 go along with something like the cloning programme ? Well , fortunately , I 'm not 2957 's keeper . But he likes you , Beth , really he does . Respects you . Shall I send him an old glove to wear pressed against his heart ? He takes awful chances trying to help you , even if you don 't want him to . He didn 't really mean anything about that computer test . Yes , he told me . It was just that , at the time , he wanted to make sure you were properly matched . - We weren 't . Like you and Liz . - lt 's not the same thing . - Liz thinks it is . - Anyone can see it isn 't . Liz is a fathead . That 's right , a D minus , officially designated . Oh , look , Simon. I don 't know anything about these things , really . All the test result told me was that I was myself and not somebody else . Well , that was good. I didn 't even think about being matched with 2957 . - l thought something different . - What ? That he might be in love with me . - Paul ! - Shh . We 'll fan out from here . Remember the orders . No shooting unless we have to . - l got separated from the others . - That 's all right . But a group of them this time and orders not to shoot unless they have to . - Hunters ? - l wonder what it 's all about . This heat is awful . If it doesn 't stop soon , I 'll ... Paul , look ! ( Groans ) ( Sobs ) Oh , Beth ! Simon ! It 's dead . The whole bush . And , Paul , the creek ! It 's dried up . What 's happened ? Why are they dead ? - l looked after them as well as I could . - ( Cracking ) Look out ! It 's dead , too . Just bone dry . Just fell off the tree . Well , of course . That 's it . They 've finally done it , Simon . 2957 and the Technocrats . They 've done something to the whole world . They 're burning us up .

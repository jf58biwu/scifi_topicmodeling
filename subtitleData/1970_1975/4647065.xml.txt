 - Anything ? - No , sir . The UFO 's disappeared . Well , keep all ground radar on red alert . - Is this the Lunar Module ? - Yes , sir . I 'll feel a lot happier when it 's landed . EER is 21 minutes . - Rendezvous 4 minutes later . - Fine . 'This is Space Intruder Detector . Red alert . 'UFO 428-146 . Green . 'Trajectory : 0427 / 5,4 . ' - Anything ? - Nothing . I 've picked it up again , Lieutenant . Course 072-124 . - Speed ? - SOL 0,4 . Check . - Confirm . - Moonbase to SHADO Control . - Come in , Moonbase . - ' Confirm sighting in Area T , 6 Green . 'Moving towards Area Yellow at SOL 4,0 . Your sightings are masked by the moon . We 'll pick it up in T6 Yellow . Out . - Check the estimated re-entry time . - Yes , sir . 'This is SHADO Control . Relay your re-entry time and angle . ' Re-entry begins in 7 minutes . Angle : 27,5 on a 3 second burn . 'Thank you , Captain . ' - The checks . - Thank you . The UFO 's altered course 4 degrees . The Interceptors won 't make contact . It could reach the Lunar Module before re-entry , sir . Make to the captain : Emergency re-entry at an angle 31 . Increase burn 1 second . That 's a tough order , isn 't it ? The UFO could be on us in 4 minutes . The new angle takes us in less than 3 . The angle 's 40 degrees . A bit close to the upper limit , isn 't ? Yeah . It 's like diving into a bowl of molten lead . It 's possible , but you wouldn 't do it for kicks . - Sighting now in Area Blue , sir . - Termination ? No affirmative yet but it 's closing on the module . The UFO 's increased speed to SOL 0,6 . Even with the new angle , it 'll reach the module before complete re-entry . Warn them . Too late . I have re-entry cessation on radio contact . Kill ... 'Kill ... 'Kill Straker ... Kill Straker ... 'Kill Straker ... ' No ... No ! 'Kill ! - ' Kill ! ' - No ! - ' Kill Straker ! ' - No ! - ' Kill ! ' - Yes ! Kill Straker ! I don 't get it , Lieutenant . It 's a lot slower than any other signal we 've ever picked up . Yes , but we can 't take any chances . This is a red alert . Repeat , this is a red alert . Interceptors : immediate launch . Still no increase in speed ? No . Steady at 35,000 knots . Moonbase to Interceptors . Imperative you obtain visual contact - before making any attack . - ' Roger . Should go visual soon . ' - Interceptor lider to Moonbase , have visual contact . - Identify . A little charred around the nose cone , but it 's all ours . Paul ! Good to see you . - How are you , Paul ? - Fine . - Well , you gave us quite a scare . - I gave YOU quite a scare ? ! Sixteen hours with no radio contact . The antenna was destroyed in the re-entry attempt . Yes , I 've read the technical report . - Why don 't you tell us your version ? - Version ? Yes . We 'd like to know what happened ... from you . You 'll get my report . Look , Paul ... There 's nothing official about this . What 'll it be ? Coffee ? No , thanks . You go ahead . How about something a little stronger ? - Now , you know I don 't use it , Paul . - Never ? I forgot . Ice-cold Commander Straker can rationalise his troubles away . Look , Paul , we know you 've had a rough time but the Commander doesn 't take that from anyone . Maybe that 's because nobody 's dared to dish it out before now . All right . Let 's have it . If you want details of the accident , you 're asking the wrong man . Who should I be asking ? Whoever ordered the angle of 31 degrees . That , as you very well know , was me . It was a dangerous but not impossible angle . That depends on your stage of reentry . For us it meant a certain burn-up unless we levelled out . So you 've compensated and bounced off the atmosphere . Yes . Just had enough fuel to make it back here . It was a risk I had to take . A risk YOU had to take ? ! Next time you have a risk to take , let me know . I 'll take back leave . Well , over the past year , our rate of success against UFOs has been impressive . But by no means 100 per cent . Like they 'd say in the old days , that 'd be like asking for the moon . Well , that 's what I plan to ask for , Alec . Enough money to set up 4 new moonbases over the next ten years . - Private ? - It 's work . Why don 't you join us ? I think it 's the only way to achieve back-up capability , even against a massive UFO attack . Who says they have the capacity to mount a mass attack ? Nobody . Because nobody really knows . But they might have next year , ten years from now , and we have to be ready for it . All right . Let 's hear your reactions . Alec ? You 're asking a lot . I think the council will fight you all the way . But I 'm all for trying . Paul ? I don 't know . Just exactly what is that supposed to mean ? - Let 's just leave it like that . - No . Spit it out . Well ? - You want it straight ? - Yes , I want it straight . But not here . I 'd like to know . What do you think you 're playing at ? Hold it , Alec . All right , Paul . Let 's forget rank for the moment . Alec says you 're asking a lot . That 's avoiding the fact that it 'll double last year 's appropriation . You 're saying you 're against . We should rename it " Straker 's Alien Defence Organisation " . Oh ! I get the picture . You think I run this organisation for kicks . You think I want more money so that I get bigger as SHADO gets bigger . It 's got a name : empire building . - Foster , you 've gone far enough . - It 's all right . Maybe you should have spoken up earlier , Paul . Maybe . - You wanted it straight . - That 's right . I 've no time for yes-men . I think you should put yourself on the furlough roster . 3 or 4 months ' complete rest . - You think I 'm falling down . - I think it 's got to you . You 're obsessed with SHADO and Ed Straker . You make decisions with no thought of the consequences . - Like that re-entry angle ? - Yes . Like that re-entry angle . Like spending millions on moonbases . Like a hundred other instances . All right , all right Suppose Com . Straker took some leave . You got a replacement in mind ? Well ? It 's possible . Why the soft peddle ? Why don 't you just slap him back into line ? It isn 't that simple , Alec . Well , if you take my advice , you 'll think about it . 'The Lunar Module leaves for earth in 17 minutes . ' Well , I have to go . - I 'll sleep on what you said , Alec . - Fine . You do that . Safe journey . General quarters . This is an internal security alarm . This is an internal security alarm . Seal all exits . I want Captain Craig found and brought here . Use stun guns if necessary , but I want him alive . - What happened ? - You tell me . Look over there . - He 's not here . Come on . - Right . Right . Continue search in Area 7 . - What 's taking so long ? - We 'll find him , sir . Reception and embarkation area searched . Sleep sphere checked ? Right . Move on to recreation area . Negative . 'The explosives store has been broken into . 'A high detonation pack is missing . ' Hold it , Craig ! He 's entered Emergency Exit 10 wearing a spacesuit . Order Condition Red . This is Control . Internal security Condition Red . Repeat , Condition Red . If he gets near the air and water installations with that explosive ... - Why wasn 't Exit 10 sealed ? - It 's an emergency exit , sir . - It 's always operational . - All right . - Get some men after him . - Yes , sir . - Check all emergency air supplies . - Yes , sir . Find out where he got that spacesuit . Right away , sir . 'Go ahead , Mark . ' A spacesuit 's missing from the leisure sphere . But he won 't get far . 'There 's practically no air left . ' Scan the surface . There he is . We have no choice . Use Number 4 . We have to use a missile . No . It 's too close to our installation . 'Listen , Craig . We know what you 're trying to do , 'but it 's 200 yards to that air and water installation . - ' You 'll never make it . ' - I 'll be close enough . 'We realise you want to destroy Moonbase , 'but your air supply won 't last . ' All systems checked and OK 'd , sir . Right . - Oh , stand down to Yellow . - Yes , sir . - The damage report , sir . - Thank you . This is Control . Stand down to internal Condition Yellow . Well , there 's nothing here we can 't handle . Thank you , sir . - What now ? - Well , I 'm going back to bed . Aren 't you interested to find out why happened ? It 'll keep . No one 's going anywhere , are they , Colonel ? Get me a teleprinter link to earth . I want to make the report . Yes , Colonel . - Colonel Freeman ! - Yeah ? I have a communication for you , Colonel . - Well ? - It 's somewhat unusual channel . - What is it ? - Gen. Henderson wants to see you now . - He contacted you ? - One of his assistants did . Why not Miss Ealand ? She deals with personal calls . I was surprised myself . I was asked to give the message only to you . You 're asked not to communicate it to anyone . Anyone ? Including Commander Straker ? Commander Straker was specifically mentioned , sir . I see . 'That 's what he said . ' I appreciate it , Alec . I won 't say you shouldn 't have told me . 'Good . So , what 's it all about ? ' Why don 't you go along and see Henderson and find out ? Well , you 're wondering why I asked you here . More than that . I 'm wondering about the way you asked me here . You mean my request that you should tell no one ? I mean the fact that I was asked not to tell Commander Straker . - And did you ? - First chance I got . Read that . You didn 't finish it . I don 't have to . I 've seen enough . - Is that all you wanted ? - Sit down , Colonel . Listen to me . If this had come to me from a SHADO operative or even from a senior officer , I 'd have pitched it into the ash can . But it didn 't . It came from Moonbase . From Paul Foster , who 's backed Straker in every fight he 's had . - If you say so . - I do ... which makes Foster 100 per cent loyal . - Not anymore , not in my book . - I have to take this seriously , Freeman That 's why you 're here . Now , the basic allegation is that Commander Straker has become obsessed with his command and must be removed . - I want your opinion . - It 'd make even you blush . So , there 's nothing in Foster 's allegations ? - Nothing . - They 're completely false ? - Yes . - Even this one ? The claim that he plans to request double his last year 's appropriation ? If it 's true , the Commander seems to be suffering delusions of grandeur . Well ? Is it true , Colonel ? 'I told Henderson to ask you , but he knew . 'If someone had told me a month ago 'that Foster would do a thing like this ... ' - Forget it , Alec . - ' What do you mean , forget it ? ' Listen . Foster didn 't transmit that information out of pure malice . There 's got to be another reason for it . Has there ? He wants promotion and will do anything to get it . 'Well , there 's only one way to find out the answer : 'tackle him about it . Thanks , Alec . ' Why don 't you girls go and grab a cup of coffee ? All right , Paul , you sent details of the appropriation request to General Henderson . That 's right . At best , that was a serious breach of trust . - What are you trying to pull , Foster ? - To stop you wasting millions , for start . You should know better than anybody that a mass attack is on the cards . - Speculation . - Half this job is speculation . Yes , and it 's proving pretty expensive . In the past 4 months there has been a fall-off in UFO sightings . Which proves that our equipment works . Maybe . Or maybe it indicates a grouping . A grouping for a much larger operation . It 's going to come . I want to be ready . I think you 're wrong . I don 't care what you think . I didn 't come in here to discuss the appropriation . I want to talk about your future here . - Are you firing me ? - No . Nobody gets fired from SHADO . Your report to General Henderson was an inconvenience . I can ride that out . No , you 're free to express your right of criticism of this command . But you are not free to divulge information given in confidence . And if I do ? All right . But let 's get one thing clear . I stick to my opinion . I 'm pushing for a change of command . How hard will you push , Paul ? As hard as Craig ? - You still say he tried to kill you . - Yes . With an empty hypodermic ? What did you say ? I 've told no one how he tried to kill me . Air bubble in the blood : lethal and very difficult to prove the cause of death . Open it ! It 's no use , Commander . The doorway 's sealed . We won 't be disturbed . - Must be a short circuit . - Emergency power . Trace the fault . Colonel ... Why don 't you just think about this ? Think about it ? That 's exactly what I 've done ever since that last re-entry . We are switching to the emergency power circuit . Emergency power now in operation . You 're crazy , Foster . You know that , don 't you ? - Am I ? - You must be to think you 'll get away with this . 'You 've run this organisation too long . ' All right , Foster . What do you plan to do ? You came into the Control Sphere . 'You asked the girls to leave and locked the doorway . ' You tried to talk me back into line . I refused . You started throwing insults . There was a fight . You lost control and pulled a gun . Your gun , Commander . I got it from your locker . I managed to jump you . There was a struggle ... And the gun went off accidentally . You 've got it in one . If we bypass the damaged circuit , we can link into the emergency supply . - I want two men outside immediately . - Yes , Lieutenant . One question , Colonel . What happened in that module during the 16 hours of radio blackout ? All right , Foster . Give me that gun . Why don 't you use it ? Makes no difference ? That shot punctured the sphere . We 're losing air . This is the end , Straker . Is it ? If you don 't pass out , I 'll kill you with your own gun . Just you try and get it . I won 't have to . You 'll pass out before I will . That 's it . Fight it . I can wait . You see , it 's a question of physique . I 'm younger , fitter ... stronger . You 're forgetting one thing , Foster . Willpower . - We 've bypassed the circuits . - OK . Stand by . The door should open in one minute . But why ? Why ? I don 't know , Alec . I just don 't know . Two men bounce off the atmosphere during re-entry . We know that a UFO was closing with their ship . After an extended space flight , they manage to limp back to Moonbase . Well , what happened during those 16 hours ? Something pretty frightening . Something traumatic enough to make both of them want to kill you . Well , we may know more when the psychiatric unit finishes its tests . Now , Paul , let 's go back to the lights . - Lights ? - Yes . The strange , strange lights you were telling me about . Now , Paul , you are in the Lunar Module . You 've been forced to abort the re-entry attempt . Check the fuel . What ? Well , that 's not enough . Compute for lunar orbit . The antenna 's damaged . No hope of radio contact . We 're on our own . Go on , Paul . Go on . It 's later . An hour later . On course . Let 's hope the fuel holds out . And then ? What happened then , Paul ? The light . You saw a light . Light . So strong ... It 's so bright . It 's blinding me ! What 's making this light ? Where does it come from ? - Kill ! - Where does it come from , Paul ? - Kill ! - Pulse rate 104 . Still rising , Dr. - Kill ! - Kill who ? Kill ! Kill ... Kill ! Kill Straker ! Relax . Relax , Paul . It 's all right . Relax now . Relax . Sorry I 'm late . All right . Let 's have it . - Paul Foster is finished . - Finished ? But you said yesterday he 'd be all right . Yes , but in our psycho-neuralgic test we found ... Never mind the textbook blurb . What happened ? Well , sometime during the space flight in the Lunar Module , Colonel Foster was subjected to a deep subliminal impulse . Brainwashed by who or whatever was in that UFO . - Brainwashed ! - The impulse was extremely powerful and confined to one specific action . To kill you . But you said that Foster could be completely normalised . That 's right . But our latest tests have shown a trace of the impulse deeply rooted in his subconscious . - Exactly what does that mean ? - That we can never be sure . - Sure ? - That next week , next month or in five years ' time , the impulse might surface and Foster 's subconscious will force him to kill you . It could happen today . Jackson , you said we couldn 't be sure . So , there is a doubt . That 's right . I could be wrong . Foster may have it under complete control . Surely , there 's something . Drugs , hypnosis ... No . I 'm sorry . You know what this means . Lock the door . Under no circumstances whatsoever open it for 15 minutes . - Is that understood ? - Very good , sir . So , this is it . The thing is I feel perfectly normal . I don 't blame you . I know it has to be done . I 'd do the same in your place . What did the report say ? I 'm liable to crack up again ? Look , I know you can 't just kick me out of SHADO . I know too much . Total security . For God 's sake , get it over with ! I think there 's a few things you should know first , Foster . The aliens planted one objective in your mind : to kill me . The rest of your mind was unaffected . - I don 't understand . - I know you don 't understand . The psychiatrists gave you a clean bill of health . If I 'm OK , why this ? I think you said it pretty well yourself . You told me you were going to push for a change of command . A change of command . Ten years . I 've given ten years of sweat and sacrifice to get SHADO running the way I want . I won 't let some young punk like you mess things up . You 're a threat , Foster . A troublemaker . I can 't fire you and I can 't shelve you . So ... I don 't believe you . It doesn 't really matter , does it ? Henderson won 't let you get away with this . - Won 't he ? - Then there 's Freeman . - What about Alec Freeman ? - I can handle Alec Freeman ! Hold it , Foster . Guards ! Now , who do you think they 're going to believe ? Foster , you 've had it . Change of command ! I 'm not throwing ten years away for a punk like you . - You want to tell Henderson , huh ? - Guards ! Guards ! They take orders from me , Foster ! - Get back , Straker ! - You 'll have to kill me , Foster . - No ! - I said kill me ! It 's you or me . Shoot ! Kill ! Kill ! It 's all right , Paul . It 's all right . You tried to kill me ! I could have killed you any time I wanted . I 'm sorry , Paul . I had to do it . I had to be sure . If you were ever going to kill me , it would have been just now . It 's all right . Still haven 't figured it all out , but he 's quite a guy . Yeah . All set , fellas ? Let 's go . To see General Henderson about the money for the new moonbases . By the way , Paul , I 'll listen to any reasonable arguments against it in the car , then I 'll tell you how it 's gonna be .

 [ Door opens , closes ] [ Door opens , closes ] Everything 's on for tonight ? Yes . I still think it 's too soon to bring him up . We have no choice . Agon thinks they 're onto us . I programmed the C.L.C. for two hours tonight . There 's no telling when he 'll be available again . We 'll have to move him ... If he comes up successfully , otherwise , we should be prepared to dispose of him the usual way . Please state registration code . Check . Where was the subject found ? We came across it the last day of our field trip into the woods a week ago . The capsule was perfectly intact . Is there a date on the capsule ? Oh , yes . The subject was frozen in 1973 , Which means he 's been under for 200 years . [ Machines beeping ] - Blood pressure . - 140 Over 50 . - Encephalo-activity ? - Just under normal . General life functions ... Acceptable . He should be coming out of it any moment . Do we have any information on him ? Just the usual data card inside the capsule and the personal artifacts here . Hmm . The subject was 35 years old at time of initial cryogenic emergent . His name ... Miles Monroe . Under occupation it says he was part owner ... of the happy carrot health food restaurant on bleecker street , wherever that was . Also a clarinet player with something called the ragtime rascals . Was his emergent voluntary ? Hmm . According to this , " Subject entered hospital for routine exploration of minor peptic ulcer ... And complications set in . " The patient never regained consciousness . He was admitted for cryogenic emergent by his cousin , a mrs . Joan needlebaum . The physical damage was repaired . Yeah . Totally . Routine . We 're getting an initial motor response over here . This is the critical stage now . If his consciousness isn 't handled carefully , There could be damaging trauma . Remember , we 're dealing with an involuntary subject who expects to be waking up ... In st . Vincent 's hospital in Greenwich village in 1973 . Swallow reflex is almost there . [ Mutters ] We 've got to get him out of here . He 's not ready . We 've got to get him ambulatory whether he 's ready or not . [ Grunts ] careful , careful . Careful ! [ Chattering ] now , just keep him on his feet . We 've got to dispose of this capsule . When he 's ready , get him to the farm . We 'll meet there tonight . Yes . There we go ! Now , let 's try to take a step . Like this . One . Up it comes . Take a step . Look at me . Up , down . That 's it . There you are . Good . Very good , mr . Monroe ! Good , good . Up , down . No , he 's got it in reverse . Oh , you 're going the wrong way . Mr. Monroe ! No , the other way ! There we go . Whoa ! [ Alarm sounding ] security is coming ! Oh , mr . Monroe ! Please , mr . Monroe , wake up ! We 've got to get him dressed quickly . Okay , stand . Right there . Stand , stand . Stay there . That way . That 's it . [ Alarm continues ] [ Door closes ] [ Gulps ] Ah , mr . Monroe . Here we are . Oh ! Sorry to bother you , doctor . Is everything okay ? Uh , yes . We ought to be through here shortly . [ Alarm stops ] huh . That 's funny . We 're getting a misread on the power function . Really ? Well , I 'll order a check first thing in the morning . Any reason why anyone else would be consuming power ? No , it 's just Dr. Orva , Dr. Monroe and myself . We definitely did register a power increase here . Uh , don 't mind Dr. Monroe . He , he , he- - oh . He 's not over the effects of a new ray we 've been experimenting with . Uh , what 's this ? Oh , that . Uh- - I think you two better come along with us . But why ? We haven 't done anything . I think I can explain . You 've heard of the venus project , haven 't you ? Yes . Well- - Uh , we had to come in here this evening to finish some very important work . Now when we asked for clearance , we were given no reason to believe that we couldn 't- - Do you have authorization ? Yes , we have clearance . We came through channels fully a week ago . [ Woman ] don 't you believe- - Dr. Monroe . Gentlemen . This really is getting- - gentlemen , he 's convulsing . It could be dangerous . Please , please leave us alone so that we can complete our work . Do we have- - he 's going to get dizzy now . This is going to be worse . We 're in total agreement . Can 't you see what a difficult- - I think the experiment is getting a little out of hand . If we hadn 't had this interruption , we 'd have had it under control some time ago . Are you sure you have authorization for your experiment ? Well , he 's fully recovered , except for a few minor kinks . Has he asked for anything special ? Yes , this morning for breakfast . He requested something called wheat germ , Organic honey and tiger 's milk . [ Laughs ] oh , yes . Those were the charmed substances ... That some years ago were felt to contain life-preserving properties . You mean there was no deep fat ? No steak or cream pies or hot fudge ? Those were thought to be unhealthy , Precisely the opposite of what we now know to be true . Incredible . Well , he wants to know where he is ... And what 's going on . I think it 's time to tell him . I can 't believe this ! My doctor said I 'd be up and on my feet in five days . He was off by 199 years . I know it 's hard , Miles , but try to think of this experience as a miracle of science . A miracle of science is going to the hospital for a minor operation , I come out the next day , my rent isn 't 2,000 months overdue . That 's a miracle of science . This is what I call a cosmic screwing . And then where am I anyhow ? What happened to everybody ? Where are all my friends ? You must understand that everyone you knew in the past has been dead nearly 200 years . But they all ate organic rice . You are now in the year 2173 . Now this is the central parallel of the american federation . This district is what you 'd probably call the southwestern united states . That was before it was destroyed by the war . - War ? - Yes . According to history , Over 100 years ago , a man named Albert Shanker got a hold of a nuclear warhead . You will remain in hiding here for two weeks while we run a battery of tests on you . Then , when we think you 've fully recovered your strength , we 'll discuss the plan- - I still can 't believe this . What do you mean , " hiding " ? Who am I hiding from ? What did she mean , " hiding " ? Well , you might as well know , Miles , That reviving you as we did was in strict opposition to government policy . What we 've done is highly illegal , Miles , And if we get caught , we 'll be destroyed , along with you . What do you mean , " destroyed " ? What do you mean , " destroyed " ? Your brain will be electronically simplified . My brain ? That 's my second favorite organ . Resisters to mind reprogramming will be exterminated , for the good of the state . What kind of government you guys got here ? This is worse than california . There is a growing underground , Miles . And some day the revolution will come when we can overthrow our great leader . Look , you gotta be kidding . I wanna go back to sleep . If I don 't get at least 600 years , I 'm grouchy all day . We 're taking him along too fast . He 's still emotionally unstable . I can 't believe this . I go into the hospital for a lousy ulcer operation . I lay in a bird 's-eye wrapper 200 years , I wake up , Suddenly I 'm on the ten most wanted list . He 's ranting . We 'd better tranquilize him . I knew it was too good to be true . I parked right near the hospital . Here . You smoke this , and be sure you get the smoke deep down into your lungs . I don 't smoke . It 's tobacco . It 's one of the healthiest things for your body . Now go ahead . You need all the strength you can get . You know , I bought polaroid at seven . It 's probably up millions by now . Now we have certain artifacts here ... Which we date from 1950 to 2000 . We 'd like any information you can give us on them . Very little exists . For instance . Uh , this was Joseph Stalin . He was a communist . I was not too crazy about him . He had a bad moustache , a lot of bad habits . This is Bela Lugosi . He was the mayor of new york city for a while . You can see what it did to him there . This is , uh- - this is , uh- - Uh , Charles de Gaulle . He was a very famous french chef . Had his own tv show . Showed you how to make souffles and omelets and everything . This is , uh , Scott Fitzgerald over here . A very romantic writer . Big with english majors , College girls , you know , nymphomaniacs . Uh , very well known . This is Chiang Kai-shek , who I was not too crazy about either . This is Billy Graham- - very big in the religion business . You know ? He knew god personally . They got him his complete wardrobe . They used to go out on double dates together . He was very big . They were romantically linked for a while . This is some girls burning a brassiere . You notice it 's a very small fire . Um , this- - I don 't know what that is . That 's a photograph of Norman Mailer . He was a very great writer . He donated his ego to the Harvard Medical School for study . And this , uh- - this I can tell you- - This is a centerfold from a magazine we used to callplayboy . Which , um- - these girls didn 't exist in actual life , you know ? They were rubberized . You had to blow them up . And then you 'd fasten it . And you could spread ointment on them or anything else that you- - I 'll just take this and , you know , study it later and give you a full report on it . Uh , and , um , Would you tell me exactly what this is ? [ Chattering ] This . This is- - you see , this is- - this is the chattering teeth . And this you would buy at a store , And you 'd take it to a party if you wanted to get big laughs . And you 'd put it down on a coffee table or something , you know ? And you 'd set it off . And then , uh- - You see how funny it is ? The teeth chatter . They 're plastic . [ Fakes laughter ] [ Chattering continues ] I am going , at this time , To give to this tv and radio audience- - Some of us have a theory that he might once have been a president of the united states , But that he did something horrendous ... So that all records , everything was wiped out about him . There is nothing in history books . There are no pictures on stamps or money . Yes , he actually was president of the United States , But whenever he used to leave the White House , The secret service used to count the silverware . Thank you very much , jimmy . From the beginning , Muhammad Ali 's career ... was marked by controversy , and who knows ? It may have ended last saturday in the very same way . From the beginning- - at first we didn 't know exactly what this was , But we 've developed a theory . We feel that when citizens in your society were guilty of a crime against the state , They were forced to watch this . Remember the way it began ? March of 1964 . That 's where it really began . Yes , that 's exactly what that was . Would you like some more ? Mm , this stuff tastes awful . I could have made a fortune selling it in my health food store . Janis , some more for mr . Monroe . Certainly , sir . Are you thirsty , mr . Monroe ? Me ? No . No , thank you . Of course . These robots are uncanny . They 're one of our biggest industries here . Infinitely more sophisticated than any previously manufactured labor-saving devices . They 're plastic . Yeah , I know . But they 're alert and they respond . You know , I 've gone out with girls who had less movement than that . Watch this . Janis , come here . Yes , Dr. Orva . May I be of service to you ? Tell us about yourself . My name is janis 414 . I 'm a domestic service menial of the 400 series . I can cook , clean . I am a butler , a gardener and chauffeur . I have been programmed to respond to a complex series of domestic commands . Clear the table and leave the room . We 'd like to be alone . Come on , Miles . Are there female robots ? 'Cause the possibilities are limitless , you know . It 's getting late . We 've got to get you out of here . What do you mean , " out of here " ? Where am I going ? We 're going to take you to the western district . The underground movement has its headquarters there . Miles , have you ever taken a serious political stand on anything ? Yeah , sure . For 24 hours once I refused to eat grapes . Miles , there 's something called the Aires project . We want to know what it is . Why ? Because we believe it 's a secret plot ... The leader has to destroy the revolutionary movement . And how do I fit in ? Miles , We defrosted your capsule because we needed someone with no identity . Everyone here has a citizen 's record . We 've all been computerized , catalogued , Fingerprinted , photographed , voice-printed . But you have no number . You can be used to penetrate . And if you 're captured , you don 't know anything . Why , they could torture you for months . What could you tell them ? Only my name , rank , serial number and your name . You 've got to help us . You 've got the wrong guy . I 'm telling you . I 'm not the heroic type . Really . I was beaten up by quakers . Miles , you 're our chance . No , I 'm sorry . I 'd love to help you out , But I never get involved in anything where I could be tortured . I 'm a screamer . That 's my problem . It 's embarrassing in the morning . I wake up shrieking at the top of my lungs . Excuse me , sir . The security police are here , and they 're surrounding the house . When will you be wanting lunch ? - Go to the western district ! - Find the aires project ! You can do it ! Out that way , Miles ! [ Babbling ] Fly , goddamn it , fly ! Goddamn cheap Japanese flying packs ! [ Shouting ] no ! No ! No ! [ Engine revving ] [ Box clicks ] [ Box clicks ] They still haven 't located the alien . We 'd like to check the back of your van . [ Door closes ] All right . Come on . Let 's go . Move it . Out . Let 's go . I don 't have all day . Come on , come on . There 's your new home . [ Woman ] oh , no . Tsk . Is this the best they could offer ? Oh , geez . I 'd hoped for something with at least decent features . Tsk ! Oh , well , I guess I 'll bring you in next week and have your head removed . Okay . Come on . Come on . [ Sighs ] What 's your name ? Mi-milo . [ Tv announcer ] the alien is still at large . Persons observing any unusual activity or behavior ... Should do themselves and our leader a favor ... By reporting it to the police immediately . [ Sighs ] all right , milo . Listen . I 'm expecting company any minute . You 'll help with the drinks and serve . I 'm sure some of them will be hungry . The kitchen is on a single circuit system . I think I 'm going to put some rose oil on my fingertips . Check the music channel and regulate the aromatrom . And make sure there 's plenty of food for all the people . All right . [ Humming ] [ Bubbling ] [ Doorbell ringing ] [ Bubbling continues ] I think the way it was first explained to me- - do it that way . Well , which one ? There were so many . That very funny story . [ Chattering continues ] Hi , everyone ! Long time no see ! Long time no see . Come right on in . Wait , wait , wait . [ Chattering continues ] Come on . Hurry up . Where did you get that ? It 's gorgeous . Hi . How are you ? How are you , darling ? You look great . [ Man ] luna . Thank you . [ Chattering continues ] [ Door beeps ] Herald , it 's wonderful . Oh , you shouldn 't have , really . I just thought you 'd like it . Oh , it 's keane . It 's pure keane . No . No , it 's greater than keane . It 's cugat . [ Bubbling continues ] [ chattering , laughing ] It was white on white . And you know where she got it . No . You 're kidding . Right , right . And you know who paid for- - [ Chattering continues ] [ man ] fantastic ! Magnificent . Oh , let 's go tell her about what- - Here it is ! Let me get that for you . Yes , thank you , dear . The orb . Um , could I get a hit off of that orb , milo ? Uh- - [ laughing ] [ Guests laughing ] Milo ! Milo ! [ Laughing , chattering continue ] Just- - Oh . Oh . Mmm . [ Both laughing ] Oh ! Ah . [ Shouts , laughs ] Now , milo ! Let 's all go for a swim ! [ Man ] where 's the pool ? [ Shouts ] Run , run , run , run ! [ Remote clicks ] ? [ Upbeat classical ] [ Gasps ] oh , that was wonderful , her ! I feel so refreshed ! I think we should have had sex , but there weren 't enough people . We 'll use the orgasmatron . Oh , that 's a good idea . Come on . [ Chattering , indistinct ] [ Both moaning ] [ Both sighing ] oh , I had such a good time . All in all , I thought the party came off quite well . Certainly as good as last night 's or the night before . Maybe not quite as good as last saturday 's , but you know something , herald ? I love a party with a theme . Say , there 's something on your mind , isn 't there ? They arrested dalton porter today . [ Gasps ] Why ? He was with the underground . No . It was horrible . They tried to reprogram his mind and something went wrong . He 's a vegetable . Mm , I don 't want to hear about this , herald . I saw it happen . He was babbling . Mm-mmm . He claimed he saw secret experiments at the lexitron hospital . Something called aires . I absolutely do not want to hear about it , herald . This world is so full of wonderful things . What makes people suddenly go berserk and hate everything anyway ? Why does there have to be an underground ? After all , there 's the orb , the telescreen , the orgasmatron . What more do they want ? It 's hard for us to understand the criminal element . We 're artists . We respond only ... To beauty . Oh , yes . I know . Herald , um , I wrote a new poem today . You didn 't . Yes , I did . [ Laughs ] A little boy caught a butterfly and said to himself , " I must try to understand my life and help others . " Not just mothers and fathers , " But friends , strangers too , With eyes of blue and lips full red and round . " But the butterfly didn 't make a sound ... For he had turned into a caterpillar , By and by . It 's deep . You 're so obviously influenced by mckuen . Oh , oh , her , do you really like it ? Only one thing . Um , they change from caterpillars intobutterflies . Not the other way . They do ? They do ? Damn it ! Damn it ! Damn it ! I always get that wrong ! Goddamn ! Oh , shoot ! Relax , relax . I 'll get you some chocolate . Oh , no . Now the whole evening 's spoiled ! No ! Spoiled ! And I 'm getting a headache anyway ! Shoot , I hate to be wrong ! Luna , now , now . No ! Sit down , sit down . Luna , sit down . Sit down . Sorry . [ Crying ] It will be all right . I promise . Now just relax . I was having so much fun . ? [ Choir ] come on . That 's better . [ Tv announcer ] and now channel 1200 leaves the air until tomorrow morning . Our leader wishes you all a pleasant good night . - Can I help you ? - Would you change his head for me , please ? - Something a little more aesthetic . - Right . And check his works . He acts peculiar . You got room in there for another head change ? Yeah , sure . All right . I 'll be back in a little while . Let 's go . You have to help me . I 'm gonna tell you the truth . I 'm not a puppet . My name is Miles Monroe . I was frozen in 1973 , and some doctors thawed me out . Everybody 's after me , but I didn 't do anything ! I 'm a nice person . I have healthy life drives and good goals ! I don 't drink . I don 't smoke . I would never force myself sexually on a blind person . You 're the alien . Yes . You 're living in a police state . Your government is evil . We have to find out what the Aires project is . God , you are . You 're the alien . You won 't give me away , will you ? You 're nice . Oh ! [ Screaming ] no ! I knew I could count on you . Are you hungry ? Do you want a cracker , maybe ? Take a cracker . How can you not be hungry ? We 've been sitting here for hours . This was all you had in the car , were these interstellar space cookies . Eat something . You 'll feel better . Just take a cracker . [ Screams ] Will you shut up ? For god 's sakes , put yourself in my position . I 'm a clarinet player in 1973 . I go into the hospital for a lousy operation , I wake up 200 years later and I 'm flash gordon . Plus I 'm a criminal . I never did anything wrong in my life . I ran a health food store in Greenwich village . Occasionally , a customer would get botulism . But that was very rare . Now you have to help me . You 're the only person I know . I 'm gonna take that gag off your mouth , and if you 're gonna scream , scream . 'Cause there 's nobody for miles . Nobody 's gonna hear you . So scream . - [ Screaming ] - go ahead . Scream . I love it . Help ! Help ! Scream . Alien ! Alien ! Help ! Help me ! Help ! [ Screaming continues ] If you don 't shut up , I 'm gonna take this rock and bring it down on your head so hard ... That a substance resembling guacamole is gonna come out of your ears . What do you want with me ? I want you to help me reach the underground . I 'm not helping any alien . We don 't want your crazy ideas ! So just go back to greenberg 's village . Greenwich village , not greenberg 's village ! And that was 200 years ago . I can 't go back . You 're sick ! You 're sick ! You have to give yourself up ! They won 't hurt you . They 'll restructure your brain . Nobody touches my brain . They may drop it . Then I would talk like Mr. Lapidus who got hit by lightning . Please ! I wanna go home ! I 'm getting a headache . I 'm hungry ! I haven 't had a stress pill ! I haven 't had a bath in seven hours ! I 'm telling you , I 'm not accustomed to this ! I need my orb ! I want to relax ! Look at me ! Look at me ! I 'm shaking ! You know , you 'd be great to take on a camping trip . I order you to take me home ! They 'll be out looking for me . You 've abducted a very important person . I am a renowned poet . I sell 20 to 30 poems a week plus greeting cards . How far is the western district ? It 'd take days , and that 's with a vehicle . Well , take me there , and you 'll never see me again . I promise . I 'm hungry ! I can 't think straight . Obviously , I 'll promise you anything . If I get you some food , will you take me to the western district ? You sit here . I 'll go find us something , and don 't try anything funny while I 'm gone . - ' Cause you know what you 'll get . - What ? What ? W-w-what will you get ? Uh , a ... Large and painful hickey . My god . I beat a man insensible with a strawberry . That 's a big chicken . What a way to go- - to be pecked to death . [ Miles crunching ] mmm . Mmm . Pass the celery . Oh ! [ Grunts ] Here you go . Oh ! Couldn 't you get anything else ? You think it 's easy to run when you 're holding a banana the size of a canoe ? You didn 't get any dessert . There 's no seasoning . There 's no wine . [ Sighs ] I still can 't believe the size of these vegetables . I 'd hate to see what they used for fertilizer . [ Moaning ] - What was that ? - What ? That noise . Didn 't you hear anything ? Are there any strange animals that I should know about here ? Anything weird and futuristic , Like with the body of a crab and the head of a social worker ? How do you know I won 't trick you and turn you into the hands of the police ? How do I know ? 'Cause I think , what the hell . I think maybe you trust me a little now . Maybe you think I got you food , And I 'm not really such a bad guy . Oh ! [ Screams ] Okay , now we 're gonna get a vehicle . And don 't try anything funny or you 'll be sorry . Come on . Oh , our car broke down . Is it possible we could borrow one ? [ Man ] oh , sure . Come on in . Are you okay ? Just fine . My goodness gracious . Just look at yourself . You 're such a mess ! So disheveled . I might have some clothes you could just jump right into . Um , why don 't you just come this way . My car ran out of- - what , honey ? Oh . We have to borrow a car . What are you mumbling about ? Could I use your bathroom ? Yes , yes , of course . Come on in and sit down . Come on in here and you just sit right down here , you little cutie . Hello , police ? Listen . I can 't speak . I 'm with the alien . We 're heading west on the 1600 channel . Um , we should be at the eastern parallel in about a half an hour . Detain him somehow . We 'll be right out . Okay , I 'll try . I 'll try , but I 'm not gonna promise anything . Okay ? We 're on our way . Would you like a stroke ? Me ? No , thanks . I 'm cool . Uh , excuse me . Do you have a space hydrovac suit ? Well , of course . Why ? Are you going on the space shuttle ? Uh . Oh , yes . Yes , I am . Yes , and he forgot his . Reagen , bring out my hydrovac suit right this minute . Here 's your silly old hydrovac suit . Jesus , I could hardly find it . It 's such a mess in that bedroom . What the hell am I gonna do with a hydrovac suit ? If you don 't want the police to recognize you , you gotta take off that robot uniform . Yeah , but what is a hydrovac suit ? It 's for space travel . Use it as a disguise . [ Miles ] I see you 're starting to think a little bit now . Why are we stopping by the river ? I don 't know . I think that we 're lost . Jeez . Hey , look ! What ? [ Air hissing ] Over there ! No , over there ! Should we take her in or get rid of her here ? Me ? But I 'm not the one that you want ! Take her in ! We 'll have her reprogrammed ! What are you talking about ? You 've been contaminated by overexposure to the alien . What ? An unhealthy period of time in the presence of the alien . But I 'm the one who turned him in ! - Let 's get rid of her now . - Oh ! Oh ! - Be one less reprogramming job . - She 'll be fine after the brain treatment . Help ! Orders were for us to use our discretion . I say destroy her . [ Screaming ] Come on ! We 're gonna have to swim for it . I can 't swim ! What do you mean ? I mean , I can 't swim ! But I can 't swim either . Get on top of me . Oh ! Come on . Get on top of me . I don 't want to get wet ! [ Crying ] hurry up . - [ Miles ] paddle ! - I 'm paddling ! Don 't worry . I was a lifeguard at bloomingdale . How could you ? I hate you ! I hate you ! Try not to get upset . They want to destroy me ! Me ! Lean straighter ! Lean left ! Left ! Lean left ! Straighter ! What is it ? It 's a 200-year-old Volkswagen . [ Sighs ] gee . [ Engine starts ] Wow , they really built these things , didn 't they ? " Regis- - register commies , not guns . " What 's that mean ? What ? " Register commies , not guns . " Oh , he was probably a member of the national rifle association . There was a group that helped criminals get guns so they could shoot citizens . It was a public service . I wanna see that . This is a New York times . Be careful . From 1990 . " Pope 's wife gives birth to twins . " wow . We don 't have cities like New York anymore . Really ? No cities at all ? No , but I went to the university at a population center . You went to a university ? That 's hard to believe . For what ? Cosmetics , sexual technique and poetry . No kiddin ' ? They teach you sexual technique in school ? You have to know it in case something goes wrong with the machine . What do you do , switch to manual ? Tsk . Where did you learn about sex ? Me ? From my mother . When I was a kid , I asked her where do babies come from . And she thought I said " rabies . " she said from a dog bite . And a week later a lady on the block gave birth to triplets . I thought she was bitten by a great dane . [ Laughs ] That 's perfect . We 'll dump it in the water . They 'll never find it . What 's it feel like to be dead for 200 years ? It 's like spending a weekend in Beverly Hills . Hey , don 't bother to help . It 's a light car . Were you scared ? Do you believe in god ? Do I believe in god ? [ Panting ] I 'm what you call a tele-ological existential atheist . I believe that there 's an intelligence to the universe ... With the exception of certain parts of new jersey . Why is it I never understand what you 're saying ? Why ? Do you believe in god ? Well , I believe that there 's somebody out there who watches over us . Unfortunately , it 's the government . Miles . Miles , did you ever realize ... That " god " spelled backwards is " dog " ? - Yeah . So ? - Makes you think . Yeah . You wanna push the car , please ? Come , come push the car , will ya ? Ready ? Yeah . All right . Let 's go ! Nice work . Just my luck . It landed on the back of a turtle . [ Miles ] hey , this is where they first brought me . It looks deserted . Oh , we really have gone wrong . [ Luna ] Hey . Hey , look at this . Yeah , I wonder who their decorator is . Shh ! I heard something . What 's the matter ? It 's nothing . It 's probably futuristic mice . Miles , I 'm scared . There 's nothing to be scared of . You 're with me . [ Objects clattering ] [ Gasps ] I did that . [ Continues gasping ] For god sakes , get a grip on yourself . You need a drink . Come on . A drink . Who are you ? Me ? Get off my channel . What are you doing ? Who is that guy ? See , I couldn 't make enough money , uh , playing jazz , So I had to open up the health food place . [ Luna ] weren 't you any good ? Yeah , I was all right . But I always felt that in order to really play jazz , You had to be black . I 'm just a mulatto . You ? Yeah . You knew that about me , didn 't you ? No . Yeah , I am . Come on . You 're joking . No , I wouldn 't kid about something like that . My father was black and my mother was white and vice versa . Oh , come on , Miles . You are joking . Yeah , I 'm always joking . You know that . It 's a defense mechanism . Do you want to perform sex with me ? Perform sex ? I-I-I don 't think I 'm up to a performance . But I 'll rehearse with you if you like . Okay . I just thought you might wanna . They have a machine here . Machine ? I 'm not getting into that thing . I 'm strictly a hand operator . I don 't like anything with moving parts that are not my own . It 's hard to believe that you haven 't had sex for 200 years . Two hundred and four if you count my marriage . What did your wife do ? She was a hit man for the mafia . Was- - was she beautiful ? Yeah , she was great . You know , blonde hair , you know ? Great upturned nose . You know , it was really dynamite . Two blue eyes . One on either side , of course . I liked the arrangement . That 's why I married her . See , you are . You 're teasing me again . Oh , no . Yes . You think I 'm stupid . No . How can you say that ? I think that you 're bright and sensitive and- - Beautiful . Beautiful . Yeah , well then how come you 're not attracted to me ? Men go crazy over me . I 'm great physically . I got a PHD in oral sex . Did they make you take any spanish with that ? What ? Well , I don 't know . I was an english major myself . You know , Chaucer , Pope . I minored in foreplay . It 's a two-credit course at N.Y.U. Miles ! You 're not taking me seriously . What do you want me to say when you say , " do you want to perform sex with me ? " I- - it 's so cold . I need to be warmed up and sent flowers , romanced . Sex is different today , you see ? We don 't have any problems . Everybody 's frigid . Oh , that 's- - that 's incredible . Are the men impotent ? Yeah , yeah , most of them . Except for the ones whose ancestors are italian . Right . I knew there was something in that pasta . You wanna get in the machine now ? Oh , you know , we don 't need that . You know , really , I- - Really , I think it 'd be great if we did , Miles , and I wouldn 't be frigid . You won 't be frigid with me . I- - believe me . Nobody ever is . I got the magic fingers . You 're gonna be- - I swear . I 've cured more women of frigidity . That 's my specialty . Oh . Two minutes in bed with me , and you 'll sell that thing for scrap iron . Really . I got a lot of fast moves . Really . The only thing is I have a little asthma . So if you hear some wheezing while we 're doing it , you know it 's me . But , you know , just give me a decent burial and- - This is the police ! We have the premises surrounded ! Come out with your hands up ! Listen , hide in this room . I 'm gonna lead them away . Find your way to the western district , contact the underground . And find out what the aires project is . Will you remember that name ? Yes , the jupiter project . The aires project . The aires project . But what about you ? Don 't worry about me , honey . I 'm like a cat . I 'll always wind up on my feet . Oh . Oh . Oh . Mr. Monroe ? I 'm Dr. Nero , your orientation advisor . I 'm here to supervise the initial phase of your assimilation into society , The society that will take care of your needs and desires ... More efficiently than any you might have thought possible .

You want trousers , we got trousers . This is a good time , believe me . We 're having a big sale . Tremendous . Positively the lowest prices . Maybe you need a nice double-knit . Incidental , I 'm stuck with three pieces corduroy . [ Nero ] Uh , something simple . We got simple , complicated . - Why do you worry ? - Who put away that shipment downstairs ? Why do you bother me ? I got a customer . You know what you 're doing ? That was all velvet . So it 's velvet . Leave me alone . I got a customer . - Why do you need so much velvet ? - What ? Where do we come to velvet ? I 'll talk to you later . Uh , I 'm in a little bit of a rush here , if it 's okay . Talk to me now . You know what your mistakes are costing ' us ? Drop dead .

I 'm rags . Is he housebroken or will he be leaving little batteries all over the floor ? Don 't yell . We 're with the underground . - [ Beep ] - um , once this week , I questioned my supervisor . And , uh , I missed a couple of minutes of our leader 's speech on television . And , um , you know that blonde girl Rainer who works in my office with me- - She 's got- - with the long blonde hair and the great tomatoes ? Um , well , we 've been sneaking into the slide projection room on our lunch hour ... And making love together . And I know if they catch us , it 's against the rules . But , uh , I-I can 't help it . Because , um- - uh , and I hope that you forgive me . [ Making cash machine sounds ] [ Luna ] hello , Miles . - Who are you ? - Who am I ? I 'm luna . - Who ? - Luna . Don 't you remember ? We were outlaws , aliens . The police captured you . I escaped . I 'm with the underground . Remember ? The western district ? Miles , I 'm luna . Luna , remember ? Luna . Your name is not luna , is it ? Think back , Miles . 1973 ? The happy carrot health food store ? The ragtime rascals ? - You 're the alien . - That 's right , Miles . I 've come for you . How did you get in here ? Don 't come near me . Rags ! Rags ! Miles . Get in here . Woof , woof . Hello . I 'm rags . We 're not gonna hurt you . - Come on , fella . Get her . Go for her throat , rags . - Hello . I 'm rags . Woof , woof , woof . We 're not going to hurt you . We 're going to reprogram your mind . We 're going to free it . Rags , get her . Hello . I 'm rags . Woof , woof , woof . Go ahead . Goddamn dog . Hello . I 'm rags . [ Whistles ] Hello . I 'm rags . Woof , woof . Hello . I 'm rags . Woof , woof , woof . Hello . I 'm rags . Woof , woof , woof , woof . We have a good file on him . We 'll induce a hypnotic state ... And force him to reexperience some of the major traumas of his life . Hopefully , this will shatter his recent personality ... And allow the old one to emerge again . [ Moans ] my orb . My orb . You don 't need that anymore , Miles . Now , listen to me , Miles . It 's the year 1962 . It 's time for that sunday dinner at your parents ' house . Your parents ' house ? In Brooklyn ? On K avenue . [ Miles gasping , panting ] [ Imitating Miles ' mother ] Nu , what are you standing there ? Come in . Your food is getting cold . - [ Imitating Miles ' father ] let 's eat . - Miles , take some peas . Soon the passover holidays are coming , and you 'll be wanting to wear your matzos . No , I got something to tell you . Arlene and I have to get a divorce . She thinks I 'm a pervert because I drank our water bed . [ Speaking yiddish ] [ Erno speaking yiddish ] What will themgoyimsay ? No , no ! Stop whining and eat your shiksa . [ Groaning ] [ With southern accent ] oh , no . No , please , don 't let in the light . Oh , cover those lights , please . Please , don 't get up . I was just passing through . Oh ! Erno . Oh ! Erno , what 's happening ? Something 's gone wrong with the treatment . His brain is locked somewhere else . He believes he 's another person . No , no . I need- - Miles . Miles . Who are you , Miles ? I 'm blanche . Blanche dubois . It means " white woods . " He 's like a sleepwalker . We can 't upset him or it could be fatal . - What are we going to do ? - Well , you 've read Streetcar Named Desire . Just play along with him . He needs another injection . Physical beauty is passing . A transitory possession . But beauty of the mind and richness of the spirit and tenderness of the heart , And I have all those things . Aren 't taken away but- - but grow , increase with the years . Strange that I should be called a destitute woman ... When I have all these riches locked in my heart . [ As marlon brando ] I been onto you from the start . I seen how you try to sprinkle this place up ... With them powders and those fancy french colognes . Well , I say , ha ! You hear me ? Ha ! Ha ! I- - I- - I think- - I- - yeah . Why- - why , you 're not the gentleman that I was expecting . What 's going on ? Whoever you are , I 've always depended on the kindness of strangers . How you feelin ' , Miles ? Oh , you look beautiful . You- - you were screaming out different names in your sleep . I was having sexual nightmares . Who are the AP gypsies ? Oh , you look so different . I feel different , Miles . I 've spent the past six months living like a wild animal . Really ? That 's right , Miles . All of us . All of us in the underground , we all live day to day on our cunning and our instinct . We 're all a pack of wild animals . [ Man ] lunch , luna . While you were being a pawn in a capitalistic society , - Erno 's been teaching me the beauty of Karl Marx . - Who 's been teaching you ? Erno . Oh , Miles , you absolutely must meet him . He 's wonderful . Someday in a few months he 's going to lead the revolution ... And start a Marxist regime . Government by the workers and the downtrodden masses . You remind me of Lisa Sorenson . Who ? An old girlfriend of mine from the village . A trotskyite who became a Jesus freak ... And who was arrested for selling pornographic connect-the-dots books . Miles , I wrote a song about the revolution . There 's not gonna be any revolution unless we stop the Aires project . Don 't you worry about that . You just relax . Now , listen . ? Rebels are we ? ? Born to be free ? ? Just like the fish in the sea ? Ooh , I 'm sorry . I didn 't know that you were kissing . Oh , Miles , I was just telling Erno about aires day . He has a plan , Miles . You tell him , Erno . Right , darling . Miles , this is a one-channel radio . Wha-what , darling ? Now , this- - this is a phony thumbprint . It 'll allow her to pass through the security scanning device . [ Luna ] We 're gonna steal operating gowns and pose as doctors . And that 's how we 're gonna get inside . Okay , try not to appear nervous . Smile . Peasants . Relax . You 're shaking like a leaf . How do you want me to shake ? Everything 's gonna be fine . So how come you 're shaking ? 'Cause you 're- - you 're making me nervous . Don 't blame me . [ Nervous chuckling ] hello . Would you get a grip on yourself ? You 'd probably feel a lot safer with Mr. White-teeth back there . Who ? The rebel chieftain with the wall-to-wall muscles on his chest . You mean Erno ? Erno . It 's a great name if you happen to be the star of a vampire movie . He 's brilliant . Yeah , I know . He couldn 't be with us today . He 's gotta go take his handsome lesson . Oh , you 're jealous . Jealous ? Are you kidding ? With a body like mine , you don 't get jealous . Certainly you don 't expect me to tie myself down to one man . My love is a free gift to all the Bolshevik brothers . Do what you want . You 're over 21 . Little tramp . We 're here on business . Free love . I created a bohemian monster . Next thing you know she 'll wanna have group sex with the robots . Will you shut up ? You 're attracting attention . Give her a couple of books to read , And right away she 's miss pseudo-intellectual , neo-fascist , Hegelian , freudian monster . We don 't have to go through this if you 're gonna get hysterical . Just get your part right . Don 't worry about me . If it gets screwed up , it 's because of you . " If it gets screwed up , it 's because of you . " Oh , you 're retarded . I 'm on a mission with a retarded man . All right , just get your part right . No , you get your part right . I don 't know what the hell I 'm doing here . I 'm 237 years old . I should be collecting social security . Do you remember the diagram ? Here 's the fast forward . That 's the dual control . That 's the manual . That 's the overheat . That 's the rewind . We 've been over all this . Yes , I know , but I wanna make sure you got it . I 'm the guy that 's going out the window . It 's a long drop to the pavement . I 'm liable to bruise my smock . All right , Miles , don 't worry . I got it . This is the manual . - No , that 's the rewind . - Then this is the manual . No , that 's the dual control . I thought you said you had it . I do . I have it . I have it . Do you love Erno ? Oh , Miles , I don 't know . Uh- - All right , the coast is clear . Start lowering me . - This is ... Manual . - No , that 's fast forward ! Oh ! Oh , Miles . Oh ! Oh , look , I- - I , uh- - I got some of the tape around . For a minute I thought you didn 't know how to work the machine . Erno said to take the north escalator . I 'm running this , not Erno . We 're going my way . It 's Erno 's plan . He knows what he 's talking about . Why ? ' Cause he 's handsome , so he knows everything ? He 's got capped teeth . Did you know that about Erno ? He 's got capped teeth . Every one . He 's got capped gums . Erno is an architect and a mathematician . Yeah , but can he do this ? You 're an idiot . Fine . We 're going my way . Oh , Dr. Temkin , there you are . Will you come with us ? The meeting is this way . Doctor . We 're doctors . We 're two big doctors . We 're not impostors . Dr. Temkin , could we please ? Big doctor . Eyes , ear , nose and throat . Please , may we ? May we , doctor , please ? Nice work . That 's a bad break . They think we 're someone else . I know . If we 'd followed Erno 's instructions , everything 'd be okay . I don 't wanna hear about Erno anymore . That 's the only thing that makes me s-stutter . It 's always Erno . I 'm tired of hearing about him . No more Erno . Shut up , shut up , shut up ! All right . [ Man 's voice ] gentlemen , none of you have ever met before ... For obvious reasons of security . But now Aires day is here . I realize that what I 'm about to say will come as a great shock . However , I 'm counting on you to respond appropriately . Ten months ago , our leader suffered a horrible accident ... When a bomb , planted in his home by members of the underground , exploded . Naturally , it was kept quiet . But since then , we have virtually been a leaderless society . Unfortunately , preparations for a successor ... Have never been adequately clear . In short , we have been in the throes of a major crisis . As for our leader , The emergency department rushed to the scene of the accident immediately , But all that remained of him was this . This is our leader 's nose . Using great presence of mind , We rushed the nose to our closest Delta laboratory which is here ... Where , through massive biochemical effort , It has been kept alive for nearly a year . Our dream has been that by cloning , We would reduplicate the entire leader again . Cloning , for those of you unfamiliar with biology , Is a process by which using one single cell , A duplicate of the person it came from could be formed . Till now we 've only had limited experimental success . But all efforts have been directed to cloning over the past ten months . And now we feel confident we can reproduce our leader ... In perfect tact from his nose . Gentlemen , with god 's help , in a couple of hours , We will have our leader back . And we will then coordinate aires phase two ... Which will exterminate all dissident factions on signal ... From our reborn leader . Miles , it 's a nose . Yes , I know . I was right here . What are we gonna do ? Radio Erno immediately . Now is the time to strike . The leader is suffering from a terrific handicap . He has no head or body . We 're not fully prepared . It doesn 't matter . They 're in a state of chaos . If we strike quick , we got ' em . Okay , give me the radio . I dropped the radio . You dropped the radio ? It fell out of my pocket when I was hanging outside . Fell out of your pocket- - Will you stop repeating everything I say ? Will you stop repeating everything I say ? Get a grip on yourself . We gotta stop ' em . There 's only one way . We gotta steal the nose . How ? Uh , I don 't know . I never stole an organ before . Wait a minute ! I got an idea . The nose is in the operating chamber . Right . We go to the floor below , cut a hole in the ceiling ... [ Repeating ] Big enough to slide through , come up under the nose and hide it under my coat . It 's a stupid plan . There 's no chance . What 's wrong ? Because it 's too subtle . We have no time for that . We 're dressed like doctors . We go into the operating room . You create a diversion , and I 'll steal the nose . Great ! Ooh . Miles , I 'm scared . Take it easy , will you ? You took some skin there . Here . What is that ? A table lighter ? You gave it to me from Melik 's . Before they captured you . Where have you been hiding it ? Don 't tell me . Ooh . The trick in these situations is to remain cool . Miles , you 're biting my nails . 'Cause you 're tense . We 're here to see the nose . I heard it was running . Dr. Temkin , we 're ready on this end . You don 't mind if some of our younger people ... Who are not involved in genetic programming just observe ? No . Not at all . I like to be watched while I clone . The more the merrier . I never- - I never- - never clone alone . [ Computer voice ] Hello , Dr. Temkin . So nice to see you . I 'm bio-central computer 2100 , series G. I 'll be assisting you through the entire process . May I say , doctor , we 're all aware of your reputation ... And we look forward to a successful and rewarding cloning procedure . This is my- - my assistant . D-d-Dr . Spock . Janis . J-j-j-janis . Dr. Spock . - Dr. Spanis . - Dr. Spanish . - Dr. Snot . - Dr. Slavish . I better have a look at the patient . Oh , wow . It 's in a lot worse shape than I thought . Better lay off armenian women . You can see the coded medical history on readout four . I believe that this is going to be a ... Very difficult croning job . Oh , yes . Cloning , you idiot , not croning . Cloning ! - We 're ready to proceed . - Uh- - hmm . After looking at the nose , I get the feeling that what we ought to do perhaps is postpone the cloning . Excuse me , doctor , but that would be a tragic mistake . See , I think what the computer is failing to take into account ... Is what I call the Pinocchio factor , Which states that the square root of the proboscis ... Is equal to the sum of the sinuses ... Over seven . Well , what is your opinion , doctor ? Should we proceed with the cloning or should we postpone ? Ah , indeed . I , uh- - one moment . A moment . A medical moment . Yes . Well , uh- - Yes , I believe that we should go ahead with the cloning . Go ahead with the- - excuse me . I have to have a conference with the doctor . Doctor , for a second if you 'll just come over here . I just wanna speak to you about that . What do you mean go ahead with the cloning ? What are we supposed to do ? I don 't know how to clone a nose . You 're crazy ! [ Both arguing ] [ Arguing continues ] Doctor , please proceed . [ Miles ] stop it ! You stop it . Get a grip on yourself . Of course I 'm glad you put it to me in that fashion . And now if you 'll let me have the lobster fork , please . What you have here- - I diagnosed the entire situation , And I think what we 've got , what we 're dealing with basically is a nose . I think we 're all in aggreance on that . I have the little beggar right here . And what you want basically is a whole entire person ... connected to that nose , right ? Otherwise , you 'd get your money back . Now , did you want me to leave room for a moustache , 'Cause there 's a nice area in there which it 'll- - It 's , um- - what- - It 's clever . She 's clever . What the doctor is doing here- - we 're placing down the garments , 'cause we 're gonna clone . We 're gonna make an attempt to clone the patient directly into his suit . And that way , he 'll be completely dressed at the end of the operation . It 's a first in cloning , and then we could all just get the hell out of here . We don 't have to hang around the clothing room while he suits up . I think it 's time to check the cell structure . Suggest it 's- - checking the cell structure . Checking the cell structure ! Ah , checking the cell structure . Checking ... The cell structure . [ Miles ] the structure cells to be checked . Checking the cell structure . [ Whistles ] checking the cell structure . Checking the cell structure . Checking the cell structure . And now the cell structure has been checked . I thank you so much . And now I 'll just take my mask , if you don 't mind , And I 'll strap it on to my face . And if you 'll excuse me for one second ... While I give the patient a quick nostrilectomy . Uh , this is it . Keep your fingers crossed . Something 's going wrong . There 's been a current break in the life-support system . What I think we should do- - [ man ] what 's that you 've got under your mask ? Pardon me ? Under my mask ? Nothing . Why ? Is- - does- - does it look excessively bulbous ? He 's got the nose . He 's got the nose under his mask . He 's got the nose . Quick ! Quickly ! All right , nobody move or I shoot your president . All right , come on . We 're getting out of here . Don 't come near me . I 'm warning you , or he gets it right between the eyes . He 'll do it . I 've seen him shoot a nose . Please , please , please be careful . You don 't realize that you 've been dealing ... With one of the greatest minds you 've ever seen . Yeah , and his isn 't so bad either . Yeah . Don 't come near us . All right . Get out of here now . He 's bluffing . He wouldn 't shoot the nose . Bluffing , am I ? Okay , clowns , you asked for it . Miles , I can 't believe it . I cannot believe that we actually did it . An eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth and a nose for a nose . I don 't know what the hell that means , but it sounds brilliant . Oh , Miles , you were absolutely wonderful . Just think . Erno 's plan worked . What do you mean Erno 's plan ? What was I through all of that ? What do you mean you ? It was Erno 's plan ? Look , I cannot get into this discussion about Erno with you . I 'm getting a hostility ache , and I 'm- - a migraine headache now . And I haven 't seen my analyst in 200 years . And he was a strict freudian . And if I 'd been going all this time , I 'd probably almost be cured by now . Miles , Erno 's going to lead the revolution and head the new government . Look , don 't you understand ? In six months , we 'll be stealing Erno 's nose . Political solutions don 't work . I told you that . It doesn 't matter who 's up there . They 're all terrible . The political men- - what are you looking at me like that for ? I think you really love me . Of course I love you . This is what- - this is what this is all about . And you love me . I know that . And I don 't blame you , honey . You know , I- - I- - I- - and I 'm not knocking Erno . He 's great if you happen to like ... A tall , blonde Prussian , Nordic , Aryan Nazi type . But , Miles , meaningful relationships between men and women don 't last . That was proven by science . You see , there 's a chemical in our bodies ... That makes it all so that we all get on each other 's nerves sooner or later . Hey , that 's science . I don 't believe in science . You know , science is an intellectual dead end . You know , it 's a lot of guys in tweed suits cutting up frogs ... On foundation grants and- - Oh , I see . You don 't believe in science . And you also don 't believe that the political systems work . And you don 't believe in god , huh ? Right . So then , what do you believe in ? Sex and death . Two things that come once in my lifetime . But at least after death you 're not nauseous .

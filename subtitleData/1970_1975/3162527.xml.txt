 Fire ! How 's the pain ? The bullet must have lodged close to a nerve , Pete . Is that bad ? - We gotta get him to a hospital . - Yeah . Great , Pete , what hospital ? Our Blue Cross expired about a thousand years ago . There is a medical center outside Central City . Come on , Galen , you must be out of your mind . We walk into an ape hospital , forget about reading any more stories . - How good is that medical center ? - It 's the best in the world . This world . I 'm not gonna let you two stick out your necks . Look , even if we do get him in there the apes don 't exactly reserve their best medical treatment for humans . I know the chief surgeon . She 'll help us . - Galen , we 're enemies of the state . - Alan , you 've got no choice . She 's a physician . She doesn 't care about your politics . And even if she did know about you she wouldn 't turn her back on anyone in trouble . - You know that ? - Yes . Yes , we used to be very close once . In fact , we were gonna get married , but things didn 't work out . But we are still the best of friends . - Look , I 'll be back as soon as I can . - Galen , no . I 'll be all right . I know a back route to the city . I 'll be fine traveling alone . And don 't you worry about my being able to convince Kira . I happen to be an expert on feminine psychology . Galen ... Nothing . Kira , I watched the operation . You did a brilliant job . Technically brilliant . And the patient died . The operation was a success . The knowledge we learn from failures will someday benefit other patients , other surgeons . That 's not a very satisfying philosophy . You think I 'm cruel ? You can tell me the truth . Tell the truth to my superior ? I could be fired for such recklessness . Only a fool would fire his best and most beautiful surgeon . I 'll see you at the conference tomorrow night , won 't I ? - Conference ? - A private lecture I 'm giving on the therapeutic virtues of vegetable casserole and apricot wine . I 'm holding it in my apartment at 8 . - Is attendance mandatory ? - Only for you . In that case , I 'll be there . Hello , Kira . As simple as that . This to remind me , a casual hello and everything else is forgotten . - Not everything . - Go away , Galen . - Kira , I need your help . - You are a criminal and a traitor . - Come on , you don 't really believe that . - What else would I believe ? I don 't wanna argue with you . - Go away . It 's dangerous for you here . - Kira , a friend of mine has been hurt . You don 't have any friends but renegade humans . Unless you help him , he may die . Why should I care if a human dies ? Well , if for no other reason , because I care a very great deal . Well , I don 't know you anymore . You 're a stranger who has chosen to live with humans . Is that such a dreadful crime ? - I should call the police . - They 'd kill me . They 'd be doing justice . I loved you . To hear you say those words now ... I 'm sorry I came . Galen . You were a decent , law-abiding ape once . What happened ? Well , I had this terrible accident . I collided with the truth . I discovered that humans and apes are supposed to be equals , not masters and slaves . Do you really believe that ? Oh , yes . Yes . And to help you , I must help them ? They are my brothers now . Oh , Galen . I thought I 'd forgotten you . I had a chance to find a new happiness . I should have known you 'd come back to destroy that chance . - What took you so long ? - I had to pick up a medical degree . This is for that renowned specialist Dr. Adrian . - Wonderful . And this ... This is a smock . - And it 's for his faithful servant . - Naturally . Well , under the circumstances , it was the best position available . Listen , even if this crazy masquerade works that hospital 's miles away . I can barely stand , let alone walk . I 'd never make it . My dear Alan , a patient of your eminence should not have to walk at all . Not at all . - Yeah , well ? - I 'm delivering grain for the prefect . I need help . He will beat me if I 'm late . You didn 't seem excited about my vegetable casserole . - Did I put too much honey in it ? - Oh , no , it was delicious . Really . It 's just that ... - Well , I 'm not very hungry tonight . - Something worrying you ? That orderly that we sent to disciplinary camp for disobeying orders do you think we dealt with him a little bit too harshly ? He behaved like an unruly beast . Like a beast , he deserved to be punished . - Where is the harshness ? - But are humans nothing but beasts ? At their best , they 're useful animals . At their worst , they 're carriers of hatred and destruction . Come in . I 'm sorry for interrupting , director . There 's a new arrival , a Dr. Adrian . Dr. Adrian ? That 's the doctor you mentioned to me . I 'll show him to his rooms . - Thank you for a lovely evening . - My pleasure . - Hello , Dr. Adrian . - Dr. Kira , I 'm sorry we are late . We met with this accident . My personal servant has been injured . Travin , make room for these two in the humans ' quarters . - Yes , doctor . - I 'll show you to your room , Dr. Adrian . - Yes . - Where ? - Put him on that bed . Now , wait a minute . Wait a minute . Not here . He needs his own room . I have my own room . All the other humans sleep here . Put him down . Now , look , he 's very sick . - He needs special care . - Pete ... We don 't provide special care for sick humans . If a man is sick , he rests . If he lives , he returns to work . That 's a very progressive system , but it doesn 't apply to us . It applies to everyone . - Pete , let it alone . - We work exclusively for Dr. Adrian . He gets very nervous when his servants get pushed around . So whatever passes for luxury accommodations , that 's where he goes . - Let it alone . - Would you prefer that I have Dr. Adrian report you to Dr. Kira ? - In there . - Thanks , I really appreciate it . This is terrific . What is it , dried mule hoofs ? You wouldn 't have some sauce for a taste-killer , would you ? We have what we have . - Thank you . - Don 't talk to her ! I was just gonna ask her her name . She has no name . Look , everybody 's got a name . Her name was taken from her . She is no one . What did she do , criticize the chef ? The girl is his daughter . - All right , Kira , what do you think ? - It 's no good . All the medical texts deal with apes . There 's nothing on humans . But you know where the bullet is . We know the bullet is lying near a nerve . We don 't know what the nerve looks like or where it runs . It may be in an area of large blood vessels . - Lf we go in blindly , we could kill him . - Which proves that you do care what happens to him . I 'm a surgeon . I don 't just go blundering in with a knife to see what will happen . To operate in ignorance is butchery . Kira , if I could find a book on human anatomy , would it help ? There are no books on human anatomy . What ape would bother to write one ? No , I mean a human book . What are you talking about ? Humans do not write medical texts . They used to . A long , long time ago when they ruled the Earth . - You 're really mad , aren 't you ? - No . I 've seen such books . Where ? In the fantasies of your deranged mind ? No , in Zaius ' study . Kira , I thought you were scheduled to give a lecture to the staff this morning . Yeah . I postponed it . I wanted to show Dr. Adrian our facilities . Dr. Adrian . What 's your impression , doctor ? It 's fantastic . Absolutely fantastic . Far beyond anything I 've seen in my life . Of course , I 'm not certain that I would agree with all of your procedures . And what quarrel do you have with our procedures , doctor ? - I wouldn 't wish to cause any offense . - No , no , no . We 'd be most happy to hear your learned opinion , wouldn 't we , Dr. Kira ? Oh , yes . Yes , Dr. Adrian is very renowned in his field . As I see it , there 's altogether too much emphasis these days upon surgery , everything from a broken leg to the vapors . Now , while I do believe that surgery is necessary in some cases I prefer a more conservative approach to medicine . You mean a special potion for every ailment ? Yes . And , or leeches . Except , of course , in the case of a common cold . That misfortune still has myself and others in my field stumped . I like our visitor , Kira . Do your best to keep him here . I look forward to working with you , doctor . Yes . Thank you . " I look forward to working with you , doctor . " You were a great help . Do you think that man is a fool ? I mean , this whole thing is ridiculous ! This crazy imposture , this mysterious book in Zaius ' library . I will get you that book . With that in your hands , you can advance our medicine . - That book is life . - Lf we 're caught , it means death . If we get caught I 'll confess that I forced you to do this by threatening your life . Do you think I want you to die ? No one wants to die , human or ape . But we can 't turn back now . We can 't . Check the instincts . This isn 't it . - Where is it ? - It 's all right , Alan . - They 're apes . - It 's okay . - This world is run by apes ! - Take it easy . Come on . What is he saying ? Everyone knows the world is run by apes . What does he mean , " This isn 't Earth " ? I didn 't realize orderlies here did psychological studies of the patients . - I only meant ... - He 's having fever hallucinations . Take care of him . If he dies , I 'll have to break in a new orderly . - I 'll hold you personally responsible . - Yes , doctor . That guy worries me . Cut it out . I said , cut it out ! Stop ! What 's going on here ? Tell me . Lafer , what happened ? It was her fault . She spilled the water . You beat her because she spilled the water ? All of us are required to discipline the girl . It 's our duty . The girl is evil and must be punished so the evil doesn 't touch us . She 's your daughter . I have no daughter . Sir , I don 't wish to be insolent but humans are forbidden to carry knives in this city . My servant is permitted to do what I tell him to do . Sir ? This is the guard . Good . This human who attacked you , what did he look like ? I don 't know . I couldn 't tell . All humans look alike . Well , that 's true . How many of them were there ? You must have seen something . What was it ? There were two . One was a human , the other a chimpanzee . You 're saying an ape helped a human commit a crime ? I am handling this . Are you sure you 're not spreading some kind of a hallucination ? What ... Look at me ! Now , what you 're trying to say is that you were frightened and you couldn 't tell who it was who attacked you . Isn 't that right ? - Yes , sir . - Good . Now , you 've done your duty . You can go now . Stupid country ape . A chimpanzee helping a human . Cleon , you are a fool . This patrol that sighted the astronauts the other day how sure were they of the sighting ? That patrol belongs to one of our best garrisons . They 're absolutely certain the astronauts were heading into the Northern Mountains , away from Central City . Could they have changed directions and come back toward Central City ? This is the most heavily patrolled area in the world . It isn 't logical they 'd take such a risk . Logical ! If they were logical , they would not be human ! They 're driven by strange impulses . I think I 'll cancel my trip into the New Territories . I think I 'll stay right here for a few more days . Yes , sir . - Have you been this route before ? - A few times . Halt ! - Restricted area . What you doing here ? - Emergency . We have been summoned to the house of Zaius . - Zaius ? - He has had a heart attack . Are we going to spend the rest of the day discussing it ? No , sir . We 'll give you an escort . Proceed . Sally . Oh , Sally . Don 't go away . Honey , I 'll get home as soon as I find the ship . Wait for me . Sally , please . No . - No ! - No , calm yourself . It 's Dr. Kira . I 'm sorry . I was having a bad dream . - Where 's Pete and Galen ? - They 've gone to get a surgical book . Supposedly written by one of your doctors a thousand years ago . I 'm a scientist , to deal in realities . Even if this mysterious book exists your chances of survival are virtually hopeless . - Then why bother to operate ? - There 's a chance that we may learn something . Something that would help us to treat our own patients someday . Is that the only reason ? Do you think I have some feeling for Galen or for your friend or for you ? - Maybe . Galen means no more to me than you do . Understand ? I understand the words . - Humans are nothing . You have no character no sense of honor , no loyalty . If they did , you never would have let them bring you here . Galen is risking his life . You can 't even see the danger he 's in because of you . Because you are blind and sentimental . You can 't control your thoughts or your emotions . And you will destroy Galen and your friend ! And you 'll all be destroyed . - Where do you think you are going ? - Inside . If Zaius needs help ... My dear fellow , Zaius has had a heart attack . Now , that is a medical condition , not a criminal offense . So you would be much better off guarding this ambulance . A colleague of mine had the wheels stolen off his cart almost within sight of the police garrison . Terrible . Terrible . Stay here . Come on . Galen , come on ! I was just remembering the happy hours I spent in this room talking with Zaius . There . There it is , as always . - It 's locked . - No , it isn 't . - Where did you learn to do that ? - Jersey City . P.S. 103 . - That 's it . That 's the one . - Good . Now that we got it , how we gonna get it out of here ? Here , Pete . - Help , please . - What ? Come on . - There we go . - You sly little monkey , you . - Now we need some pillows . - Pillows . Right . Got them . My diagnosis is , not only is he suffering from a heart attack but a most severe heart attack . Oh , yes . I can 't even find his pulse . Come on , come on . Galen . - What ? - The candle . - Set ? - Yes . Diagrams of the circulatory system . Surgical procedures . Is this a medical text or a work of fiction ? You knew the answer the moment you saw it . I can 't believe that a human wrote this . If Zaius knew about it , why didn 't he let us know ? Political reasons . If humans could write books like this would they be content to be slaves ? Zaius was afraid that it would mean the end of our civilization . What if he was right ? Come in . Dr. Adrian 's servant is very sick . Watch out for the apes . It 's an ambush . You can 't trust them . Look out . We can 't delay that operation much longer . Send for Galen . He 's a good ape . Trust him . - We may not be able to operate on him . - What ? What do you mean ? His hallucinations indicate the bullet has moved closer to a nerve . If we try to operate , that could cause severe internal bleeding . In his condition , he can 't stand any kind of a blood loss . We can transfuse blood during the operation . Blood transfer is impossible . We tried it a few years ago . - On apes ? - On a human . The patient suffered a severe reaction . Died within minutes after the blood transfer . Leander concluded that transferring blood is against the laws of nature . You must have tried it with a mismatched donor . There 's a simple blood test we can do to find a compatible donor . Surely there must be one among all these humans . Now , this won 't hurt . Now , see , I told you . We 've only got 11 samples . - I was told there are 12 humans here . - There are only 11 . - What about the girl ? - She is not a person . You better go get her anyway . - I don 't take orders from you . - One moment . It could be dangerous to tamper with these people 's taboos . - Now , do you really need this girl ? - Virdon 's blood type is AB negative . Statistically , there 's about one chance in 10 of finding a compatible donor . - Where is the girl ? - These blood samples ... - Is it permissible to ask what they 're for ? - It is not permissible . Where is the girl ? Cleaning the hall . Got it . Thanks very much , folks , that 's all . Hi . I just wanna talk to you . No one may speak to me except through my father . Well , we 're in luck . He just told me that I could speak to you . - I need you to help me . - How can I help you ? We 're running some tests . It 's an experiment Dr. Adrian 's conducting . We wanna take a small sample of everybody 's blood . - I 'm sorry . - Now , wait a minute . Hold it . It 'll only be a bit of blood , like you just scratched your finger . It won 't hurt . And , you know , it 's gonna be kind of hard to turn a really important ape doctor like Dr. Adrian down . Oh , yeah . Look , for what it 's worth , I promise I won 't let anything happen to you . I won 't let anyone hit you anymore . And I 'll even take the blood myself . Didn 't know I could do that , did you ? Trust me . I trust you . No good . It 's an O positive . That leaves us with two compatible donors . An AB negative and an O negative . One of them is that clown I clobbered . I hope his blood 's in better shape than his brain . Brigid , where 's Lafer ? Answer the question . - He 's not here . - One can see that . He heard that someone was going to have to take all his blood away . He was afraid . He ran off . - Please , may I go now ? - Yes , yes , yes . You said there was another eligible donor ? I hope you did . I 'll get her . You want to take my blood ? The procedure is safe . You can save his life . No ! - Listen to me ! - Let go of me ! - I won 't hurt you , I promise . - No , please ! I know that there are superstitions ... I said , hold it ! Listen to me ! I know there are superstitions that giving blood drains life . That 's nonsense . I wouldn 't do anything to hurt you . I told you I can 't give you my blood ! I 'm evil ! - Now , please let me go . - Who says you 're evil ? Why ? - Please , leave me alone . - Tell him . I said , tell him . - Please . - Tell him . I killed my brother . He was 16 . My only son . It was a hunting accident . They took him back to the center . The doctors were doing experiments with blood transfer . It was the only time they ever tried such a thing . I told them they could use my son in the experiment . I wasn 't putting his life in danger . He was dying . - This was a way to save him . - So , what happened ? My daughter gave him her blood . The boy died . She killed him with her evil blood . All right , now listen to me . Her blood was not evil . It was incompatible . It was the wrong chemical type , that 's all . That 's what killed your son . That transfusion should never have been tried . If she gives your friend her blood , he 'll die just like my son . Okay , little lady . Now , just lie still . And when I tell you to you can start squeezing on that piece of wood , okay ? Pulse is 72 . Respiration is normal . This book was written by humans , now what if it 's wrong ? - It 's a little late for that now , isn 't it ? - Be quiet , both of you . We 're ready to start , Kira . Yes . Kira , why didn 't you tell me you were operating ? That is my fault , doctor . I was supposed to notify you . I forgot . I 'm terribly sorry . What kind of operation is this ? A bullet wound . The nerve system may be affected . How did the human get a bullet wound ? Well , you see , doctor , my colleagues and I were attacked by this bear . Now , fortunately , we were able to subdue the beast . But , unfortunately , my orderly was accidentally shot . Now , Dr. Kira is going to try a new experimental surgical technique of mine . And if it works , doctor ... Think . Just think . It can be applied to apes . The girl . You 're planning a blood transfer ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to do anything wrong . - You stay right where you are . - There could be intensive bleeding . We tried a blood transfer with her once , it didn 't work . But this is a new process , doctor . One that I have been trying in my clinic . If what you say is true we may be on the threshold of a breakthrough in medicine . May I join you ? A pleasure , doctor . A pleasure . Would you mind just wearing this mask ? Yes , we find it very useful in protecting us from the vapors . You practice a fascinating kind of medicine , Dr. Adrian . I 'm quite eager to watch you in action . Dr. Adrian , better put a clamp on that bleeding vessel . It is so seldom that a country doctor has the opportunity to see a surgeon such as yourself at work . I would like to watch you . It 's only some minor bleeding . However ... I can 't reach the bullet . It 's trapped between a nerve cluster and a large blood vessel . There 's no way of removing that . You 'd better close up . Wait a minute . Make a second incision , 3 inches below the first . We 'll try to get the bullet from below the entry point . - What is he saying ? Who is he ? - My orderly . An orderly giving instructions to Dr. Kira ? Let me see that book . The book ! Well , I see you have things well in hand , doctors . I think I can resume my other duties now . Dr. Leander . I think you better stay . - Did he force you to do this ? - No . - Then why ? - I 'm a doctor . - I have no right to reject the truth . - The truth ? That book is not truth ! - That book is treason and madness ! - That book exists . And to deny what exists is madness . Go on with the transfer . He 'll die . I know he 'll die . If I had been here instead of at a council meeting I wouldn 't have thought it necessary to call the police over a minor burglary . In my opinion , no crime is minor . Do you have a key for this cabinet ? - Why ? - Well , let 's call it intellectual curiosity . Even a brutish policeman has the right to expand the potential of his limited mind . Thank you . Very impressive , this . Very impressive and dangerous . You should have burned these as I warned you long ago . One day , these books will serve us . They will enslave us , Zaius . And the process has already begun . Look . Look , Zaius , one of them is missing . Our burglar , it seems , was a better critic than we supposed . What does the burglar have , Zaius ? A volume on human politics or a manual of war ? A book of surgery ! Well , is there anything else ? No , Zaius . No . You 've told me everything I need to know . Fascinating . The blood transfer seems to be working . Maybe now you 'll change your mind about us humans . On the contrary . This whole exercise merely demonstrates the low level of your intelligence . Even if your friend survives , he 'll hinder your escape . You would have done much better letting him die in the forest . Kira ! Look ! Look ! I can 't get a pulse . Doctor ! The anesthesia affected his heart . There 's a stimulant ... What , don 't you trust an ape surgeon ? Or are you waiting for verification from the great Dr. Mather ? That small bottle on the second shelf . I 'm getting a pulse . Thank you , doctor . I don 't like to see patients dying in my operating room . It 's bad for morale . There it is . The bullet . Come on , let 's close up . - That 's it . - Is he gonna be all right ? Yeah , he 'll be all right , thanks to you . I think you can probably forget about that nonsense about your evil blood . He should have an uneventful recovery . Listen . Leander , listen . Urko . - You ! - Me ? - Yes , you . Come here . - Yes , sir . We 're looking for two humans and a renegade ape . Listen , we 're looking for some fugitives . - Where are they hiding ? - Fugitives ? - Yes , two humans with a chimpanzee . - I don 't understand . - You 're lying ! - Urko . The shouting is disturbing my patients . It 's all right , Travin , you can go . - The astronauts are here . - Astronauts ? Humans . Two humans . Special humans . Different . They ... - One may be wounded . - Oh , those . - Yes , where are they ? - Gone . - Gone ? Where ? - I don 't know where . No . I suggest you go too , as quickly as possible . - Are you trying to give me orders ? - No , of course not . I 'm merely giving you a medical warning . Come with me . Come . See ? The room of the dead . The busiest room since the coming of the plague . The plague ? The Black Death . Seven cases in the last few days . When the strangers heard of it , they fled . Of course , if your duty compels you to search the hospital ... Urko displayed a proper and satisfying respect for the plague . Why did you help these humans ? I was afraid they might take you along with them and we have a date for tonight . Besides , if they had searched further they might have found that . I can 't leave here without knowing the name of the girl who saved my life . Tell him . - My name is Arna . - Arna . Thank you , Arna . - Goodbye . - Goodbye . - Welcome to the Plague Express . - I told you , we travel first class . When I come back , Arna ... Well , you know it 'll be different in every way I can make it so . I know . - He will come back ? - Believe me , he will . The last thing in the world I need is another human . It 's clear . You 'd better go now . What do I say ? Well , if you 're asking my opinion , I would suggest " goodbye . " And no " thanks " to you ? I helped your friends , but they helped me to have an accident . To collide with the truth about humans . It does permanent injury to one 's beliefs . I 've begun to see the effects even on Leander . - I like him . - So do I. Goodbye , Galen . Goodbye . And thank you . Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH ]

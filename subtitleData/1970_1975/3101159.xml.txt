 Omer The Tourist in Star Trek Remark : A Turkish phrase is widely used on this subtitle , which is ulan ( or lan in short ) . Ulan ( or Lan ) may have different meanings in the context . Depending on the usage , it may mean " hey " , " man " , " my friend " , " you bastard " , etc . Due to this wide range of usage , we left this word as it is . The Captain 's logbook . Star-date 2520.1 We did put the ship into the orbit round the planet Aurin 7 . Our mission is to take the scientific notes from Professor Krater , who has been living there for many years . - How much left , Mr. Sulu ? - 1327 point 28 , Captain . - Mr. Spock ? - Yes , Captain . This is Spock . I 'm listening . Tell Dr. McCoy to finalize the examinations . - And please come to the bridge . - Roger that ! The necessary information is obtained . - The special receiver of the professor has recorded our arrival signal , Captain . - Did you report the case to the federation ? - Yes , we did , Captain . - Keep transmitting , Lieutenant Uhura . - Yes , captain . There 's no reduction at our velocity . We are approaching to the planet of Aurin 7 , Mr. Spock . - Warp Speed 3 . - Yes , Mr. Spock . - All arrangements for the landing are done , Captain . - Thank you , Mr. Spock . - Your reporting mission is finished , Jenice . - Thank you , Doctor . - Doctor , did you complete the examinations ? - Except you and Mr. Spock . - Atmosphere test for Mr. Spock , too ? Actually , that 's not necessary . His pulse rate is 1340 . A pressure , which may kill us , can only tickle him . Does it bother you , that I have a different structure than human , Doc ? Mr. Spock , please don 't be upset . We appreciate that you vulcans are superior species . Upset ? Probably , you forgot that such an illogical emotion does not exist on us . You can not win a debate against Mr. Spock , Doc . His feelings are faint as his green blood , you know . But we are always stronger than you human . Don 't forget that . Now , we should finish this debate , Mr. Spock . Please give us some information about the planet . There 's no other living creature than the professor and his wife , Captain . Just a few robots . - So , Mr. Spock , in order to be transferred to the planet , please go the transport room . - Yes , Sir . - Mr. Sulu . Decrease Warp 2 speed . - Yes , Sir . Warp 2 speed decreased . Allright . Route planning . Joe , beam us down when ready . Supplement to the Captain 's logbook . The pioneer team landed to the planet , in order to take the required notes and examine the professor and his wife . We are not aware of the real status of the planet . We have to be guarded . Darnell , you come with us . Green , it will be better that you walk around and watch the area . Professor Krater ? Mrs. Krater ? Doc , are you going to be nervous to see your ex-fiancee as the professors wife ? No , indeed ! We don 't see each other for over 10 years . She must have forgot me already . - Leonard ? - Nancy ! Hey ! - Glad to see you . - Me too . You didn 't even change slightly . Oh , this is the second captain of the spaceship Enterprise , Mr. Spock . Nice to meet you , Mrs. Krater . I like vulcan people , Mr. Spock . And this is our crew member , Darnell . Hello . Hello , miss . Is something wrong , Darnell ? I just thought that she looks like a girl from planet Fun . - Darnell , you better go to help Green . - Yes , sir . I 'll call professor . He forgets everything while he works . Very hot here , isn 't it ? Ancient remains . Let 's look around . - Professor , I 'm Colonel Spock and this is ... - I know ! You are here for the reports . I could have send them as usual . - To check your health ... - That 's not necessary . Tell people , who give you the orders to leave us alone . We don 't need anything but some salt . If you are done , Professor , let Dr. McCoy do his job . Dr. McCoy ? - Nancy 's friend ? - Yes . Didn 't she tell that I 'm here ? Did you see her ? She didn 't change . She 's like 25 . Doctor , she 's a cool woman but not 25 . Your discussion is inappropriate . Doctor saw her with the eyes of the days when she was her fiancee and you saw her current face . Be surprised by nothing here . And Doctor , please forget that she 's been your fiancee , once . Dead ! Red stains ? I want to know what happened to my man ! I couldn 't find the professor . While I was coming back , I saw your man . He had a borcia plant on his hands . Before I could say anything , he bite it and fell down . Everything is dangerous on an unknown planet . Don 't risk your other men , go away . We know our mission , Professor and we know how to warn our men . From Spock to Enterprise . This is Enterprise . Captain Kirk speaking . Yes , Spock ? Captain , Darnell is dead . We don 't know the reason yet . Doctor is coming up for an autopsy . You better prepare the computer . I 'll check the region with Green . Should I come down , too ? That 's not necessary , Captain . I don 't know how dangerous it is , yet . Don 't leave the ship . Understood . Alright . I 'll give the necessary orders . Spock , be careful . Roger that . I hang up . Doctor , I want you to prepare the report as soon as possible . Ok , Mr. Spock . Weird . The body seems very strong like he 'll stand up and walk . Borcia plant may cause alkali poisoning . But there aren 't any symptoms on the body , indicating this . Nancy said , that she saw him while eating that plant . Even if he had swallow a tiny portion of the plant , my device would indicate that . Salt ! You had to request salt from them . Nancy , go for a walk . You are nervous , now . Doc , I have to make an investigation . I 'll see you at your place , Professor . Ok , start your investigation . Let 's see , what you can find . An imaginery killer ? Did they give you salt ? Not yet ! I need salt ! Relax . You 've already caused a lot of trouble for me . What are you going to do with that time machine ? - I 'll find a savior for you . - What ? A murder happened so we need a murderer . - I 'll transport a living organism from past . - A living organism . A human . That means salt . Hey , where are you going , lan groom ? You can 't just impregnate our sister and escape . Are you a hoodlum or what ? Find another groom for you . Can 't you find any other fool ? I just saw this woman once in my life . If she 's that pregnant with just an eye contact one week ago she can give birth to 15-20 babies in a month . - Hey , look ! - A slander against our sister ? March ! What slander ? Lan , you couldn 't find any other man to foist that woman upon , weren 't you ? Don 't take picture , ulan ! Please , sit down . Hey , stop ! - I 'm going to the telephone booth , bro ! - Take your seat ! Why don 't you take pic of anybody else , ulan ? Jackass ! Do you accept to marry Omer the Tourist ? Yeeeees ! And you Omer the Tourist ? Do you accept to marry Hatice Tezsever ? I 've found the man , which we are going to introduce to Enterprise crew as the killer . Now , we 've to transport him here . We 're waiting for your answer . Come on , groom . Tell " yes " ! Dear God , please create a reason and make me lost from here . Save me , vanish me . - Where did he go ? - Did he escape ? What happened ? Oh , dear God ! You heard my prayer , you brought me to a place , where human is scarce . You left me alone with my conscience . What 's this place ? Some place where an earthquake hit ? A construction site ? An isolated place ! Did you escape from a beach ? Where are your clothes , ulan ? Or are you the headman of this district ? He came ! He landed onto the planet . Let 's go and find him quickly . Look , I 'm bored . Will you make me wander until evening ? Let me go or kiss my corpse ! Lan , what a weird creature you are ! You critter ! Oh , brother . The God has sent you to me ! You saved me from that man ! Tell me , where am I now ? You are on the biggest planet of the galaxy . Hmmm , then is this place close to Kasimpasa ? We are 3 million lighyears away from Kasimpasa ! Oh , I see ! We are at Nalinci Hill , then . You 'll stay here for a certain time period . Don 't worry . You are in safe hands . If you mean the ones of him , they 're not hands . They are paws ! What are you doing ? What the hell are you doing ? Are you nuts , girl ? Last week , I looked at a broad on the street , like this . She became 9 months pregnant . You lick my hand . I swear , you 're gonne give birth to quintuplets ! - No ! Don 't do this , Nancy ! - No ! No , don 't do this Pepsi , no ! I want him ! He 's exactly what I want . Look , listen to me carefully . Unless the killer of the dead man is found , the crew of Enterprise won 't leave our planet . Now , I 'll present them this guy as the killer , understand ? I 'll solve everything . Now , go ! Man , you 'll be an excellent firewood to be burned in winter . Hey , brother ! His battery went down . I 've fixed it . Hey , bro ! Where did she go ? That girl ? She has things to do . Ok , then you take my hand and continue . Professor Krater ! Professor Krater ! Bring him down , now . - My God ! - Bring him back , when I call you . Don 't leave me with that guy , bro ! Professor Krater ! Professor Krater ! Mrs. Krater ! Green , patrol outside . - Be on watch . Your duty is till evening . - Yes , sir . Don 't you have anything else to do ? We 've got a lot of things to do , Professor ! Where 's your wife ? She must be on a digging . I can 't put a guard by her . An unknown killer is outside . I 'll give him to you , when the time comes . An illogical offer , Professor . He can kill anybody else , till your time comes . I can 't allow you to commit outrage on my planet . Your complaints will be recorderd , Professor ! Look , Professor . My man has been killed for an unknown reason . Your and your wifes lives are also in danger . - Spock speaking . - This is bridge , Kirk speaking . Spock listening . McCoy has something to say . I want you to hear the answers of the computer to the report , Mr. Spock . I 'm listening , Doctor . Borcia plant , which can be found on M type planets is not detected on the body . At the same time , there 's no NaCl on the body . Explain . No salt left on the body . And the reason ? Unknown ! The regular salt content of the body has disappeared . Nancy and Professor requested salt from us . - Did you hear that , Spock ? - Yes , Captain . I want you to work on that salt thing . No poisoning . - Mr. Spock . - Listening . There 's a strange killer against us . You heard the explanation , Professor . There 's a huge salt cunsumption on the body , which cannot be explained . And you requested salt from us . On a dry and hot planet , salt is scarce . That much left here . Your murder argument is just a fantasy . Now , leave the planet . We don 't go anywhere , without closing this case . The horses die because of the barley , and I 'll die because of this man . Huh ? Who are you ? We are golden girls . - Are you made of gold , too ? - Yes . - Are every part of your bodies made of gold ? - Yes . You should be deposited in a decent bank or cashed and spent , got it ? Look , the quarter is here , too . Subsidiary coin , God bless you . Oh , no , thanks . I don 't want it . Let this camel drink . Why don 't you say " Thank God " , ulan ? Say " Thank God " , ulan ! Damn you ! You 're here with these pretty golden girls , they wine and dine you but you don 't even smile . Come on , smile once . Yeah , you smile when I say , don 't you , jackass ? If you are so nervous , logically you should know him personally . Of course ! Of course , I know ! And I 'll give him to you , now . Hercules ! Bring the murderer here . Be quick , Hercules ! Wait , let me chat a little with these girls , with these golden girls . Stop ! Ulan , you aren 't fed up with me , like you carry a luggage since morning . Go and carry someone else ! The guy picked on me , sticks like a leech on my neck over and over . Huh ? Take it away ! Is this a machine ? Huh ? Is this a machine , too ? But the engineer couldn 't design that properly , look at that model , those sharp ears this weird hair , as straight as a line , got it ? Here , the monster killer that you seek for . Hmm , so he 's the monster . Oh ! He mutters ! Let 's take him to the ship and examine . Look , what if he tears me up during the examination ? Yellow alert , be careful , he 's a monster . Be polite , monster is your father . Attention , yellow alert ! I 'm a monster ! I 'll eat you up . Wow , very beautiful . That 's a chair for rulers . Let me sit , someone will make me stand up anyway . Beware , I 'm a monster . Come on , sister . God bless you . This is Spock , speaking . Your orders , Captain ? I 'm waiting for your orders . Oh , Spock , is that you ? Send us four cups of tea , well steeped , got it ? Don 't do that , children . Let 's chat decently . You make me angry ! Now I 'll do something ! Where is the tea , Mr. Cafer ? Looks like an incredible robot . That 's illogical . A robot doesn 't need salt , Doctor . - An immature species . - An unfamiliar race . - I 've to examine his body . - And I 'll do his brain . He must have come from another galaxy . His behaviour is like human but his mother and father must have been from different planets . Stop there ! I 'm not sure about me but your mother is from another planet and your father is from the planet of goats . Aren 't they , Doctor ? I told him about his family tree , and he became upset , camel . Doctor , I can 't solve this issue . I 've to report this to the captain . Let 's first discover his identity . That 's not necessary . My birth certificate is not with me , but my name is Omer . Omer the Tourist . Give me your hand . He wants to shake hands . Zzzt , come to my office ! He fell into the trap . Illogical . Spock , what 's the situation ? I can 't find any solution against this creature , captain . Oh , is he the captain ? Come on , bro , sit on your rulers seat . Practically , my brain stopped working . Instead of a brain , you 've got ears . Doctor , what 's your opinion ? We 've to test . We 've to hold a meeting and review the situation . Tell your opinon , now . I think , this creature comes from a weird planet . What does that mean ? Not from our galaxy ? I don 't know . We 've to investigate . Come this way ! Now alltogether that way ! Come on ! Warp 1 , red alert . Duty call ! - We 're in the orbit , Captain . - Ok , Mr. Spack . What uproarious people you are , I 've just played with two buttons , so what ? So what ? You put the ship out of the orbit . - Captain , we 've to subject him to some tests . - Allright . - What are you going to do ? - Come with me ! What subject ? I 'll catch the next ferry boat . Doc , you 're always with me like my guilty conscience . This killer case make me worried . Captain 's logbook . Star-date 2520.2 One of my crew members has been killed on the planet , where we made a visit to Professor Krater . We couldn 't discover yet the identity of the creature , who has been introduced to us by the Professor as the killer . Nancy ? Look , I 've got salt here . Nancy ! Here 's the salt . Nancy ! - Transport section ! - This is the transport section . This is Private Green . My mission is over . Beam me up . OK . You can 't keep him away from me , Professor . What 's that ! You 're gonne make me sick . Let 's check his reactions . Up ! Down . Up . - Clamp ! - Down . Up ! Clamp ! Up ! Clamp ! Enough , stop . Up ! Enough , stop . - Excessive reaction on the sex plasma . - What ? A primitive ruin where normal opposites clustered . Read it decipherable , you talk like a geography book . Up . Come on , girls , do me up or ... Clamp ! Come on , up ! Cla ... Say stop , stop ! Can 't you remain silent ? - I can 't . - I can 't concentrate on my job . Please don 't talk . Why not ? People should talk to understand each other . - Please shut up . - If I don 't talk , I die , Doc . Right , girls ? Doctor , what 's the result of the test ? A monster or a killer ? - Come on , monster ? - Let me summarize my findings , captain . Brain activities ; almost none . Everyone knows that I don 't have a brain . Heart ; none . Blind Melahat was used to call me as heartless . Innards disordered . Yeah , I 've got diarrhea My inner is in bad condition . The analysis goes on this way . - Mr. Spock . Please continue the investigation . - Yes , sir . Mr. Tourist , answer my questions correctly . I 'll do . I never lied in my life . If I lied , please God make me paralized . Oh , then I lied once . Mr. Tourist , are you ready for the intelligence test ? Don 't be ridiculous . I 'm always ready like a boy scout . - Then I start . - Go on . What happens if we activate the trossises from backside with the tornulle mechanism and increase crossis to 45 ? Well , your mothers distaff happens . - Trossis from back or so , what are you talking about , dude ? - What ? You tell me . What happens from backside , when all the things you said happen ? Why don 't you tell me , ulan ? Captain , I can 't continue the investigation . No power left on my nerves . Your all power is consumed by your ears , mumps . Mr. Spock . There isn 't any monster characteristics . There was a monster Vasfi once , may God have mercy on him , he died . During a hurly burly in Kasimpasa , his enemies shooted him from behind . He was a brave man . A logical conclusion . There can 't be a monster this primitive . The monster was Vasfi . So , what 's this ? I 'm a jewel . You 'll appreciate me , after I die . So , that was a lie , too ! ? Considering that , this is not a monster , only the professor can give us the answers of all questions . - We have to find him . - So what about me ? - You may swan in the ship . - So may I do what I want ? - Sure . - Good . Jenice , come with us to the bridge . You go to the bridge with Jenice , and we 'll stay with her in Galata . Ok , girl ? We 'll play cards . Status report , Mr. Spock ? There 's only one living creature on the planet , Captain . Maybe the professor . - And his wife ? - I don 't know , Captain . There aren 't any other living creatures . This situation is very important . - Expand the extent of the investigation . - Yes , Captain . - Prepare the status reports . - Yes , Mr. Spock . Oh , hello Captain Brother . How are you ? Is my friend here ? - Who ? - Mumps , mumps . Oh , yeah , he 's here . I guess you are leaving . I don 't want to take your time . Let me open the door . Open ulan ! Go on . You 've a long walk . Mumps ! Mumps , how is it going ? - Not mumps , Spock ! - Come along , pumpkin . Hey , look . What 's that , something like a television , something in that ? A meteor . There are millions of that in the galaxy . Then the one next to it is a heated marble stone , like in a Turkish bath . - What ? - Zzzt , Erenkoy ! Go on , do your bussiness . - And what 's that ? - That 's the planet of the professor . Is it ? But it 's too small , brother . No it 's not . We are 4 light-years away from that planet . Brother , please don 't fly over 30 km / h , it makes me sick and we may be charged speed penalty . What 30 km / h ? We 'll fly round the planet with 30 million km / h . Come on , there aren 't that much kilometers on the earth . We 're not on the earth . We 're in space . So , " in space " means we 're far away from home , right ? Please let us do our job , Mr. Tourist . Do his job ! Bullshit , mumps . What 's the job you are doing ? Preparing reports . Jenice , bring the reports . Dennis , bring the reports . - Thank you . - What 's that , bro ? - Girl . - What girl ? Space girl . Not space girl . She 's the daughter of her mother . - Come here . - Jenice , go back . Mr. Tourist , you too . Don 't be late , come quick . - Let me help you a little . - Put them back , Mr. Tourist . Your belongings are so precious ! Take back and do what you want . - Oh , what 's that machine ? - Computer . What does it do ? A device that can answer every questions . Professor and his wife landed on the planet Aurin 7 five years ago . - This machine woman talks . - Of course , she does . May I ask a question to her , too ? Not now . Kiss my dead body , please let me ask one question , please brother . - I said no Mr. Tourist . Don 't break your brothers heart because of a machine . Ok then , ask . Comfather ! - Not comfather . - What then ? - Computer . Impossible , I can 't pronounce the word . Please you say it . Computer , answer . - Well , what 's 2 times 2 ? - 4 ! Oh ! The bitch gave the correct answer . - Brother , may I ask one more question to the comfather , please ? - I said no Mr. Tourist . We 're busy now . We did it once and it happened . Kiss my corpse , please . Say comfather , say it , come on . Computer , please answer the questions . Well , comfather , what will be the results of football pools this weekend ? - 1 , 2 , 0 , 0 ... - Give that to me , quick . - ... 1 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 2 , 1 ... - You 've ruined my reports , Mr. Tourist . - ... 0 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 0 . - And you ruined my pools , I didn 't say anything . Damn you , comfather . You heel , comfather ! Captain , may I use my annual leave ? What 's the matter , Spock ? This is the first time that I see you angry . May I use my annual leave and leave the ship , Captain ? Why , Mr. Spock ? I don 't wanna stay , while Mr. Tourist is here . He 's angry with me , but now I 'll apologise and we 'll make a peace . Give me your hand . I said , give me your hand . Oh please , give me your hand . Zzzt , come to my office . You see , Captain ? An illogical creature . Here 's the report of Mr. Scotty , Captain . There 's some disorder at the sound frequency of the compuýter . - Check the frequency , Mr. Spock . - Yes , sir . Jennice , give me the sound amplifier . Why don 't you give it , my girl ? Come on , give it . Be quick . Thank you . Check the reflector , Jennice . - For God 's sake , what 's this , bro ? - Sound amplifier . - This can amplify the sounds up to a million times . - Wow ! It can increase the noise of a bugs steps like a thunder . It 's ok , Captain . Sound reflector is on maintenance . Thank you , Mr. Spock . What 's the latest status on the planet . Let me tell you briefly . Mr. Spock , what 's this ? This can be a hazard signal . - Yellow alert ? - No , red alert . A dangerous situation . - Yes , sir . Attention ! Red alert ! Deck 3 and 5 . Take full cautions . Come on , skip the cautions . Everything happened because of this . - There 's an unknown danger . - There 's nothing unknown . It 's because of my stomach . Believe me . - Look ! - Get ready for laser shooting . Don 't make them shoot . It 's because of me ! Fatal power on the weapons . Don 't ! I say , it 's a hunger issue . Brother , this thing made it . Look , brother . When I make it like this , there 's nothing , look . It 's my stomach , because of hunger . It rumbles . I tell him , don 't rumble , ulan . I would eat something , if I had , but he continuously rumbles and rumbles and rumbles ! End of emergency situation . Everybody back on work . - Brother , take your device back . I want to be alone with my hunger . - Thank you , Mr. Tourist . You 're welcome . Don 't mention it . Don 't ever touch anything again . Ok , but don 't leave your toys around , puppy . Mr. Spock ! So Mr. Tourist is hungry . An illogical sound comes out of his stomach . However , Mr. Tourist is right , he is hungry . Enumeration on Decks 3 and 5 . All crew members should give their reports . Enumeration on Decks 3 and 5 . All crew members should give their reports . Oh , thank you for the food and water . Thank goodness , I 'm full up now . Now a space cigarette . Space cigarette is invisible . I hope we won 't be smothered due to this invisible cigarette . - Look , I 'm full up now . - Bon appetit . - Thank you , Captain . Well , Spockettin , look . Click click , no sound now . - Your stomach is more logical than you . - You say ! - It 's silent when full . - And you are silent when you are not talking about logic , Spockettin . Hey look , why are your ears so sharp ? Hmm ? Did you father pull them a lot when you were a kid ? In Vulcan , everbody has this kind of long ears , Mr. Tourist . So , the human in your country has so long ears , then how long are the ears of the donkeys there ? - We don 't have donkeys ! - Really ? And we have , on the contrary , too many donkeys , like sand , you can 't believe it . I swear . - And our blood is green . - Green ? - Yep ! - Brother Spock , never drink milk then . - Why ? If you drink milk , you 'll be green and white , like the jersey of FC Vefa . And you 'll struggle not to relegate . I don 't understand what you say Mr. Tourist . Don 't forget that , logic is our first priority . - Huh , then don 't forget that our first priority is food . - What ? Zzzt ! Trallal la la ... What are you writing there , Spockettin ? Lieutenant Jenice . Yes , Captain . - Please take care of Mr. Tourist . - Yes , Sir . - Why don 't you come with me ? - Where to ? - To the flower bed . - Sure , but just a minute . See you later Mister Spock sharp ears . Look at here , mumps , take my hand and tell my fortune . Pardon me ? Zzzt , tralala lala lala .. Look , why don 't we go to a movie instead of the flower garden ? I couldn 't think of any other way to make you free , Mr. Spock . To answer two of the questions of Mr. Tourist is more difficult than solving all the space algebra . Captain what does zzzt mean ? I don 't know . You better ask the computer . What is zzzt ? What is zzzt , computer ? What is zzzt , computer ? Computer has gone mad . What 's this place ? Kindergarden . So where are the children ? Here , these are my children . - These are your children ? - Yes ! God bless them to you . It should have been difficult to you to give birth to the prickly ones . We cultivate them ourselves . - Who 's the father of them ? - Mr. Spock . What a Spock he is . - There 's something between you and him , right ? - He likes the plants , not me . - So what are you doing ? - I take care of the flowers . You take care of the flowers . May God take care of you . Sometimes I 'll take care of you , so you 'll be fine . Come on , let me help you a little . Let me salt them . Ah , Mr. Tourist . You are so funny . Yes , previously I was a navy , now I 'm funny . I didn 't get it ! ? I say that you are so swanky . Ok , this much salt is enough . We added salt and pepper , so ? So , we 'll feed them . - What 's that ? - Meat ! Look ! How can a flower eat meat ? What are you doing ? Yes , this flower eats meat . - Let mee look . - Keep your hand away . - Why ? - It may tear your fingers off . - Let me see . - I said keep away . Why do you slap me ? What are you doing , man ? One of your flower is grown up and kisses hand , God bless him . Thank you . God bless you . - He isn 't a flower , he 's Private Green . - Green or blue , doesn 't matter . She got nervous . She felt something strange . Private Green ! He 's gone . Sister , I 'm leaving . I don 't like this place . Like a madhouse . Private comes , you go out , the flowers eat , no ! Come on , take this. you are hungry . Hey , look . There 's ... .. ! Mumps , mumps ! Brother Spock . There was a flower , green . Private . - He was white . - I 'm busy Mr. Tourist . - He then darkened . - I said , I 'm busy . Captain , brother captain ! He was white , then came , then turned out to be dark and the girl .. Mr. Tourist . Don 't take our time , please sit down . Doctor , brother . There was this flower , private , came and left . Then black and ... - This kind of things are normal in space . - He was white . - Sit down and rest . I guess you are right , Mr. Tourist . I 'm right but nobody listens to me . What are you doing there like praying on a funeral . Are you crazy or what ? Captain , she 's dead ! Yes , she 's dead . Red stains ! Call Dr. McCoy , quick ! Dr. McCoy . Please come to Dock No : 7 Dr. McCoy . Please come to Dock No : 7 Captain , logically the killer is in the ship . We 've to find him . - Yes , search for him . - Yes , Captain . Doctor , why don 't you check the body ? Same as before . No salt left . We 've to find the professor . Quick prepare for beam down . Look , you didn 't believe me . She 's now lying there , dead . Mr. Tourist . You 're coming with us . We are going down . Yeah , I won 't stay here in any case . Come on , march . Flower girl , go on . Supplement to Captain 's logbook . I 'm now sure that my crew members are killed by a strange creature . There 's a killer among us , who can take the shape of whoever he wants . Only Professor Krater and his wife can give us the correct answer . Suddenly , we came here again . How could this happen ? Ion , candide and andreon beams converted material to energy . Who converted you to talk this nonse ? - Search around and inform me if you find anything suspicious . - Yes , sir . - Mr. Tourist , sit there and wait for us . - There ? - Yes ! Ok , I 'll park here , sit like a flower pot and wait for you . Why don 't you leave ? I gave you the murderer . Professor , I 'm Captain Kirk . Give an end to the game . Mr. Tourist is neither a murderer nor a monster . Where 's the real killer ? Spock , use your ninth power and open that door . Did the professor set that monster on us ? That 's the way he escaped so that 's the most logical explanation . We 've to find him as soon as possible , Spock . - Captain . - What is it Mr. Spock ? Dead . Same red stains . - Same thing . - Green returned to the ship after his duty is done . There must be someone in the ship , who resembles him . There 's a monster against us , who can take the shape of everyone . From Kirk to Enterprise . This is Enterprice . Scotty speaking . Scotty , there 's an alien in the ship . He can be in the shape of Green . Full alert on all decks . The third security plan will be held . But first , take the body of Green up . Where 's the doctor ? He was on the other side , Captain . Let 's move on . Doctor ? - Doctor , did you see anything ? - No , Captain , how about you ? We 've found the body of Private Green . Private Green ? There 's someone else in the ship instead of him . We 've to be very careful . Professor is determined to terminate us . Maybe he just wants us to leave the planet . The killer is maybe on the planet or maybe on the ship . But something is certain . He can take the shape of anybody any time . This means , the monster takes the shape of others to survive .

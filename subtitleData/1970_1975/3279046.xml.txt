True , most of us here . We haven 't seen a woman Or a child in all of that time . Think about that for a minute . Want to know how we survived ? Well , I 'll tell you . The day that I was captured , I made a promise to myself : Each day I would brush my teeth , shave my beard , Wash my hands and face before each meal , evacuate my bowels with regularity . And do you know why ? Because the war consists of continual petty humiliations . And I for one was going to treat myself with a good deal of self-respect and survive . Do you think you can do it ?

It 's by far the safest place to be until We get this all over with . Now then , you must elect a leader . He 's going to be in charge of all this group . You 'll all be under his direct orders , And he will be your line of communication With the Germans . Nominations are now open . You need a leader . I nominate Paul Lazzaro . Lazzaro . Right .

I 'm gonna pepper your radcliffe ass with buckshot If I catch you smoking again ! You better stay in condition To keep up with B.C. Rumfoord . - you guys go on without me . I 'll be all right . Christ . All he does in his sleep ... Is quit and surrender and apologize . Shoot . I could carve a better man out of a banana . Did you bring me those books from widener ? The boys at the Harvard crimson have a beautiful bit about you . Oh ? They call you the Red Baron of military history ... And want you to get well soon . Those little bastards ! The Truman statement about Hiroshima is in here , And those eight Army air force documents . Oh , yeah . And the Irving book on Dresden . I was there . Honey , why did they keep Dresden A secret for so long ? Oh , hell . For fear a lot of bleeding hearts ... Would say bombing it was a chicken shit thing to do . My book 's gonna lay it on the line , sweetheart . Nobody 's gonna weep and wail over Dresden After they read my book . I was there . What 's he saying ? He said he was there . Says he was where ? Dresden . At Dresden , B.C. ! The hell with him . Let him write his own book . Schlachthof-funf . What the hell is he saying now ? Ich bin amerikanische soldat . Dresden . Schlachthof-funf . You wanna know something ? We didn 't start the last war ; The Nazis did . And 135,000 people dying in Dresden ... Does not seem so very much when Put against over five million Allies who had to die ! And you just might remember that When we were bombing Dresden , The Germans were sending v-1 And v-2 rockets into London , Killing men , women and children . Don 't get so uptight . Jesus ! It gives me a pain : weeping Over Dresden and not give a damn About our own losses ! Hey , what about Coventry ? What about Rotterdam ? What about the extermination Camps the Germans were running ? Gassing , Maimings ? I want your attention . Attention , please . You are having a visitor . Howard Campbell , junior . I have just come back from the Russian front , So I 'll make it short . I know how hungry you are . Food 's not much though , is it ? Food 's terrific ! Almost as neat as your outfit ! Men , I have a proposition for you . How would you like to come back to America After this war as heroes ? Great , as long as I could wear that fag outfit ! Since you 're so interested In my outfit , I 'll tell you what it 's about . Blue is for the American sky . White is for the race that Pioneered that continent , Cleared the forests , drained the swamps , Built the roads and the bridges . And the red is for the blood of fine American boys ... That 's been shed in defense of your freedom . I don 't see you shedding any blood , Campbell . You all know that communism is out to enslave the world . And who 's out there trying to stop them ? The Germans ! They 're not your enemies . They 're your allies ! Communism is the enemy of all of us ! - I want volunteers for the free American corps . - men who are willing to stand up to these commies . - sit down , Lazzaro ! I didn 't vote for you , Derby . Good . Now , who 's next ? - if we don 't stop them- - - everybody to the air shelter . Move . Let 's go ! Get outta my way . There 'll be no bombs . Churchill 's nephew Lives in Dresden . Don 't worry , soldier . Well , men , do I have only one volunteer ? Listen , pal . I only stood up back there to tell you that one day your doorbell 's gonna ring , And there 's gonna be this guy In a trench coat- - We 'll eat German craw For so long , Campbell , because we have to . But we 'd rather die than eat your dung , Which is sick and lousy and foul ! History will prove you an ass . Oh , shit . No bombs , Eh , Campbell ? You can 't trust the Jews . Daddy , you should really stay with us . And you shouldn 't talk about mama ... Or the accident , or even the war . I just wanna go home . But we want you with us ! I 'll be fine . Just for one night ? No . Oh , daddy . Honestly ! Daddy , you should consider yourself lucky . Practically every optometrist in Ilium was wiped out . Stanley 's been working night and day for you . Stinking old dog . Hello , spot . Yeah . Yeah . Daddy , honestly ! Won 't you please change your mind and come stay with us ? You 'll be in this empty house with that old dog . I 'll be all right . But , daddy , be realistic . You just turned middle-aged . You 've got your whole life ahead of you . Good night , dear . Ja , schweine ! Verfluchen schweine ! Mama ! Mama ! Mama ! Mama ! - dad ? Dad ? - Papa ! Dad ? Robert ? Hi ya , dad . Hi , spot . How did you get here ? Well , they- - They gave me leave to visit mom . But you know- - Sure , dad . I know . That 's why I 'm here . And to see you . How are you , dad ? I 'm fine . God , dad . To think that you lived . It 's a miracle . Like one time when a chopper Got hit by Charlie , Just outside our camp . It came down like , like a stone . But the door gunner walked away . Dad ? Dad , i-i did the right Thing , joining up . I 'm sure you did , son . Aah , it 's a lousy war , but sooner or later It 's gonna be us or the communists . We 've gotta stand up to them somewhere . Dad ? Dad ? I know you and mom Worried about me a lot . I guess I haven 't been The best of sons . You 've been just fine , Robert . No , I- - I know I was pretty wild , And I want to make up For it . Remember that stuff In the cemetery ? Geez ! I 'm so ashamed of that now . Really , I am . But I 've changed A lot , dad . And I just hope I can Make you real proud of me from now on . You already have , Robert . Dad , will you come to mom 's grave with me ? I 'm not ready yet . I know how you feel , dad . I 'm just not ready . Okay , dad . What 's happened ? Where am I ? Welcome to the planet Tralfamadore , Mr. Pilgrim . Tralfam- - Tralfama- - Tralfamadore . Oh . How did I get here ? There is no " how , " Mr. Pilgrim . There is no why . The moment simply is . I don 't understand . Where are you ? Oh , you can 't see us , Mr. Pilgrim . We live in the fourth dimension . But we can see you , And there are many Important tralfamadorians here to welcome you . Oh . Well , uh , how do you do ? We hope that you 'll find your Accommodations here suitable . I have to stay here ? I 'm afraid so . You mean , I can 't leave of my own free will ? Mr. Pilgrim , we have visited 31 inhabited planets in the universe . We have studied reports on a hundred more , And only on earth is there any talk of free will . Well- - What 'll I do ? You will aid in the removal Of the bodies . Those that are identifiable ... Will be tagged . Their personal effects will be Tagged and given to an officer . There will be a classification ... According to the degree ... That the victim can be identified . Any looting or stealing ... Will be dealt with by a firing squad . Follow me . It looked like The end of the world . What looked like the end of the world , Mr. Pilgrim ? Dresden , after the bombing . Don 't be so egocentric . We know how the world ends , And it has nothing to do with earth , Except that it gets wiped out too . Really ? How does it end ? While we 're experimenting with new fuels , A tralfamadorian test pilot Panics , presses the wrong button , And the whole universe disappears . But you have to stop him ! If you know this , can 't you keep The pilot from pressing- - He has always pressed it , And he always will . We always let him , And we always will let him . The moment is structured that way . Mr. Pilgrim , a pleasant way to spend eternity ... Is to ignore the bad times And concentrate on the good . It 's- - it 's all right ! It 's all right ! Will you be quiet , please ? Will you please be quiet ? Can 't you see you 're frightening her ? - who are you ? Who are you ? My name 's Pilgrim . What 's this scene ? - where are we ? - we 're on a distant planet . Are you mating now ? What ? Have you mated ? Who are you ? I 'm a tralfamadorian , Miss Wildhack . A what ? You 're on the planet Tralfamadore , Miss Wildhack , 423 billion miles from earth .

Naturally . And ... All of a sudden , it was like a- - a ray- - This is all I can offer . Thank you . And- - I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to interrupt . Th-that 's all there is . And the next thing , I was- - I was here . What 's it like up here ? I don 't know . We can 't leave the dome . The atmosphere of Tralfamadore is cyanide . It would be fatal to you If you left the dome . This is it ? I 'm ... Afraid so . How long will they keep us here ? I don 't know . You are here , you have always been here , And you will always be here . Is he trying to blow my mind ? No , no , no . It all makes sense in a way . - You see , in Tralfamadore- - - Would you please mate now ? Look . We 're not going to put on a show for you . That 's one thing . Another is I demand you get Miss Wildhack some clothing . If she 's cold , we can always Regulate the temperature . Now , you get down to earth And get Miss Wildhack ... A complete wardrobe , and one that fits ! What 's your size ? I take a ten . But I have to take it in here And let it out a little here . So , they 'll have to bring a needle and thread .

The one your son Johnny broke ? Yeah ! How 'd you know about that ? The letter you wrote home . Of course . It 's a miracle , isn 't it ? This little dancer survived All this destruction . Wait 'll I bring it home . Can you imagine how Meg 's eyes will light up ? Arbeit ! She 'll love it . Diener ? Was haben sie da ? Oh , uh , look at this . I found this down there . There 's not a chip on it . It 's pretty , isn 't it ? We had one like it . Used to sit- - oh ! What 's the matter ? Feuer ! Stop ! Stop ! Billy . Billy ? Billy ? Where were you , honey ? Billy ?

She died . Somebody smacked Into the rear of her car ... And the exhaust fell off . She died of carbon monoxide poisoning . Oh . Like what they have out there ? No . That 's cyanide . That 's worse . Oh , wow . What did you love most about her ? Her pancakes . If we had a real stove , Billy , I 'd make you an out-of-sight Macrobiotic souffle . I 'd like that . And then ... We could think about having your baby . Could we have the night canopy , please ? Oh , daddy ! There is no such planet as Trilaflamaduke ! Dad , I think what Barbara and I would Really like to know- - Would you be willing To see a psychiatrist ? Listen , I have a friend who 's not only a doctor , But he 's interested in outer space . Why don 't the three of us Have lunch together today ? I 'm not going to commit myself to an institution . Dad , I wasn 't- - If it weren 't for Tralfamadore , I might have needed an institution . I don 't need a doctor , Stanley . On Tralfamadore you learn that the world ... Is just a collection of moments all strung together in beautiful , random order . And if we 're going to survive , It 's up to us to concentrate on the good moments ... And ignore the bad . Besides , I 'm in love up there . You know , dad , I 'd really like To have lunch with you today . I 'll be very busy . Montana 's pregnant . What 's her name ? Montana Wildhack .

I 've seen it many times . I died in Philadelphia , where I was giving a speech On the subject of Tralfamadore . You see , in Tralfamadore , Where I presently dwell , Life has no beginning , No middle and no end . For example , Many years ago ... A certain man promised To have me killed . He 's an old man now , Living not far from here . He 's read all of the publicity Associated with my appearance . He 's insane , and tonight He 'll keep his promise . If you protest , If you think that death Is a terrible thing , Then you have not understood What I have said . You see , it 's time for you to go home ... To your wives and children . It 's time for me to be dead For a little while ... And then live again . I give you the Tralfamadorian greeting : " hello . Farewell . " hello . " farewell . " eternally connected , " eternally embracing . " hello . - farewell . " Nobody fucks around With Paul Lazzaro ! Do you hear me , Pilgrim ? Pilgrim ? Pilgrim ? Hey , Pilgrim ! You hear me ? Pilgrim , get your ass over here And give me a hand ! What are you gonna do with that ? I 'm gonna make a fortune ! Are you kidding ? Haven 't you got enough stuff ? What if we get caught ?

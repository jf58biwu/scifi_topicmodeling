 ( Alarm sounds ) - Right , get this suit on ! - Right . - There , normal again . - Just another power surge , eh ? - Looks like it . - Another break in process , like the water supply cutoff and the reactor failure ? - We 've certainly had a lot lately . - Too much ! And I would like to know why ! - Simon , hurry up ! - Sorry , Liz , I 'm not going . - You 're joking ! - l 'm interested in that longevity drug . Blow that ! If you don 't come now , we 'll never live to use it ! That 's the only thing that matters now ! - Go and warn your mother of all this ! - No ! Quick , before someone catches you ! Daddy ? - l 've told you a thousand times ! - Why have these things gone wrong ? - The director says it 's human error ! - Oh , come on ! - Beth , listen ! About the director ... - Yes , Dr Bukov ? There are certain facts . The director isn 't the same as the rest of us . - Of course not . - He 's superior intellectually but ... - ls there something wrong with him ? - l can tell you this . - The director suffers from blackouts . - He works hard all the time . - When he recovers , he has no memory . - Thank you , I was aware of that . I observed it just half an hour ago . It doesn 't strike me as very surprising under the circumstances . We don 't help the director , do we ? We hinder him , just as he says . ( Wind howling ) Daddy , wake up ! Daddy ! ( Alarm bleeping ) ( Director ) So whose fault is it this time , Bukov ? I don 't know , there was that strange rise in temperature . It must 've thawed the hibernation slabs outside . How did those volunteers escape ? I don 't know . Liz ! You were imprisoned behind an electronic shield ! How did you get free ? - Answer me ! - Can 't you see she 's upset ? This has been a shock to her . She was unhappy here . - And then she saw the slabs ... - ( Liz ) I 'm all right ! It 's a mystery about the electronic shield . - lt just vanished ! - Very convenient ! You can hardly blame her for that . Since they were unable to move in that room , neither Liz nor Simon ... Simon ! Yes , what has become of Simon ? ( Director ) Since those two children came , everything 's gone wrong . I 'll have to get more serum from the stores . You 'll need to be artificially fed for a couple of days after such a spell . - Will nobody answer my questions ? ! - Questions ? I beg your pardon but are you asking questions or telling us the conclusions you wish us to draw ? Beth understands . She knows that in the ice Box , the only way to work is to start with the answers and only then to look for the questions ... if we haven 't lost the ability , of course . Bukov ! How dare you speak to me like that ? I 'll not stand for it ! - Come on , Beth . - Can I stay with the patient for a while ? - Why ? - The hibernation experiment . I 've little in the way of statistics yet . As he regains consciousness , the children 's reactions might be of value . Very well , Beth ... By all means ! - Mummy , why didn 't you tell me ? - How could I ? You would never have understood , you know you wouldn 't ! That isn 't why ! You didn 't dare . How could you let this happen to Daddy ? Oh , Liz , we couldn 't manage any longer and Beth ... Oh , it had to be Beth ! All this was her doing , wasn 't it ? ( Door closes ) He 'll be all right . It 's a regulated experiment . All factors controlled by the computer . You and your computer ! And the director , come to that ! I suppose he was behind all this ! - You think he 's marvellous ! - Yes , I do ! You never stop to think whether he 's right ! You want to be like him ! How could you hope to appreciate what the director is trying to achieve ? - You 're a stupid little girl ! - That 's right , I 'm stupid ! I 'd rather stay stupid than become like you ! I won 't let it happen ! Look what you 've done to Mummy and Daddy ! Mummy 's too scared to talk to me ! She never used to be like that ! - Now , listen ... - Will you both stop it ! What matters now is Frank . We 're here , it 's all happened . We 've got to find a way of dealing with it . I 'm sorry , Mummy. lt 's just ... Somebody tell me , why did he have to be frozen in the ice ? The hibernation experiment is different from anything else we 're doing here . We 've yet to show that long-term freezing produces any ill effects . This particular experiment will have to be accounted a failure . Frank should 've remained in the ice for ten years . At least . - Ten years ? - He knew that when he volunteered . - Did he volunteer , Mummy ? - Yes , of course , dear . - You don 't sound so sure ! - Stop asking questions . Daddy came here with you , just to do something like this ? - That 's confidential information , Jean . - l want to know ! Very well , Liz ... Your father 's volunteering for this was a condition of our coming here . - Jean ... ! - What 's the good of evading the truth ? In the beginning , the authorities had no use for your father . Then they said that if he would do this ... I could come with Beth as I wanted to . That 's why he did it ? So you could be with Beth ? Yes , Liz ... This is a wicked place ! You know that too now ! Go away. I 've had as much of you as I can take ! You won 't remember the past ! You 're frightened of it ! Jean , ask her to go away . She 's nothing to do with me . But I am ! I am you ! Only , you 're not me . You 've changed too much ! Better intelligence , scientific progress and your ... - l 'm not staying to listen to this ! - Please , don 't go ! Don 't you see ? We can 't escape from one another , you and I . It 's the director who worries you . You can 't go against him . - l will not stay ... - You think he 's always right ! But how can he be when he lets things like this happen ? How can you say the rise in temperature is my doing ? You keep saying Liz and Simon weren 't responsible . - They were imprisoned . - They 've caused enough trouble , yet you go out of your way to excuse them. I query your motives ! - Director , I cannot allow you ... - Allow , Bukov ? ! I want the truth . Larry could not have been solely responsible . It 'd be out of the question to blame Beth or Jean . That leaves you . - l thought you wanted the truth . - Sorry ? Director , I have to tell you I have certain evidence concerning the things that 've gone wrong . I was intending to report to the lnternational Commission but know I see I must show it to you . What right have you to make a report ? Every right . I know you 'll question my right to do this but Edith Joynton and I have a special brief from the lnternational Commission . - l know nothing of it . - No , our brief was to report on you . You ? Report on me ? ! This case contains computer tapes . I do not accept that you were detailed to spy on me ! If you think ... Each of these tapes contains a break at a critical point . There 's an interruption , a break in programming . - lmpossible ! - Aren 't we starting with conclusions and working our way back to questions ? With your permission , Director . - You 'd better come and see this . - Yeah ? - Bukov ! - What is it ? The temperature control again . Only this time , we 're showing a heat loss . ( High-pitched tones ) ( Humming sound increases in frequency ) That 's three degrees in half an hour ! Not an abnormal variation . You said you were looking for the truth . I have it for you . No , like everyone else who works against me , all you have is theories . Only I can be relied upon for the truth . Every operation of the computer is checked by you daily on brain link . The computer can 't make mistakes but if , while you 're programming ... Enough , Bukov ! I 'll hear no more ! Not a word ! Nearly four degrees . ( intense humming ) ( Frequency increases ) It 's all right . He 's coming round . Beth ! - l don 't think you should stay . - l want to be with him . It would be too much for him . He thinks of you as belonging to the past , the good past . Will you stay , Beth ? No , Jean . No ... ( Moans ) Frank ... Frank , my dear ... - Liz ? - What is it this time ? I know you don 't like me much , with good reason ... - Don 't like you ? I hate you ! - Be fair ! You make decisions and hope they come out for the best . You 'll know that soon . But I 'll never make your decisions , will I ? And how did I come to make them ? We 're the same , Liz . I 'm like a person you could never be and you 're like someone I never was ! - Liz , guess what I found in there ? - ln the director 's office again ? - l understand about the testament ! - Stop this ! - You 've interfered once too often . - You don 't know , either ! All you did was service that computer for Devereaux . You never knew what it was truly for . Come on , you 've got to see ! - Just watch this . - What ? ( Simon ) There . What does it mean ? I don 't know what you 'd call it properly but I think it 's a kind of life history . - The director 's ? - Do you know what the director is ? I mean , what he truly is ? Dr Bukov once told me the director was a clone . A clone ? What 's a clone ? - No , it can 't be true . - Somebody tell me what a clone is . A clone is a person constructed from the genetic cells of someone else . From that other Devereaux who died . It doesn 't ... I didn 't know it was possible ! Nobody knew it was possible and the director 's keeping it that way . This computer is here to build another clone and what we 've just seen is as far as it 's got . And that 's the testament , too . The secret of the longevity drug . Now it 's part of the new clone . Once that becomes mature , it 'll be Devereaux all over again ... and the secret will be safe inside his head . It 's dropping all the time . - Well ? - No , Director , procedurally OK . - Remarkable ! - Remarkable ? The fault can only be in the programming . Bukov , for the last time , that 's impossible ! Why ? Because every operation of the computer is checked by you on brain link and you can 't admit that you could have made a mistake ? Lies ! lnsinuations ! You won 't hear what I 've got to say , then ? Larry ... from now on , you 'll do everything I say , please . I 'm assuming command . Too much danger , Director . You can 't be trusted to govern us any more . It 's so cold . What 's wrong ? - ( Director ) No ! - Director ! Beth , help me ! Emergency signal , central control ! I 've no choice . His mistakes will kill us if I don 't take over ! - No ! - Larry , get his arms. inside , quickly ! ( Larry ) Right ! - Ah ! Agh ! - A computer headclamp , Larry ! - What for ? - Don 't argue , get it ! - No ! - Here you are ... - Throw an electronic shield around him . - Oh ! Agh ! Right ... ( Director moans ) No ! How dare you ! Beth , help me ! ( Bukov ) We 're going to analyse one of these instruction tapes . It 's the one from yesterday morning . Your programming of the HA57 dosage . It was because her dosage was incorrect that Edith Joynton died . - That 's a lie ! - Memory scanner ! - The heat is seven below , Bukov ! - Beth , don 't let them do it ! No , no , there was no error , you understand ? So , Director , you have contact ? Answer , please . ( Director ) Yeah , yeah , contact ... Ah , this is clear ... That 's right ... You 're programming the drug dosage for ... Beth , I think . - All in order . - This is idiocy ... ! Ah , yes , Edith Joynton . You begin programming ... - There was no error ! - You continue ... You are just prescribing the variable dosage when ... - Aaaagh ! - A blank ! A break in programming ! When the computer converted your instruction to manufacture , there was still a blank and Edith died ! - No ! - Shall we analyse the other tapes ? The ones relating to the water supply , the volunteers ? It 's because you suffer from blackouts , Director . Were you aware of that ? - Blackouts ? ! - They 're beyond your control , your mind goes blank . You 're not perfect , after all . 15 below , Bukov ! Director , you must go on brain link , correct the error you 've made . Error ... All this time ... Error ? No time to waste , Director ! Can 't be ... My brain ... The computer ... Most reliable combination in the world . - You must reprogram . - No , I don 't believe you . You 're deceiving me , all of you . Yeah ... You 're working against me as always . You , Beth , Bukov ... everyone ! You 're not worthy of me . I shall leave you . I shall leave you to your fate . Director ! - No ! - You must reprogram ! No ! Ow ! Director ! Larry , it 's so cold ... 20 below ... That 's ice , Beth. lce ... What are we going to do ? - The antifreeze . - What ? The serum , the stuff Bukov called antifreeze . You 're right ... We can 't wait any longer . Emergency signal to Central Control ... ( Beeping ) .. and the supply cupboard . Larry ... I 'm sorry . It 's all right . The serum , I 'm taking it to Mummy and Daddy . I think he ran right outside , Simon , right onto the ice . The finest scientific mind in the world , unable to face the fact that he could 've made a mistake . Take these , Mummy . Give Daddy some too . It 'll keep you alive till help arrives . It 's so cold . What 's happened ? The Ice Box is freezing over . The director could 've saved us but he 's gone . - Gone ? Where to ? - l don 't know ... He wouldn 't reprogram the computer . Bukov proved it was his fault Dr Joynton died . It 's his fault we 're freezing . He couldn 't face being wrong . ( Sighs ) Don 't worry , Mummy , Simon and I will get out of here , back to our own time , to you and Daddy . We 'll go on living as we did before . I won 't let any of this happen , I promise I won 't ! ( Wind whistles )

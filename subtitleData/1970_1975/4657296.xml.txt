 Hello ? Best you come up here . In the laboratory . I 'm waiting . Good day . Your book . Is that all ? Yes , many thanks . Dear , you were far away , weren 't you ? I 've got the book . You 're chasing a phantom . But no . Sytherlin 's experiments are written down carefully in the book . When did he invent this immortality drug ? The research results remained unknown . His records stop one day . But I 'm convinced there is a result . Do you really think ? 'Cause I can 't understand you anymore . What do you want ? So far , everything was fine . Nothing has changed between us . If nothing has changed , why are you then so obsessed with this idea ? It 's not an idea . It 's an emotion . I 'm scared . First everything was so beautiful . You felt safe for me . You said to me : What happens today , is life . That was so simple . I 've never thought about what tomorrow means . But tomorrow is coming closer . Together we can make it . Everything will be fine . You must believe me . I love you . I love you . When are we going ? Into this area . Lichtberg . There we need to go . A few days in the country . I don 't know ... why I thought of roses all the time . Back then . You had gone ahead . The sea had barely colour . Suddenly it was so quiet . Then a glass clattered back and forth . You hear no sound . At least it 's like this in my memory . It was warm but I froze . It wasn 't a state . It was like a pain . The terrace was empty , and I heard the sea again . Somewhere called a donkey , crickets , as always . Everything was as we knew it together . But I only thought of roses . Red roses . Coming ! - What do you like to drink ? - A coffee . Good day . I 'm looking for the mayor . You 're looking for the mayor ... What do you want from him ? I 'm looking for a professor . He lived here long ago . This is really quite a long time ago . Of course it is long ago . You are quite right . Anyway I will look for him . Thank you . - What did he say ? - Difficult to understand . Did he know anything ? No . Nothing . M 3 M 3 calling ... calling ... Test ended ... mission done ... 7.1.6 2.4.4.7 ... 1.3 ... beta vision ... Finding on channel 2.6 ... Professor Sytherlin ... not available . F 3 , Alpha , F 1.3 Contact establishing . No further informations . Headquarters . End . It makes probably no sense yet . - Should we better drive ? - I like this place , it makes me happy . Born . Died . People had much time back then . The wind . Eternal coming and going . Look . That is in fact immortality . Perhaps you overcome your fear of dying if you recall that now and then . It is not easy . I know it . Thank you father . Almighty Lord , we beg you , let us who face so much trouble caused by our weakness , breathe a new sigh of relief through the merits of the suffering of your only Son , who lives and reigns with you . In the name of the father , the son and the holy spirit . Amen . Go in peace . - Good day . - Good day . It 's getting dark soon . I 've been here for four years already . - Sometimes you 're very alone . - Yes . You know I 'm actually teacher in this village . My big passion is music . You 're still searching ? I have informations that will help you . As we left the village I hadn 't come further . You talked about new opportunities . Excursions into different times and dimensions become possible . The conventional aspects of time don 't exist anymore . Visiting this professor , for example , would be thinkable . You understand I have doubts ? I thought so . But your quest for immortality , how does that match with your work ? The decision I can 't make for you , but I 'm ready at any time to arrange a meeting with professor Sytherlin . The most important , the communication with the professor , you 'll have to do yourself . Think about it . I 'm so filled with longing and love . In heaven the angels are tender and pure . One must exorcise the devil from the humans . Loneliness I feel . Like Christ at the cross . Purity doesn 't burn . Change cools my bleeding wounds . I have trampled down a cross of straw . She will bleed . Bleak lilies , I put on her grave . FK calling ... FK calling . F 3.0.5 H 6.1.3 . ... new coded . Establish contact . Headquarters . End . Headquarters . End . Farmer Siggi has seen all three of them . Well , we haven 't dreamt anyway . The book alone ... - We could see them clearly , right ? - I don 't understand it anyway . You don 't get it . Just before you meant that ... You need to be totally calm now , understand ? Alright . - Possibly I can interprete you that way , so we ... - No ! - The trip you talk about ... - It failed . It was to no avail . There she is . My love ... I 'm old . - Older than you . - Yes . Yes ! Yes , yes . Of course . I 'm coming right now . Thank you . Good day . Lecture . How 's your experiment ? It 's fun , right ? But much work . Klaus Bexter startet already four years ago with plant experiments . And what did he want to find out ? Originally he only wanted to test with the polygraph how fast water that was absorbed by the roots would spread until the leave tips . Klaus Bexter had connectet the Philodendron plant to a polygraph . Like to humans who 's secrets you want to uncover . Then Bexter lighted a match to burn a leave tip . And it happened what Bexter had suspected . The polygraph reacted . The stylus drew a sharp graph on the running registry tape . As for a human an emotion was revealed . At the finger tips . But there was more . The stylus had already reacted before the heat of the flame had reached the leave . It seemed as if the plant was suddenly scared . As if it had sensed the threat . His newest experiment made his research spectacular . Bexter sent six men one by one into a room where there were two plants . A seventh man turned the room upside down . One plant lay on the ground . Destroyed , trampled down . Killed . Who was the offender ? Only the surviving plant could know it . Bexter connected it to a polygraph . Then he made the men come in one by one . When the fourth man entered the room the stylus of the polygraph reacted . He was in fact the offender . The plant had exposed him . I have new informations . Very good . Are you thinking ? Because you stopped . Yes ? I see this room for the first time as it really is . No formulas anymore but things . I 'm touching glasses and flasks . I feel the floor . Things are what they are . I 'm moving and I 'm sensing it . I 'm thinking and I 'm sensing it . I am whole and that is good . I 've cooked something good . Do you like something , yes ? - Yes . I have , until now , made an afford , through my research , to find a drug , that can give immortalty to us humans . Since ... your ... first visit , I have been thinking a lot . And I have stopped my experiments because I have seen , that it can 't only be about one particular structural formula , but only about conscious existence . I know now , I have always searched for harmony . for the meaning that for me turns all knowledge into pleasure . Because the fearful slow process of dying was my life until now . But now I have thought about all the things that really exist , and I see that this could already be everything , the joy of living consciously . To feel you live . To live with others . Without fear of missing anything . Time is just a condition . No escape for something , or towards something , no more limitation . Time is perception . The sun rising , the flower blooming . Mild air or cooling rain . Snow falling calmly , the body of my girl that I sense . We will think independently , and not use anybody , not force anybody . Feeling good and thus enable everyone to feel good . That 's actually everything . Wait . I 'm coming . Subtitles : The Huge Animal From The North

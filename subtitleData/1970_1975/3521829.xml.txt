 You , in here , while that girl ... How dare you ! I will kill you ! No one dares pry into the director 's affairs ... No one dares pry into the dir ... Director , I wondered if ... Ah , Bukov , just the man I wanted to see . That power failure , section four . - l thought something was wrong . - That was your fault . No , I checked the reactor . You picked up the germ of carelessness but we live an antiseptic existence . We don 't tolerate mistakes . Human error . You seem to have picked up the germ of careless ... Am I never to get cooperation from my staff ? Must I spend my years bearing the burden of responsibility alone ? Go away . Help me , all of you ... or leave me be . - What happened ? - He got his hands round my throat . - l thought he was going to kill me . - Then ? He just let go . You were in his room without permission . If you 're going to meddle , there 's something you 'd better know . Professor Devereaux is not like the rest of us in the ice Box . - What do you mean ? - Just what I say . Oh , he 's brilliant . The finest scientific mind in the world . But he isn 't a human being as you and I understand the term . He 's a new species . It 's the biggest secret in the ice Box . Professor Devereaux is different , Simon . A man of the future . But I still don 't see what you mean . That 's enough for you to be going on with . When you say he 's a new kind of species , do you mean he 's ... Well , some kind of machine ? Oh . No , a flesh-and-blood machine is an impossibility . You ought to know that . - Do you know about imprint cells ? - Imprint cells ? It 's known in biology that you can extract cells from a living being that contain his whole genetic structure . If these cells could then be cultivated , brought to maturity , the result would be another person , exactly the same as the person the cells came from , someone identical . A more advanced person , supposing also that he 'd been given the benefit of advanced techniques . But I still don 't get it . Professor Devereaux is ... A clone . That 's the word for it . And he 's the world 's first . Blimey . He 's exactly identical to that other Devereaux , the one you know about . I 've only just heard of him . The famous biologist . Imprint cells were taken from him . There was no technique to mature them , so they were scientifically stored . In the ' 70s , when conditions were right , a new Devereaux was given to mankind . - The finest scientific brain in the world . - Yes . Of course , we don 't know a lot about cloning yet , the effects it 's likely to produce . So Professor Devereaux himself could be called an experiment under observation , in the ice Box . - But he 's running the place . - With his abilities , he was given control . But Dr Joynton and I have been detailed by the lnternational Commission , who set up the ice Box , to keep him under observation and report . Oh . So that makes an incident like this evening 's more important than it seems . He seemed to go mad for a minute . Honestly . But a moment later ... Yes . I don 't know . Simon , if you notice anything you think I ought to know , I hope you 'll tell me . It seems to me you 're involved now , for some reason I don 't quite understand . Cassettes . Music tapes . Reading matter . There . You can 't complain you 're being harshly treated . But I want you to stay up here and cool your heels . I was doing nothing wrong outside the director 's office . This room locks electronically . I shall throw the switch . - lt 's just because it 's me , isn 't it ? - l beg your pardon ? Anyone else you wouldn 't worry about but you pick on me . - How did I grow up to be like you ? - Shut up . You 're hard . You 're mean . You 're a rotten cow . - l told you not to speak to me like that . - You 're a ratbag . What 's more , you 're not even pretty , not as pretty as Larry thinks you are . - Poor chump . - Let 's get this thing straight , shall we ? I don 't want anything to do with you . If the computer hadn 't summoned you , I 'd take you by the neck and shove you straight back through your ridiculous time barrier . The computer didn 't do anything of the kind . The computer doesn 't make mistakes . However strange and impossible it may seem , the computer summoned you and the computer shall have you . My wishes and my feelings come second to that . And Simon ? Simon wasn 't doing anything wrong down there either . I 'm locking this door . ( Jean on intercom ) ' Liz ? Liz ? ' Mummy , it 's locked . What 's happened ? - Can 't you see I 've been locked in ? - But why ? Because Beth thought I should be . Simon and I were prowling around the director 's office and she put me in jail . - The director 's office ? - Simon wanted to find something out . Why is Beth like she is ? I can 't understand it . And why does she hate me so ? If I 'm really her , then she should be kind to me . Liz , listen to me . You must be very careful when you 're here . Believe me , they can be very hard when they like . - l can see they 've got you believing it . - What ? You hate the place . Why did you ever come ? - We 're not talking about me . - Let 's talk about you . Please. I can 't stand much more . It 's all so confusing . Beth , you , it 's barmy ! Yes . Yes , I suppose you 've got a right to know more . Well , Liz , it all began as I told you , in the late ' 70s , when we lost our home . Mummy , how did that happen ? - Your father 's business failed . - Daddy ? He 'd never really been very successful , you know , Liz . Times were bad and he took a big chance and lost . - We looked for another way of living . - Why ? Beth had the idea of coming here , to the ice Box , in 1980 . When did I ... she change her name to Beth ? That same year . She 'd gone in for what was called an intelligence enhancement course . It 's common today. lt extends a person to the limit of their capacity . In Beth 's case , it brought about a change of personality . She was completely different . I could hardly recognise her as the girl she 'd been before . As Liz . I often wonder if she took the course before it was completely safe to do so . I 've heard of similar cases . Anyway , that 's it , Liz . You became Beth . I came here because there wasn 't anything else to do . I still wanted to be near her in case some day she should change back . - lt 's been hard for you , Mummy , but ... - Yes ? What about Daddy ? Please , don 't go. I 've got to ask you . Why won 't you answer ? is something wrong ? - No . - Then why won 't you tell ? - Your father isn 't dead . - Then what ? Please ! There 's nothing for you to worry about . I 'd like to say more but I 've decided it would be unwise . You mustn 't worry about Beth either . I 'll see you 're let out of here. I 'll look after you , just as I did in other days . Now , trust me , darling . Please , trust me . ( Men chuckling ) ( Buzzing ) All hands on deck . Action stations . Get fell in . One day that woman will drive me round the bend . - Don 't make it a long journey . - There you are . One for you , Bukov . One for you , Simon . One for you , Liz . The director has his dosage delivered privately . One for you , Beth , and one for you , Larry . Well , here 's to the next 100 years , my children . - Kia ora . - ( All ) Kia ora . - Come on , Liz , have a try . - No , I don 't want to . What are you afraid of ? It 's the standard form of relaxation here . - Not yet . - She doesn 't have to . If you don 't change your ways , you 're as bad as Beth . That 's an awful thing to say . ( Larry ) Beth ! I 've never believed you 're as uptight as they say . Show the kid how . The computer can join our fantasies together if we want . - We could fly to the moon . - Honest ? I 'm busy , Larry . Surely you can see that . What is it I like about you anyway , the way you draw up a schedule ? - Fly to the moon , Larry ? Really ? - Sure . The computer can do anything once you 're plugged in . - You and I could really fly to the moon ? - Why not ? - Let 's do it . - Terrific . Now I know why I came . To find the right girl to get lost in the stars with . If I remember rightly , you came because you were redundant at home and needed a job . Your work was just good enough for us to accept you . The lady speaks nothing but the truth . But I wonder if she believes in anything , apart from those personnel reports she has to write . - OK , kid , blastoff . - Oh , look , wait . Right . We hold hands and that links us computer-wise . Hold hands . - Oh , it 's real , it is . - Quiet . Quiet . Deep fantasy now . Simon . You and Liz attend Dr Joynton first thing in the morning for calibration checks . - Present this slip . - What are calibration checks ? - What they sound like , measurements . - For clothes ? Don 't be stupid . The director wants to get started on the AB experiment . We need the measurements of your body organs to be replaced with machine parts . You intend to replace our organs with artificial ones ? - Of course . - So that 's the AB experiment . To fill Liz and me up with machine parts . You volunteered . Simon , you don 't deceive me . No matter how you got here , the computer summoned you . As volunteers , you and Liz are really very lucky young people . inefficient and obsolete organs of your body are to be removed and replaced . You 'll be the first man machine in the history of the world . ( High-pitched beeping ) Four . Two . Three . - Dr Joynton . - And 0-05 . Right , Director , that should do it . Kids , all through . Feed the calculations to the computer . - Make sure there 's no errors . - Of course . And double-check the specifications for the boy 's new heart . Yes , Director . I want you to do the surgery , Dr Joynton . - Thank you . - We can set a date for two weeks . That settles the internal organs . Now , the limbs we intend to replace . Oh . Yes , certainly . Now , Liz , you 'd better come along with me . What for ? We 're going to give you a nice new arm and we need to make a caste . - But I don 't want a nice new arm ! - Liz . What 's the matter with the one I 've got ? I 'd look a freak with a tin arm . That 's a good joke . The arm we 're giving you is 1 , 000 times more efficient than the one you 've got . - Just think , stronger , easier to use . - Just like your new leg . - A leg ? - You bet . You 'll really be able to kick a football around with that . Oh , well , you come along ten minutes after Liz . Come on . - Simon . - Yes , Director . Never enter my office again , you hear ? Never for any reason . - l was only curious . - Curiosity is a vice in the ice Box . I program the computer , which lays down the pattern of our lives . Did you learn how to program the computer through depth research ? What do you know about that ? Only what Dr Bukov was saying . Did you find the secret of HA57 through depth research ? It 's something terrific. lt must be the greatest scientific advancement ever . You 're concerned for the advancement of science , for its own sake , in complete detachment , beguiling innocence ? If you had the luck and ingenuity , Simon , you could make your name ring from pole to pole . You could emerge from the ice Box as the greatest scientific innovator . - The inventor of the longevity drug . - No . Don 't lie . People would like to get hold of the formula I perfected. lt won 't happen . - But ... - lt is well guarded . Personal to me ... So keep out of my office , Simon . Attend to your own business . No more prying . They really mean to do it . They 're going to give us new lungs and legs and arms . - We 've been measured up . - So that 's the AB experiment . They said they 'll operate in a fortnight . - lt 's a mistake . Has no one realised ? - No . They think we 're volunteers . They keep saying the computer can 't make mistakes , even Beth . If only one could get away from the computer . This is a dreadful place . How can you stay here ? Liz , we can 't cope with the situation . You must go back . You and Simon back through the time barrier . But I can 't , not till I know about Daddy . I can 't tell you . Don 't you understand ? You 'd let them do these awful things ? How can I stop them ? I 'm something of a prisoner . - l 'll stay if you don 't speak . - You can 't do that . Don 't you think I 'd speak willingly if I could ? Be fair , Liz. I want to protect you , but you must think of me . To have you with me again like this , it 's like a miracle . I have so much trouble with Beth , I can do without more from you . Please go . Mummy . Why is it that you can 't remember that you let me come to the ice Box ? - l let you come ? - You did . Simon and I went back after we found the place and I told you I 'd seen you here and you said ... Oh , Liz . I don 't remember anything about that . Why ? It 's the biggest mystery of all . I remember you and Simon coming back from 1940 but after that ... lt 's strange. lt 's just a blank . We live among mysteries , Liz . We must be brave enough to bear them . I can tell you this much , I do think this is a dreadful place . The things they do here frighten me . Then why do you stay ? Just for Beth ? Isn 't that a good enough reason ? I think Beth 's hopeless , all mixed up . Nothing to do with me . All right , there 's another reason . I 'll tell you on condition you go back through the time barrier . It 's not much , Liz , but it 's as much as I can say . I stay here for your father 's sake . If it wasn 't for him , I wouldn 't be here . There . All right , Larry . I 'm ready for brain link now . - Convert the computer from autocontrol . - Yes , Director . - And now he is one with the computer . - How ? What 's the process ? The electrical charges in his brain are interpreted by the computer to correct human error . The computer sends back corrected thoughts so that they 're absolutely reliable . - There 's a lot only the director can do ? - Yes , he 's an exceptional person . - Dr Bukov . - Yes . You know you said if I noticed anything about the director , I was to speak ? There is one thing . He has blackouts every so often . - Blackouts ? - lt 's strange. I wasn 't sure at first . I am now . When you found him in his office , he tried to strangle me . - You said that . - Then he stopped in the middle of it . - Changed his mind ? - No. lt was as if he 'd fallen asleep . He just wasn 't there for a minute . ( Mumbling ) - Haven 't you noticed it ? - l can 't say that I have . Well , what could it mean ? As I told you , a clone is a new species of human being. lt 's always possible ... Bukov , we 've got power surge on the No.14 channel again . - You 'd better have a look . - Say nothing to anyone about this . We 'll have to do it now so we can find out about the longevity drug . But why ? We can 't hang around for new arms and legs . I meant , what does it matter about the longevity drug ? - l promised Commander Traynor . - Commander Traynor ! - What matters more ? - Mummy and what 's going on here . - And Larry . - What do you mean ? You were getting on fine with him in the fantasy room . Well , he 's fun , isn 't he ? He makes me laugh . You never do . I didn 't mean to start anything . - This doesn 't matter . - Are you two OK ? Lovers ' tiff , eh ? My , we haven 't had one of those round here since they sunk the foundations . Keep up the good work , kids . I 've got to find out . Can 't you understand ? - Right , go in here . - But it 's all dark . There must be a light . Quick . ( Gasps ) That block that glows . What 's that for ? Come on . We 'd better get out of here . ( Clattering ) Who is it ? Ah ! ( Gasps ) You two again . The fantasy room . Dr Joynton ? Dr Joynton ?

 PLANET OF THE APES 1x08 " THE DECEPTION " Subtitles by subXpacio We are met to bid farewell ... to one who lived amongst us . It has been said of the ape ... that his days are like grass . Like a flower of the field , he flourishes , ripening in fullness and is gone . Rest forever , O Lucian , father of Fauna . Why ? Why ? How could they do it ? They 're animals , Fauna . That 's all , just animals . They don 't know any better . I hate them . I hate them ! We will capture them , Fauna . I make this promise to you on the grave of your father . The humans will be captured and punished for what they have done . A hundred humans for every ape . They hide their killers . They will lie for their killers . The time has come , Perdix , for the apes to unite , drive the humans out . No ! This will be handled within the law , and I am the law . Yeah , it 's a nice friendly little community you have here , Jasko . They 're doing this all because one ape was killed ? Well , the killing caused the kettle to boil over . The apes here hate the humans . There 's too many of us . These Dragoons , as you call them , surely they 're illegal . I mean , even ape law forbids such action against humans . Perdix and Zon , well , they try , but they can 't be everywhere . Come on ! Something , anything , jump on that hook . Galen , why don 't you let us teach you how to fish ? Oh , no . The only thing I like less than fish is the water they swim in . Look ! Dragoons . Let 's go ! - Clear out , human ! - This is my home ! Then watch it burn . No , don 't ! No ! No ! Let that be a lesson to all humans . Oh , boy . It 's so senseless . Why ? Why , why ? I could make a guess . We 've seen this kind of thing before . Another time , another place . It almost makes me ashamed to be an ape . Isn 't there something we can do ? For openers , we can look for the killers . This whole thing started when that ape girl 's father was murdered . Maybe she could help us . I 'll talk to her . Who is it ? Who 's there ? Uh , we are strangers ... but we wish you no harm . You are apes ? I don 't think there 's any doubt that I am an ape , a chimpanzee . Why ? I 'm sorry , but for a moment , I - I was afraid you were humans . Surely you 're not afraid of humans ? They killed my father . I 'm sorry , but I didn 't know that they killed apes . They 're savages , and I hate them ! I shall always hate them for what they did . Uh , my name is Phoebus , and , uh , these are my friends . Alar and , uh , Pargo . I am Fauna . Where are you ? We 're right here . Your voice sounds familiar . Which one are you ? I 'm Pargo . I don 't think you 've ever met me . I 'm from a very distant place . Yes , we 've been traveling for a long way . You must be tired and hungry , then . Won 't you come to my house and rest ? I have food and drink . - Do you live alone ? - With my uncle , Sestus . He has gone to the village for supplies , but he will be back by nightfall , Well , uh , we don 't have very much time to spare , but we are very hungry , Good . Follow me , then . I hope you will stay to see Uncle Sestus . You will like him . You will be notified when we raid again . See you , Sestus . Please , sit down and be comfortable . - Uh , may we help you with something ? - Because I am blind ? No , don 't be silly , I manage quite well . Oh . Being unable to see has really changed very little . I know the farm and most of the area around for some distance so well ... that I don 't really need my eyes . Of course , there are - there are some things I miss . Setting of the sun , colors of the flowers . And-And reading . Reading , most of all . M - My father collected books , and though I read them all before I lost my sight , he , uh , he used to sit ... and read them to me over and over again . Every night by the fire , my father would - I 'm sorry , Fauna . Those humans , you know who they were ? No one knows . My uncle Sestus was going to meet my father and saw it . but he was too far away to help . How did it happen ? There were two of them . They had come here asking for food , and my father gave it to them , We tried to be friends with them . Uncle Sestus warned him that humans were treacherous , but he wouldn 't listen . Then later , down by the sea , they attacked my father , and they killed him . What about your uncle ? Did he get a description of them ? How tall they were , their hair , what they were wearing , anything ? No . No , it was dark . He saw very little . Besides , how can you tell one human from another ? When I could see , they all looked alike to me , I have the same problem . - Pargo ? Pargo , where are you ? - Right here . Oh . I 'm-I 'm sorry , Fauna , I 'm-I 'm afraid I spilled the milk . It 's all right , I-I 'll clean it up . Pour yourself some more . Uncle Sestus ! Uh , Fauna , I think there 's something we better tell you . What ? What is it ? Um , you said that you missed reading most of all . Well , the love of books is something that we share with you . Unfortunately , it 's gotten us into some trouble with the Ministry of Knowledge . Trouble ? What-What kind of trouble ? Well , uh , there are some books which we didn 't know had been banned , and the police found them in our house . - They were going to punish you for reading ? - No , actually , you see , it was the ideas in the book that some people felt challenged their whole way of life . But surely it can 't be against the law to think ? Well , your uncle might not be as understanding as you are , so I think we 'd better leave . Yes , we 'd better go . I 'm afraid Uncle Sestus doesn 't feel the same as I do about books . He and my father used to quarrel about them . I have an idea - a place where you can hide safely and rest . - It 's not far from here . Oh , please ! - I don 't think that would be a - Let me do this for you . It would give me so much pleasure . This way . Whoa ! They 're still here . I haven 't needed these for a long time . I used to come here with someone I grew up with . Someone I cared for very , very much . It-It was our secret place . where we could laugh and hide and shut out the grown-up world . Then he left when I became blind . - Pargo ? - I 'm here , Fauna . Your voice reminded me - It sounded so much like his . I wonder . May I touch your face ? It would help to know what you look like . Yes , it 's just as I thought - a strong , handsome face . You 'll be safe here , I 'll come back in the morning with food ... after Uncle Sestus leaves for the village . Will you stay ? Please , I 'll-I 'll stay . Thank you , Fauna , - Oh , man , that was close . - Whoa . I didn 't like doing that . I don 't think it 's right to deceive her . - Yeah . - And we still came up empty ? - She has no idea who the killers are . - Except they were humans . - If only we could find them . - Yes , I know . I feel sorry about her father . We 're out to try and stop the Dragoons , not solve a local murder mystery . Hey , the Dragoons are local killers , right ? - They 're homegrown . - Right . I mean , those two humans who killed Fauna 's father , they could be homegrown too , you know . You can bet that some ape 's gonna find them and gun ' em down . It 's open season on humans , hmm ? And who 's gonna stop the apes ? Okay , so we zero in on the Dragoons , try to get to their leader , We get in , the whole thing could fall apart . Oh , that doesn 't make any sense at all . I mean , if you do find a member , do you expect him to be the leader ? - No , Galen . - Somebody joins the Dragoons . Infiltrates and gets the scoop on everybody . Oh . And who is this somebody that gets this scoop on every - Me . Stop ! - Oh , stop . Please . - Whoa , whoa . - Stop ! Please ! - Whoa ! What is it ? What 's the matter ? I 've been attacked by two humans . They stole my horse ! What sort of district is this ? Have you no law and order ? I understand your anger , but don 't shout at me ! - I 'm sorry . - I didn 't steal your horse . Look , I 'm sorry , but you see , I came here to find a farm and to settle down . Well , this is a good district , although we do have problems with humans . We are solving those problems . Oh , I 'm sure . Please , is there a village near here where I can report this to the police ? Climb up , I 'll take you there . Oh , thank you . Oh , oh , that 's wonderful . Oh . Oh ! Huh . You know , I never knew there was so much ham in an ape . Dragoon ? Who knows ? Maybe . Come on , we could follow him , maybe learn something . Wait . No " we , " me . Fauna 's expecting you back at the cave . We don 't want her to get suspicious . A few weeks past , my brother was murdered by humans . Really ? Well , I certainly hope those humans were dealt with . Haven 't been caught yet . I sometimes wonder if they ever will . Huh . You and I have something in common . A similar thing happened where I lived . We knew how to deal with those - Ooh , ah - Oh , sorry . I was pledged to secrecy . You don 't think that I 'd ever say anything to hurt an ape ? Or help a human ? Well , really , a group of us apes got together , and we ran those humans off and burned their houses , and we even killed a few . - Did you really ? - Ho , ho , ho , we certainly did . Oh , I can tell you we haven 't had any trouble with humans since then . Good ! Very sound . You know , Phoebus . I think you will enjoy meeting some special friends of mine . Hello , Fauna . - Pargo ? - Yeah . Alar is not here ? I brought food . No , no , he and Phoebus went off to get some water . I am glad , I enjoy talking with you . Yeah , well , uh , yeah , me too . - Pargo ? - Yeah ? Could you tell me about the books you 've read ? Could you tell me some of the stories ? Uh , yeah , I guess . Yeah , well , there was this one I always used to like . It was a story about this - about an ape ... who was stranded out on this island out in the middle of this tremendous ocean , Now , his name was Robinson Crusoe . A toast to our Dragoon-to-be , Phoebus ! - To Phoebus ! - To Phoebus ! - To all apes ! - All apes ! - To all Dragoons ! - To all Dragoons ! Congratulations , Phoebus , you 're soon to be one of us . Oh , you don 't know how pleased that makes me . At the meeting tonight , you 'll get our leader 's final approval . And then I will be a full-fledged Dragoon . A brother to all of us . Afterwards , you 'll ride with us while we raid on the humans . Sucker . Whoa , easy , boy . Whoa , easy , boy . Easy , boy . - Hey , Alan ! - Pete ! How 'd you do ? Our friend led me to the Dragoon 's meeting place . - About a mile from here . - Nice goin ' . Now , if Galen clicks , we 're in business . Get a load of this . What is it ? It 's a journal written by Fauna 's father . He wrote it , but she never knew what was in it , so she asks me to read it to her . I stop when I get to the part where he mentions ... he 's meeting with humans in secret-humans that he liked , - They were buddies . They liked him too . - Yeah ? He knows that the apes are afraid of humans and that they hate humans , right ? But he 's meeting with them in secret to teach 'em things , to share his knowledge with . Alan , it doesn 't make sense . No human is gonna try to harm the only ape in the world ... who 's knockin ' himself out tryin ' to help them . I wonder if Sestus could be , uh , mistaken . What if her father wasn 't killed by humans ? Yeah , mistaken or lying ? Come on . Whoa ! My niece , Fauna , will see to you . Tell her that you 'll be staying with us , and I 'll be back shortly . - Fauna - that 's a pretty name . - Gentle girl . Oh , she 's blind . And , Phoebus , she knows nothing of my activities . I 'd like it kept that way . Oh , of course , of course . When I return , I 'll bring a horse for you . You 'll be needing it . - Oh , hello . - Phoebus ? Yes . Here , let me help you . Did you get your water ? Water ? Yes , Pargo said you and Alar went to get some . Oh , water , yes ! Oh , hey , I think that 's finished . Yeah . - You were with Pargo , huh ? - At the cave . - Oh ? - He told me a story ... about an ape named Robinson Crusoe . Oh , he has a way with females . I think I love him . Isn 't that , uh , kind of sudden ? I know he reminds me of someone else , but it isn 't just that . There 's a warmth in his voice , a gentleness all his own ... that makes me feel more alive than I 've felt in a long time . Fauna . you must be careful . You can 't trust a love that comes so quickly . Is time any guarantee that a love will be binding ? Phoebus , I know it 's asking a lot for him to love someone who 's blind , but do you think it 's possible ? - Do you want an honest answer ? - Of course . No . I do not think that it is possible . I can do anything that a female with sight can do . Except to recognize the truth ! He is not an ape ! That you can , uh , trust . I don 't believe you ! I think you 're the one that 's not to be trusted ! You 're supposed to be his friend , you speak of him as an enemy ! He is my friend ! But I know him . And I 'm - I 'm very concerned about you . I don 't want to hear anymore from you ! J - J - Leave me alone ! Go away ! Galen , any luck ? Oh , you were right . Sestus not only knows about the Dragoons , he is one of them . - What do you know about that ? - Huh . I 've won their confidence . In fact , I am being brought up for membership ... at a special meeting later today . - Hey , good work , kid . - Yeah , we knew you could pull it off . Yes , we all have a great deal to proud of , isn 't that right , Pete ? Well , I can 't take any credit . I haven 't done anything . Oh , but you have . You have indeed . - What 's eatin ' you anyway ? - I 'll tell you what 's eating me . I think you should stay away from Fauna . I 'm sorry , Galen , I don 't understand . - She is in love with you ! - What do you mean , she 's in love with me ? She told me ! She asked me if I thought you could be in love with her . - Well , that 's ridiculous . - Ridiculous ? It 's tragic . Can you imagine what that is going to do to her when she finds out that you are human ? Wait a minute . You 're the one who made her think I was an ape . I didn 't think you were going to get involved ! I 'm not involved ! All right , come on now , knock it off , both of you . What happened , happened . Nobody planned it . Oh . Look , Galen , I don 't wanna hurt her any more than you do . I 'm not going to . I 'll go talk to her . - Pete . - What ? - Be gentle with her . - Yeah . Hi , Fauna . Yeah , it 's me , Pargo . You shouldn 't be here . Yeah , well , I had to talk to you . Did Phoebus tell you what I said to him ? - Look , Fauna - - It 's all right . It 's all right if you don 't care for me . I understand . It 's too soon , Perhaps in time you will , and then - Look , um , I think you 're very lovely ... and gentle , There are things about me you don 't even know ! Now you sound like Phoebus . Yeah , well , maybe you should have listened to him . You tell me - You tell me what is so wrong about you ... that it surpasses what is wrong with me . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . You know , this reminds me of a story ... my mother used to tell me when I was very young . Tell me . Well ... this is a story about an old blind man named Isaac ... and his two sons , Jacob and Esau . Esau , uh , was a hunter , and he was strong and hairy , and his father idolized him . Old Isaac was very sick , and on this deathbed , he gave Esau his blessing , which was a big thing in those days . Now the other son , Jacob , had very soft , smooth skin , and he wanted his father 's blessing as well , so he pretended to be his brother Esau ... by covering his hand with a piece of goatskin . And , uh , Isaac was fooled ... into thinking that he was touching Esau , and he gave Jacob the same blessing . I 'm not sure that-that I understand the meaning of your story . It was a deception , Fauna , born out of desperate need , but not meant to harm anyone . But you couldn 't deceive anyone , Pargo . I have touched your face . It is strong , like Esau 's . If it was soft and smooth like Jacob 's , I should fear and despise you , Fauna , you must understand that there is nothing between us ... and there can never be , My friends and I are going to leave here today , and you 'll never s - and you will never hear my voice again . Oh , no . Good-bye , Fauna . Hold it ! Hold it ! No yelling . Just take it easy , Perdix . We just wanna talk to you . Look , we need your help . Our friend is going to a meeting of the Dragoons tonight . If you wanna get them , we 'll take you there . Our friend 's gonna be in trouble , big trouble , so , we 're not asking you , we 're telling you , - I 'm not Perdix . - Are you looking for me ? As leader of the High Council , I now call the Dragoons to order ! If there are no objections , we will not list the grievances voiced by the humans on our last raid . It seems these humans are now dead . I understand ... we have a new prospect who wishes to join our ranks . Will he please stand ? Oh . - Your name ? - Phoebus . - Who vouches for Phoebus ? - I , Sestus . Ah , Sestus , good , Are you , Phoebus , familiar with the goals of the Dragoons ? Oh , yes . To drive all humans from our land . - And the humans who refuse ? - Death to them . Death to them all ! It appears Sestus has brought us a worthy prospect . Let us take a vote . Welcome , Phoebus , brother Dragoon . Now and forever . Our next raid - Our next raid will be on the human shepherd , Rico . We meet tomorrow at midday . Are we agreed ? - Agreed ! - And , Phoebus ... you , you will have the honor of killing him . Thank you very much . - Until tomorrow ! - Wait ! Excuse me , I just - I 'm really not very used to this yet . Uh , is it over ? - Of course . - So soon ? We have no further business to conduct . Oh , I have something to say ! You know those two humans who stole my horse and attacked me ? I saw them . - Where ? - Actually , it was quite near here . - Near my farm ? I don 't believe it . - They were just passing through . They were heading for the beach . In fact , I am sure they were heading for the beach . Why don 't we go down there and find them ? At night ? Well ... I hardly think they 're going to wait until morning . It 's impossible to search the caves and the cliffs in the dark . Oh . At first light , we meet on the beach at Sandy Point . Agreed ? - Agreed . - Don 't worry . We 'll get them , I promise you . And you can kill them instead of Rico , if you wish . Oh , thank you . Thank you . Is anything wrong , Phoebus ? Oh , no . Oh , no , no , no . Uh , nothing could be better . Nothing . Come , I 'll take you back to the farm . Oh ! Do you mind ... if I stay here for a while ? I mean , it 's such a very ... very special night . It 's such a very special place for me , I would like to ... enjoy it alone for a while . Oh , of course , of course . I 've listened to everything that you have to say . It is clear to me that you are lying . Come on , Perdix . How can you be sure of that if you don 't check out our story ? You could not know about the Dragoons ' meeting place . Even I have not been able to learn that . Why would we come here to lie ? It 's too easy to prove or disprove . I will put you back in your cells and go to this meeting place you speak of . If the Dragoons are there , you will be released . They 're not there now , Perdix ! They were last night ! First , they are there , then they are not there . I will decide whether to execute you at once ... or advise Urko before shooting you . Well , that 's a great pair of options . Back to your cells , Move ! Here , take his gun . Back , get back ! - Against the wall ! Carefully ! - Who are you ? I am wearing this mask so you won 't find out . Now , why would I tell you ? I 'll find out , I 'll track you down if it takes ten years ! I hope you find something better to do with your time the next ten years . You can start by capturing the Dragoons . - But you are a Dragoon ? - It 's a long story . My horse is out back . Now , the Dragoons will be at Sandy Point . - Got it . - Take him . We 'll meet you on the cliffs . - Come on ! - Perdix , we 're going for a little ride . Outside , nice and easy . Where have you been ? I seem to remember that our plan called for you to bring Perdix to the meeting . Ah , he changed our minds . Oh . Wait , wait , wait . Now , you said you wanted the Dragoons . Let 's see if you 're more interested in them than you are in killing me . Come on . Come on , come on , Come on . There 's no one in there ! More caves further back on the beach . All of you , throw down your weapons . - Throw them down ! - No ! Don 't be a fool , Zon . You 're the fool , Perdix . A fool not to side with us . All right , turn your back . Let us kill humans ! We have ten weapons to your one . Are you willing to die to save humans ? Are you willing to die to kill me , Zon ? We-We 've gone too far , Zon . Shut up , Sestus . We set out to do something , and we 're gonna finish it . I will shut up as far as humans are concerned , but not apes ! I 'll kill anyone - human or ape - who try to stop us . Fauna , Fauna , it 's all right now . It 's all right . - Pargo , Pargo , is that you ? - Yes , Fauna . No ! No , you 're not Pargo . You 're human ! It was a deception born of desperate need , Fauna , not meant to harm . Oh , get away ! - Get away from me ! - Fauna , Fauna ! Fauna , this is your uncle . It 's Sestus . - Nothing to be afraid of . - But he 's human ! He 's human ! - Don 't worry , he 's not going to hurt you . - No ! Get him away ! Get him away ! He-He tricked me . He tricked me , like the others tricked my father , And they 're treacherous , like animals , and they must be treated like animals ! Fauna , now listen to me ! This human saved your life , He risked his own life to save you . No , I hate him . I hate him . A human killed my father ! He killed him ! Now , Fauna , Fauna , it 's Alar , Listen to me , please , listen , I don 't know if a human did kill your father . But if it happened , that doesn 't mean that all humans are bad , just like all apes aren 't good . This Alar speaks the truth . It was not a human that caused your father 's death . - Shut up , Sestus . - What are you saying , Sestus ? I hated and feared humans as you do now , but your father was different . He didn 't fear the humans , he trusted them . - That night , I was with Zon . - No , Sestus ! We warned your father , but he was stubborn , Zon became angry , there was a fight . Zon hit him . He fell and hit his head on a rock , - Oh , God . - Zon said ... we were both responsible for his death . Fauna , I couldn 't bring myself ... to tell you the truth . Sestus is a coward . But what difference does it make who killed Lucian ? The humans are still our enemies . We must drive them from our lands , Kill them . Kill the humans ! Well , listen to me . Listen to me . Kill them ! Kill them ! Do you hear me ? Listen to me . Kill them ! Kill them ! Give me your pistol , Zon . Let 's go . You 're welcome to stay on at the farm . Thank you , Sestus , but we gotta be movin ' on . Fauna - Look , I - Fauna , I 'm sorry . I hope you forgive me for deceiving you . I - I just don 't understand ... how-how I could 've thought I loved a human . Good-bye . Subtitles subXpacio

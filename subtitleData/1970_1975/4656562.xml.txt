I 'm sure I shall . Shall we continue ? The spares situation might need reviewing . - I 'd like the level up 20 per cent . - Funny you should say that . Straker asked me to get your ideas on the subject . He had the same idea . - Hi , Colonel ! - Hi , Lew ! What times are you making on the Interceptor launches ? - About 125 seconds flat . - That 's pretty good . Well , that 's it for this month . - I 'll report a clean bill of health . - Fine .

'Impact confirmed . Interceptor 1 destroyed . ' Why , Alec ? - You 've read the report . - Yes . An astronaut killed , a UFO through the outer defences . The report tells me what happened , I want to know why . I don 't really know . - Alec , I know you better than that . - Things happened so fast . - Meaning ? - I can 't be sure . I 'll settle for an educated guess , Alec . The error could have been human . A decision was taken , it could have worked , but it didn 't . Right . I want the 2 surviving astronauts and Lieutenant Ellis back here on the next moon flight . Right . Oh , what happened to the UFO ? We lost it in a radar blind spot . But one thing 's certain : it landed . Landed ? Where ? Just about the worst place possible . Somewhere in an area of 50,000 square miles in northern Canada . Everything we got that flies is out looking for it . Have completed grid search . Nothing to report . 'OK , skiper . See you in one hour . ' No , I 'm going around again . It 'll stay light long enough for one more run . It looks a long way off , doesn 't it ? Might as well be at the other end of the universe . Has anyone seen Lieutenant Ellis ? - She 's in Central Park . - Thanks . There 's a lucky one who 'll be back on terra firma tomorrow . If by terra firma you mean Straker 's carpet , rather them than me . Gay , we all took the same chance . Ken was unlucky . These things happen . Nobody 's to blame . Don 't give me that crud , Masden . Find it ! If you need more aircraft , appropriate them . Yes . Yes , I 'm giving you the authority . Yes . Right . Right . - What now ? - ' The Moonbase personnel are here . ' Send them in . - Now , look , Alec ... - I know , I know . - You want that UFO located . - Yes . Bradley , Waterman , Lieutenant Ellis ... I assume you know why you are here ? I 'd like to say something , sir . As Interceptor leader , I want to accept complete and sole responsibility for what happened . Very gallant . Yes , that 's a very brave gesture . But out of line . I know what happened , now I want to know why . You people were selected because of your outstanding character , as well as intellect . What went wrong ? Anything from those satellite shots ? - No , sir . - Well , keep looking . It 's got to be there somewhere . 'Have relocated UFO in area blue . ' - Straker . - ' We 've picked it up . ' Great . I 'll be right there . Thank you , Greenland . - Where is it ? - Crossing the Atlantic seaboard . Speed is down . The Interceptors must 've damaged it . - Alert Sky 1 . - Right , sir . 'SHADO HQ , skipper . They 've located the UFO . ' Be right there ! I 've got the UFO 's fix . If we steer 042 we meet in 18 minutes . Right . Alter course to 042 ! Give her everything she 's got ! Maximum speed ! Lieutenant Ellis , Waterman , begin the computer test while I interview Bradley . Right . - Cigarette ? - Thank you . Nervous ? No . There 's no need to be . This is all quite confidential . Please sit . There . Before we start , I 'd like to get one thing straight . I 've no liking for you blacks . Have you ever heard that phrase on Moonbase ? No , never . You didn 't seem surprised when I said it . I assumed you didn 't mean it . Good . Good . This time we 'll get it . Range 800 miles , sir . Closing . - Launch stations . - Launch stations ! - Liftoff stations . - Yes , sir . Good luck . Right . Stand by for liftoff . Levelling off at 10,000 . Roger . Sky One airborne , sir . Thanks . Word association . Ready ? - Father . - Mother . - Hot . - Cold . - Geometry . - Variable . Yes , of course . You were a pilot before an astronaut . - Apple . - Teacher . - Sun . - Moon . - Tree . - Pine . - Hate . - Love . Love . 'This is SHADO Control . 'UFO 48 miles from your present position . ' Thanks , Control . I have it on the scope . Have visual contact . Closing for attack . Sky 1 reports a hit but UFO has turned and is still airborne . Signal all radar stations . Tell the commanders if they lose it this time , they 'll answer to me . Get some rest , Alec . You look tired . SHADO Control to all radar tracking stations . UFO has been hit , but is still airborne . - Did he say anything else ? - No , just that I 'd been cleared and I 'm on the next flight back to the moon . And us ? He 's the one who needs looking at . 'Don 't worry , he can 't hear in that glass case . ' Tell me something . Does SHADO have anyone checking him out ? If they did it would probably be a computer . Lieutenant Ellis , will you come in , please ? Please sit down . - Coming down , sir . - Great . When it lands , let me know its exact position . Oh , have a seat , Alec . I don 't believe it ! - Oh , that 's for you . - Thanks . Well , the UFO has landed , but this time , we know where . Exact position ? Close enough to Lexfield Air Base for you to be there by first light . - Fine . - I want them , Alec . I want them alive . I 'll do what I can . You 'll be the Field Commander . I 'll monitor the operation from here . Central Control will give you all the details , but the Transporter will be ready for takeoff at 2100 hours . - Fine . - Oh , one more thing , Alec . Dr Shroeder has finished with the Moonbase personnel . His report is quite clear . I 'd like you to handle that , too . - I 'll do it before I leave . - This is the way I want it done . - ' Mahogany . ' - ' Table . ' - ' Grass . ' - ' Green . ' - ' Laugh . ' - ' Cry . ' This is an interesting reaction . Watch this carefully . - ' Sunrise . ' - ' Morning . ' 'Black . ' 'Black . ' 'Bird . Blackbird . ' 'Blackbird . Ah , yes , yes . Good . ' A 2.04 second delay . You could see her mind racing . She was consciously avoiding giving the standard answer : white . Look at the stress factor at that point , 5 times normal . And your conclusions are based on that ? They 're based on 8 hours of exhaustive tests , 20 years of experience and the computer 's conclusion . That example was one even a layman might understand . I 'll leave you to it . Come in , come in . Sit down . I won 't waste time with the details of this report because you 'll be given copies . But I 'd like to read its conclusions . " 1 ) Taking into account the circumstances at the time , it was clearly the duty of Lieutenant Ellis to decide the type of evasive action to be taken . " " On that count , Lieutenant Ellis is cleared , provided the decision was in no way influenced by emotional factors . " " 2 ) The three personnel concerned took standard psychiatric and psychocomputer tests with the following results . " " Astronaut Lew Waterman , clear on all counts . " " Astronaut Mark Bradley , emotion count .48 paranormal , clear on other counts . " " Lieutenant Ellis , stress factor 1.28 paranormal . " " Emotion count .35 paranormal , clear on other counts . " " 3 ) These results are attributed to an emotional attachment between Lieutenant Ellis and astronaut Bradley . " It ends with a recommendation as to what action should be taken . We 'll just hope this thing sorts itself out . Straker 's given you separate postings . Bradley , - you 'll report to Moonbase . - And me , sir ? SHADO Headquarters , earth . Everything 's fine with the Air Force , you 'll get their fullest cooperation . - I 'll be on my way . - Oh , Alec ... - Who are you taking ? - Does it matter ? No , except that I hadn 't seen the list of personnel . - Mark Bradley and Lieutenant Ellis . - Your decision ? My decision . Without the aid of a computer . They 'll be back inside 3 days to take up their new postings . The Transporter 's just landed at Lexfield , Canada , sir . Fine , fine . 'SHADO Mobiles 1 , 2 and 3 , proceed to search the area . ' 'This is Control . In position on airfield perimeter . ' The other Mobiles are on their way , sir . Good . SHADO Mobile 1 to Control . In position . - ' Roger , 1 . ' - No visual contact . - ' SHADO Mobile 2 in position , sir . ' - ' SHADO Mobile 3 in position . ' - All three Mobiles in position , sir . - Good . - Send one in . - Which one , sir ? The one in the best position . Standard procedure . Control to SHADO Mobile 3 . - ' Close in for final assault . ' - Roger , Control . They should be able to see it any second . There it is ! - Have visual , 300 yards ahead . - Any sign of movement ? No , nothing . We 're going in closer . 'Right . Take it easy . ' - SHADO Mobile 3 under attack . - Head back to the ridge . We 're still under fire ... SM 3 , can you hear me ? Come in , SM 3 . Radio and tracking link negative . They must 've been hit . Send the next one in . I know the risk . Send it in . This is Control to SHADO Mobile 1 . Close in on UFO . 'Roger . ' This is Colonel Freeman . Assume SM 3 is non-operational . 'Stop just below the ridge and proceed on foot . ' - I repeat , proceed on foot . - ' Understood . ' OK , let 's go . Roger . Backup forces in position and standing by , sir . OK , fan out . 250 yards from UFO . Closing in . They 're closing in , sir . Take cover ! Keep down ! Look out ! The UFO , sir ! Get down ! - Hello , Mark . - Hi . Quite a day ! Yes , they 're flying the alien back to HQ now . - You all right ? - I 'm fine . Mark , there 's something I must tell you . After Mobile 3 was hit , Freeman told me to send another one in . Mobile 2 was in a better position . It 's OK . I was glad of the action . Don 't you understand what I 'm saying ? I risked your life to prove a point . You did it to prove that Straker and the computers were wrong . Well ? Much the same situation we 've experienced before . The alien was breathing a liquid containing a bioaquaphilic compound , imparting the usual green tint to the face and neck . The hair was unaffected and the eyes have protective shells . We 've reverted the respiration to normal atmosphere . - Successfully ? - 5 hours is not enough to tell . It 's long enough to tell us if we 're dealing with a young alien . Past experience has shown that once they breathe our atmosphere , they deteriorate to their true age . I want to see if I can get anything out of him . How soon can he be ready ? We 're crossing new physiological frontiers . How can I say ? Well , I ... I suppose he 's as ready now as he 'll ever be . Right , Doctor . He appears to be humanoid and highly intelligent . The biosensor tells us his eyes and ears are in excellent condition . Computer reports indicate he 's in perfect health . There must be some way we can communicate . You 've been interrogating him for 43 minutes . How much longer ? Why ? We must remove the compound from his hair to assist oxygen absorption . All right , all right . Now , let 's go over it once again . The answers are needed to certain questions . I 'm asking you to cooperate . It 's no good , Alec . He either can 't or doesn 't want to understand . There 's no alternative . I 'll try one of the new anodynes to break down his resistance . Which do you recommend , Doctor ? GL-7 is the most effective in my experience but ... - but in this case ... - Well ? I can 't guarantee the results . It could be dangerous . - How dangerous ? - Who knows ? But the decision and the responsibility must be yours . Your reactions are all right , you heard that clearly enough . All right , Doctor . Now , the drug will lower your resistance , it 's no use fighting it . You must help us . You must cooperate . Pulse rate increasing . Still increasing . Hold him . Hold him down ! - Drink , Alec ? - No thanks . I 'd like you to accept this . We 've worked together a long time , Alec . - Maybe too long . - Can 't we talk about it ? There 's not much to say . It 's a difference in temperament . You think I wanted him to die ? It was a calculated risk . It 's not only that . You make all your decisions based on cold logic . Computer predictions . 1984 . I wonder what it 's going to be like in 20 years ' time . Will the computers take over completely ? Why don 't you ask them ? They have all the answers even now . We build them , program them and they tell us what we 're going to think before we know ourselves . You 'd better make that phone call . I 'll sleep on it . Straker . It 's for you , Alec . Freeman . When did you find this out ? You know what it means , don 't you ? Right . No , no . No , leave that with me . Yeah . Bye . - Mark Bradley . - Important ? He thinks it is . Well , it looks like you were right . You and your computers . Oh , by the way , Alec . Would you tell Lieutenant Ellis and astronaut Bradley to return to Moonbase immediately and assume their normal duties ? - The report didn 't recommended that . - Not the first report , no . But this report analysed the flight paths , and it shows that , had normal procedure been followed , we would have lost all three Interceptors . You mean her decision wasn 't influenced by emotion . You tell me . See you .

 153 degrees . Turn complete , sir . Commence second run . We have a radar trace , sir . - ' Bridge . ' - We have a radar trace , sir . 'Bearing 147 , speed Mach 5 , reducing fast . ' - Mr. Cooper . - Sir ? Can you see anything ? No , sir . Yes ! Yes , there ! What is it , sir ? I don 't know . I have never seen anything like this before . It 's coming down . Action stations . - It 's attacking , sir ? - I think it is , Mr Cooper . Open fire . Straker . 'General Henderson 's here , sir ' . Right . - Commander . - Morning , General . - You 've read it ? - Hasn 't everybody ? If this is why I 'm here , there 'll be an official denial tomorrow . Yes , I expected that . I stress the word " official " . Apparently it was a test flight of one of the Navy 's prototype aircraft . - Unfortunate . - Yes . Straker , you 're getting too suspicious . - Is that bad ? - That photograph could be anything . - Yes . Including a UFO . - There was an immediate inquiry . I was in touch with the naval board personally . They were satisfied . It 's a false alarm . - General , are you warning me off ? - No , even if it sounds like it . How many sightings turn out to be aircraft ? This was a highly-trained naval crew , on a ship equipped with every modern detection device . Let 's have some breakfast . It happened too fast . The wreckage sank with no attempted salvage . The ocean is too deep at that point . I take it you 've no objections if I conduct my own investigations . No , none at all . But don 't expect any cooperation from the naval authorities . They 've accepted the findings . You have checked the records for that day ? - Yes . - And ? There were no UFO sightings , if that 's what you mean . - None got through ? - No . None that we know of . - But they have before . - Not for a long time . Since your defence tightening . Gen. , don 't underestimate them . It has always only been a matter of time before they discovered a way to pierce our screen . - Toast ? - No , thank you . Try hitting the sand behind the ball . Oh , Paul , you 're supposed to smooth over your tracks . - Tell me , what do you see in this ? - Relaxation , exercise . Chance to forget your problems . You 've only talked about them since we started . I have a lot on my mind , Paul . Well , here you are . I suggest you try a number 9 iron on this shot , Paul . Good shot . You said Henderson thought that ship 's sighting was a false alarm . Did I ? Yes , I suppose he did . Your theory about the aliens piercing our defences screen doesn 't hold up . Why ? The Interceptors destroyed a UFO this morning . Yes . True . How come we managed to stop that one ? Paul , it 's a battle of wits between us and them . If they have made a breakthrough they wouldn 't want us to know . - This morning was a sacrifice ? - Could be , couldn 't it ? We destroy a UFO , feel secure in our defences , then they just write off that sighting . If it was a UFO , why didn 't it fire on the ship ? That would have been proof . - You don 't buy it , do you , Paul ? - No . Well , you could be right . Depth 600 . 620 . Maximum safe depth . - 640 . Colonel ... - I heard the first time , Captain . Continue the dive . 680 . 750 . - Pressure malfunction . - Level . Level out . Paul , do you know Sheringham ? - The Admiral ? - Yes . Not personally . Do you know anyone in his department ? Now I know why I 'm here . All right , what do you want me to find out ? I want to find out why that admiralty board reached such a fast decision . You see , I think that ship was where it was for a special reason . A reason the Navy want to keep secret . The aliens want to know why and so do we . - Yes ? - ' Turbines not responding , sir . ' 820 . 'Engines overheating . ' Hold full power . Forward plates are buckling . 870 . 'Turbines still not responding , sir . ' - Hold power . - ' We 'll burn out , sir . ' - Hold full power . - 880 . It 's slowing . - Steady at 900 . - Maintaining level course , Captain . Take her back to 600 . Up to 600 . - Sonar ? - Colonel . - Find anything ? - No , Colonel . Nothing ? How much water below us ? - 200 fathoms , Colonel . - Thanks . - We could try again . - No . No , it 's too deep . Thank you , Captain . Over 1,000 fathoms deep . The trench runs for about 30 miles . It sounds ideal . Come in . If you could sign these sometime this afternoon , sir . This is the amendment of the second pavilion . All right . Thank you , Miss Bosanquet . Well , the assignment 's due on the ninth . My crew are on 24-hour stand-by . Over 1,000 fathoms deep . An even greater safety margin than we need . All right , Captain . I approve the location . Thank you , sir . - Steven . - Yes , sir . Good luck on the ninth . We may need it . And remember : one slip and life on this planet could ... - Straight through ? - Yes . Be with you in a minute . Make yourself at home . - Nice place . Very comfortable . - It 's convenient . Would you like coffee or something stronger ? I would prefer something stronger . - Scotch ? - Fine . - May I ? - Oh , please do . Your drink . Oh , thanks . - Unusual hobby . - Is it ? - Are you an expert ? - I wouldn 't say so . What 's the bright star at top left ? Spica . Magnitude 1,2 . Forms an isosceles triangle with Arcturus in Bootes and Denebola in Leo . Really ? By studying Spica and the star Rigel in Orion , Hipparchus discovered the procession of the equinoxes . Here 's to good old Hipparchus . - You don 't waste time , do you ? - Well , you 've got your hobby . How long have you been with the Ministry ? - Not long . Why ? - I hadn 't seen you before yesterday . - You probably have . - What department are you in ? Let 's say it 's my job to know everyone else 's . Take you , for example . Sarah Bosanquet . Young , beautiful . Ten years ' service . Currently with Sheringham . Where 's my birthmark ? I 'm much too much of a gentleman to mention that . - What 's Sheringham like ? - Why ? I mean , to work for . I was thinking , with the responsibility he 's carrying , - he might be taking it out on you . - I can look after myself . I 'm very independent . - How is Paul progressing ? - He 's still working on it . - Well , what have we got ? - There 's a deep trench here . Virtually bottomless . If that was a UFO and it did go down there , - then it 's lost forever . - Anything from Sonar ? No . We took Skydiver down as deep as we could . Deeper . Nothing . Well , the wreckage is of no longer any importance , but that trench is . - What 's the next step ? - A meeting with Admiral Sheringham . General Henderson can do the groundwork . He can say I 'm a safety officer from the Ministry of Aviation . Mr Straker is anxious to discover as much as he can about the incident . I appreciate that . Please , sit down , gentlemen . Right . Well , what particularly can I do for you ? I want to interview the captain of the ship . - I 'm afraid that won 't be possible . - Oh ? He 's on an assignment ? Naval security prevents me from answering that question . Oh , I see . Excuse me . I 'm sorry . I take it you 've read a transcript of the inquiry ? Yes . My office was able to supply those details . I 've studied the report , and there seems to be a great deal left unsaid . I don 't understand . It appears to me that the findings in the report were arrived at with , might I say , unnecessary haste . Mr Straker , the facts that we had were the only ones likely to be available for all time . In the circumstances , it would have done nothing to delay . Yes , I can see that . But Admiral , nowhere in this report can I see any mention of the steps taken by the captain and crew to verify identification of the aircraft . - The incident was over in seconds . - Yes , but your captain ordered the destruction of an aircraft . A layman , such as myself , might be excused for thinking he could equally have taken steps to identify it . I am sure the captain acted as he thought best . You ... - We weren 't there . - But the ship sustained no damage , proving there was no aggressive action . Admiral , it could have been a civilian airliner . I 've really nothing further to add to the report . Of course , if the ship in question were actively concerned in some mission or other , then the action of the captain might be more understandable . Will you come in , please ? I 'm afraid I can spare no more time , gentlemen . Miss Bosanquet will show you out . - You wanted to see me ? - Yes , Paul . Come in . How are you making out with Miss Bosanquet ? Well , Rome wasn 't built in a day . Yes , I have heard that before . - There 's something I want you to do . - Sure . Find out if your new friend knows him . Yes , she does . There 's a picture like this in her apartment . - Are you sure ? - Positive . - That 's very interesting . - Who is he ? Are you taking Miss Bosanquet out tonight ? Well , I ... Good . Make it something special , will you ? I 'll try . Oh , and Paul , you might let me have the key to her apartment . Take a look at this . - Should be perfect . - I 'll set it up . A sighting device . With all this , I 'd say you could line up on any point in space . It 's pretty sophisticated for an amateur . That 's for sure . Look . There 's a setting marked . You better take this down , Colonel . East 817 ... 9 ... 2802 . East 8179-2802 . 'Yes , that 's correct . Have this course computed . 'Then station an Interceptor directly on the line . - ' You understand ? ' - Yes , sir . 'Good . I want this carried out round the clock . 'At all times an Interceptor is to be in position . ' Yes , sir . 'Interceptor 1 , immediate launch . Immediate launch . ' - Mr Cooper . - Sir ? - Make a signal . - Yes , sir . Proceeding on schedule . Target date : twelfth , 0300 . - Mr Cooper . - Sir ? - Code it . - Yes , sir . Interceptor 1 to Moonbase . Routine check , 1500 hours . Nothing to report . Roger , 1 . Routine check 1500 hours received . - Confirm negative report . - ' Report confirmed . ' This patrol wouldn 't be so bad if I knew what I was waiting for . 'Inter ... ceptor 1 'to Moon ... 'base . ' Moonbase to Interceptor 1 . Come in , 1 . This is Moonbase Control to Interceptor 1 . Moonbase to Interceptor 1 . Come in , 1 . - I just can 't believe it . - How is the pilot ? He regained consciousness and was able to land the Interceptor . He was checked out and cleared for duty . - Do we know what it was ? - No , not for certain . The lab boys think that telescope sent out some sort of laser signal ... - Picked up in deep space . - Exactly . The signal , whatever it was , must have got through . With such a highly concentrated light beam , it would pass through Interceptor 1 as if it wasn 't there . But why ? I still don 't understand why . Paul , do you remember that photograph I showed you ? The one Sarah had in her apartment ? Yes . That was her father , John Bosanquet , one of the experts who helped build Moonbase , 5 , 6 years ago . - You said he was her father . - Yes . He was posted as dead but in fact , he disappeared . You see , in those days , accidents on the lunar surface happened much more frequently . There was a search but he was never found . - You mean the aliens got him ? - It seems to add up . Contact with Miss Bosanquet before SHADO became operational would have been quite simple . And she 's been forced to send them information ever since . Forced or controlled . Doesn 't make any difference . And that ship has put out to sea again . Now , why would the ocean depth be of interest to Admiral Sheringham ? Colonel Lake , I 'm assigning you back on Skydiver . - To follow that ship ? - Yes , and don 't let it out of your sight . And me ? Sorry , Paul . You startled me . I didn 't expect you . I know , Sarah . I know all about it . I 'm sorry , Paul . I don 't know what you mean . What did you tell them ? - Paul ... - What did you tell them ? We have all the proof we need that your Miss Bosanquet has been supplying the aliens with information from your office . What Straker says is true , Admiral . UFOs are a fact . It 's fantastic ! I can 't believe it . Well , I won 't argue with you there . Whatever you 're doing , the aliens know about it , make no mistake . And if they 're interested , so am I. Look , whatever you 're doing , you 've cloaked behind a veil of secrecy that we 've been unable to penetrate officially or otherwise . But now , Admiral , I have to know ! Well , I 'm chairman of a committee dealing with the destruction of obsolete weapons , and military equipment and so on . Some time ago , a thousand gallons of an experimental nerve gas were manufactured in Europe . Further tests revealed that the gas was too dangerous even to be handled . It was arranged that the gas be destroyed in laboratory conditions . Then it was discovered that the gas was virtually indestructible . It was therefore decided that the gas should be dumped at sea . What if there 's a leakage ? The gas is sealed in very special containers , geared to corrode over a period of several hundred years . When that gas escapes into the atmosphere , it will be harmless . And if the aliens attack the ship and the containers are destroyed ? Then that would be the end , Commander Straker . There 's enough gas on that ship to destroy every form of life on earth . You mean we can 't contact the ship at all ? Exactly . The ship 's captain is maintaining a radio blackout . - Security . - Ironical . Could an aircraft pick them up ? We 've got Search Task Force combing the entire area . But the ocean 's a big place to look for a small ship that doesn 't want to be found . - We do know their destination . - Yes . And by the time they get there it 'll probably be too late . What about Skydiver ? Is this our best speed , Captain ? Midnight , sir . Right on schedule . It 'll be light about 300 hours . Then we 'll start dumping immediately . The men will be ready , sir . Think I 'll go back to my cabin . There 's not much I can do here . - Call me , Mr Cooper . - Aye aye , sir . What about Sheringham ? He 's convinced all right . I 'm letting him watch the operation . If it 's a success , he 'll get the usual amnesia shots . If it isn 't , doesn 't really make any difference , does it ? - Can we stop them ? - I don 't know , Paul . I just don 't know . I still think they 've discovered a way to break through our screen . Well , the Interceptors are skyborne . - Visual contact ? - That could be our only hope . Thank you , Mr Cooper . 0230 hours , anything to report ? Yes , sir . Radar reports increased aerial activity . UFOs : 2 . Sighting . 0122-7074 . Sector 14 . Unable to confirm UFO sighting . Interceptor 1 to Moonbase Control : confirm sighting . Reading negative . Repeat , negative . Repeat , we are failing to get a reading . Moonbase Control to Interceptor 1 : confirm trajectory . 0122-7074 . Sector 14 . Moonbase , can Interceptors 1 and 2 give assistance ? Compute Interceptor range . 'Interceptor range computed . 'ETA Interceptor 2 : 47 minutes . 'ETA Interceptor 3 : 170 . ' Interceptor 1 to Moonbase Control : I 'm moving in . You were right . They 've got through our defensive screens . Some kind of radio jamming , using waves to break up the frequency . Can our technicians fix it ? Depends on whether we 're still here tomorrow , doesn 't it ? They 're separating . 'The best I can do is to get one . ' Sir , trajectory report on surviving UFO . Thank you . Heading for a point somewhere near Newfoundland . That 's nowhere near the ship . The ship 's in the South Atlantic . - Everything ready , sir . - Good . - Commence dumping . - Sir . Bridge to deck party , commence dumping . There 's a change in course , sir . The UFO 's veered off . Its trajectory is now the South Atlantic . This is it . Trace , sir . Bridge . We 've picked up a radar trace . Bearing 281 , Mach 5 , reducing . Action stations . 'Action stations ! Action stations ! 'Seal all watertight bulkheads . 'Gun crews on immediate stand-by . 'Repeat , gun crews on stand-by . ' Missile in position , sir . Launch missile , Mr Cooper ! 'Clear for firing . Clear for firing . ' Get that missile launched , Mr Cooper . Bridge to missile control : fire ! Repeat , fire ! It 's the damage officer , sir . Missile guns ' electronics have been affected by the explosion . What the blazes happened ? It 's no use , sir . Missile systems are negative . Alert gun crews . Bridge to guns , stand by . Bridge to guns , stand by . There it is . Open fire ! Radar puts it out of range , sir . One more shot . Maybe two . That 's all . What the devil 's that ? Well , we were lucky . Very lucky . - Sometimes we need it . - Moonbase reported ? Yes . We ran tests on the radar . It was a radio wave jammer , but by using a double frequency we can plot them again ... until they find an answer to that . Well , I suppose it 's another incident closed . - I 'll be in touch . - There 's the girl . Sarah Bosanquet . There 'll be no proceedings against her . In the circumstances we could hardly hold her responsible for her actions . Of course , someone will have to explain what became of her father . That 's not what I meant , General . How many others are there like her ?

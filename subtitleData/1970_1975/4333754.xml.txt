 THE PLANET OF THE APES 1x14 " UP ABOVE THE WORLD SO HIGH " Subtitles by subXpacio . Oh , oh , Alan ! Pete ! Alan ! - Alan , look ! - What 's the matter ? A flying reptile . - A what ? - A flying reptile . Oh , I think it sees us . - I don 't believe it . - Well , what do you know . - Are you frightened ? - What , seeing a man fly ? A man ? Oh . Humans can 't fly . Yeah , it 's some sort of a homemade glider contraption . - Yeah . - Uh-oh . Get down ! Get outta here . We gotta get there first . A flying human , they 'll kill him . Come on . Pete , Galen , I found him . Over here . Let me help you there . Are you hurt ? Oh , no . - Are you all right ? - Yeah , better . Oh , you see , that gust of wind - that gust of wind on that side . I should put my weight on that side . Well , it 's not that simple . Your design 's wrong . Oh , sure , sure , I can correct . You see if I - No , never mind . You wouldn 't understand . Alan , those troopers spotted you . Come on . This way . He got away , but we have the thing that flies . Yeah , well , it 's very impressive . You see , it will work . Leuric , you got your glider up in the air , but it 's a wonder you weren 't killed . You have a superstitious fear of flying . I 've got a lot of fears , but that 's not one of them . - I guarantee you 'll kill yourself . - Now how do you know ? Oh , believe me , they know . It 's impossible . No one has ever flown . I 'm the first . How could they know anything about it ? Leuric , listen . What you 've invented ... is a kind of a glider . which is a remarkable achievement . But it 's a dead end . Where do you go with it ? - Up into the sky . - For what ? Put that same thought and energy into something that can be useful for you . Yeah , invent a new kind of plow or something . I will fly ! I will do what no human be - Trying to steal my idea so you can take the credit . We 're not trying to steal anything . We 're trying to help you . Listen , Leuric . If we worked on your glider , taught you safety techniques , got you up there soaring like an eagle , we 'd only be setting you up as a target . Some gorilla would see you and pow ! I don 't care ! I have to get on with my work . How long do you think it will be before they find you ? They already know that a human has tried to fly . They are not going to stop until they find that human . I won 't stop my work . Look , if you have to continue this project , could you do it someplace farther from town where you won 't be spotted ? There is a place the apes avoid because of superstition , but - It would take too much time to move my tools and materials . It doesn 't matter . We 'll move you . Yeah , right . Now let 's move this junk to wherever . Well , you 're very good to me , I 'll show you . Several trips will be necessary . Has this something to do with flying ? Oh , no , no , I found it on the beach . A strange rock appeared after lightning struck . The sand must have melted it . A hunk of glass formed . I 'll polish it , Galen , and show you what you can do with it . Uh , if you don 't mind , Leuric . Uh-uh . You expect us to believe ... a human - a human flew - - My troopers saw it ! - Something even apes cannot do . Now then , I expect you to believe Konag . My garrison commanders are not in the habit of coming here ... to address the council for the purpose of lying . This is very interesting . but it 's no more than a toy . Is there any objection to having this human found , killed ... and any other such toys destroyed ? - No objection . - Zaius , if I might have permission to speak . I 'm just a female scientist with none of your wisdom ... in dealing with humans , but I merely wonder if this idea ... even though stumbled upon by a human , - ... might not serve us . - Ridiculous ! How could a human idea serve us ? I don 't know , but it 's new and unexplored , and what could be lost in further examination ? Yes , yes , go on ! It 's not widely known , but there is reason to believe ... that our ancestors knew how to fly . What ? There are references - vague , but strongly suggestive - in remnants of books , from the old days , before the world was almost destroyed . Perhaps this human learned from some book he found . If he has such a book , it is punishable by death . He could infect the other humans . But , in any case , why bother with something ... which is just a worthless toy ? I 'm sure you 're absolutely right , Urko . And yet , I wonder ... if flying were worthless . would our ancestors have engaged in it ? - Hey , hey . How much more ? - Hey . Galen and Leuric should be bringing the last of it . How you doing ? This is a round stone . It 's useless . - There you go . - A little innovation . I think I 'm gonna stay here , work on this . I , uh , can 't wait to see Galen 's face ... when he first looks through a magnifying glass . Alan ! Pete ! They captured Leuric ! I watched from my hiding place . There was nothing I could do . They just took him away . Why didn 't they just kill him ? Well , the only thing I can think of is , uh , they wanna make a spectacle of him . How ? Public execution . Bring my baggage . Commander Konag , congratulations on capturing the human . Where is he ? In a cell . He 's been handled roughly , but he can answer your questions . Oh , I 'm sure he 'll be much more cooperative thanks to your handling . What 's all this ? Oh , some things that I use with the human . and the others are my personal comforts . since I 'll be staying awhile . Council gave you permission to deal with a human for a short while . And how long is a short while , Konag ? Three days ? Five ? Seven ? Nine ? We have no guest facilities ! This is a troop garrison ! I don 't mind the inconvenience . This will be perfectly adequate . And , fellow , put those there . Yes , ma 'am . These are my quarters ! And it 's so generous of you , Konag . I shall be sure and tell Urko and the council how very helpful you 've been . Now . I shall require a room , and I 'm sure you could manage two or three sturdy tables . And , uh , well , beyond that , you just won 't even know that I 'm here . Thank you so much , Konag . My servants will carry your personal effects out . and I 'll question the human shortly . Trooper , I 'm Carsia . - You were told to expect me ? - Yes . Take me to the human , Leuric . What 's that ? He 's being punished . He doesn 't show respect . - Next time eat what 's given you without complaining . Stand up ! Stand up ! You 're worse than these lower animals . There 's nothing worse than strength and authority without intelligence . Get out of here . I 'm so sorry . Apes are not sorry for humans . I 'm different from some apes . And I think you 're different from most humans . That 's why I 'm here . Guard , when this man is rested and had his hurts attended to , please bring him to me . And I needn 't warn you against the repetition of brutality I just witnessed . Gee , it 's a nice carriage . Yeah . - You driving ? - Yeah . All the way from Central City ? I drive Carsia to towns a lot further than this one . - She 's a very important ape . - Oh . And you get to ride it , huh ? - Yeah . - Gosh , you 're lucky . You know , if I was an ape that was as important as - Carsia - is that her name ? I 'd never come to this village . Nothing ever happens here . - Something happened . - What ? I don 't know . Carsia wouldn 't come all this way to talk to a human , unless something important was going on . Oh , yeah . Why did you tell that guard not to beat me ? Because there is nothing which can be accomplished by beatings ... which cannot be achieved in a more civilized manner . What do you want ? I refuse to be questioned by a human for whom I 've requested decent treatment . I 'm sorry . Well , that 's the first reasonable thing you 've said . And I appreciate what you did . I want to help you , Leuric . I 'm a scientist , I 'm interested in truth and knowledge . I 'm told that you know the secret of flying . Is this true ? Yes . Can you prove to me that a human ... or an ape could fly ? I can prove to you that I can fly . - How ? - By flying . - So you say . - No , I have flown . Well , almost . if they hadn 't taken my tools and materials from me . If I get out of here , if they don 't kill me , I will fly . All right . I will try again . A flying reptile was actually reported as being seen near here , or so I was told . I don 't know anything about flying reptiles . Or you 're not interested . And you 're wasting my time . You must have a superior . Where is he ? Konag is inspecting the outposts , He 'll be back tonight . There must be somebody else . There has got to be somebody besides you . - She 's busy . - She ? - In a garrison ? - Visiting from Central City . From civilization ? Ha ! I shall wait . Here . Wait outside . Is there anything else you 'll need ? What else is there to need ? I 'm not familiar with tools . Some of these were developed by our ancestors . We 've since lost the knack of using them . Perhaps because we have humans to do our labors . I 'm sure you know how to use them . This does seem an awkward device for driving a nail . It has another use . See ? Very good . You 're clever with your hands , just be equally clever with your head ... and design a device which will take you high into the sky . How much longer ... do I have to wait for this female ? Hello , I 'm Carsia . Oh , hello , indeed . I 'm Protus . I am on an archaeological expedition and - What are you doing in this forsaken place ? I 'm on an expedition of another sort . How may I help you ? You already have ... by reviving my confidence in the fact ... that I am not the only ape on this planet ... with interests other than sleeping and eating . I , myself , have not found the company very stimulating . Do come in . So , I have been trying to track down this rumor about this flying reptile . Well , I 'm glad you did . but it wasn 't a reptile . Oh , I know . The guard told me . And a flying human , I mean , that is - that 's much more of a curiosity . I 'll know in a few days whether or not the human can fly . Oh , I would love to see such a thing . Well , stay , I 'd be delighted to have you present at the demonstration . You are kind . Well , I 'm not quite sure that 's the right word for me . - Charming . - Thank you . Well , I 'm not asking for compliments , although I do like to hear them . Won 't you please sit down ? Oh , thank you very much . Oh , you , uh , you don 't think that you 're kind ? Oh , I was really not sure . I think I have other qualities that are more important . Such as ? Well , I think it 'd be more interesting if you found out for yourself . Well , I intend to try . But I very much doubt that I 'll find you unkind . I mean , that is very hard to believe . Well , I suppose I could take credit ... for saving the life of a human who says he can fly . He 's promised to give us a demonstration in five days . If he fails. well - Well , I hope he succeeds , just so that I can see a human fly . I 'm eager too . That 's why I decided he should live . Galen , can 't Carsia help Leuric , even if his plan is a failure ? Well , I can only go on what she 's told me . She 's very sympathetic . I know she 'd want to protect him . Yes , she 's that kind of ape . Hey. getting a little hung up there on her , Galen , huh ? If you mean what I think you mean , I think you are jumping to premature conclusions . Which may be correct , Hmm . In the meantime , what are we going to do about Leuric ? - See that he flies . - A functional glider . We 're gonna have to make it for him . Hey , I 'm not sure we know enough to make a functional glider out of that junk we got . How you coming ? Okay , Galen , we 're ready for it . Be right there . Ow ! Jeez ! Careful of this . It is very hot . Right there . Okay , keep it taut . Hold it as tight as we can . Hmm , that 's amazing . Boiled tree sap . And corn flour , Hmm . That 's the best we could do . It 's called glue . - Galen , hold that a second. will you ? - I can 't . Why not ? My fingers are stuck together . Well , uh , what do you think ? Yeah , I think it could fly . - With luck . - Oh , I do hope so . It 's very exciting . If you think the prospect of flying is exciting , wait till you take off . Oh , I cannot - Wait a minute . You mean I take off ? Oh , thank you very much . This all has been fascinating . - Galen , Galen . - Wait a minute . If you tied me to that thing , screaming and kicking , I would find some way to keep my feet on the ground . It 's gotta be tested before we take it apart and get it to Leuric . Yes , and I intend to watch one of you test it , and I shall applaud enthusiastically if you are successful . What would happen if an ape looked up and saw a human flying ? Well , he would , uh , shoot the human down . Right . When you 're hanging up there on a glider , there are not a lot of places to hide , right ? Right . If an ape looked up and saw another ape flying , he 'd get pretty shook up , but he wouldn 't shoot . No . He is not going to get shook up because he is not going to see an ape flying . Galen , you 've gotta do it . It 's you or it 's , alas , poor Leuric . Save your breath . It is out of the question , I refuse ! I absolutely put my foot down . Okay , now use your foot to kick up , right ? Now brace yourself like I showed you . You ready ? - No way . - Good . Let 's go . Aah ! Whoo-hoo ! Easy , Galen . Let the wind do it . You let the wind blow it ! Whoo-hoo ! Whoo-hoo ! He likes it . Well , Protus , what do you think ? Oh , it is marvelous . It 's absolutely marvelous . It is hard to believe that one can actually fly . Oh , how thrilling that would be . I 'll be the first to know when I fly tomorrow . Tomorrow ? But that 's two days earlier than Carsia said . Ah , yes , Leuric 's been working enormously hard . - He 's ready before we expected . - How nice . Come , Protus . I 've had a new book sent from Central City . I 'm sure you 'll be interested . Oh , Carsia , I 'll be with you in one minute . I do want to take one last look at this marvelous bird . Very well . - " Protus " ? - Shh ! Never you mind about that . Your glider will not fly . - It will . - It won 't . But we have built a glider that will fly . It is being disassembled and being smuggled to you . This will fly , and I will fly it . You will break every bone in your stupid head . Now , you must stall for two days . See , we can 't get it delivered and reassembled in less time . You just want time to steal my idea ... - ... so you can be the first to fly . - Protus . - Coming . - Everything all right , Leuric ? Yeah , everything is fine . I 'll fly tomorrow . This is hopeless . It 's absolutely hopeless . I mean , even if we could get it into shape by the morning , we couldn 't deliver and assemble it in time . We 're going about this whole thing the wrong way . The first order of business shouldn 't be to deliver a glider that will fly . The first thing we gotta do is to stop a glider that won 't fly . Are you ready , Leuric ? All ready to move it to the cliff . Oh , I am afraid that Leuric is somewhat single-minded of purpose . It 's a characteristic of humans . I was trying to tell him yesterday ... that there are other areas of interest in science . - See ? - What is that ? Ah , this , which is a natural substance , is an unnatural device . Uh , look , I call it an expander . See here , it 's a fly . Well , that 's fascinating , Protus . Leuric , come on . It 's your turn . See that ? - Ahh , Uh-huh . - Uh-huh . This , it 'll expand almost anything . Look . Look , see here . Oh ! Ooh ! Here , look see that ? There 's something over there I want to show you and ask you about . I want - I want your advice about it . It 's , uh , it 's right at the end of that table . Over there . Right there . Here . Look at this closely . See here ? A well-made joint you say , huh ? Ah , but can you be sure ? How many mechanical failures have been caused ... by poorly fitting joints , hmm ? Weakened by small flaws that could have been exposed by my expander , Hmm ? It could help . I take a certain ... conceited pleasure ... in the way your mind works . Protus . - Conceited ? - It is uniquely ... penetratingly the mind of a chimpanzee . Oh , don 't be modest . After all , are gorillas ... or orangutans capable of subtle ideas ? Well. you know . I 'd never thought of the gorilla ... as being subtle . No , they hold higher authority because of brute force ... since they lack intelligence . Oh , help ! Help ! Fire ! Oh , what do you think caused it ? It 's gone , destroyed . Oh . Oh , pity . Oh ! Your expander may have uses you never thought of , Protus . Oh , that is amazing . Oh , Carsia , I cannot take credit for this , no . You will be known as the ape ... who made fire with an expander . Thank you , Hmm . My flight . Oh , no , no , merely delayed . You 'll have all the materials you need , and you may start again . Oh , I feel responsible for this . Let me make amends . I have these two servants . They 're rascals , both of them , but they are very , very clever with their hands . I will send for them , and they will bring ... all the materials they can provide to , uh , put this thing back together again . You two , what do you want ? We 're the servants of Protus , sir . Yes . More foolishness for that human to make into wings ? Yes , sir . All right . Take it in . Thank you , sir . You know , Protus , I like doing things for you . Thank you . - Interesting ? - Oh , very , Very ! - Galen burnt - - Shh ! Galen burnt the wings , didn 't he , deliberately ? Leuric , what do you want , an engraved apology ? We only ruined your stupid glider because you would have broken your stupid neck . - It would have flown . - This one will fly , and you 'll be flying it . All you have to do is assemble the pieces . - I don 't believe it . - Do you hear this guy ? - Alan , what are we doing here ? - Spinning our wheels . We should have left you up that tree . We could have let the troopers pick you up when you crashed . Oh , you were very clever . You wanted to find out what I knew about flight first . Right , we risked our necks just so we could take lessons ... from wobbling Willy and his wonderful wiggling wings . Let 's go . Oh , now wait . Wait ! You-You were really trying to help me ? - You really want me to fly ? - That 's right . All right , I believe you . I don 't know why you 're helping me , I don 't know why Carsia is , but I don 't care . As long as I get up there just once , just once , I don 't care what happens after that . Hmm . Well ... that is very , very flattering . Oh , no , not flattery , it 's the truth . Every word . Oh , I guess , uh , I am delighted to believe that , uh , chimpanzees are superior to , uh , other apes . seeing I 'm a chimp . I don 't know , however , that , uh , agreement would be coming so easily from , let 's say ... a gorilla . Of course not . They haven 't the intelligence to recognize the obvious . Well , I suppose , uh , patting oneself on the back could be ... considered , uh , harmless and a good form of exercise . I wanted you to read that book . I wanted you to know how we feel . " We " ? Who is the head of the council ? Zaius , of course . An orangutan . And who is commander of all the security forces ? - Urko . - A gorilla . Can you name me one chimp ... who occupies a position of top authority ? J - Just what are you hinting at ? What do you want ? I advised Urko of the delay in the flight test . I expected you would . This is Konag , the garrison commander , Protus . Urko believes the human won 't fly . I know Urko 's views . He 's authorized me to execute the human ... if the test is delayed beyond tomorrow . And you ! You might want to arrange to have your things ... taken out by then . A gorilla in a position to give orders to you , to me , to chimps who are far above him in intelligence . He gives orders to chimps , but he shoots humans . What about Leuric ? The test has been postponed until tomorrow . There 'll be no problems . Come in . Sir , the guard told us to report to you when we were through . A precaution . Oh , of course . Well , are you through ? Yes , sir . Uh , is everything prepared for the flight ? - Yes , sir . - Very good . Um - Very well , you may go . Sir , I wonder if we could speak to you for a minute , please . I am busy . What is it ? Uh , well , there 's something I 'm trying to remember . We , uh , wanted to talk to you about , sir . Your servants don 't seem very bright , Protus . They 're not . Go . You can come back later if you can remember what it is you wanted . Well , um , I just remembered what it was . sir , we wanted to talk to you about . The last load we brought in , it , um , it wrecked the cart , sir , we want to show it to you . You permit them to bother you with nonsense like this ? No . Go ! G - Go at once ! Yes , sir . I 'll teach them some manners . I 'll be back in a minute . What 's the matter ? What do you think 's in that box in your girlfriend 's room ? - What box ? - The green one . The one that says " fragmentation cosmoline pack . " Oh , yes , I wondered about that , but I didn 't want to pry . Fragmentation bombs . Lovely little mama bombs with lots of little baby bombs inside , so when they blow . they really blow , all over the place . They were customarily dropped from airplanes . Right . Now the question arises : What is that cute little chimp that you 've been romancing in there , doing with a case of instant death ? Well ... now they 'll mind their manners . Now tell me - thank you - what were we talking about ? We were saying the chimps , who are the most intelligent and the best equipped , are not in control of the government and the council . Ah , yes . Yes , that 's what we - Oh , by the way , I 've been meaning to ask you , what is this ? The answer to some of the questions I 've been asking . - Oh . - For instance , why would I waste the time saving the life of a human ? Leuric means nothing to me . but if he can teach us to fly - I - I don 't understand . The council chambers are guarded when the council is in session . No one can approach . The same is true of Urko 's headquarters . Now , Protus , think . If Urko , his troops and the council were eliminated . who would control the world ? There are bombs in this box . To eliminate them . With Leuric 's wings , we can swoop down out of the night sky - in the dark , unseen , unheard . That is why I 'm determined to keep him alive , until he can teach us to fly . Do you see , Protus ? Oh , yes . Absolutely . It 's perfectly clear . - What are you doing here ? - We 're getting you out . What ? Oh , no ! - Carsia is using you . - I don 't care ! Stay away from there ! She 'll blow up everything if she gets her hands on the glider . There 's no time , the guards are coming . Pete , take care of the guards . I 'll bring him . Get away ! Get away ! Come on , come on ! Now ! Come on ! Come on. come on ! There 's no chance . Let 's go ! You chose a human ... in preference to me ? In preference to what you 're planning . Take him away ! The test is cancelled . The flight will proceed as scheduled . I arranged for the execution of Leuric ... and that renegade ape first thing in the morning . I shall look forward to witnessing Protus ' execution ... after the test flight . No , Leuric will be shot too . There 'll be no test . A dead man can 't operate those wings . One of your troopers will take the human 's place . Risk the life of a gorilla in a pointless experiment ? Absolutely not ! - It 's all my fault . - Of course it is . Some humans are much more human than other humans , but you - you are the most human . - I 'm sorry . - A lot of good that does . - How 's that feel ? - It 's numb . You know , even if I get out of here , I won 't be able to fly . It 's almost impossible - We are facing a firing squad , and all you can do is - I don 't care what happens to the human , but I want that flying device returned safely . if , in fact , it can fly . If you 're worried about them flying off with it - Move out ! Bring the human here . Look . You have an open area marked off by my troopers . If you fly out of it . you 'll be shot down . Are you trying to signal ? No , of course he isn 't . The poor man is half frightened to death . - He doesn 't know how to tell you . - Tell me what ? He can 't fly with one hand . Look . Is this true ? The test is cancelled . No , I insist the flight go on . And I still refuse to risk the life of an ape . Well , it 's no good looking at me . You couldn 't force me onto that thing . If I am going to be killed , I demand a decent , proper execution . Huh ? Wait a minute . Oh , no , no , no . Now you wait a minute . It is out of the question . It is absolutely ridiculous . Even if I were willing , I tell you , I don 't know how to fly . Will the wings support both you and him ? Yes , they might . - But no ! - Well , Konag . it seems we have solved two problems . I want to see if those wings can carry extra weight , and you want to spare any of your troopers the risk of flying . - But I protest ! - If they fall into the sea , they 'll drown . It 'll be no loss . You will fly . The human will ride along with you to show you how to guide the wings . Oh , Carsia ... I knew you were cruel ... but I didn 't know how cruel . Bring the wings ! More fun than the no-hitter I pitched in high school . Ready ! I am going to fly ! They 're flying . I knew it would work . I don 't know if I can control it ! The wind is so strong ! Whoo ! Whoo-hoo ! Whoo-hoo ! I made it happen , what nobody ever did before . You also may be killed the way no one 's ever been killed before . Here we go ! Where are they going ? Flying out to sea . Fire ! Shoot them down ! Both of them ! Wait ! You may not have to waste your bullets . Hold your fire ! They 're dead ... and so is the secret of flight . For a while , I wasn 't sure you would make it . Oh , oh , I wish we hadn 't . It flew like a bird , I knew it would . I could have stayed up forever . Oh , please , get me to the shore , quick . No , we can 't . We 'd be spotted in a minute . Shot on sight . Oh , I can 't , I 'd rather be ... shot . All right , everybody , let 's go . Keep your heads down . Try not to splash too much . Oh , please , somebody shoot me ! - What 's wrong with him ? - Ancient human disease - seasickness . Subtitles subXpacio

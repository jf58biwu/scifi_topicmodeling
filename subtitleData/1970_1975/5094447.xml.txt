Hey ! Matthias ! AII right , where 's Matthias ? Come on . Where 's Matthias ? Where 's the hive ? journal recording 958 . August 5 ' 1 977 . I found another one , one of Matthias ' group , dead of plague . The sweep continues . Not my color . Wait ! Come back ! I want to talk to you ! Hey ! is this how it starts ? A trip to the laughing academy ? No , you silly bastard . It starts with you asking yourself idiot questions . Right . Okay . Let 's get cleaned up ... . .. and find a drink before the bars close . And ' all brothers and sisters , I ask you to look at him . Does he have the marks ? Do you see them ? No . You see him as we were before the punishment .. . . .. before we gained grace . You see lying there the Iast of scientists , of bankers ' of businessmen ... . .. the users of the wheel . Yes . Do we use the tools of the wheel as he does ? No . - Is he of the family ? - No . - Is he of the sacred society ? - No . - Then what is he ? - Evil . He is part of the dead . He has no place here . He has the stink of oil and electrical circuitry about him . He is obsolete . You are discarded . You are the refuse of the past . You 're full of crap . How hard it is to admit the truth . Take him to the little room for the questioning . well ' Mr. NeviIIe , now we can talk a little while . It 's been a long time since you 've talked , except to yourself . Tell me something , would you ? Are you fellas really with the internal Revenue Service ? Your little jokes are meaningless ' Mr. NevilIe . Or doctor , or colonel , whatever it was they called you . - I 'm a scientist . What the hell are you ? - Definition of a scientist : A man who understood nothing , until there was nothing left to understand . well ... . So there is a Iittle light in the forest after all . A guiding light , Mr. NeviIle . But now to me has passed the responsibility ... . .. for this last tiny remnant of mankind . Then why don 't you quit these bloody games ? Throw away those halloween costumes and get these people organized ' damn it . Or are you already too far gone ? - Along the road of truth . - Oh ' for God 's sake . And we are very organized , Mr. Neville . After last night , you should know that . If you 're organized , why don 't you try finding a cure ? There is none ! None . There was no cure and there is no cure .. . . .. but the family has found its way . We can bear it . The only burden left is you . But you 've been trying to kill me for two years . Last night you killed how many ? Three of us ? And today , we don 't know yet . You 're the angel of death , doctor , not us . He has confessed all , brothers . Murder ' use of forbidden tools , practice of prescribed rites . He admits science , medicine ' weapons , machinery ' electricity . He has not shared the punishments . - He does not bear the marks . - Marks ? Show him , my children . Show him the pretty marks . These are the marks ' Mr. NevilIe . The punishment ' which you and those like you brought upon us . In the beginning we tried to help one another , those that were left . We tried to clean things up , set things straight . We buried things and burned . Then it came to me that we were chosen . Chosen for just this work . To bury what was dead , to burn what was evil .. . . .. to destroy what was dangerous . You 're barbarians . Barbarians ? You call us barbarian ? well ... . This is an honorable name . We mean to cancel the world you civilized people made . We will erase history from the time ... . .. that machinery and weapons threatened more than they offered . And when you die ... . .. the Iast living reminder of hell will be gone . Gone . Brother Zachary . We are ready , brother . - Here is evil . - Evil . evil . is this not the place where all the dead were burned ? Yes . And this is the last of the dead . And what shall we do with him , my brethren ? Burn . - Burn . - Yes , burn . Burn ! - Burn . - Burn ! - The dark ! - Turn off the light ! Get those lights off ! Give us the dark ! Bring back the dark ! Who the hell are you ? Shut up . Move . He 's gone ! Find him . Find him . That 's an order ! - Find him . - Go ' man , go ! Move . Move . - Wait . - Get in . AII right , you son of a bitch , just hold tight . Up against the wall , you mother . Don 't turn . Just stand . When I want you to ' l 'll turn you . On or off ' up or around , I 'II turn you . Now cool it . Now ' put your hands out . Out . Way out about shoulder high , like they 're gonna crucify you ' baby . Matter of fact , they were gonna roast me . Why 'd you stop them ? Don 't look a gift horse in the mouth . You got any more questions , fathead ? My name is Robert . Your name 's mud . Down the tunnel ! - Down the tunnel ! - Where is he ? After him ! Back ! Okay , hey , hold it . Open it up . - You . You 're the- - - Your living PIaytex doll . Now ' come on , man . Get the bike . Move ! pull it out . - You really plan ahead . - It helps . Now ' look , you gotta run this thing you understand , but I 'm the ramrod . Those stadium lights how 'd you manage that ? - Dutch knows all about that stuff . - Dutch ? Come on , man . Get on the bike . Don 't screw up. I know how to roll , but it 's hard on the elbows . And if you just have to play James Bond ... . .. I 'lI bust your ass . Yes , ma 'am . Don 't let him get away ! Left , damn it , left , and step on it ! Move . Step on it . Move ! Down the tunnel , man . Hit it . They 're blinded . Okay , baby . Hitch up your drawers . - I thought we 'd gotten past that . - You 're sweet . It 's okay , Tommy . This is the man , and I mean the man . But he 's cool. lt 's okay . Come on , man . This is it . That 's all there is . At least all we know of . There are others , I guess , if Matthias and his brethren haven 't killed them all . I didn 't know there were any left . Between the Family at night and you in the daytime ... . .. shooting at anything that moved , man ' we had to stay low . I had to stay alive . The mad bomber himself . And I see you got the mad scientist . - You know me ? - And about your work . My work ? Biowar pathology perimeters in urban and semi-urban environments . journal of Military Medicine , June , 197 4 . Incremental effects , countermeasures to toxic agents , and liquid systems delivery . Microbiological Letters , January , 1 975 . Remember ? That 's a nice recitation . You know what it means ? I was a med-school senior when they scratched the world . As a matter of fact , I was gonna apply to Biowar Labs for my post-doc ... - ... but the next term never came . - I 'm sorry you didn 't make it . Sorry the world didn 't make it . - Come on . Let 's go see about Richie . - Richie ? Lisa 's brother . He looks like he 's about to go over . You 've only seen the tertiary cases , Matthias and his people . We 're not that far gone but we 're on the road . The yeIlow-brick road . We 're off to see the wizard . When it hit , the older people either died or went to the third stage fast ... . .. you know , blindness in light , aIbinism ' psychotic illusions ... . .. occasional stages of torpor like Matthias and the things out there . - What about you ? Why didn 't you get it ? - I don 't know . Some of the younger people have a kind of ... . .. resistance . I don 't know , we just hold out . One or two of us are a bit light-sensitive , but otherwise we 're all right . But Richie 's definitely going . He 's advanced secondary. lncidentaIly ... . .. mind telling me what keeps you in the city ? You some kind of ... exterminator , huh ? I guess maybe you could call it that . Very complicated ' doctor . I 'd be living on top of city halI' or better than that , the Oxy Tower .. . . .. instead of that pillbox you 're in . well ' that 's where l live . It 's where l used to live . It 's where l 'm gonna Iive' and not Matthias nor his family ... . .. nor any other son of a bitch is gonna make me leave . He 's no better . His fever is high . - What are you doing- - ? - Shut up . Keep out of the way . Sit down . could stay this way for weeks or he could go over 1 0 minutes from now . I 've seen them go before . I almost got killed by a friend of mine last summer . He went over without any warning . When I looked away ... . .. his face was getting pale and his hair was going . When I Iooked back .. . . .. he didn 't have any eyes . What did you do ? I did just like you 'd do , doctor . I killed him . If the Masonic rites are over ... . .. bow about Richie ? We 'lI take him to my place . I got nearly everything I need there . is there anything you can do , doctor ? I mean , seeing how you 've lost over 200 million patients . I don 't have it . - Have what ? - The pIague. I 'm immune . - Everybody has it . - Everybody but me . There was a vaccine just an experimental batch . We weren 't sure it 'd work . - Why , if you 're immune ' you couId- - - That 's right . My blood might be a serum . At the stage that boy 's in , my antibodies could reverse the whole process , stop it . Christ , you could save the world . Screw the world . Let 's save Richie . Nothing with drugs . It 's gotta be the serum . CouIdn 't you reconstitute the vaccine ? You got any idea how many steps it takes ... . .. to synthesize an antibiotic specific for this bug ? - Got the picture . - I 've tried . God knows I 've tried . Once I caught one of Matthias ' people last year ... ... and tried everything on the shelves on him . He damn near killed me and then he died very badly himself . So it 's very tight ' doctor . Very tight . Bring him in here . In the bed . I see where you do your heavy thinking . One side keeps the other side going . Can 't have one without the other . - I 'm a narcissist . - How do you do ? - The guest room . - You weren 't expecting us ? I wasn 't expecting you . well ' hold these . I 'm gonna need some help . Lisa will have to do you . I hate to leave the kids alone too long . They get spooked . Hey , watch your mouth . You know , some of the kids you know what they say ? No . What do some of the kids say ? They say the Family comes in the night when it 's dark . They say they 're going to come some night and take Richie 's soul ... . .. and tie it all up in a bag and give it to the devil . is that really true ? Do you know if that 's really true ? No . We wouldn 't let that happen . Not a chance . Are you God ? Let 's find out if he 's even a doctor first before we go promoting him ' okay ? Okay . How about a break ? well . Your move . I just made my move . Where 'd you get that dress ? The same place you got that jacket . I hustled it . The house fuzz was on vacation . NeviIle . His voice . I 'Il never get used to it ... . .. to hearing it . Something ... . We were with them for a while you know ? With Matthias ? You were a part of that Family ? When it happened when even the Army fell apart ... . .. and there was nobody left except those living alone like animals ... . .. Matthias walked the streets at night ... . .. ringing a bell . Richie and I ' we had us a place in the back of a furniture store . One day ' we hear this bell . So we go out to see and there are people there . We thought we were alone ... . .. just me and Richie with millions of corpses . But there was Matthias and other people . well ' anyway , he gave us the family for a while . We helped with the burials . We helped with the burnings . But when it was over , and the worst was past ... . .. they began to know how different we were , our skin , our eyes . One day while they were asleep , we just took off . How 'd you get mixed up with Dutch and his group ? Dutch came by one day and said he was with the Census Bureau . - Now , what you thinking ? - Yeah . well ' you know the old song ? " lf you were the only girl in the world and I were the only boy " ' okay ... . .. but until then don 't bother me ? I guess I 'm the only boy . The family . God , I forgot to keep the fuel up in the generator . They 'll be into the garage ! You stay here . - What 's this for ? - Comfort . You may not have time , Brother Zachary . More time than Neville has , brother . - When he comes back up , I 'Il be waiting . - Take care . - He has the luck of a devil . - I know . But this time his luck has run out . Robert ! You can take down that service flag now ' mother . Man ' don 't scare me like that . - You all right ? - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm okay . Now ' what 's this stuff about me being the only girl in the world ? Do you know it 's been a long ' long time ? I 'm not sure I remember how this goes . - How is he ? - He 's stable . No loss of pigment since yesterday and vital signs are steady . He 's comfortable . I 'm sorry . It 's been a long ' long time since I 've had a patient . well ' doctor , you certainly haven 't lost your bedside manner . is that so ? Are you ready for this ? What is it ? Birth-controI pills . Yeah . Here we are . I can make toxins from both of these . AII right , now the tourniquet . Good and tight . That 's fine . Give me the swab . AII right , you get the needle . Go ahead . AII right , take off the tourniquet . will one bottle be enough ? It 's genuine ' 1 60-proof old Anglo-Saxon ' baby . I was a very peculiar doctor in those days ... . .. trying to find treatments for diseases that hadn 't existed ... . .. till other doctors invented them . Now I 'm the only game in town . I don 't know how much . I 'Il draw blood as often as I can . We 'lI just have to keep pumping it into him . - How long do you think it 'lI take ? - I don 't know . I really don 't know . But if it does work ... . .. then Richie will be the source of even more antibodies . The more people we inject ... . .. the more serum we 'II get . And when that 's done ... . When that 's done ' baby ' we will pull out . We 'lI take what we need and head for the mountains . Out of rats ' alley Where the dead men lost their bones T.S . Eliot turns out to have been just as good a prophet as he was a poet . " The Waste Land . " I wonder if it comforts him . I wonder if I 'II ever see a stream full of fish again . Where 'd you ever see a stream full of fish in Harlem ? At the movies . - Does that hurt ? - A little , yeah . It hurts . How about off , man ? Turn it off . A week ago ' that much light would have sent you right up the wall . I 'm beginning to see the light . I 'Il have another batch of serum ready in a few hours ... . .. then we 'lI load up that Land Rover pick up Dutch and the kids ... . .. and go to the hills . How about the Sierras ? Yeah . Oh , Robert . Baby ' we made it . We really made it . I think I 'lI go pick up some stuff for the trip . is there anything special you fancy , baby ? What I pick up today , you 're gonna be seeing for a Iong ' long time . - Why don 't you skip it ? - Oh ' honey . The most dangerous thing I ever ran into in one of those stores was you . You watch yourself . You stay on the ground floors , near the doors and in the light . - If you see anything , shoot . - Check . Honey ' can I borrow your credit cards ? is that gonna be for me ? No , you don 't need any more . This is for Lisa . - One of these days , she may- - - Start to turn ? That 's always a possibility . It 's best to catch these things early . Then you don 't think the serum would work ... . .. for tertiary cases ? - What do you mean ? - Like Matthias . The family . It 's hard to say . well ' would it ? Come on , help me with this . Put the cap on that . Put it in the refrigerator . I can 't afford to give more blood till I get clear of this town . Later on , if your blood count comes up ... . .. and you put on some weight , we can use your blood to make serum . Yeah ? Yeah . Now ' go eat your soup . You know , someone ought to do something about those people . How about it ? - You gonna give them the serum ? - Fat chance . How come ? We 'd have to be here for a few more months ' for one thing . For another thing , they 're homicidal maniacs , for God 's sakes . Hey , man ' they 're humans . I mean , they 're sick ' you know ? They 're vermin . Okay , then . If you don 't want to cure them , kill them . If I just knew where they 're at . The old court building ' that 's where . In the civic center . That 's where they 're holed up . - You 're kidding me . - They 're there . well ' go on . Ain 't you gonna go down there and zap them ? Why not ? You 've been looking to kill them for practically two whole years now . Either kill them or cure them , damn it . No need . They 're haIf-dead right now . You know what ' mister ? You 're hostile . You just don 't belong . Nice of you to let me hang around . At times ' you scare me more than Matthias does . Hey , Dutch . - How 's Richie ? - Beautiful. lt works . It works . It works ? It works ! It works . It works ! It works . Oh ' my God ' it 's a beautiful world . Don 't you think we ought to do something ? Damn right . I 've got some blood to make up serum for Lisa . We 'lI start on the rest of you in a week or so . Can you have the kids ready to leave tomorrow ? Gonna take me a Iittle ride in the sun . Where are we going ? Away ' that 's all . Just away . someplace nobody ever bothered with . A river nobody ever dammed ... . .. a mountain nobody built any bloody freeways to ... . .. where everything we do will be the first time it happened . Hey , yeah , you got it . That 's it . Just like in the beginning of the world . Like we were starting all over again in the Garden of Eden . Only this time we don 't trust no frigging snake . Richie ? Scout ' l wonder if we 're gonna have room for you . Richie . " Going to find out who 's right . You or me . " well ' Richard ... - ... why are you here ? - I came to help you . - You know the man . - Neville ? That 's him , yeah . He 's got a serum for what 's wrong with you . And if you could just talk to him , get with him ... . .. then everybody could be ... . Yes ? Everybody could be what ? Everyone ... . well ' everybody could be normal again . I see . - We could be as we were before ? - Yeah , I guess so . - The way we were . - The way we were . That 's what NevilIe thinks we want ? That why he sent you ? - He didn 't send me . He- - - silence ! Oh ' yes ... . .. he sent you to offer us something from his world ... . .. to change us back to the creatures we were . A trick ! A trick to weaken our resolve . I was almost like you , but he saved me . He brought me back . He wants us all to go away from here . You have been damned ' Richard . Don 't you see that ? Don 't you ? Prepare the Family .

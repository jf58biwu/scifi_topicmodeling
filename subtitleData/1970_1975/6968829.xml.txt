Willard stiles , vice president . Willard . You don 't talk to me anymore . Well , I try , mother . Oh , Willard . Sometimes i just don 't understand you . Well , the whole house is falling apart . All the shingles on the roof are falling off , the TV doesn 't work , oh , oh , and the faucets in the kitchen are starting to leak again . Yesterday , I saw , saw a rat in the yard . Why , you 're letting everything go ? Well , I 'll put some washers in tomorrow . Oh , yes , and Willard ? Uh , the laundry faucets , they need , need new washers too , you know ? All right , all right . Sometimes I think you 're trying to , kill your mother . Good night , mother have a good breakfast . Willard ? Willard ! Did you do anything about those rats ? What ? Oh , I will . When , Willard ? I 'll get to it . Uh , their nests are out by the rock garden there . Perhaps we should call an exterminator ? Exterminators cost money . You can kill them with a stick ! No ! And I never find them all . When are you going to talk to Martin about your job ? I thought I told you i wanted to talk to you this morning at 9 : 00 A.M. Oh , I was just on my way to your office , Mr. Martin . It 's 9 : 40 A.M. What 's the matter ? Well , I had a lotto do at home this morning , and I missed my bus . Oh , you missed the bus ?

Oh , uh , I got most of them done , I 'll , I 'll get the rest , uh , this morning . There are two departments in the company that have to work right . One of them is sales , and one of them is manufacturing . Now , you get a bottle neck in the middle , and orders don 't get processed , or orders don 't go out , and everything comes to a screeching halt . And I lose my shirt . Now , do you want me to lose my shirt , Willard ? I 'm gonna tell you , for the last time ! Clean up your back log of work ! All of it ! You hold up my sales department , or even my shipping department , one more time , - Mr. Martin ... - Shut up , Willard ! I don 't buy that bit about you being overworked . I 'm gonna do you a favor , at my own expense , I 've brought in a temporary girl , to help you clear up your desk . Now , I want , and I am going to have a system around here , and if I don 't get it ... Promise or no promise to your mother , I 'm gonna throw you out of here . Now get moving ! Do they always give you that much work to do ? You can call me Joan , Mr. stiles . Willard ? - Did you do it ' ? - Do what ? Oh , Willard , you 're driving me out of my mind . Want a little something to nibble on ? I want you to come here ! Did you kill the rats ? Yes ! I did it , I did it . They were , uh , swimming around and around . And I didn 't think they were gonna drown , you know , so I got a stick , it was your idea . And I came up on them and I just , you know , - ka-bam ! Like , like that . - Don 't ! Don 't , please don 't . I , I don 't want to hear about it . Jackson . Stanley . Margolis . Bannister . Kramer . ' ( Ant . That 's all the additions to the list so far .

This way you 'll save a stamp . Make a hit with the boss . L 'm coming . Thanks , Willard . It seems to me that Martin should 've invited you to his party . Well , I 'm not a customer . For a salesman . But after all , your family founded the company , didn 't they ? Yes , but that 's the past and this isn 't the past . I 'm glad I 'm just a temporary . Oh , hello , darling . Your mother called me . She didn 't feel well , she had a very bad spell this afternoon . But I told her I 'd stay here until you got home . Now , don 't , don 't worry . I , I made her a little custard , - would you like some ? - No . I don 't mind taking care of both of you . No . Oh . Mother , why did you call Charlotte , instead of me ? Well , you can 't leave your work every time I call . And , we have to have someone hereto help . I 'm afraid , I 'm going to be a lot of trouble to you , Willard . I 'll manage , don 't you worry . The only evidence of my struggle with the world is you . I 'm sorry to have been such a disappointment . You 've always been a good boy , Willard . It 's just that I 'm alone here , most of the time , and I worry so . What you need is a wife . Who 'll keep after you , all the time . Who , who would help you in business . Oh , and did you fix the shingles on the porch ? Yes . I 'm so ... Sick of lying here without my TV . I 'll fix it tomorrow . You 're not in trouble with a girl , are you ? Oh , I brought this for your mother , it 'll give her strength . I heard you two talking , how is she , Willard ? She 's asleep . Oh . Well , I , I can put it in the refrigerator , and you can give it to her later , and I 'll be off . But , you remember now , you call me if you need me . Lesson time , queenie . C 'mon . C 'mon , queenie . Hi . Hi babe . Hi . Come on , it 's lesson time . I know what the trouble is , queenie . You don 't know what speech is .

You can 't just sit out back for an hour doing nothing ! Yes , I can . I like it . It isn 't good for you to sit out there alone and brood so much ! What do you think about , huh ? Oh , the pilot light is out on the heater , again . I 'll fix it . Willard ! What 's that in your pocket ? There 's something in your pocket ! No , you 're imagining things . No , I 'm not . Turn around , I want to see . There 's nothing to see . Hi , troops . Hi . Hi . Hi , team . Oh . Oops . Okay . Everybody ! Ella , here for ... Nashua-ashua . King of the station of pitchburg road .

Uh , sit down , sit down . Sit down . You caught me in closet with ol ' rickles , huh ? C 'mon , boy , loosen up . I was just doing the old broad a favor ! Willard ? Are you happy here ? Well , I might be if I made some money . You 're not trying , Willard . You 're not trying at all ! Hey . Hey . Are you putting the squeeze on ... On me ? This is one for the books ! Mr. Martin , uh , now , I haven 't had a raise since my father died , and I work weekends , and I work nights - and ... - What do you want from me ? You need money ? Sell the house . We can 't sell it . Of course you can . And I 'm prepared to make you an offer . That house is much too big for you . Oh , for me too , for that matter . But I can afford it . Now , you haven 't got a father , and ... What do you say ? You sell the house , you won 't have to worry about a raise .

What do you mean , " you think " ? Half of my customers haven 't even answered ! Look in your desk , i bet they 're still in there . Look , it 's tonight you know ? Or doesn 't that interest you ? You know something , Willard ? You 're a real pain in the tail . I carried your father on my back , for years ! And now I 'm carrying you ! Go on , crawl outta here ! Willard ? Four thousand dollars , and he thought he was gonna take me ! Go right in . Oh , hi . Go in and have a drink , enjoy yourself . Food ! Food ! Food ! Rats ! Whoa , what , what 's the matter ? Rats ?

It 's somebody from Willard 's house . No ! I think you better take it . Hello ? Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . All right . Willard , uh , let me have those clearance papers .

She died this morning , Willard , at 9 : 42 , in my arms . The last thing she said was to take care of you . What right do you have to move my mother without my permission ? Well , I tried to get you . The office , didn 't Mr. Martin tell ya ? They said you 'd gone to the customs house , and I called you over there , but they couldn 't reach you . Where is she ? Your mother 's in heaven dear . And Mr. farley has the body . She 's out of her misery , poor thing . Oh , how she loved you , Willard . Your mother asked me to take care of you . - Oh , how she loved you , Willard . - I know my mother loved me , you don 't have to keep telling me that . Well , well , I have to call Mr. farley later about the arrangements , flowers can come from the stewarts and we can call reverend Pascal , he can help . Willard , you don 't know how much there is to do . You 're , you 're upset . And nervous , of course you are . You and your mother were so close . After this is over , you should take a week off . Take a rest . That 's what you need , Willard , a rest . And a chance to decide , what you 're gonna do with your life now that your mother 's gone . Get out ! Just , just , just get out . You , you leave me alone . I 'll take care of my mother , you , get out . Get out ! You just get out ! C 'mon , we have a lot to do . Oh , Willard ! I don 't want to seem precipitous , Willard , but , there are a few things about your mother 's estate you should know right away . Your mother left everything to you . The house , the clothes , everything . Oh , what about money ? Did she leave any money ? Well , your mother was living on a small annuity , unfortunately it died with her . You mean she left me nothing ? Not much , just the equity on the house . Well , you could sell it , pay off the mortgage . Buy yourself a small house , somewhere else .

But , it 's Saturday . Good luck . / Willard ? Finished with your work ? Well , I have a surprise for you in your car . In my car ? Okay , now close your eyes . C 'mon . C 'mon . All right . Now look in the back seat . Aw , her name 's Chloe . She 's a present for you . I , I couldn 't bare thinking of you all alone , Willard , and ... Well , cat 's are really very good company . Especially girl cats , and ... Well , I saw her in the pet shop down the street when I was having lunch today . Well , I couldn 't resist getting her or you . Have you ever had a cat before ? No . Um ... Why don 't we drop her off by your house , I , I 'd love to see it . Ahh ... Well , we could go by there ? But , uh , I can 't ask you in , we 've ... Too messy . All right . Ah ! I just love old houses . This is where I live . What is it , Willard ? What 's the matter ? They 're gonna sell our house for taxes . Oh , that 's a shame . Joan , do you mind if I take you right home ? What are you gonna do , Willard ? - About what ? - Well , about your house . I don 't know . I don 't have $ 2,500 . You just have to think of someway to get it . Oh , I wish I could give it to you , Willard , i ... I mean you deserve that . Be good , Chloe . Take care of Chloe ! Oh , I 'll take care of her , all right . Do you mind holding this just for a minute for me ? Thank you . Each time I come down here , there 's more of ya . Now , now look ! Get this straight ! Stop it ! Now , I am the boss here . Want you to stop it ! I can 't afford it . Look , nothing ! The mortgage is driving me nuts . And you 're driving me nuts ! Worse than a bunch of rabbits ! Dinner ! C 'mon . May be the last one . C 'mon . C 'mon . Dinner . C 'mon , eat . All right . Wait here till I get back . Willard . You came to apologize , I knew you would , you 're your mother 's boy . Is that the car you bought with the money she left you ? - Yes . - Nice . Oh . I , I need some money for taxes . Uh , I came home and found a , a notice for tax sale on the door . And , if I don 't pay it , they 're gonna take the house away from me . And , and I was wondering if you could help me ? Farley 's mortuary . Mr. farley speaking . Yes , ma 'am . Just a moment please . B-a-r-r-y . And the address , please ? Yes , ma 'am . Somebody will be over there , within an hour . No office hours in this business , Willard . You have to be here when they want you , or they take their business somewhere else . Now , what were you saying ? I thought maybe you could lend me the money so I could pay my taxes and then you 'd let me pay you back . Willard , what you 're saying makes no sense at all . There 's no reason why you should get deeper and deeper into debt . Now , you just sit down there , and listen to me . You 'd better sell the house , Willard , it 's the only thing that makes sense . You 're not gonna lend me the money , Mr. farley ? It 's $ 2,500 . Well , my boy ... If I thought it would help you , I 'd do so , but , no , I can 't do that . You think about selling the house . Now , think about it , Willard . Now , you 'll have to excuse me because I have someone in the back to take care of , and then I ... Have to , make a pick up . Did you have any luck ? - Luck with what ? - Well , with the money ? Oh , Willard , I wish i had some money to give you . Why , I couldn 't take money from you Joan , that wouldn 't be fair . I 'll think of something . Walt , I promise you , it will be delivered . But , you gotta remember , those little pictures back there , for me . Alice , Mr. Spencer 's going to Europe tomorrow afternoon , the lucky stiff . And listen , he needs some cashier 's checks and some cash . Now , draw up a check for $ 8,000 , take it down to the bank . - Yes , Mr. Martin . - And here is Mr. Spencer 's personal check put that in the firms account ... Right , but the bank will be closed before I can get there . Well , call them , they stay open for me . Get me half in cashier 's checks and the balance in cash , $ 100 bills . Isn 't that a hell of a lotta cash to be carrying around ? Stick it in my money belt . I always like to have some real cash available . For a little wheeling and dealing in that black market , huh ? Hey , I 'd like to get a black market on those pictures . Can you , can you imagine having $ 8,000 to spend on a vacation ? Hey , we could really ball it up with that kind of a bank roll , huh , Willard ? Oh ! Ah , you got my rolodex , give me Spencer 's address . - Spencer . - Wait a minute . Yeah . Spencer , Walter t . 1136 Spencer Lane , Hollywood , 90028 . Door joint ... Eat it out . Come on , Walter , wake up ! - Something 's scratching . - What ? You hear it ' ? Stop ! Tear it up ! Walter ! Please , Walter , there 's something outside the door . Please ? It 's just your imagination . But if it 'll make you feel any better ... Do something ! Oh , god ! - Don 't leave me ! - C 'mon , June ! June ? Hmmm . Damn kid 's never home ! What do we do with the house ? Are you kidding ? This is a woodpecker 's hamburger . You run a bulldozer through it . And where 'd he get that weed bit ? Yes , sir . I can put close to 40 apartments on this lot . Now , remember , you gotta have one and a half parking places per apartment . I got room , don 't worry . Why is that kid still hanging onto this old barn ? 'Cause he 's a kook ! Here , let me , let me look in here . Suppose he won 't sell ? He 'll sell , if he 's unemployed . Ah ! Come on . Ben ! Now , you know very well you 're not supposed to be in the bedroom ! Now , just for that , I am not gonna take you into the office tomorrow , do you hear ? Ben ! Bad ! Go to the cellar . To the cellar ! You hear ? I am sick of your troublemaking . Ben ? Ben , I 'll ... Ben ? Ben , did you ... Now , how did you get in there ? Look , are you gonna be good ? All right , I 'll take you to the office . But if you do one thing wrong , if you make one sound , it 's the last time you go . Do you understand ? All right . Uh , Mr. Martin wants to see you . Come in . Uh , you got a moment ? Come in , come in . Uh , close the door . Sit down . I , um , I want to talk to you . You 're the boss , Mr. Martin . Now , as you know , Joan , we have a nice family relationship here . Everybody gets along with everybody . Now ... I 've noticed lately that , uh , you 've been seeing a lot of Willard ? You object to that ? Me ? No , sir ! I should say not , i think it 's wonderful now ... I 'm the one that pays you , right ? Just exactly what do you want , Mr. Martin ? I want you to do me a favor . Help me to help Willard . You can help us both . By persuading him to sell me his house . I can 't do that ! - Can 't ... - No . Or won 't ? I think you better do your own persuading , Mr. Martin . If that is the way you feel . Alice ? Hey . Now , you two ... you ! You behave yourself , do you hear ? Are you gonna be good . Hmm ? I can hear ya out in the hall , now calm down ! Both of you ! This is the last time I 'm gonna warn you . Willard , can I see you a minute , please ? Willard ? I , I 've just been fired . I , I just got my notice . Alice put it on the desk . Well , did you have a fight with her ? It , it 's all right , Willard , it was just a temporary job . I 'll get another one . I 'm sorry . It 's all right . He 's given me my notice . Big deal , I get 30 days . What the hell 's going on here ? Tell them about rats , they 're just little mice , probably . Where , where 'd you see the rats ? I saw them , they 're all over the closet ! Oh , for ... here 's somebody get me a stick . Get me a stick , get me a stick , anything at all ! - Get a stick . - Now , c 'mon . Hold it down , will ya , kids , it 's only a rat . All right , now hold it down . Be careful , Mr. Martin I see them ! Get me a chair ! A chair , gimme a chair , hurry up . Gimme a chair ! - Hurry up ! - Watch it , look out . C 'mon , will ya , with the chair ! C 'mon with the chair ! - Hold the chair now ! - I 'll hold it , I got . Ruin my party , will you ? Oh , you ... I got him ! L got him ! - You got a lot of guts , boss . - Huh ? He 's dead . Good work , Mr. Martin . All right . That was great , boss . Oh , man , i gotta get washed up . Phew ! Oh , boy , look at me . I gotta get cleaned up . Ha ! It 's like a damn safari with all these rats . Hey , what 's the matter , tiger ? Got a little nervous stomach ? C 'mon , boy ! Let 's not take all day , let 's get going , we got a lot of work to do . Hey , Alice , get somebody to clean up that mess , will you ? Hey , hey ! C 'mon ! Let 's get back to work ! Do you think there are any more of them ? Well , if there are , just whistle for me . Listen , uh , open up the office in the morning , will you ? Would you like me to stay the night ? That 's a good idea . It 's tax season , and I need some private fanangling time . Ben , there was nothing I could do . There 's nothing I could do . Ben , it was ... It wasn 't my fault . Will you ... Please just , just get in ... And I won 't touch you . Ben , they 'll kill you if you stay here ? Please , they 'll kill you . It 's all right , it 's okay . Why didn 't you tell me that you owed taxes on the mortgage ? You ! You told me to talk over my future with your , your friend , Martin . Well ! Well , Martin your friend , wants to take my house and just , just knock it down ! Well I won 't let him ! Incidentally ... He fired me ! And , if it 'll make you feel any better ... Socrates is dead . Martin killed him . Just like he killed my father ! Don 't worry , I 'll manage ! I make the decisions now . I make the decisions now . Hello . My , god ! Look at the rats . Look at the rats , not just one anymore . We 've come to talk to you . What , are you crazy or something ? Watch , Mr. Martin . They do anything i tell them to do . You 're the one that ruined my party . - You crazy ... - Don 't you move ! There are a lot more of them . Waiting . Waiting for what ? Waiting for us , to finish our talk . Sit down . No , Willard ... Sit ! Mr. Martin ? I have a number of things to tell you . First ... You stole the business from my father . And second ... It killed my mother . And third ...

I 'll call them for you . - You don 't have to . - But I 'd like to , Willard . No , you don 't understand . You see , I 'm not afraid anymore . What is it ? I don 't know . I think I heard something in the hall , excuse me . Joan , I want you to do something for me . What is it , Willard ? And I don 't want you to ask me any questions . I don 't want you to complain , i just want you to do it . Well , of course , but , what is it ? I want you to take this money and I want you to go down to the corner and get a taxi cab and go home , and I 'll call you there . - Willard ... - Don 't ask me ... What , Joan ? Just go ! Don 't ask , just go ! Ben ! Ben , now you ... Okay , I guess we have to make a deal . Now , you came here for food , and , you behave yourself and you 'll get it . And so will your friends in the cellar . You understand ? Get out ! Get out ! I was good to you , Ben !

 Sighting : radius vector 1096 . Alter course : 4,31 degrees . Confirm bearings . 109,6 . Orbital altitude : 306,2 miles . Vostok II , launched June 13 , ' 65 . Fire limpet . Limpet attached . Moving away . Stand by . Activate . - Positive , sir . - Resume course . Confirmed sighting at radius vector 1520 . - There she is . - Position and data correct . Log and resume course . Apollo 8 , December 21 , 1968 . What we say goes no further than this room , OK ? So let 's get down to the infighting . You have been a thorn in my side for years , Straker . Consistently excessive demands for the diversion of resources to your organisation . - But a total clearance programme ? - Right . While I 'm running this commission I 'll fight you on this issue every inch of the way . You 've been practising . What are you working on , anyway , Alec ? One of Straker 's projects . It 's a beautification campaign . I won 't deny you could use it . No , space junk . Straker wants it all cleared . The Astrophysical Commission takes care of any space junk , anything with hazard potential . Straker thinks it could be used by the aliens to crack our defences . He may be onto something . If your report shows it 's possible , the junk gets cleared . - What 's the problem ? - James L Henderson is the problem . Cost ! Time ! Personnel ! Resources ! You want reasons why not ? I can give you a hundred . Listen , Henderson , every item of space junk could be cleared in weeks if the commission gave its full support . As for cost , it would be high , but safety factors alone would justify it . - Safety factors ? - Yes . My organisation uses space more than any other . My pilots take more risks in a month than ... My men do in a year ? No , we 'd need facts , Straker . Details , statistics . - You just don 't have them . - Don 't I ? - Of course not . - I have my report . Your report . You promised you would not decide until my report was fully considered . And so it won 't . However , I confess I don 't think it will have much influence . Then that must be because you 've swung them against it . We 've completed the annual clearance of all dangerous space junk . The cost was more than double last year 's . And worth every penny . Do you realise what a full clearance programme would cost ? I 'm not gonna swap dollar signs with you . Lives are at stake . I want that junk cleared . Every last piece . - ' So where is he ? ' - On his way , sir . Commander Straker . Freeman . 'Alec , I want that space clearance report . ' There 's data still missing . 'I don 't care what 's missing . 'Looks like Henderson 's commission have already decided against it . 'We have to convince them . ' Give me 24 hours . It can 't make any difference to you . 'I want that report , Alec . I don 't care what shape it 's in . ' 'SHADO lunar module 32 , clear for takeoff . Stand by . ' Roger , Moonbase . Confirm TET . Affirmative . Trans-Earth trajectory green . Lift off , 32 . Check delta coordinates . Coordinates correct , sir . Earth orbit insertion , 2 hours , 13 minutes , 8 seconds . Right . Contact SHADO HQ and Moonbase . Tell them we 're going for EOI in 43 minutes , 29 seconds . Right , sir . 32 reports Earth orbit insertion at 13-08-21 , sir . Contact SID . Tracking procedure green . - Has SHADO HQ been alerted ? - Yes , sir . - So everything 's fine ? - Straker won 't think so . He 's expecting you . Re-entry angle : 6,58 degrees . EOI : 4 min , 12 sec . Sighting , sir . At 7035 . That 's in behind us . Confirm sighting . Affirmative , sir , and it 's closing fast ! Contact Moonbase . 32 reports unidentified sighting , sir . Signal red alert . What 's happening ? Angle increasing ! His angle of re-entry 's too steep . Tell him to correct angle of re-entry ! Loss of signal , sir ! Still increasing ! Something 's pulling us off course ! We 've got to correct ! Pitch actuator : 1,3 . Burn ! Earth orbit insertion now . No response ! We 're in trouble ! Henderson , all I need is another 48 hours . - Another 48 hours ? - Yes ! I can have a summary of the report on your desk by then . Yo know I can 't hold up the commission any longer . Why don 't you let me tell them that you decided to withdraw your proposal ? It 'd get you off the hook . I intend to hold you to your word . Consider my report before deciding about the clearance programme . All right , Strake , I think I 'm reading you . You want an alibi for that pilot of yours who killed himself . You want to blame it on uncleared junk . - I want your word , Henderson . - On one condition . Are you considering your spacecraft was in a collision with space junk ? It 's a possibility . A possibility , yes . So suspend all lunar flights until we 've investigated the incident . - You realise what you 're doing ? - Yes , I do . I 'm proving to the commission that your organisation at present is an expensive and unworkable luxury . Ahh , Ms Ealand . Hard at it ? I 'm always hard at it . Sometimes you notice . - How did it go , sir ? - Go ? You know the code word " Washington Square " , Miss Ealand ? Not without looking it up . It 's not a regular one . - It 's one I thought we 'd never use . - What does it mean , sir ? It means " shutdown " . Cancel lunar flights . Virtual isolation of Moonbase . 'SHADO control to all units : Washington Square . 'I say again , Washington Square . 'Immediate compliance , Washington Square . ' Colonel Foster , sorry to disturb you , sir . 'Code message from SHADO : " Washington Square " . 'I 'll check it right away . ' There 's no need . It means shutdown . What ? More specifically , a complete ban on all orbital flights . - ' Colonel Freeman for you . ' - Put him on . - ' Why the ban on moon flights ? ' - Henderson . - ' Why ? What about the report ? ' - Forget it . The commission believe we 're blaming space junk for the crash . - ' When you think it was ... ' - Maddox . Pilot error . Take a rest , enjoy the scenery , Alec . What 's Straker trying to do ? I don 't know . He doesn 't usually take things lying down . You couldn 't call it typical . Then there 's Maddox . What do we do about him ? Forget all about it ? What else can we do ? Any pilot can make a mistake . - And you 're only allowed one . - Not Steve Maddox . - Anyone can make a mistake . - Not Maddox ! He was too experienced ! All right , all right , what caused the re-entry error ? He reported an unidentified sighting just before loss of signal . But we didn 't pick up anything . It must have been something . Space debris . Maybe . Maybe . And we just sit back and do nothing ? No . We make sure it doesn 't happen again . Get me 32 's electronic log . - Captain Maddox 's flight ? - Yes . What 's going on here ? - Who the devil 's in that module ? - Colonel Foster . Why didn 't you tell me ? Any of you ! Col. Foster 's orders . We weren 't to tell you until takeoff was imminent . And irreversible . Paul , cut your motors . I said cut your motors . - ' Paul , this won 't help . ' - What won 't ? Taking out a module . If you 're doing it why I think you are . - I 'm gonna fly Maddox 's course . - Under the same conditions . - ' Yes . ' - You 're crazy ! What will it prove ? For one thing , Maddox wasn 't responsible for the loss of his ship . 'Well , if you do make it it won 't mean much . ' Depends on how I get through . 'And if you don 't ? ' Then I don 't . Roger . Three . Roger . What is it ? 29 calling Moonbase . - ' Everything under control ? ' - So far . EOI in 2 hours , 38 minutes , 22 seconds . Roger . Have you contacted Straker ? No . But I have a feeling he 'll be contacting me soon . Sighting at galactic latitude 43,17 . Longitude 14,53 . - That 's Moonbase operations area . - Right . Call Commander Straker . 'You 'll turn back right now . ' EOI in 1 hour precisely . - I 've gone too far for that . - You 're right , Foster . Much too far . - Module 29 to Moonbase . - Go ahead , 29 . 'Re-entry in 6 minutes , 9 seconds . ' Roger . - Moonbase . - ' Receiving , 29 . ' 'EOI in 4 min , 3 sec . ' Re-entry angle : 5,73 degrees . Confirm . '29 , confirm re-entry angle . ' Stay on 29 ! 29 's re-entry angle , it 's ... Paul , adjust re-entry angle . Cut back to 5 . 'Cut back to 5 , you 're far too shallow . He 'll bounce off the earth 's atmosphere out into space . Colonel Foster ? Foster here , I 'm happy to say . 'Congratulations . ' Don 't let my delight blind you to the fact that we have matters to discuss . Ooh , you 've gone too far this time , Straker . - I don 't see it that way . - You authorised a lunar flight ! I authorised nothing . Look , Straker , I don 't want to argue . You are responsible whatever the circumstances . I agree . But Colonel Foster has proved there is alien interference with our interorbital flights . - Has he ? - Yes . And I was almost killed doing it . - So you say . - Yes , I say ! My apologies . Thank you . It 's time we laid our cards on the table , Henderson . All right . I 'll tell you what I think of Colonel Foster 's so-called proof . You knew we would turn down your space junk clearance programme , so you instructed Foster to fly . - Why should I do that ? - You were desperate for evidence . Go on . You rigged this information . But you won 't get away with it . The commission convenes the day after tomorrow . By the time I get through , you 'll be out of a job . Is that all ? I 'll see you at the comission meeting . Indeed you will , Commander . Can he really do it ? - Do what ? - Ease you out . He can try . What about our evidence ? Evidence . What 's it gonna look like if Henderson says we manufactured it to get a space clearance programme ? But we 're right ! Sometimes , Colonel , that 's not quite enough . The tracking data 's been processed , sir . - Anything ? - Not that we can see . We should 've picked up something . There 's nothing on the log except a record of manoeuvres . Send it to SHADO headquarters . So what do we do now ? - Any suggestions ? - We can 't just sit around . I 've solved many problems by " sitting around " , Colonel . Try it . Comm . , the report on Colonel Foster 's flight has come in from Moonbase . - And ? - Nothing unusual , sir . All right . - So that leaves the MV3 detector . - Yes , they 're processing the data now . We haven 't had much luck so far , maybe we 're due for a break . - The MV3 data , sir . - Ah , thank you . Looks like an SPS rocket of some sort . Like the limpet rockets used in debris destruction . Yes . It doesn 't make sense . Why would the aliens put this device into orbit ? Could be programmed to attack moon flights ? A blockade on Moonbase ? Maybe . Why hasn 't our radar picked it up ? Space debris . It 's based in one of those burnt-out rockets over there . Assuming you 're right , which one could it be ? Maddox and I flew practically identical paths it would have to be one of these two here or Apollo 8 here or B-47 . Four possibilities . I think we 're onto something . That should be OK . - Freeman . - ' Alec , I have an assignment for you . 'Launch the Interceptors . Mission : to destroy four pieces of space junk . 'Control will relay the coordinates directly to the astronauts . ' Space junk in earth orbit ? 'Right . And I mean use all three interceptors . ' - All three ? - ' I know , 'it 'll leave Moonbase undefended . Nevertheless , do it , Alec , at once . ' You know what 's gonna happen when Henderson finds out this ? Ah , yes . Henderson . Go over and tell him , Colonel . What ? He 'll go berserk . Yes . Take a nice , slow drive . Give me about half an hour . I hope you know what you 're doing . Control to Interceptor Leader , steer course to earth orbit . 'You will receive details from Earth Control . Out . ' Ms Ealand , when James Henderson calls tell him I 'm unavailable . And when he arrives , sir ? Show him right in . Red carpet . He 's a very important man . Expect him at 3 o 'clock . I wanna see Straker . Immediately . And before you have some excuse , I 'm telling you I won 't take no for an answer . Of course you may see him , Mr Henderson , he 's expecting you . Go straight in . Thank you . - Straker ! - Ah , Henderson . You 're late . Won 't keep you a moment . Studio business . I think it 's a great script , Mr Steiner . There we are . - Cleared for shooting . - Thanks . - I like the way you operate . - Thank you . Some executives crawl all over you . Well , I can assure you , Mr Stanley , you 'll see very little of me . And I 'll give you a film the studio will be proud of . Thanks again . Nice guy . Goodbye ! Bye . All right , Straker ! You know I never touch them . Voice identification . - James Henderson . - ' Identification positive . - ' Henderson , James L . ' - Thank you . I tried to call you , Commander . I was told you were not available . - Were these your instructions ? - Yes . I see . A very high-handed attitude . However , one more question . Is it true you ordered all three Moonbase Interceptors to destroy certain items of space junk ? Correct . Do you realise what you 've done ? - You tell me . - Defied the commission and left Moonbase defenceless . It was my decision . I realise the implications . You had better start packing , Straker ! When the commission know you 're through ! Aren 't you interested in my reasons ? Let 's be kind . Let put it down a mental elaboration to the strain of command . Get those Interceptors back on Moonbase , Commander , while you can still give orders . - Sorry , Henderson . - Don 't push your luck , Straker ! - If Moonbase reports ... - A UFO sighting ? Stick around ! I 'm expecting it . Possible contact : 248-016 red . Contact confirmed . UFO 248-136 red . Red alert ! Get me SHADO HQ . 'UFO maintaining course : 248-204 green . ' Get the termination . Request trajectory termination . 'Predicted termination : 1FO26 , southern England . ' Close enough . Its target is this studio . Keep visual contact on countdown . Yes , sir . - And order complete shutdown . - Shutdown ? ! Everything ! VHF , radar , computers , complete radio silence . - Straker ! - As you said , I give the orders . Complete shutdown . Do it . Termination : 8 minutes , 4 seconds . Com . Straker , I 'd like to talk to you in your office . You too , Colonel . Straker , I 'm relieving you of your command . Colonel Foster will take over . You can 't , Henderson . You require the backing of the commission . - You think I won 't get it ? - I think you can . But it takes time . And this base is due to be attacked . Colonel Foster , assume command ! Colonel . I take my orders from Commander Straker . Now , for the first time in your life , Henderson , you 're going to listen ! The aliens put a satellite into earth orbit using space junk to cover . Why ? A blockade on Moonbase ? A logical reason , but obvious . Too obvious . In time , we would have located and destroyed it . So the satellite is a decoy , a red herring for something bigger . An attack on this headquarters . They hoped the satellite would draw the Interceptors from Moonbase . And you fell right into the trap . I acted as if the plan had worked , yes ! It would take a UFO of great power to destroy this underground base . I didn 't want that hanging over our heads . All these guesses does not explain the shutdown . Why make it easy for them ? The UFO is programmed onto our signals . I don 't buy it , Straker . I just hope you 've guessed wrong . Because if you 're right we 're about to be killed . There 's still time for you to leave . All right , we all just sit here and wait . - For what ? - A voice . Moonbase to SHADO Control . Come in Control . It 's no use , sir , it 's complete radio shutdown . What the hell is Straker playing at ? 4 minutes to termination . Straker , contact the Interceptors , there may be time . No good , they can 't operate in the earth atmosphere and the UFO 's in the stratosphere . Termination : 1 minute 20 seconds . We 're sitting ducks . Maybe . - Yes ? - ' Sky 1 has overflown the studio . ' Thank you , Ms Ealand . - Switch everything on . - Yes , sir . - And get me Captain Carlin . - Sir . - ' Nice timing , Captain . ' - Roger , Control . Sky 1 to Moonbase , request UFO fix and attack coordinates . Will relay direct to outward computer . - Straker , the sly old ... - Fox ? 45 seconds . 40 seconds . 35 seconds . 30 seconds . Have visual contact . Going in for attack . Sky 1 to SHADO Control , UFO destroyed . Colonel Foster , would you get this operation computerised and we 'll prepare it for the commission in my office . Straker , I guess I owe you an apology . You were right . I 'll recommend to Commission a complete clearance of space junk . Thank you . Of course , it 'll take time . The money has to be raised . Call it the Maddox fund . - Maddox ? - The pilot who was killed . Ah , yes , Maddox . Well ... If only you hadn 't been so positive you were right . Like you ? Henderson . I 'll walk you to your car .

 How 's everything going ? - Oh , quiet . - Good . Oh , Alec . Can I see you for a minute ? Sit down , Alec . I want to talk to you about the new leave roster for Moonbase . - I thought you might . - It has to change . And who tells them ? I might have guessed . ( Buzzer ~ ) Straker . ( Ealand ~ ) 'Jo Fraser is in reception , sir . ' - Who ? - ' A reporter from the press agency . ' - Did I make an appointment ? - Yes , sir , last week . Right . Thank you . Alec , can 't you handle it ? It 's the head of the studio he wants to interview . Article for a heap of glossy film magazines . I 'm no PR man . It won 't be that bad . GPA will syndicate the story and keep the rest of the press away . Commander , the refuelling schedule . Give it to Colonel Freeman . I 'm about to be thrown to the press . - ( Phone ~ ) - excuse me . Yes , Mr Straker ? - ' I 'm ready , Miss Ealand . ' - Yes , sir . Would you like to go in ? Before we start , I must tell you that I 'm a busy man , Mr Fraser . I must apologise ... My name is Josephine Fraser . I sometimes find that in a man 's world , Jo is more convenient . Hmm ... well , er ... Is it a man 's world ? I think so . I hope you 'll forgive me . Oh , I 'm sorry . Please sit down . Well , fire away , Miss Fraser . And how long have you been head of this studio , Mr Straker ? Do you tape-record the interview and take notes ? I noticed the microphone in the front of your purse . Oh , that 's to ensure I don 't misquote you . And the notepad 's for my impressions . Of me ? I think first impressions are so important . I think so , too . - ( Man ~ ) ' Fuel checks are complete . ' - I 'll tell Commander Straker . Black , no sugar , sir . Just how I like it . Well , I 'll walk you to your car . Thank you . I thought the age of chivalry was dead . No , I have to go up on the studio lot . It 's on the way . Goodbye . ( Jo ~ ) no , I 'm not sure about that ... very smart . I 've earned it . Well , thank you . You 've been very kind . A pleasure . - Goodbye . - Miss Fraser . Commander Straker ? ( Ford ~ ) ' Commander Straker ? ' 'Commander Straker ? ' Miss Fraser , I didn 't expect you back ... so soon . - I left my handbag . - Oh , I see . - I 'll get it for you . - No , it 's all right . I 'll get it . Have you found it ? Yes , thank you . Stand by . When I give the word . Now ! Cut it . How are you ? All right ? - Fine . How was it ? - That was great . Right , we 'll take some close-ups . From the point when your hand comes up . - Good morning , Roy . - Good morning , Mr Straker . - You died beautifully . - I don 't go much on blood , though . We got that contract matter straightened out . Miss Ealand will put you in the picture . Lovely . Commander Straker has to authorise these . Lieutenant , where is he ? He 's on his way back from the lot . Fine . Messages ? Callers ? No , sir . Only Miss Fraser . Miss Fraser ? Yes , she came back for her handbag . She left it in your office . - You didn 't let her go in there ? - Well , only for a moment . I see . Straker . 'Voice-print positive . Identification Commander Straker . ' ( Jo ~ ) ' I think first impressions are so important . ' ( Straker ~ ) ' Do you tape-record the interview and take notes ? - ' You didn 't let her go in there ? ' - ( Ealand ~ ) ' Only for a moment . ' Alec . Ford . Something wrong ? Did anyone call me during the last 15 minutes ? I bleeped you on the lot . - No , in the office , on the intercom . - I tried there first . - What did you say ? - Nothing . You must have said something . It 's important . Well , Just " Commander Straker " . There was no reply , so I clicked off . " Commander Straker . " All right . Thank you , Ford . How could I be so stupid , Alec ? That reporter had a tape recorder . It was left in the office . Chances are it picked up Ford on the intercom . He only said " Commander Straker " . What could it mean to anyone ? Not a lot , I agree . But maybe enough for that woman and her friends to start snooping . - It was a girl ? - Yes . Miss Ealand , get on to the Global Press Agency . I want to contact Josephine Fraser . It 's urgent . ( Ealand ~ ) ' Yes , sir . ' - What was she like ? - Hmm ? Oh , intelligent . Attractive ? ( woman ~ ) ' I 'm afraid we have no one on our staff named Fraser . ' - Are you certain ? - ' I checked the personnel files . ' - Yes , I see . - ' Check the other agencies . ' Right . Thank you very much . ( Buzzer ~ ) Yes , Miss Ealand ? 'I called the Press Agency , sir . They 've never heard of Miss Fraser . ' Well , check all the other agencies . I want her found . 'Thank you , Miss Ealand . ' Intelligent , attractive ... and a possible security leak . It was my mistake . I 'll take care of it . - I still think I should go . - It 's simple enough , Alec . Find Miss Fraser and get the tape , a logical sequence . Well , you can look after things here . Sure . Well , there it is , Alec . The responsibility seat , the other side of the fence . I 'll check in every few hours . ( SID ~ ) ' Have trace on positive track . 'Course , four-two-eight-one-four-siX green . 'Speed , zero-SOL-eight . 'Range , 2 million miles . Closing .

Missile three not confirmed . 'UFO changing course , moving out of range . ' ( Ford ~ ) we 've lost it . ( Jo ~ ) ' I think first impressions are so important . ' ( SID ~ ) ' I have a sighting bearing green zero-four-two . 'Maintaining stationary position at 5 , feet , earth atmosphere . ' Yes ? Commander Straker , sir . He wants to know how it 's going . Tell him everything 's fine . No trouble . - Well , do we have trouble ? - I don 't think so . - But we have an unidentified trace . - Yes . - Then something 's there . - I guess so . - It could be that UFO . - It 's stationary . The point is do we have a UFO on our hands or don 't we ? In my opinion , it 's a million to one against , - but we 'll maintain a radar track . - No . Launch Sky One . Tell waterman to investigate . Yes , sir . This is SHADO Control to Skydiver . 'Launch Sky One . Investigate possible UFO . 'Position zero-one-two , three-zero-two , red three . ' Roger , Control .

( waterman ~ ) ' Have visual contact . ' Panic over . It 's a weather balloon . - Miss Fraser . - How did you find me ? The studio gate logs all licence plate numbers . I got your address and a couple of places where I might find you . It was a simple process of elimination . - Who do you work for ? - Myself . And sell whatever you get to the highest bidder . Look , I 'm sorry I lied . If I hadn 't , you wouldn 't have seen me at all . Just give me the tape , Miss Fraser , and we 'll call it a day . The tape , Miss Fraser ! You 've played it back . - There wasn 't time . - Right . ( Brakes screeching ~ ) Well , why don 't you say it ? - If you Just sign this , please , sir . - Oh , get outta here . I 'll leave them on your desk , then . Even a practice launch for Skydiver needs an authorisation . Hold it , k eith . I 'm sorry . Can you imagine what Straker would have said ? Yes , sir . I can imagine . What now ? Police ? Who are you ? Jo Fraser , freelance reporter . Failed . I 've only had one article published in the last month . ( Radar pings ~ ) - Is it still there ? - Yes , Lieutenant . Ask Colonel Foster to come in . Get Control . He 'll want to speak to Commander Straker . - Colonel Foster on the video link . - Oh , thank you . Hello , Paul . 'Hello , Alec . This is a surprise . Where 's Straker ? ' I 'll explain later . What 's up ? We 've picked up radio signals about 5 miles east of the base . It 's some sort of vehicle . It 's on an erratic course , but heading our way . - ' Have you any ideas ? ' - Not really . We can 't make radio contact . - Could it be unmanned ? - ' Possibly . ' If it maintains this course , it 'll run into us . 'It 'll be a couple of hours before there 's any real danger . ' Well , get onto it right away . Lieutenant , I want an immediate rundown on all installations on the moon operating surface vehicles . Why did you do it ? It 's a dirty world . You have to cut a few corners . To get what you want . Like that car of yours . The car ? Huh ! It 's on hire . All part of the front . - Does it matter ? - Let 's say I 'm ... interested . You 've heard it all before . I 'm a very good listener . With an ice-cold clinical outlook . 'Intelligent , attractive ... and a possible security leak . ' Huh . You don 't believe me , do you ? You know , if there 's one thing I hate ... it 's eating dinner alone . Well , what do you think ? It 's a tough decision . Thanks . Tell Moonbase to launch Interceptors . Right , sir . Interceptors 1 , 2 and 3 , immediate launch . Repeat - Interceptors 1 , 2 and 3 , immediate launch . Mmm ... nice . Well , it suits me . I 'll get things moving in the kitchen . - Can I help you ? - No , I can handle it . - I left the wine in the car . - I 'll get it . Oh , thanks . ( Buzzer ~ ) Yes , Miss Ealand ? - Commander Straker , sir . - Well , you 'd better tell him ... everything 's under control . 'He says he 's glad to hear it and he 'll be back tomorrow morning . ' ( Straker ~ ) ' Miss Ealand , do a voice check for me . 'It 's Miss Fraser . Just routine . ' 'You mean a G-6 , sir ? ' That 's right , Miss Ealand . A full G-6 . 'I understand , sir . Record immediately . ' Yes . Yes . Come and say hello to Miss Ealand . Hello , Miss Ealand . You 're working very late tonight . Hope to see you again soon . Goodbye now . 'Goodbye . ' Yes , that 'll be fine . Goodnight , Miss Ealand . Well , why don 't you help yourself to a drink ? I 'll break out the can opener . Hey . Thanks . We can see it . I 'll go down and radio back a photograph . Transmit a print of this to SHADO Control . You know , Ed , you 're a terrific cook . I Just follow the instructions on the can . The wine was great . You should have had some . You know , you have a nice home here . It 's a place to sleep . You know , it 's funny , Jo , I enjoyed today . Ever since my divorce , I 've kept myself pretty much to myself . You know how it is . Yes , I do know . It 's Russian . From a base about 12 miles east of Moonbase . Russian ? It 's a mobile rig used for mining in rich surface ore areas . Get on to their base . - Tell them unless they divert it ... - I 'll explain the situation . ( Russian accent ~ ) We understand your concern , but we still can 't establish radio contact with the crew . 'Something must have gone very seriously wrong . ' ( Speaking Russian ~ ) ( Singing ~ ) ( Russian man ~ ) 'They 're out of control . ' All we can do is to keep trying . Get me SHADO Control . We 've contacted the Russian base . The crew of two can 't be contacted . - ' Is the radio link Ok ? ' - It seems to be . - They Just don 't answer . - What 's its position ? '2 miles east of the base . 'A surface mobile is on the way , but it won 't get there on time . ' Send out a Moon Mobile . Try to establish visual contact . 'Right . ' ( # Classical music ~ ) We should be making visual contact any minute . Yes , I make it about two miles . ( Rings ~ ) Straker . ( Ealand 's voice , indistinct ~ ) Yes . ' ... and criminal records show she was indicted five times . ' - I see . - ' Is there anything else , sir ? ' No , that 'll be all right . Right . What 's the matter , Ed ? Get out . What 's wrong ? I know . That 's what 's wrong . One article published in the last month , the car on hire ... ( Scoffs ~ ) You were right the first time . You earned it ... the hard way . What did you have mapped out for me ? To take me for all you could get ? Or maybe something more ... cosy , like an idyllic weekend ... and a guy with a camera happens to burst in at the right time . Maybe at first . Oh , come on . Don 't give me that . Don 't tell me there 's an emotion in that pretty head . - You 're getting soft ! - Soft ? ! That 's the way you get eaten alive . Oh , you wouldn 't understand . It 's a man 's world , remember ? ( Foster ~ ) ' Come in , service rig . 'Come in , service rig . Do you read me ? ' Get me a direct radio link with the Moon Mobile . Right , sir . - ( Barry ~ ) ' Colonel Freeman , sir . ' - Right , put him on . - ( Freeman ~ ) ' what 's the position ? ' - We have visual contact . We 're trying to contact the crew ... without success . - Fire a warning shot . - A warning shot ? You 're five miles from Moonbase ... - That 's a civilian vehicle . - Fire that shot . Right . Range , 48 yards . Angle , zero-decimal-two-eight . Not too close . ( Laughter ~ ) Try another one as close as you dare . Yes , sir . Range , 32 yards . Angle , zero-decimal-two-four . - No reaction . - You 're certain they saw the shot ? Any closer , they 'd have been part of it . - Stop them . - You mean ... ? I mean shoot to stop them . I 'll take the responsibility . Do you read me ? Give us a couple of minutes , we 're going to try something . Come in M3 . 'Come in M3 . ' - Come in M3 . - ' M3 to Control . ' - Control to ... - Get me Colonel Foster . - He 's trying to board the rig . - What ? ! - Has he made it ? - I 'm not sure . I can 't see him . If he 's not inside ... ( Speaking Russian , drunkenly ~ ) They 're both incapable . 'The air pressure 's down . They could have inoXia . ' - How far away is it now ? - 1,5 metres . This is a red emergency alert . Seal all airlocks . All personnel to carry out decompression drill . ( Speaking Russian ~ ) Call the Russians , find out how to stop this thing . Yes , I understand . The quickest way to stop it is to throw the red master power switch . It 's situated left of centre on the control panel . Right . ( Ellis ~ ) ' There 's a red switch on the control panel . ' - I can see it . - That 's the master power control . 'Ok . ' How far is it from Moonbase ? Just a few hundred yards . ( Ellis ~ ) ' The crew are fine , but I doubt if they remember much . ' There must have been a pressure leak . The lack of oxygen induced a sort of drunkenness . - ' Drunkenness ? ' - Like drinking whisky . We call it inoXia . Ah , we know it in the same way . except our description would substitute vodka for whisky . On behalf of SovateX , I would like to thank you for your cooperation . - Good morning , sir . - Ford . Well , it 's all sorted out . Clever girl , Miss Fraser . You were quick with the voice-print . The international crime computer did it . Her record 's as long as your arm . - Is she wanted by the police ? - No . But she won 't stay out of trouble for long . Her kind never do . Maybe . - Where 's Colonel Freeman ? - In your office , sir . - Hello , Alec . - Hello . Well , I hear you had quite a day . You could say that . Paul Foster might have lost his life . Ordering him onto that rig - a tough decision . - The right one , of course . - It wasn 't quite like that . Whatever way it happened , you were responsible . I certainly have to hand it to you . That Miss Fraser , she didn 't have you fooled for a moment . I 'd have probably got emotionally involved . Yes , I can see how it could happen . - I say , Alec ... - SovateX ... well ... It 's all yours . Yeah , the other side of the fence .

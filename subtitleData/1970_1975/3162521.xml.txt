 They were here . The tracks are fresh . I don 't see them . If you could , it 'd be too late . - Come on . - Hey . Galen can 't keep up . His tail 's dragging . Chimps do not have tails . And I 'm all right . Yeah , sure you are . You 're Ironman . Excuse me , " Iron Ape . " Michigan 's great running back . That was a while ago , like , about 2000 years . Give or take a century . Well , let 's move on . There 's no telling how close Urko 's men are . - Let 's make that forest before dark . - Coming , Mother . Sack time , huh ? Let 's check in here . I 'm ready . No way , baby . It 's our chance to get clear . We know what direction to go . They don 't . There 's nothing in any direction . What does it matter ? You can tell direction by that ? I mean , without the stars ? Yeah , it 's called a " compass , " Galen . That needle always points north . And that cloud cover is a big break . Urko 's men won 't know what direction to go in , so they 'll go in circles . - We can go straight on . - Compass ? Is it witchcraft ? Witchcraft ? No , it 's handicraft . And I made it . Next handicraft class , make me a trail bike , twin jet . You got it . Come on . Through here ! They 've been this way ! Clouds ! Blasted clouds ! - We 're forbidden to travel without stars . - Not when you ride for Urko . Then how come the spirits have pulled our horses ' tails in a circle ? All right ! All right ! We 'll camp here . Make a fire ! And stand watch to see if it chases the clouds . If not , we 're going on until we catch them ! Why didn 't I buy that little bar in Jersey City ? Come on ! We 're following the handicraft . Come on ! - Hey , Galen , heads up . - Take it easy , it 's rough in there . Galen ! Take it easy , Galen . Don 't move . Don 't move . Lie still , Galen . Lie still . Tourniquet . Hurry . I 'm sorry . Don 't worry about it . I always make tourniquets for my friends . That 's it . Take it easy , Galen . We have to stop this bleeding first . It was dark . I fell . No kidding . Next time , wait for the lights to change . We 've got to keep moving . We 're sitting ducks . Hey . Hey , wait a minute . - What is it ? - It 's a farm . It looks isolated . This could be it , Pete . Show me a couple of nice , smelly old tractors , and it 's home sweet home . All right . Saddle up . Let 's move out . I 'm beat . I don 't care if this farmer doesn 't have a daughter . Anybody in there ? Anybody inside ? You get away from here . Now ! I 'm warning you . - We have clubs and corn knives . - Look , we need help . Our friend 's been hurt . We don 't help humans . Oh , dear ! That 's terrible . He needs help . Wait . Who are you ? My name is Galen . - These are my friends . - His tired friends . You 're their prisoner . They captured you ? No . No , no . Please help us . Are you rich ? They 're your bonded humans , right ? No . Put that thing away and help him , will you ? ! Now look , we 're no danger to you . Get him inside . I 'll see what I can do . Ask your questions later . Can 't you see he needs help ? Don 't direct me , wife . I 've already made up my mind about you two . Anto and I will carry him . You two can wait in the barn . And don 't touch anything , or don 't steal anything or I 'll put the patrol on you . You just take care of him . Man , I could sleep standing up . Leave a wake-up call for February . What year ? - Hey ! - Get up ! Take it easy , sarge . I didn 't hear a reveille . Thanks for waking us up . - Why did you sleep close to the cow ? - Lf she doesn 't object , why should we ? - Look , we aren 't gonna hurt your cow . - Humans are a curse to cows ! Live and learn . Five years I 've waited for a bull-calf . My own ox , to start my own farm . And nothing but female calves . Heifers for the landlord ! Put the stabber down . This could be your lucky year . Wait a minute . I don 't understand . Oh , you understand . When a son comes of age he has to wait for a bull-calf to be born before he can start his own farm ! Five years I 've waited . And the signs were against me . Nothing but female calves . This year I knew the signs were right until you came . You hear ? ! You 're a bad omen ! If you 've put a curse on her I may kill you . - Hey , now wait a minute . - Remove the curse . Go away today ! Hey , you two . Galen is asking to see you . He 's awake . Wait ! It 's bad enough having humans in the house but wash first . There 's a smell about you . Well , nobody 's perfect . You are wonderful . I feel so much better . Have you done this before ? Oh , I once trained to be a nurse until I met Polar . - The city ... No place to raise a family . - Or even visit . Someday . Always the same answer . Anto need his bull-calf , Remus hardly out of rompers Jillia hasn 't sought out a husband . - Daddy ! You won 't be able to stand on this for some time . - How long ? - Oh , several days at least . I can 't have those humans around here . It 's dangerous . They 've been known to kill cows , just for the meat . Virdon and Burke are not going to kill your cows . Where are they from , those humans ? You simply must let them stay . - They 'll work for their keep . - Work ? Of course they 'll work . That 's what they 're for ! Well ... ? I 'll see . He means well . - You 'll see . - Thank you . Did you send for my friends ? How can you keep calling them friends ? I think we 're gonna have to stand inspection . You ready ? I 've made up my mind . You can stay until your friend is well or able to walk . - No ! - You heard my decision . All right . But the cow is my say . They stay away from the cow ! He 's right about that . The cow is his say until the calf is born . - Anything you say . - But you 'll work . Every day ! Just as though I could afford you . - You got a deal . - Just as though I owned you ! I get one of them . One of them 's mine . We 'll see . The mounted patrol . You sure you 're not escaped bonded slaves ? No , I give you my word . We 're free humans . - You will work for me ! - Yes . Yes . All right . Now go in the back and hide . I 'll talk to them . Yes ? I 'm looking for escaped bonded slaves . You seen any ? - Humans ? - Of course , humans . What else ? We know nothing of bonded humans . We 're just poor tenant farmers . Yes . We can 't help you . If you see any , report immediately . Failure to do so carries a severe penalty . I understand . Are you dumb ? Do you understand ? Yes . I understand . If you see a stray human , report at once . Oh , yes . Your name ? Polar . I wonder if there 's a reward . Didn 't look like one of Urko 's men . Don 't kid yourself . He 's some kind of a local patrol , but they 're all Urko 's men . Don 't tell me your troubles . We 've got enough of our own . Rocks . There 's no end to them . The earth seems to keep breathing them up . How do you know ? I lifted half the rocks in Jackson County when I was a boy . You keep talking strange . There 's no such place . There was . It 's a bad field . But we need it . Every foot . It 'll get worse if you keep plowing like that . What ? Come here , I 'll show you . Look . Every time you plow up and down a hill the way you 're doing there whenever it rains it 's gonna wash off more of your topsoil and gullies are gonna start to form . And they 'll get deeper and deeper . And they steal your land , because you have to work around them . Playing in mud ? But if you 'd plow around the hill instead , like this : You see ? Then when it rains , the furrows hold the water . It won 't run off with your rich soil . And there are no gullies . See ? Look , Anto , it 's true ! It 's foolishness . Now , everyone knows that plowing down the hill gives the ox rest from plowing up it . Foolishness . Where did you learn this ? My family owned a farm when I was young . - We 'll plow around like he says . - Then he 'll plow around because I 'll have no part in it ! Don 't mind him . He 's worried about the bull-calf . Nothing else on his mind . - You lied , didn 't you ? - No , you 'll see . Take the ox ... About your family owning a farm . Only apes ever own farms . Then only the rich ones who have friends in the government . No . No ! No ! Stop ! - I order you to stop . - What 's your problem , boss ? That 's the wrong kind of fence . Show me some barbed wire and I 'll build a proper one . But right now this is the best I can do . Poles ! Set up and down . Stuck in the ground like these . You 'd knock yourself out putting up a stick fence like these . And then the first time old Bessie rubs against it , it falls in . Now you take a nice rail fence like this ... Locked tight . Bull strong . Last you a lifetime , and it 's pleasing on the eye . Fences never last long . They 're not supposed to . - That 's where you 're wrong . - I 'm not wrong . - I 'm in charge . - This kind of fence grows on you . And say you wanna move it . Polar wants it over there , say . All you do is take it apart and put it back . - Is that right ? - Would I lie to a nice ape like you ? I 've decided . - It 's a good job . - Thank you , boss . Back to work . Yeah . Who taught you to build a fence like that ? Abraham Lincoln . - I 'd like to meet him . - So would I , master . So would I. The point is , you let them get away . We could not follow them at night , sir . The clouds ... Virdon , Burke and that traitor , Galen . I suppose they can see through the clouds to the stars . - How long ? - Four days hard ride , sir . This is all farm country . Tenant farms ! - A few plantations . - Yes , sir . - They could steal horses . - It 's death for a human to ride a horse . Yes , I know that . Could you find your way back again ? Yes , but it will be slow . The weather is covering the stars again . Then the gods will guide us ! These humans are dangerous ! They stir up trouble . They think they 're as good as we are . Make an ox pitch hay into the barn ? Isn 't that enough to convince you he 's not right in the mind ? Wait ! Watch ! Okay . Ready . Work is meant to be work . And hay is meant to be pitched by the forkful . Drive the ox ahead . Go ahead . Ho , there . Ho . Oh , that 's good . That 's very , very good . It 's not bad for a guy who doesn 't have all his marbles . - Show me how to make the trick work . - Sure . It 's easy . Now , you saw ! That 's better than forking a whole load full of hay ? She must already eaten some hay that fell in here from that evil device . She 's dying . I know it . They 're a curse . I told you ! - He makes a strong argument . - How soon is she expected to calf ? Three weeks . In three weeks , I think . I think your calendar 's a little off . More like two or three days . - She 'll be off her feet for a while . - It 's a lie ! - Throw them out now or she will die ! - Your cow is not going to die , Anto . Look , we can 't leave here until Galen 's able to walk . By that time she 'll be a happy mother , and we 'll leave . No ! I 'm the eldest , the cow is in my charge ! Have we shown you anything evil yet ? Well , tell me , Polar . If we have , then send us away . The farm seems to profit from them . You can stay , but if anything happens to the cow as Anto fears your fate will be up to him . - What good is that ? Enough ! Then it will be too late . Maybe not . Where 's Anto ? I think he has some things to work out of his mind . Remus , I thought you were shelling corn for seed . I am . Burke should be doing it . Have a heart . We didn 't discuss coffee breaks , but it 's part of the deal . Remus will shell the corn . It 's the job of the youngest son to prepare the seed . Well , here . Always use the best ears for seed , not the smallest . Did you hear that ? The best ears are for feed and flour . The little ears are for seed . Oh . Oh , I see . Well , then I guess it 's the bad spirits that have been making the stalks in the field smaller every year ? - Virdon used to be farmer . - Not much of a farmer . Wasting big corn on seed . Well , tell me something , Remus . Do you expect to be big and strong like your father someday ? - Of course . - That 's because Polar is good seed . Now , if your father were small and weak then you wouldn 't grow big enough to handle a calf , let alone an ox . See , every year , if you use the biggest , best ears for seed then your crop will get bigger and bigger . It will . I promise you . You know , I can remember sitting around a fire , something like this with my own son and telling him the same thing . Chris . I wonder how he is . I wonder what ... ? Is something the matter ? Well they have feelings too . Just like us . Now you hush . Why are you so interested in runaway bonded humans ? You couldn 't afford to buy one . I just wondered if there was a reward for helping you find one or two . Reward ? Why ? Do you know where some are ? I thought you could tell me what they look like . All humans look alike . You know that . Maybe I 'd go hunting for them if it 'd pay enough to buy a new bull-calf . You farmers are all the same . You want to get paid for doing your duty ? There 's no reward . Now move on unless you want to be arrested for loitering around horses . The returning of slaves should be worth something . - Who was that ? - Some backcountry farmer . Thinks we ought to be giving a bounty on humans this year . He looked familiar . I 've seen him before in the past few days . Yes . Polar 's farm . He was looking for bounty , you say ? Perhaps Polar 's farm needs to be watched more closely . She 'll die . Then what 'll I do ? Wait for another heifer to freshen ? Another four years ? Virdon says she 'll be all right . He 's turned your mind with clever talk and tricks . This cow is dying from their curse . She started dying the day they walked in here with that human-lover , Galen ! I 'll have a talk with them . Galen can stand . I 've seen him . They 're staying so the cow will die , I tell you . Humans burn the flesh and eat it . You 've heard tell of that ! You say Galen can stand ? Not too much at one time . Mother says you 'll break open the wound . Oh , no . The pain has turned to itching now . That 's very good . Virdon and Burke will be surprised when I walk in . - Not quite yet . - Why ? Well ... I mean ... Well , I don 't quite understand you anyway . I mean , you must have come from a good family . Now you 're running with humans who have filled your mind with mad ideas . - They 're not mad ideas . And I can 't tell you any more , so you just stop asking . Why don 't you just let them go on ? Well , you see I can 't . That 's just a way of you asking the same question . Just like a female . I thought you might never notice . Well , you see ? What did I tell you ? It 's ... It kind of goes ... And then it 's one of these ... Virdon , tell them what you 're ... No , wait . I remember . It 's ... It 's our very own windymill . - Windmill . - Well , that 's what I said . - Isn 't it wonderful ? - What good is it ? This is the power unit to your irrigation system , Polar . I don 't understand . Well , when Virdon finishes with the wheel , it goes up there . The wind makes it turn and we pump the water out of the ground and out there onto that dry field . You see ? Making oxen lift hay that should be pitched . Conjuring up the wind to make water pour where it shouldn 't . It 's unnatural . No wonder the cow is dying ! Tell them . Anto says he 's seen your friend Galen stand . If this is so , you must go . It 's true . He can stand . They can 't go now . Not until they finish , so I can see it work . It 's not for you to say . The youngest has no say . I do have a say . I have a say . Anto 's only worried about a bull-calf . Wait till your time comes to worry . - Please ? - Stay ! Leave ! Stay ! Go ! My mistake was being a father . Do what you want . From now on , I just live here . That Anto is not one of my favorite apes . Yeah , he could be trouble . That mounted patrol was looking for escaped laborers but he didn 't look fussy about who he picked up . See ? The gods have been with us . We 've made excellent time . - Yes , sir . But the horses need rest . - We ride ! I stood for several minutes today without this . What 's the secret ? I thought we were friends . I wanted to surprise you . Well , lovable Anto is chomping at the bit to get us out of here . Apes do not chomp at bits . Oh , I 'm sorry . He 's anxious . Better . I think we 'd better accommodate him . He could turn us in . We should help out that cow . Give her Epsom salts and get this moving . If the calf isn 't a bull , then we could be in bigger trouble . If the cow dies , Anto is entitled to kill you . Glad he knows his rights . Just give me a couple more days . I 'm healing fast . See ? We could carry you again , Galen . But the minute we leave here , Urko 's gonna pick up our trail . If we could get ahold of some horses ... I take it this isn 't horse country . Only landed apes and police are allowed to have horses . Farmers have to walk or ride oxen or cows . Nice arrangement . Keep them poor and busy . Well , then , that 's it . We 're stuck . All right , we sit it out . See whether Galen here or that cow makes it first . I can hardly wait . I don 't mind being a peasant , as long as I have the conveniences of the rich . Well , even the rich don 't have showers in this world . But if you 're adding conveniences , maybe you can put in the hot water . How about a massage parlor , a sauna and a gym . Will that make you happy ? Yeah , for openers . It 's her time . The tolling of the bell . She 's dying . She 's dying . Trouble , doc ? - Lf I can remember what to do . - Try hard . I got a feeling we don 't want to lose this patient . Anto . Anto , look . Anto . Anto , now , look . Listen to me . Your cow is having a premature birth . She 's suffering because the calf is turned . Do you understand me ? Do you ? ! Anto ! You ! You 've done this ! Wait ! The cow is not dead ! You can 't claim a life yet ! Look , Anto , the cow doesn 't need to die . I can help . - The calf has got to be turned around . - Oh , no . You 've worked your last trick here . When she dies , you die . Anto , stop ! Come on in , you human-lover , and see what you 've done . Blame me , then . It 's my wound that brought us here . We 'll leave . We 'll all leave now ! I 'm packed and ready . I 'll tell you that . Anto , there 's nothing they can do . No one will leave until this is all over , one way or another . Toll the bell , Remus . It 's probably too late but toll the bell . Polar , talk sense to him ! I 'll commit a clipping penalty that 'll get us the 15 yards . - What are you saying ? - A five-legged race with Galen . No way . Our best bet is with the cow . Speak so I can understand . We 're close to being shish kebab . Let them find another doctor . Anto , there 's nothing they can do . You 're right . Because if they try anything , I will kill them . All of them ! Anto , I can help the cow live . I 've seen doctors do it a dozen times . No ! Do you want your cow to die ? ! The fate of the cow is in the hands of the oldest son . I have no say . Who says you have no say ? ! Those are words passed down for so long , we don 't know if they 're right ! Be still ! Don 't say that in front of the young ones ! No , I won 't be still . It 's Jillia and Remus that I 'm thinking of . Anto , listen . You 've seen the humans show us how to stop the hills from washing away . And you have seen them create cropland from dry fields . Please , Anto . You want that calf . And the bell asks that it be a bull . Let him help you . No . You won 't touch the cow . Give me a reading on the odds . You know what you 're doing ? No . But I know that cow will die if she doesn 't get help . Remus , do you trust me ? Just play along . I like the odds better your way . Get ready to operate , doc . All right , Anto . I 've got a knife . Drop the fork or your baby brother will never see your baby bull born ! - Anto , please , do what he says ! - You heard him . Drop the fork ! Anto ? ! Anto , do as he says ! If you want it to be a bull , ring the bell . You won 't get away . Because when this is over if I don 't kill you , the police will because I won 't lie to them again . Okay , sweetheart , I 'm gonna do my best for you . And I want you to do your best for me . Nice work , Remus . We make a heck of a team . Can I go watch ? You go watch . I get a little queasy in operating rooms . You can tell me all about it later . Not too much detail . Go ahead . You think he can do it ? Instruct a cow in the birthing of a calf ? Well , he 's made a needle that can see directions even on a cloudy night . Yes . I would think he could direct a baby calf into the world . What 's the score ? It 's worse than I thought . How bad is that ? It 's about twice as bad . Just a quiet little bar in Jersey City . Little bell over the door . Mounted patrol from some outpost . - Sir ! - I am Urko . Headquarters . Sir ! Your horses are lathered . For what reason ? Escaped bonded humans . Patrol here thinks he spotted one near here . - Standing under a stream of water . - How far ? - We 're almost there , sir . - We 're hunting two escaped humans and a defector . Enemies of the state . - Sir , I doubt if ... - lf there are doubts , I will have them after we have a look . - Yes , sir . - Lead the way . Anto , come have a look ! You hit a jackpot ! Twin bulls straight across ! When you said twice as bad ... - You 're a genius , Alan . - Thank you . I 'll never knock a farm boy again . Twins . Two bulls , Anto . That bell ringing really did the trick . Police ! Police ! All kinds of police ! Hide up there ! - Come on . Quick ! Outside ! - Anto , come on . - Polar ? ! - That 's Polar ! Why do you come riding through here ? You make enough thunder to shake the turnips from the ground ! Shut up , female ! You are hiding escaped bonded humans , Polar ! No ! That 's a lie ! He was here before . - Silence ! - He was standing under that thing . One of them was standing under there in a kind of rain . What 's funny ? You won 't laugh with Polar hanging on the end of a rope . It was me . He saw me . We 're a poor farm family . Would you deny us what little fun we can make for ourselves ? Now , look . See ? I make the family laugh . White . Like a human , see ? And then I walk around like a straight-necked goose . Like a human , see ? I 'll have some meat ! I 'll have some meat and cook it good ! See ? This is what he saw . My room . For taking my makeup off . Fool ! Search the barn . Eyes that deceive once can deceive twice . A clown , eh ? We 'll see . No humans here , sir . Two brand-new calves . They would have been eaten if there were humans around . Demote that patrol . He 's made fools of authority . Yes , sir . Idiot ! Virdon , I 'm sorry for how I acted to you in there . I just couldn 't believe . Thank you very much . Anto , I saw what you did out here and if I hadn 't seen it myself , I wouldn 't have believed that either . I 'd say we 're about even . Will you show me what to do in case someday when you 're not here ? Just ask me , Anto . I know . I watched the whole thing . I put some bread in there . Oh , thank you , Zantes . Be careful of your leg . I don 't want you to come back here laying around , for me to wait on . - Oh ? - Where will you go ? Well , we don 't really know . West always seemed like a good direction . Maybe we 'll try it again . Thank you , Virdon . I 'll never forget you . It 'll be a long time before I forget you too , Anto . I named the bulls . One Burke , the other Virdon . Hey . Well , just watch the heifers around the one named Burke . Bye . - Bye-bye . - Bye . So long . - What is this ? - A windmill . - Where did it come from ? - I made it . He 's a very bright boy . If you were bright , you 'd keep him working not building these toys to play in the wind . Next spring , we 'll plant that new field they made for us . Good , rich earth . And I 'll plant the best seed . Like Virdon said , huh ? Yes , we 'll try it . The best seed this time . If there 's no objection , we should go that way . Does it matter ? Everywhere we go there 's apes . Yeah . Some good some bad . Come on . Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH ]

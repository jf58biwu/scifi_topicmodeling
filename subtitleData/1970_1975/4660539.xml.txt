 Morning . Morning . - Morning . - Morning . - Morning , Sir . - Morning . - Morning . - Good morning . Morning , Colonel . All quiet on the Western Front ? - I 'll let you know . - Good . Yes , hello ! - That was security on the line . - And ? Enquiries on UFO report YP195 may be reopened now . - And ? - Will you handle it yourself ? Well , since I have no idea what UFO report YP195 is all about , I can 't answer the question . The last report was numbered 7,000 , so you have the advantage on me . This was 10 years ago . The main witness was hit by a car and has been in a coma ever since . That is , until this morning . - How is she ? - I don 't know . The hospital just said that she was conscious . Dr Jackson 's on his way there now . Colonel Johns was on that case . Would you like me to ask him to follow it through ? No . I 'll handle it . Get me Colonel Foster . Thank you . Commander . Dr Jackson , thanks for getting here so quickly . - Has she remembered anything yet ? - She hasn 't spoken yet . Shall I lead the way ? - How 's our security ? - Adequate . Doctor , medically speaking , is it safe for me to question her so soon ? Yes . It can only help . She 's been in limbo for the last ten years . We must get her mind active as quickly as possible . It 's very difficult in these cases . She could have total recall or remember only fragments . You see , as far as she 's concerned , the accident happened yesterday - and this is your best opportunity . - I see . OK . Thank you . Miss Fraser . Miss Fraser . Can you hear me ? There 's a gentleman here to ask you a few questions . - How is she ? - Much calmer now . She obviously remembers me as the man who was driving the car that knocked her down . Yes , but I explained that you were in no way responsible . - Does she accept that ? - In the main . But it 's up to you to gain her confidence . Shouldn 't we wait a few days , Doctor ? Well , she needs ... shock therapy . As I said , you can only help her . Have you told her she 's been in a coma for the past 10 years ? No , no . But when she finds out , she will need a friend . Her parents are both now dead . - She doesn 't know that either ? - No . She specifically asked us not to contact them . - Do you know why ? - No , but it 's really up to you . You 're her only link with the past . 'May I sit down ? ' I 'm sorry if I frightened you just now . Perhaps it will help if I explain things to you . My name is Ed Straker . I work for an organisation whose function it is to investigate all reports concerning unidentified flying objects . - You saw one ? - Yes . Would you like to tell me about it ? Take your time . Yesterday ... - Where did you see it ? - The farmhouse . I was on the roof of the farmhouse . Do you remember where this farmhouse was ... is , - Miss Fraser ? - No , I don 't know . How did you come to be there ? - We needed somewhere to sleep . - We ? Tim . - Who is Tim ? - I didn 't know him very well . We met at Piccadilly Circus . He 's dead ! - How did he die ? - He fell off the roof . - Do you live in London ? - No . - Why were you there ? - I ran away from home . - Why ? - To be by myself . - Where is that farm ? - I don 't know . - What is your name ? - Catherine Fraser . Do you feel like telling me about it ? I 'd run away from home because I was being stifled by my parents . I love them very much , but I just wanted to be by myself for a while . 'I was on the point of returning home . ' 'There was nowhere to go . ' 'I was just wandering through the crowd . ' 'Then I saw Tim . ' 'It was only yesterday . There must be something we can do . ' 'If only we hadn 't met , he might ... ' 'We chatted for a while and then we were asked to move on . ' Come on , love . What I meant was , why did you give up when you only had 2 years to go ? 2 years , 2 weeks ... Didn 't seem to make much difference . I just didn 't see the point any more . You could have had your own practice instead of just ... wasting your time . Look , when I was at the hospital , I assisted on a 15-hour operation on a little kid and he lived . That same night on television , I saw newsreel of men killing each other . Suddenly I lost the urge to become a doctor . - Tim , look ... - Look . Let 's drop it , OK ? - I mean , just enjoy the day . - OK . Sorry . - None of my business , anyway . - Hey , look ! So , I left home . Well , the old man kicked me out , actually . But I wanted to prove to him that I wasn 't just a layabout and do something I believed in . - That 's good . Did you ? - Yeah . I went on a peace march . Only got as far as Manchester . Started raining . Do you like the country ? - The country ? - Yeah . Fields and trees . - Yes , I suppose so . - Come on , then . 'He said he wanted to leave . Get out into the countryside . ' 'He knew a place . A farmhouse . ' 'If we hadn 't managed to get a lift , he 'd still ... ' 'I 'm sorry . ' 'As we walked to the farm , we were happy . ' 'How could I have possibly known what was going to happen ? ' What 's the matter ? I don 't know . I don 't mind the daylight , I just can 't take the night . I 've got some aspirin . Might help you to sleep . Aspirin ? You can 't spend the whole night walking around , can you ? You go to sleep . I 'll be all right . OK ? - What are they ? - Just something to ... - make me relax . - I don 't believe you . - They 're perfectly harmless . - What do they do ? Here . Try a couple . Look . It 's all right . They 're not addictive . Nothing . 'All those colours ! Everything 's changed ! 'It 's beautiful ! Beautiful ! ' 'Look at those colours ! ' 'It feels like I 'm floating ! ' 'Come on ! ' 'Where are we going ? ' 'Look ! For you ! For you ! 'There ! 'Come on , Tim . ' 'Where are we ? ' 'Hello ! Hello ! ' 'Even when we saw the spacemen , we 'd no idea , 'no sense of the danger we were in . ' 'What were they doing ? ' 'They were digging a sort of hole in the floor , 'burying something . - ' And there was this cylinder . ' - ' Cylinder ? ' 'Yes . Like a mechanism . 'Tim picked it up and then he threw it to me . ' 'And this device belonged to the aliens ? ' 'Yes , they wanted it back . They chased us . 'But to Tim and I it was just a fantastic game . 'We weren 't afraid of anything . Tim even encouraged them to join in . ' 'Come on ! ' 'Come on , Tim ! ' 'Come on . Hurry ! ' 'You can 't catch me . You can 't catch me ! ' 'They can 't . They can 't , Tim ! ' Come on ! Come on ! Follow ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! And then I lost consciousness . What was in the hole that they had dug ? - I don 't know . - Try and describe it to me . Well it was a sort of container , quite big . You could see through it . I had sections , colours . And what did you do with the piece that you took ? I had it when I left the farmhouse but I don 't know what I did with it . - ' Please , try . It 's important . ' - ' I don 't know . ' Sorry to have to ask you all these questions . You must be feeling ... No . It 's all right . Now , think very carefully before you answer this , Catherine . Where is that farm ? All I can tell you is that we walked for miles when the truck driver dropped us . I 'm sorry , I just have no idea . That 's all right . Don 't worry about it . Now tell me . What happened after you came to ? 'I must have been unconscious for a long time . 'When I woke up I was cold and frightened . 'It was morning . ' 'It all seemed like a horrible nightmare . ' I 'm sorry . I was so frightened . I can barely remember what he looked like . Just his name . Tim . Well , I think that 's enough for today . - May I come back tomorrow ? - Yes , of course . Try not to worry , Catherine . You 're in safe hands here . Oh , and if there 's anything you need , just ask Dr Jackson . Well , this dead case has come back to life with a vengeance . In a derelict farmhouse , the aliens have planted a bomb . - 10 years ago . - The girl doesn 't remember where ? - Right . - Why hasn 't the bomb exploded ? It seems the girl took away one of its vital parts . And lost it . We have to find that bomb . Paul , I want you to search every farm that existed between here and here . That 'll take weeks . The area 's built-up now . I know . The only alternative is that the girl remembers what she did with the part of the bomb she took away . That doesn 't seem likely . Sorry . Would you be kind enough to ask the doctor if he could come in here for a moment ? - I 'm sorry , I had to tell her . - You should have left it to me . Last night she asked for her parents . I had no choice . The poor kid . How did she take it ? Pretty hard , pretty hard . But she asked for you . 'I don 't know . ' 'You 're the only person I know in the world . ' Do you have any relatives apart from ... ? No . My parents weren 't young and I was an only child . - Friends ? School friends ? - None . Catherine , when all this is over ... You 're very kind . Thank you . The sooner it is over ... - Now , do you feel up to it ? - I 'm all right . Well , when the UFO left , I hid for a long time . I didn 't know what to do . 'Then I ran away from the farmhouse . ' 'I was so confused . I just had to get away . ' 'The next thing I remember is coming out of a field onto a road . ' 'Can you remember seeing a signpost ? ' 'No , I don 't think so . Oh - there was an orchard . ' 'Then I stopped a truck and got a lift . ' 'The driver was chatting about something , but I wasn 't really listening . ' 'I was still confused and frightened . ' 'Then he pulled the truck off the road . ' She just ran out in front of me . There was nothing I could do . Flying saucer ... took him . And that 's the last thing I remember . Do you think you still had that piece of mechanism then ? I feel almost sure ... I remember ... - No , I 'm sorry . - That 's all right . I 'll take you back . I don 't want to get into trouble with your doctor . - When are you coming again ? - Tomorrow . That 's the search in area 18 completed . Even with a full crew , it 'll still take the best part of 3 months . Then you 'll have to split your forces , Paul . Catherine thinks she had her part of the bomb when she left the farmhouse . Aren 't we making a mountain out of a molehill ? It was 10 years ago ! Do you remember Turkey in 1974 ? 80,000 people killed . An entire city destroyed ? - Yes , but that was an earthquake . - Was it ? A UFO was reported over the area a few hours before the quake struck . Our farmhouse incident occurred 3 days later . Put me through to search headquarters . Tim . - I thought you were dead . - Did you ? I 'm sorry I shocked you . I just don 't ... - It was all a dream . A bad trip . - You mean I imagined ... ? Everything . Oh , Tim . I 'm so glad to see you . - I 'm so glad you remembered me . - You 're real . Some of it was real . The farmhouse . The mechanism . I had that ... - Yes , what about the mechanism ? - Ed Straker wants it . Oh , I don 't know . I 'm so confused . Was that part of the dream ? - Where is it ? - What ? The mechanism . What did you do with it ? You can tell me , Catherine . I 've tried . I can 't remember . Tim , it wasn 't a dream . - You were dead . They dragged you ... - Shut up . When they took me on board , I was resuscitated . I have a task to complete . Where is that mechanism ? Where is that missing piece ? Tim ! The injection ... will make you tell me . You will tell me . Commander , you 'd better come to the hospital immediately . I 'm on my way ! I have to go to the hospital . I 'll call you from there . When the injection worked , I remembered every detail after I left the farm . 'I came to a hump-backed bridge over a canal . 'I still had the mechanism with me . - ' I threw it over the bridge . ' - ' Into the water ? ' 'No . There was a houseboat . It landed in the houseboat . ' 'And you told Tim all this ? ' 'Yes . I could barely remember his name . ' 'Tim . ' - How long ago did he leave ? - About an hour . Get me security . When I arrived , the owner had been dead for only a few minutes . The boy must have found the mechanism or it would have been there . God help us . Where are the maps ? - In the car . - Better get them . Catherine ... Catherine , I 'm sorry , but we must try again . This is where the accident happened . You ran into the road from here . Can you retrace your steps back to the farmhouse from that point ? - How long did you walk ? - Two , three , maybe five hours . I don 't know . This is no good . We 're still gonna be here when that bomb blows up and Britain splits in half ! It worked before . It 's our only chance . What is this drug , Doctor ? I don 't know . It wasn 't anything I 've seen before . - Would another injection harm her ? - The last one doubled her pulse rate . It 's no way near back to normal . I don 't know what would happen . - But you must use it . - I won 't take the responsibility . Paul , it could kill her . Look , thousands of people may die if we don 't try ! Use it ! Wait ! - Catherine , I want to explain ... - There 's no need . And then I turned left and ran for about four or five hundred yards , until I came to some fields . I cut across them . There was a water tower in the second one . Next I came to a public house called the King 's Arms . The farmhouse was only about less than a mile from the main road on the right . - It 's there . The farm 's still there . - How is she , Doctor ? All right , Paul . Let 's get to that farmhouse . Against the wall ! Wait , Paul ! God in heaven ! 4 liquids , held apart by separate compartments . The outer casing of the last piece is of a different substance , the detonator that would fracture the walls between the chemicals . They mix and ... goodbye , England . How is the detonator activated ? I have no idea . I can only suggest drilling through the outer casing - to extract one of the liquids . - Will that work ? If it doesn 't , there won 't be anybody around to say , " I told you so " . Rig the drill and we 'll need that green box . Good . Right . Look at that . That drill will go through beryllium steel and not a bloody scratch . There 's only one thing for it . I 'll have to remove it . - To where ? - The middle of the Atlantic . The tidal wave will destroy the coast of every country around . I am aware of that . There 'll have to be a mass evacuation . Space . We 'll dump it in space . Paul , get on to Colonel Branston . Get a radio-controlled space dumper down here immediately . All right , gentlemen , let 's start digging . Careful . Commander , it 's beginning to react . There we are , Commander . I don 't think you 'll need us any more , so we 'll leave you to it . - Thank you , Major . - All right . All in a day 's work . Good luck . Why don 't you go back with them ? I can take care of this . Thank you , Paul . I think I 'll stay here and see this through . But you go back and look after Catherine . Tell her ... Tell her I 'll be back as soon as I can . Of course . She ... Space dumper 24,000 miles from earth . Detonation time minus 10 seconds . 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 . - Commander ... - What 's wrong ? Is it Catherine ? Commander ! Commander . My God ! - Is that ... ? - Yes . It 's Catherine Fraser . But it can 't be . That drug ... ? The boy 's extra years had to come from somewhere . We can only assume they took them from Catherine when she was unconscious on the farm . But how ? How is it possible ? I don 't know and I 'm glad I don 't know . He lived 10 years . She 's ... They didn 't know how long it would take the boy to complete his task . He could have lived on borrowed time for another 50 years . - When did it happen ? - About 6 hours ago . About the same time the boy died . - Ed , if there 's anything I can ... - No , no .

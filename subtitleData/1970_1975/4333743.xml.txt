 THE PLANET OF THE APES 1x03 " THE TRAP " Subtitles by subXpacio . - Where 's Mema , Zako ? - Huh ? What 's keeping him ? Urko , I 'm sure he 'll be back as soon as he 's searched the city . It would be a good place for the fugitives to hide . When I ask you a question , don 't tell me something I already know . Yes , sir . Can you read it , Galen ? I 'm not sure . Uh-oh . I think we 've been spotted . Yes , we have . - Is he sending word to Urko ? - Hm-hmm . - How soon before Urko gets to us ? - An hour or so maybe . Unless he makes a mistake and takes the wrong road . Why don 't we suggest it to him ? - To Urko ? - Yeah . Guard ! Guard ! - What do you want ? - Oh , guard , please help me ! - Who are you ? - Nalick ! - Where are you from ? - I was - My horse ! It stumbled , and I was thrown ! Help me ! I 'll signal for help . Ha ! Well. that 's one gorilla that won 't be sending any signals for a while . I signaled we were heading south by the bend in the lower road , I think . Certainly can 't hang around here . Let 's go . - Where are you running ? - The earth ! We 'll be killed ! You will be killed by me . - The earth is shaking . - Ah , it stopped ! Urko , I know this territory . The earth shakes often . Many die ! Now , listen to me . Listen ! Somewhere out there - maybe not more than an hour away - so close I can almost touch ' em - are Virdon , Burke and Galen . Do you think I 'm gonna let them get away from me because the earth is shaking ? Is that your best trooper ? He 's my only one , but I 'll make him better . Did you feel the earth - - Where have you been ? - I 've ridden hard from the city . - Where are the fugitives ? - Urko , they 've been seen . Galen , Burke , Virdon ? Yes , close by , heading south . All towers are alerted . - Zako , did you hear that ? - Yes ! Hurry up ! Mount up ! This time they won 't get away . Well , we bought some time . I could sure use some rest . You 're not alone . I suggest the village of Numai . It 's about half an hour south . - Numai ? - No , it 's all right . The people there have a good reputation . They can be trusted . All right . Wheres that signal operator ? - Could he have followed them ? - Something 's wrong . He 'd never leave his post . Zako , you go and investigate . We 'll go west . When you have something to report , ride after us . - Hello , friend . - Is this the village of Numai ? Yes , it is . You seem tired . We are . I 'm Miller . This is my wife Mary , my son Jick . - Hi . - Hello there . Please , come in . Make yourselves comfortable . Running from Urko must be tiring work . What are you talking about ? An announcement was made a few days ago ... by one of Urko 's soldiers who came through here . Spoke of three fugitives : Two humans and a chimpanzee traveling together . Oh , that has nothing to do with us . You see , these two humans are my servants . If you wish . In any case . I 'll say that I 've not seen you . You were right . The operator was beaten and tied . Zako , you and Olum ride southwest . We 'll go southeast . Meet you at the road beyond the forest . Don 't be alarmed . Earth 's been shaking . Worst happened some time ago . - Not so bad now . - You had an earthquake . Three days ago , some distance from here . Drink ! No sign of them ! Aren 't we near the village of Numai ? Yeah , the road leads there . Why ? Numai has a reputation for harboring fugitives . Galen would know that . - Lisa , where have you been ? - Where did you go adventuring today ? I heard the earthquake was worse in the city , so I went to see . - You know better . - I was careful . - Where did you get this ? - In the city , I wove it myself . May I look at it ? - What is it ? - Electric wire . - Did you find anything else ? - Sure , Look . Does that mean something to you ? Yes , it 's some type of a computer relay unit . How far is the earthquake area from here ? About two hours . If we left right now . we 'd get there long before dark . Yes , but I must warn you it 's dangerous . You think we should take the chance to find where these came from ? Take a look at that , Pete . That 's part of a highly sophisticated system . We might be able to find some of the answers weve been looking for , Yeah , and a building might fall down on us . What then ? I think we should hide out in the hils to the north , Just turn our back on this ? Forget we ever saw it ? Yep . Well , it seems we have hit an impasse . What do you think , Galen ? I think an unanswered question is a very difficult thing to live with . There may be danger , but there 's no guarantee of safety anywhere , is there ? I think that if we left now , we could see that place . Then we 'd have enough time to get to the hills before Urko could catch us . Look over there . - You , old lady ! - Yes , sir ? We 're searching for three fugitives . Two men and a chimpanzee , they came this way . Please , I am old . I see very little . - My eyes are bad , - Do you see this ? Please ! I don 't want to hurt anyone . You 'll only hurt yourself if you don 't tell us the truth . - They 're not here ! - Get out of my way . I told you , they 're not here , I swear ! I don 't believe anything I hear in Numai . Urko , they 're not in there . - What is this ? - I-I don 't know . - Where did it come from ? - I found it . - Where ? - I don 't remember . - I 'm tired of these lies ! - Please , please ! Shes just a child , - I want to know where she found it ! - In the city ! The one called Virdon . He would want to investigate this . - Isn 't that right ? - Right . - He would go to the city ! - No ! They were afraid to go there . They went south . South ? Are you certain ? Yes ! He 's certain . Lies ! Lies ! Nothing but lies ! We go to the city . Urko , how did you know they were lying ? I always assume a human is lying . It makes things easier . I 'll remember that . It 's an aftershock . We 're pushin ' our luck . Pushing luck ? He 's getting to be a pessimist . Let 's spread out . see what we can find . Olam , circle around to the rear , ride quietly . Cut off any chance of escape . Zako , Mema , you move around to the side streets . I 'll go straight in as soon as they 're in position . You don 't really expect to find anything useful in this ruin , do you , Alan ? I suppose not . I was hoping that - Yeah , don 't tell anybody , but so was I. - Is it trouble ? - Run ! Urko ! Urko . Urko ! You kill me , you kill yourself ! . You hear me ? You kill me , you 're dead ! We 're trapped , Urko . You and me together , just the two of us . You understand ? We 're trapped ! Where are we ? What is this place ? A subway station . Subway station ? Yeah . Look , see - " B.A.R.T. - Bay Area Rapid Transit . " We 're in the San Francisco area . Urko , look , see , the entrance , it 's caved in . We have no choice . We have to work together to dig ourselves out . I don 't work with humans ! I don 't need humans ! You might need me . I come from the time when this was built . I know things about this place that could help us . Look , do you know what that is ? It 's a railroad car . It used to carry people , humans , underground on rails . Its power source was nuclear energy . Nuclear energy , you know , atomic power . Oh , never mind . You 're lying ! You know nothing of this place . Why would anyone want to travel in a thing like this underground ? How could anyone travel underground ? It was a practical way of getting around in large cities . There was a great city above us before the holocaust . Holocaust ? What kind of word is that ? It 's what went wrong with my world while I was traveling in space . Your world ? I know there was something there before , but we were here too ! - It was our world ! - Okay , okay ! Look . It 's all right . It 's a simple question . Come on . Do you know where that light 's coming from , Urko ? No . Solar energy , Urko . Solar - from the sun . We took energy from the sun 's light , stored it in batteries . which provided electricity . Somewhere up there there 's a solar shield that 's still collecting energy , After all these years , some of the batteries are still working . There are certain things you don 't know that I do . Things you have to know to get out of here . You don 't need humans , huh ? Well , you need this human ! Have you seen Pete ? Oh , Alan , I , uh , uh ... I think he 's dead . Oh , God . I 'm sorry . What happened ? He was - He was roped to Urko . And the last time that the earth shook , a great big hole opened in the ground , and they both fell in it . And then , uh ... the side of this building ... wall collapsed and covered them up . - A hole opened in the ground ? - Mmm . - Then you 're not sure he 's dead ! - Hmm ? Show me where ! Mmm . Have you seen Urko ? No . Why would he leave his horse ? I don 't know . Stay here . I 'll take a look . Here . There . This is it . Do you think he could still be alive ? I don 't know . It 's possible . Even if we didn 't have these gorillas on our back , how would we get this up ? Mmm ! Mmm. mmm ! What more do I have to do to convince you that we need each other ? You need an example what apes and humans can do when they work together ? Come here . One of the more advanced forms of nutrition ... a meal in a pill . - A pill ? Yeah. a little thing , about like that . Swallow three a day , you don 't have to eat anything else . Surely you remember that . How could I remember that ? I wasn 't there . - I didn 't say I was there ! - Okay , okay , Urko . Come on . Now , organ replacement . You got something wrong with your liver , kidneys , heart . they give you a new one , instant health . There , uh , disposable clothing . You wear it , then you wash it down the drain . There , E.N.M. - electronic neurological monitor . You got something wrong with your head . you hook yourself up , calm yourself down . That 's something you could use , Urko , You talk as though you thought I was a fool . like I didn 't know as much as you , not as intelligent - All I 'm trying to do is prove my point so we can get to work ! - You need more proof , more convincing ? - Yes ! - Yes , I do ! - Okay , okay . Look , uh , how 'd you like to call home . check in with Zaius ? - What 're you talking about ? - This is a telephone . Men used to be able to talk to each other from thousand of miles away . How could that be ? They bounced their voices off of hardware floating around in the sky . That 's not possible . Men used to talk to each other anywhere from their own homes ! Show me ! I can 't . Nobody 'd answer . You can 't because it 's not true . It 's all lies ! You don 't know anymore about this than I do ! This place is evil ! Even the air is bad . I 'm tired of all this ! I 'll get out of here without you ! Urko , no ! Urko , no ! I lied , I lied ! Everything I said was true but it was yours , not ours ! - It belonged to the apes ! - Ours ? We were just playthings , pets . All this was ours ? - All this ? - Yes , yes , all yours . I lied , but you saw through me . We gotta stop this fighting , get back to work . or we 're never gonna get out of here . You 're lucky you finally decided to tell me the truth . Yes . - Enough . - Yes , yes . It 's not the place , definitely the air . I don 't know if it 's lack of oxygen or gas leaking . but if we don 't do something pretty soon , we 'll be dead in an hour or two . We 'll go to work . Yeah . Nothing . I saw the renegade , but I lost him . What 's become of Urko ? Urko may die ! I repeat , Urko may die ! That was one of the humans . Urko will die unless he has help , Where are you ? Only we can save Urko , You lie ! All humans lie ! I am an ape , I do not lie , Don 't believe them . Even if Urko is in trouble , why would they try to save him ? Why would you help Urko ? To help our friend , we must also help Urko , I don 't believe you . Will you make a truce to hear me out ? One-to-one , no weapons ? We 'll meet out in the open , There 's no way to trick you , You can 't lose anything , and you may save Urko 's life , I agree ! A truce ! Where is Urko ? Urko had a rope on my friend , the earth shook . Urko fell from his horse . The ground opened right there . Urko and my friend fell in , You 've been too much with humans . You lie like they do . I can see no opening in the ground , It 's covered up . The wall of the building fell down . If we work together , perhaps we can save Urko and my friend . I don 't believe you . Galen , duck ! Hey , I agreed to a truce ! Now lay your guns down and move away . I want no more disobedience until I hear what they have to say . I promise you it 's safe for you to come out now . Now , tell me why I should believe you . Because I saw it happen . Urko is too clever to be pulled into a hole in the ground . Maybe we can prove it . What 're you doing ? This steel girder will carry sound . If they 're still alive , maybe they 'll hear it . There 's no way we 're gonna be able to clear out that entrance , - We 'd do better to dislodge whatever covered up the hole . What was that ? K - E. B-U-R ... K - E. They know we 're here ! Help me find a piece of metal so I can answer Virdon . What are you talking about ? Later , later ! We gotta find a piece of metal ! Now ! Don 't make me angry at you . - Virdon is spelling my name in code . - Code ? Sound signals like your light signals . If we don 't answer , they 'll think we 're dead . They 'll leave us here ! Hurry ! - This is foolish . Why - - Quiet ! Listen . - It 's Pete . He 's alive . - Is he hurt ? - He 's okay . - Urko ! What about Urko ? He 's okay . Urko 's okay too . - You 're lying ! - What ? - Urko is dead . - What 're you talking about ? Your friend killed him . Take them away ! Are you crazy ? All humans are liars . You 're not to be trusted . Who taught you that ? Urko . Urko is my commander . - And I suppose he 's always right ? - Yes , Does Urko have a wife ? Do you know what her name is ? Yes . - What 's your wife 's name ? - What ? - Her name . - What ? My wife ? Elta . Elta . Elta ! Urko 's wife 's name is Elta , right ? How did you know ? Because Urko just told Burke which proves they 're alive . Now tell them to put down their rifles . Help us clear this stuff away ! Do what he says . The air down there 's going . We gotta move fast . They 're trying up there . Let 's see what we can do down here . We get some of these beams together . then I 'll show you a little bit of basic engineering ... that I learned , uh , from your forefathers . Urko . If we can get some wire together . we can build some kind of a ladder . make us able to work up high . reach the hole . - All right ? - Good . All right . Come on . Let 's get going . Huh ? Come on , Urko . What you 're doing is human labor . I 'm not someone who does human labor . Are you someone who enjoys suffocating ? I 'll make an exception in this case . The only way we 'll move that is with the horses and ropes . - Yes , with horses and ropes . - That 's a good idea . - We can use this girder as a fulcrum . - A fulcrum ? A way to get the most out of the energy we use . Get your horses and ropes . Stay where you are ! I give the orders here ! Then give them . You get the ropes . and you get the horses . And you get the fulcrum . All right , but there 's a condition . - A condition ? - Yes . - I want your word we 'll be set free . - Impossible ! It is not impossible . All you have to do is give your word . - I won 't barter with you ! - You have to , you need us , Need you ? I 'm using you . There 's a difference . All right , then you set the rig and finish the job without us , Ah , you 're bluffing , You won 't let your friend die , If we go back as prisoners , it 's the same as being dead . I can 't give my word . Urko is my commander . Urko is down there ! Urko is running out of time and air ! Without Burke 's help , without our help , he will be a dead commander . Now , do you want to risk that ? You have my word . Good . Now let 's get to work . Good . Okay . Urko , I think we need one more beam here ... to use as a brace . Would you mind getting it for me , please ? All right , human . Thank you , Urko . I 'll rig up a work light so we can see in that hole . Atta boy . What 's the matter ? I don 't know why this thing is so heavy . Yeah , we 're running out of air fast . You all right ? I 'm all right . You ready to try again ? Yes , I 'm ready . All right , I 'm tied off . Are the horses ready ? - Are the horses ready ? - Ready ! Move the horses forward ... slowly . Move the horses slowly . Hold it , hold it ! - All right , it 's coming . Easy . - Easy ! - Take it slow , - Take it slow ! - All right , it 's coming . Easy . - Easy ! - Easy , slow . - Easy , slow , slow . - Hold it right there ! - Hold it right there ! Urko , you hear something ? Look ! - Pete , Pete ! - Yeah , here , below you ! - How 's it look ? - Okay . Can you hold it there ? - I think so . - Hold it there ! Pete , I 'm throwing you down a line . Let 's drop this thing . Urko , you go first . Human , you 're not leaving here . What do you mean ? What 're you talking about ? This picture . I saw the poster on the wall . What 's the problem down there ? - Can you see the line ? - Yeah , we see it . Just hold on . I don 't suppose my word would satisfy you , would it ? That I wouldn 't say anything ? The word of a human . How many times have you lied to me today ? You couldn 't risk my telling anyone , could you , Urko ? You couldn 't risk having your friends know the truth . That your ancestors were the lowest species , Urko . That it was the humans who built a civilization ... beyond your understanding . You all right down there ? Yeah , just fine ! We need some more rope ! They need more slack . Okay , pull him up ! What 's the matter with Urko ? Don 't worry about him , He 'll be okay , Okay , untie him . Hurry ! - Pete , hold on . - Hurry . All right , here it comes . Okay ! All right . All right , together . - You okay , Pete ? - I think so . All right , it 's all clear . Kill them ! I said kill them ! Get your rifles and shoot them ! No , Urko , you can 't kill them , I gave them my word . No - Your word ? On what ? He promised if we got you out , if we helped save you , you would set us free . They are fugitives , prisoners . Shoot them ! - We made a bargain . - No bargains with humans ! You 're worth nothing ! Urko , it 's not our policy ... to kill prisoners . What happened down there ? You don 't understand . Trust me . I have my reasons , believe me . Kill them , Kill them ! Kill the - Urko ! Put him on a horse ! Get him to a doctor ! - But he gave us an order . - I 'm giving an order ! Take him away ! Give me that ! I will take care of the execution . Hurry ! - Go ! - Hmm ? Go ! You are enemies of the state . but I gave my word . Go before I change my mind . All clear ? Nothing around . Good . We can stop and rest a while . Mmm . Not again . That wasn 't much . It was sort of one for the road to remind us . I don 't want to be reminded . When Pete fell down that hole with Urko . I - I thought - Well , you know what I thought . Alan , the gorilla who let us go . the one who didn 't shoot us . how come he disobeyed Urko ? Let me answer that , You wouldn 't obey an order that you knew was wrong , would you ? - I guess not . - Oh . You don 't think that you are any better than a gorilla , do you ? Subtitles subXpacio

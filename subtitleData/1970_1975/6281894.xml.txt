 Now , what about food ? Normal intake has continued for over a week now . Good . Good . Any new signs of rejection ? Absolutely none . The patch of pneumonia has completely cleared up . What about his blood pressure ? It was a little off yesterday , but today it seems to be completely level . Oh , excellent . Excellent . Any adverse or abnormal symptoms ? Couldn 't be better . The transplant is a complete success . Excellent . Donald , you were right . He does look fantastic . We complete the balance of the tests now . Tomorrow , we 'll remove the original head . You see ? It knows me . Doctor , I wouldn 't get too close if I were you . Don 't be absurd , Donald . He trusts me ... And he needs me . After all , we understand one another . I am the genius that has given him a new life . And he , in return , will help me keep mine . And he , in return , will help me keep mine . Arterial clamp , please . A little more perfusion . Ladies and gentlemen , this is one of our 3 operating facilities . The kirshner transplant foundation is the only place in the world where such a massive operation can take place . Where such a massive operation can take place . Dr. Smith , in such a massive transplant , why don 't we see more blood ? That 's because at this moment , both the patient and the donor organs are hooked up to individual heart-lung machines . They control the blood flow through those plastic tubes . Is that Dr. kirshner on the platform ? Yes . Dr. kirshner supervises the major transplant operations . Does he ever operate himself ? No , uh ... Not anymore . He developed a severe arthritic condition a year or so ago , and , well , it makes surgery quite difficult for him . It makes surgery quite difficult for him . Dr. Thomas , X-ray , please . Dr. Thomas , X-ray , please . Philip , walk me to the door , will you ? Sure , Max . I 'm leaving early today . Now , the only thing left on the schedule is a kidney transplant , right ? Right . I see no problems there , do you ? I don 't . Well , you and hersch take care of it , and I 'll see you in the morning . By the way , that was a pretty good job in there today , you and the team . Thank you . I didn 't think you 'd noticed . I said good . I didn 't say excellent . Are you all right now , doctor ? They 're getting worse . And more frequent . There must be something we can do . You know damn well I can 't take any drugs . I must keep my mind alert . I 'm sorry , Thomas , but it 's difficult . Come on , boy . Yes ... Come on . Gently . No sudden moves . Just gently . Just gently . Now , Thomas , move easily . Give him the injection . Quiet , boy . Attaboy . Easy , boy . Easy . Come on . All right , Thomas , now , move easy and stay calm . Behave normally and slowly and just ... Just as if you 're dealing with a child . You 're dealing with a child . I didn 't get him ! I didn 't get him ! Be quiet ! Don 't run around . Keep that cage steady ! Damn it , Donald ! Don 't just stand there ! Try him again . Get him from the other end ! Watch him , now ! Hold that cage down ! Hold it ! Donald , hold the cage down ! Hold it down ! I can 't ! Get around him ! Don 't let him get away ! Here , boy ! Look out ! He 's coming for you ! Oh , no ! I 'll get him . Get away from him ! Get away from him ! The tranquilizer gun , quickly ! Doctor , are you all right ? Forget about me ! Get him back . And get him back alive . I haven 't got much time . Move ! He can 't have gotten too far , could he ? Look at that . This monitor will discard organs that are malfunctioning beyond what the human eye can detect . Young man , you realize we operate here on a success average of 92 % ? Can your machine improve on that ? I 'm sorry to interrupt , Dr. kirshner . Dr. Williams has arrived . You asked me to let you know as soon as he got here . Show him in here , will you ? Dr. Williams ? I instructed the board to hire him without an interview . He 's done some interesting work on rejection prevention . Well , of course . I 've read about him . He 's excellent . This is Dr. Williams . Dr. Desmond . Pleasure meeting you . Phil Desmond , head of surgery . This is Jim franklyn . Hi . How are you ? Fine . And this is Dr. kirshner . Dr. kirshner , it 's a pleasure meeting you , sir , and I 'm very happy to be on your staff . Won 't you sit down ? Thank you . Dr. Williams ... Yes , sir ? How was the trip from Minneapolis ? Very pleasant , thank you . Uh ... Doctor ... Since originally hiring you , uh ... Certain situations which we were depending upon haven 't arisen . Due to budgetary setbacks , we find that we are unable to use your services . But we signed a contract , and I 've already given up my position in Minneapolis . Miss Davis ... Check the terms of his contract . It 's for a 6-month trial period at 500 per week . The board was most generous . I 've been a physician for over 5 years . I was making much more than that in Minneapolis . Oh , come now , Dr. Williams . I didn 't mean that at all . What I meant was , it 's just that here we pay our lab men much less . I 'm much more than a lab man , sir . I 'm a doctor . Let 's not bargain , doctor . What is it you want ? What I wanted was to work with Maxwell kirshner , one of the foremost transplant specialists in the world . Why is it you people always put yourself in a position where you ... Where you don 't fit ? But , Max , that 's not necessary . Why is it all of a sudden that , uh ... I don 't fit ? I 'll get some coffee , and we 'll look at this thing some other time . Yes , why don 't you do that ? Yes , uh , I 'll do that . Yes , uh , I 'll do that . Why don 't we stop playing around , doctor ? Things might be different if I were white , right ? Let 's put it this way ... This ismyhospital . I run itmyway . I hire whom I please ... And I don 't wish to hire you . Oh , no . Let 's put it this way ... We have a legal and binding contract , and I intend to see you follow it to the letter . And I intend to see you follow it to the letter . All right , doctor , you 'll have your 6 months . But that will be it ! Report to Dr. hersch for scheduling . Thank you . 6 months will be long enough . I 'll watch you , and I 'll learn . That 's what I came here for . And when I 've learned what you know , I 'll fit myself in somewhere else . Max , that wasn 't necessary . What is or what is not necessary in this hospital is my affair . As you know , I never allow colored people on my personal staff . I just got carried away by superficial accomplishments before interviewing the man . Whether he 's black or not , he 's an excellent doctor . Philip , do me a favor , will you ? Cover for me today . I have some important things to do at home . I don 't believe it . Yeah , I know . Call Dr. Desmond . Tell him it 's urgent . I want to see him here immediately . Max , what is it ? Hello , Philip . What 's the problem ? My condition is terminal chest cancer . Prognosis ... I have 2 or 3 weeks to live , at the most . Why didn 't you tell me this ? There was no point in telling you . You couldn 't do anything about it , anyway . Well , in your own case , I doubt if you 're the best judge . Let 's get you to the hospital and start working . Donald ... Show him the x-rays . That was taken over 3 months ago . As you can see , the condition was inoperable at that time . Progression has gone past the lungs and into the pleural cavity and the rib cage . Organ transplanting would be futile . Afraid I 'll have to agree with you . Is there anything I can do to make it easier ? Yes , there is . Donald , show him . That is not the gorilla 's original head . He 's heavily sedated now . But we have achieved 100 % total spinal alignment on the newly transplanted head . On the newly transplanted head . It 's impossible . Is it ? Heart , lungs , kidneys , arms , legs ... Everything is functioning properly . Look at this . Top one . I kept the original body and the transplanted head alive on 2 separate heart-lung machines . Well , what do you think ? Absolutely amazing . Exactly . Total spinal alignment achieved by using matching electric currents attached to the nerve endings . I left the 2 heads together for 28 days , until the new one was strong enough to take over . The removal operation was really quite simple . I did it myself . Alone ... In 35 minutes . This could revolutionize the whole profession . I 'll get a paper on it right away . No , no , no , no . We 've got to go much further . That 's why I need your help . What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about science , about genius . Genius must be prolonged . Philip , I want to transplant my head on a healthy body . Well ? Well ? I don 't know . Whatdon 't you know ? It hasn 't been proven . Then we 'll prove it now . My genius must be allowed to continue . Philip , I have nothing , absolutely nothing to lose . There 's no other way for me to live . I guess there isn 't . Of course , we 'll need a donor , perhaps someone with an inoperable brain condition , with a body that cannot be saved , but it 's healthy enough to withstand the operation until we can remove the other head . That won 't be easy , Max . Such a patient only comes along once in a great while . Perform the operation here , in secret . The fewer people who know about this , the less our chance of trouble with public opinion . Philip , you 've gotto help me . Well , as you said , Max , you have absolutely nothing to lose . You have absolutely nothing to lose . No , no . His brain must be totally inoperable . Kirshner institute . That 's correct . A cancer patient is out of the question . What type of patient is it ? Blood type ? I 'm sorry . That doesn 't match up . Kirshner institute . The patient must be able to sustain life for at least 30 to 40 days . Kirshner institute . May I help you ? No.The body has to be functioning properly . No . I 'm sorry . Now , what does the patient have ? Kirshner institute . No good , Patricia . We 've had 2 possibilities in the last 4 weeks , and neither matched up . Oh , I 'm sorry , but a cancer patient is out of the question . Kirshner institute . May I help you ? Yes ? Oh , fine . Bring him in . Hey , Phil , it 's been a long time . Mitch . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . Anytime . Grab a chair . Thank you . Since I talked to you yesterday , I 've come up with a few answers . Oh ? Can you help us ? You said it was urgent , so I pulled a few strings for you , and I talked to the governor , and I talked to the Attorney General , and , uh ... Here 's the deal . First , we can 't let any of this leak to the press . We 're already having enough trouble with these executions without adding fuel to the fire . You 've got it . Next , the convict must be under total police security at all times , and proof of his subsequent death must be certified by a state physician . Of course , we 're assuming some things . We 're assuming that someone on death row will decide to donate his body to science rather than go to the chair . Well , we can only hope . Tell me something ... Just off the record ... What 's this experiment about ? Transplant , Mitch . Just another transplant . Men , listen up . We have a message from the warden . We have a message from the warden . This is an offer from the office of the lieutenant governor . " To all men presently on death row . " We are hereby offering one of you the opportunity " of donating your body to science " rather than undergo your present sentence " of death by electrocution . " While the resulting scientific experiment will , " after a period of 30 days , also result in your death , " you will at least have the personal satisfaction " that your life has aided humanity and the scientific world . " And the scientific world . " Only 60 millimeters of Mercury . What do you think ? Well , if it weren 't for our life support systems , he 'd be dead now . As it is , I don 't know , uh ... One day , 4 at the most . I don 't think he 'll regain consciousness , which means that we 're going to have to find our donor immediately . That we 're going to have to find our donor immediately . ♪ ♪ Here am I ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Take my hand ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Take my hand ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ If I trip , if I fall ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Won 't you help me stand ? ♪ All right , Jack .

Anything you say . Yeah , sure , sarge . Anything you say . Philip . Max . Max , I 'm here . Max , listen to me . We did it . We transplanted your head . We did it , Max . And everything is checking out properly . Max , it 's going to work . I knew it would . By god , I knew it would . I can feel it . I can breathe with it . I can feel my hand . I ... I think I 'm moving it . Am I moving it ? Yes , it 's moving , Max . It feels so strong ... So magnificent . Fantastically , beautifully strong . I think I 'm lifting my left arm . I think I 'm lifting my left arm . Iamlifting it . I know I am . Max , we had to make a last-minute decision . We had no choice . Is this some kind of a joke ? You were in a terminal coma . We had nowhere else to turn . It was our only chance . If it wasn 't for him , you wouldn 't have made it . You wouldn 't have made it . Let me see him . There was nothing else we could do . Is that a fact ? You wouldn 't have lived on the life support systems for more than one more day . Is that a fact ? Is that a fact ? Breakfast will be along in a few minutes . Mm , thank you , nurse . Mm , thank you , nurse . Hey , Sam , wake up . It 's breakfast time . Take your hands off me ! Take your hands off me ! What happened ? What have you guys done to me ? I 'm talkin ' to you , man . What have you guys done ? Shut up . Where 's the rest of you ? We are joined together temporarily . What do you mean ? They 've transplanted my head onto your body . And will you shut up and get some rest ? We need our rest . We ? What do you mean , we ? I told you guys I was innocent . I just needed a little time . Why 'd you guys do this to me ? Why 'd you do this to me ? ! Easy , easy ! Take it easy , moss . Let me go ! Let me go ! Help ! Help ! Hold it . I 'll take care of this . Help ! Let me go ! Oh , my god ! Let me go !

I couldn 't move the left arm . He was controlling it . I couldn 't move it . Takes time , Max . You know that . Your head won 't begin to take control of that body ... For 10 to 14 days . How am I going to ... Ever control him ? He might do it again . He could ... He could kill me . No , no . No . He won 't . We 'll keep his head locally sedated until then . When he was out , you only had minor control . Do you understand that ? Yes . Now , I 'm gonna give you something to make you relax . Uh ! Philip . Philip , I can feel that . I can feel it . I can feel it . I can feel it . It 's all right , Max . You 're gonna make it . Dr. Williams , I 've been looking for you . Dr. Desmond has asked that you meet with him , at Dr. kirshner 's , as soon as possible . And here 's the address . Are you sure he asked for me ? Specifically . Thank you . Thank you . Dr. Desmond . Over there . Thank you . Oh , Dr. Williams . Uh , we 'll talk about this later . Right . Doctor , I 'm sorry I haven 't had a chance to talk to you since you started at the hospital . It 's really not necessary . Well , yes , it is . I want to apologize . I mean , for Dr. kirshner . See , he 's not had an easy life . Even his childhood was ... Well , I can certainly sympathize with people who have had a difficultchildhood . Let me put it another way . It 's possible we may be making medical history right here . We 'll know in a week or so . We 've performed a massive transplant . We 're expecting severe rejection problems . Quite honestly , I could use your help . Why me ? Because of your anti-rejection techniques . They could come in handy . Could mean the difference between success and failure . You 've got the best people from the hospital here . Now , why me ? And especially here . Doctor , I understand your problem . But did you ever stop to think that my views may not be the same as Dr. kirshner 's ? Now , we 're testing 24 hours a day . You 're a good doctor and an excellent lab man . I need your help . Will you help me ? Yes , doctor . I 'll do everything I can to help . Thank you . Now , I can 't divulge the full nature of the operation as yet . You 'll have enough information to do your job . I want you to go home , get some things . The entire staff is living here . Dr. hersch will assign you a room . Thank you . Thankyou . We have a patch of pneumonia . That extra decadron is giving us one hell of a problem . The body just can 't fight infection with it . Cut down the dosage of barbital to the black head . He 's too far under . We need all the help we can get from him . Right , doctor . Right away . Right , doctor . Right away . You 've been working for 16 hours . Would you like me to get you a relief ? Oh , no , thank you , nurse . I 'll be all right . Thanks anyway . How 's the lymph count ? It 's better , much better . In fact , it 's falling slowly . Good . We 're gonna make it . Ok . So , uh ... When do us here on the outside really get to know what 's going on in there ? It won 't be long now . How are we doing ? Well , the pneumonia 's finally stable . No improvement , but , at least , he 's no worse . Philip , I think we may have a chance . You 're late for the injection , nurse . I was about to look for you . Now get going . Sorry , doctor . I 'll get right to it . Oh ! That the hell is the matter with you , moss ? Get back to bed . You jive . Holy shit ! Aagh ! Uhh ! Are you crazy ? You 'll never get outta here . That 's what you think . Just take it easy , lady . I 'm not gonna hurt you . Run , you idiot ! Get help ! Help ! Help ! Shut up . Hold it , everybody ! Hold it right there . Will somebody do something ! Now , I don 't wanna hurt nobody , but I will if I have to . But I will if I have to . You , soul brother , you got a car ? Yeah . Why ? You 're now the chauffeur . Let 's go . But my keys are in my coat in the closet . Well , let 's get ' em . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! And the rest of you folks , you just stay inside till we 're gone and nobody 's gonna get hurt . And nobody 's gonna get hurt . Get in the car ! You drive . Get in the car ! You drive . Jack , come with me . Call the police . We 'll keep track of them . Come on , Jack ! Come on , Jack ! Williams , stop this car immediately ! By helping him , you 're making yourself an accomplice . Why don 't you shut up ! Hey , that 's telling him , man . I should have known your kind stick together . Your kind stick together . You a doctor ? Yeah . How good a doctor are you ? What do you mean by that ? You done an operation before on a patient that lived ? You done an operation before on a patient that lived ? So far , so good . Then how about you talking ol ' happy face off me here ? Williams , turn this car around immediately . Now ! If you don 't do it , then I get rid of him my way . Williams . That 'd be about as smart as you jumping out of this car . How is that ? I mean that if you kill him , you 'll kill yourself . The only way to eliminate his head and live is through surgery . Is through surgery . Ok . We 'll just have to figure out a way to do it right , then . To do it right , then . There they are . Thank god you 're slowing down . Well , we don 't want to catch them . We just want to keep them in sight . If we get into traffic , there may be a police car around somewhere . There may be a police car around somewhere . There 's a car following us . Step on the gas . I 'm doing the best I can on this road . You 're gonna get us all killed . There 's a police car up ahead of us . There 's the police . Hey ! Hey ! You looking for Jack moss ? You just passed him in a 1969 yellow Ford , about 10 seconds away . About 10 seconds away . They 're gonna be coming back soon . Hit the brakes . Oh , my god ! Move over ! You 're a passenger now . I 'm driving . I 'm driving . It 's them . They turned around . They 've turned around . I think we 'll let the police handle this . Man , this car 's a real dud . I don 't often use it to escape from the police . I don 't often use it to escape from the police . Police are gaining on us ... But they 're not gonna get us , man . I 'm gonna lose ' em . They 're shooting at us ! Stop this car , you black bastard ! Stop it ! Whatever you say , baby . Ha ! No way they gonna get me , man . This is 22 Charlie to headquarters . Over . Roger , 22 . This is headquarters . We are inoperative . Lost suspects vicinity Ridge route 4 and Compton place . Request assistance . What kind of assistance do you require , 22 ? Well , a tow truck would be nice . Well , are you gonna help me or not ? I told you , I haven 't decided yet . Listen , man . I know the jury , the d.A. , and the papers all say I 'm guilty , but big Jack knows the truth . Well , big Jack better stop this insanity and give himself up before we 're all killed . What 's this " we " stuff ? They 're not after you . They 're after me . So I 'll do the thinking . You said back there that you were innocent . I am . They all say that . Sure they do , but , in my case . It happens to be true . Heck , I didn 't know you guys were gonna do this to me . I figured I was gonna die anyway , so what the hell . They transplant something from my body makes a kid live , that 's good . But I had no idea you was gonna do this . Anyway , I 'm innocent , and I 'm gonna prove it . So , how about it ? I told you , I haven 't decided yet . You mean you 're actually considering helping this escaped murderer ? Murderer ? You 're the murderer , trying to cut off my head . That 's different . Funny how it becomes different when you 're talking about your own head . When you 're talking about your own head . What is it ? We obviously have a flat . You gonna stay with me , doc ? Do I have a choice ? Nope . At least not right now . Let 's go . This is 2-19 to headquarters . We 'll rest here till dark . Then we 'll make it over to my girl 's house . The police may be looking for you there . It 's cool , 'cause they don 't know where she live . 'Cause they don 't know where she live . May I have your attention , please , ground control . We 're going to move out across Ridge 4 . Please spread out . Follow us in a line , and we 'll see if we can help you spot him . Let 's go . What ? How 'd you wind up on death row ? Oh . A cop got killed with a gun I used to own a few years back . If you didn 't do it , didn 't you have an alibi ? Willie Thompson . Well , who 's that ? Crazy guy I used to know . Came knocking on my door a few days before I got picked up . He 'd pulled a job and the police had gotten a make on him . So ... He needed a place to hide out . It 's interesting how criminals always seek out other criminals . Man , I ain 't no criminal . Of course you 're not . Wait , hold on , doctor . Go ahead . Now , what happened then ? Well , the night the cop got killed , Willie and I stayed at my place . The next morning I went to the store to get some food , they arrested me . When Willie heard I 'd been picked up , he disappeared like a ghost , man . And neither you nor the police have been able to find him since , have you ? Nope . But we will . It 's just a matter of time . Psst ! Williams , I got a proposition for you . This transplant has made medical history . This transplant has made medical history . Now , we should work together . Just you and me . You and me ? Look , you work with me on this , and I 'll make it up to you . And I 'll make it up to you . Just you and me . We 'll take all the credit for what we 've done here . What about Dr. Desmond ? Philip ? Oh , he 's an excellent surgeon , but I see a more promising future with you . You actually feel that I could take credit for something with which I had very little to do ? I don 't understand you . The reason you don 't understand , doctor , is because you 're a bigot . A bigot of the highest caliber . And because of that , you have underestimated me and my intelligence . Maybe I said it badly . I appreciate your intelligence . But we 're expanding the operational facilities , with a much larger lab contingency , and I need a man like you to head that department . And I need a man like you to head that department . And in order to win all that great acclaim and prestige , all I have to do is help you cut off his head . All I have to do is help you cut off his head . This is chopper 2-9er-2 to ground control . Have lost suspect in the vicinity of hill 14 . Recommend you proceed immediately to this area . Recommend you proceed immediately to this area . We got to get out of here fast ! Let 's go . Hey , w-w-wait a minute , man . Uh ... uh ... Look , before I get killed , I 'll make a deal with you . You put that thing away , and I 'll stick with you , ok ? Deal . Let 's go . Ready ? You 're gonna get us all killed ! All right , let 's go ! Are you out of your mind ? I 'm the one that 'll get us out of here . Not this way you won 't ! Not this way you won 't ! You idiot ! I hope you know what you 're doing ! Hold on ! We 're gonna get fancy ! Yahoo ! This is chopper 2-9er-2 to car 7-4 . To car 7-4 . 7-4 . Suspect Jack moss is now on the saddleback race course , approximately 1 1 / 2 miles due south of your present roadblock position . We are returning to base and will advise unit control to surround the area . 10-4 . Will you please stop this infernal machine ! Oh , just shut up ! Oh , just shut up ! Harry , Sam , check the back of the house . Come on , will . I know , I know , Mitch . But it 's not as bad as it sounds . Look , Mitch , the police are here . Can I call you back when I find out some more information ? Yeah , my god , Phil . Do you have any conception of what this means ? We talked about secrecy and ... and public opinion . This is incredible ! Mitch , I understand , but we 're doing everything possible . It 's not as bad as it sounds . Phil , a murderer is on the loose because of my decision . The press is saying that you 've turned him into a two-headed monster . I 've committed political suicide ! And you say it 's not as bad as it sounds . Mitch , I 'll ... I 'll have to get back to you . It 's not as bad as it sounds . I 'll get you . We 'll never get through this alive ! This is Baker 22 . Head him off at the south end of the field . You black bastard . You black bastard . Oh , my god ! You ok , Harry ? I think I broke my arm . I told you to keep that seat belt fastened . Harry ... Stick your head out the window and see if any more is coming . Car 88 . Car 88 . I got him coming around circle pass . You come in from the other direction . 10-4 . We 've got him now . Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Who is it ? Who is it ? It 's me , baby , big Jack . It 's all right , honey . I 'm not going to hurt you . You get into more shit . You get into more shit . They were talking about this on the television , but I had no idea ... Are you all right ? I 'm fine . How about a kiss ? Honey ... Um ... I ... i know you don 't like to answer a lot of questions , but ... But how did that happen ? Oh , I 'll tell you about that later . This is Max . He 's a doctor . Nice to meet you . Well , does he talk ? Sure he does . Don 't touch me ! See ? Works every time . This is Fred . He 's a doctor , too . Hello . Honey , I was wondering , um ... Do you have two of anything else ? Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , this is dick whittington . At the top of the news tonight is certainly one of the most bizarre stories this reporter has ever heard . But it has been reported by several confirmed eyewitnesses that a two-headed monster has been seen . Police have issued an all-points bulletin . Police and state officials are also investigating the mysterious disappearance of condemned murderer Jack moss , who last month donated his body to medical science . How this situation came about is still not known . Earlier at his home this morning , we interviewed , or should I say , we attempted to interview Dr. Philip Desmond , the acting chief of the kirshner transplant foundation . And here is that interview . Dr. Desmond , what kind of an experiment was performed on Jack moss ? It was not an experiment , it was an operation . What can you tell us about the two-headed man ? No further comments . It was a transplant operation , wasn 't it , doctor ? Look , gentlemen , the foundation in a few days will issue a formal statement . Now , excuse me . Level with us , doctor . Have you created a monster ? Aw , come on , doc , give us a break . What are you trying to hide , anyway ? And as you can see , still no answers . But , this is known ... A two-headed man has been seen , and it is suspected that condemned murderer Jack moss is one of those two heads . Police have reported that their switchboards are jammed with calls from an alarmed and panicked public . And we 'll be right back after this important commercial message . After this important commercial message . You get some sleep , baby . I 'll wake you when dinner 's ready . Why don 't you stay here for a little while ? Oh , come on , honey , I got to start dinner . You don 't have to start now . Why don 't you do it later ? Come on , Jack , uh ... Is he bothering you ? I 'll cover his head with a pillow case . You must be joking . Is that all you people ever think about ? It 's no use , honey . Maybe when I get used to it . Maybe when I get used to it . Now youknow you got to go . So what 's gonna happen to Jack ? What about that other head ? I don 't know yet . Um ... Jack tells me that you 're trying to help him locate his witness . That 's right . His name is Willie Thompson . We tracked him down once in Nashville , but ... He took off before we could talk to him . You say " we . " Does that mean you have a detective agency on it ? Mm-hmm . Then you really believe that he 's innocent . Well , if I didn 't , would I spend all this time and money ? I don 't know . Look , Jack was railroaded because the cops didn 't have any other leads . The only crime Jack ever committed was letting Willie hide out at his place . The only problem is , that 's Jack 's story , too . Listen , it 's also Willie Thompson 's story . I talked to Willie before he took off , once he heard the cops had picked up Jack . He thought the cops were getting too close , so he said he was sorry he got Jack into trouble and took off . And when I told them that in court , they said it was hearsay . So what about you ? Why are you here ? Jack wants me to help him . Well , are you ? Well ... The more I hear , the more I think I will . That 's good . Because he certainly doesn 't deserve what he 's getting . What he 's getting . Come on . You can help me clean these Greens . Clean these Greens . Anyway ... I didn 't , uh , I didn 't kill nobody , and now I got a second chance to prove it . And you 're gonna get us both killed trying it . That 's great logic . Here , man , have some pork chop ... Oh , take it away . I can 't stand that garbage . What 's the matter , baby , don 't you dig soul food ? What have you got for dessert , watermelon ? What do y 'all think about having fried possum and chitterlings for supper tomorrow ? Yes , sir . Ha ! Anyway , doctor , you don 't have to worry about eatin ' , 'cause I 'm gonna take care of that . After all , it 's my stomach . And after supper , we can all sit around and sing spirituals . Could I have a cigarette ? Oh , sure , honey . Jack . Lila was telling me about Willie Thompson . Same think I told you , right ? Right . Seems like the court did give you a raw deal . Did give you a raw deal . Hey , man , don 't be smokin ' while I 'm eatin ' . Doc . How difficult would it be to remove Mr. personality from off of Jack 's back ? Without the team of surgeons and the proper facilities , absolutely impossible . Oh , come on , now , doctor . We both know better than that . What do you mean ? I mean that placing your head on Jack 's body must have been quite a task , but the removal process is quite different , isn 't it , doc ? In fact , one might consider it merely a basic amputation . You mean ... You mean you could cut him off of Jack 's back by yourself ? Yes , that 's right . Yes , that 's right . If there 's someplace where we can find the right drugs and ... Surgical equipment ... We could do it right here . And you 're gonna help me ? Yes . I think I will . Williams , if you cut off my head , that 'll be murder . But it 's ok for you to cut off my head , is that right ? Williams , I 'm warning you ... Listen , kirshner , I 've heard enough to convince me that this man is innocent ... And that you have no right to his body . Then you 're gonna help me ? Yes . Honey , can we borrow your car ? Why , you idiot ! You do this , you 'll be the same as he is ... A murderer ! Boys , boys , boys , don 't argue . It 's all settled . Dr. Max has got to go . Dr. Max has got to go . Hold it . Hold it . Do you think there are any guards in here ? How am I supposed to know ? Did you bring your gun with you ? Tsk . I left it at Lila 's . Are you sure you 've ever done anything like this before ? Not even in your apprenticeship ? Let 's go . This is it . Hey ! What 's goin ' on here ? Hey , what 's happenin ' ? Jack . He 's taking control of your body . Cut it out , man ! Cut it out , man ! Doctor , help me , doctor ! Help me ! Uhh ! Now ... Now it 's your turn . Oh , this is Dr. kirshner . May I speak to Dr. Desmond , please ? May I speak to Dr. Desmond , please ? Max , where are you ? Philip , can you talk ? Yes , Max , I can talk . Well , listen carefully . I haven 't got much time . I want you , Smith , and Patricia to prepare for the removal of the other head . Max , no , no , no . The place is crawling with police . They want moss dead . Now , you don 't stand a chance of getting in here . I see . All right . I 'll have to handle it myself . Max , listen to me ! All I 've done is listen . Now , this is basically a very simple operation . And I think I can do it myself . I 'll contact you when I 'm able . I 'll contact you when I 'm able . Abrasions , several broken arms , one broken leg , and numerous bruises and broken ribs . All of the officers involved appear to be in good health . The chase , which took place in a deserted field near the city of ackersfield , resulted in the total demolition of 14 police vehicles . We were able to interview lieutenant j.J. Hinesacker who led the chase . - I 'll get him ! - I 'll get the ... Thank you for those words of encouragement , lieutenant hinesacker . And now to our sports desk . Lila ? This is Dr. Williams . Kirshner has taken control of the body and has gotten away . There are only 2 places he could have gone , and I don 't think he 'll try the hospital . Can you borrow a car ? Ok . Pick me up on the corner of Washington and j as soon as possible . Ok ? All right . Philip , what is it ? I just talked to Max . I don 't know what 's going on , but I want to be able to operate within a moment 's notice . But we can 't work here . The police . I know . I know . Maybe they 'll catch him alive . In that case , we 'll be ready . Tell Dr. Smith to , uh , stand by . Now , you don 't want to do that , doctor . You 'd be killing an innocent man . Hello . Doctor ? You had better get over to Dr. kirshner 's house as soon as possible . He needs your help . Who is this ? Hello ? Philip ... Philip ... Philip ... Get me another body .

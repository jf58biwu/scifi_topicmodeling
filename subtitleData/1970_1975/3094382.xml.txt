 THE FANTASTIC PLANET She stopped moving . Now we can 't play with her any more . Careful ! It 's Mr. Sihn . Look , father . A female Om and her baby . Is she dead ? I 'm afraid so , Tiwa . Why does the baby make noise ? It 's either frightened or hungry . We can 't leave him . May I keep him ? Let me , father . I 'll take care of him . All right , Tiwa , we can 't let the animal die . He was the Great Master of the Traag people . He saved my life and took me into his home . Mother ! Mother ! See how cute the little Om is ! His mother 's dead . I want to keep him . He is very pretty , Tiwa . You disturbed your mother 's Meditation ! Make that animal behave or I 'll take it away ! Father , he got away . He needs a collar . Learn to use the Watch . Now put the animal down . It 's fun . Let me try . No so fast . The animal is delicate . You might hurt it . Did you name it ? Tiwa , like me . That 's not an Om 's name . Name it Frisky or Trusty . Watch him wiggle , the little devil ! I 'll name him Terr . I was forgotten ! A baby Om is nothing compared to Meditation ! A weird virtual . Traags devoted most of their time to it . It seemed to be chief concern . Oddly enough , the housing unit factory on our Uva at Goham ... has not met production levels . The machines show unusual wear ... This wear causes the delay . Master Taj , can you explain ? We don 't know yet . Meanwhile we 'll use machines from our reserve ... to meet the schedule . I don 't understand . The machines worked perfectly until now . Have you had similar problems on other Uvas ? Only machines from our space flight ... to planet Antax 4 have trouble completing their program . Master Sihn , our scientists ... explain this loss as a break in the sensory compensation system . Scientists also notice that animals brought from planet Terra ... have sovibon and rather high intelligence . I am not sure that is true . Obviously , the animal adapts rather well . But is that intelligence ? The little pet you stroke ... between Meditations may well ... surprise you some day . Films made in Terra show many traces of organized life . This ability to adapt , Master Kon may indicate advanced evolution . Oms have a much shorter life span that we . But we must not forget that they multiply much more rapidly . If the animal is intelligent , Master Sihn ... we have not yet noticed . What we do notice is the considerable damage ... caused by Oms on the Uvas of Jext and Telez . The numbers of tame Oms is easy to control . But wild Oms probably exist ... in much larger numbers than most of us realize . We de-om the enclaves ... of wild Oms every 3 cycles . But I wonder if ... that is often enough . Few weapons have a long-term effect . Drastic measures must be taken . New ways to fight them are being researched . I doubt if they will suffice . Go play somewhere else . I 'm very sorry . Imagination was so rich today too ... That Om is a pest ! Please , our children all love those animals . I grew up fast in that slow world . A Traag week was equal to one of my years . I was only a live plaything . I was sometimes rebellious . Tiwa loved me . Terr loves Tiwa ... Repeat ! Terr loves Tiwa ... Repeat ! Tiwa got her learning from a headphone . Its lessons cut directly into the brain ... engraved on the memory forever . " Our Planet Ygam has one satellite ... " the Fantastic Planet . It is uninhabited " and used for Meditation . " Ygam is divided into several Uvas . " Uvas Strop and Yot are natural and symmetrical . " Urtana , the largest Uva , is covered " with blue assonic blocks . " Its temperature range ... " is from 8 to 243 laics ... " making ripocal exploitation impossible ... " Our Uva , Goham , has a fepular inland sea ... " stabilizing the apenosh at about 20 laics . " Fixations bloc offset pontic rebation . " Er-shaped globes regulate pressure . " All Uvas under go a cycle of 3 seasons of unequal length . " The seasons of garus crystalization ... " An accident enabled me to acquire the Traags knowledge . " When the soil peels , intense vegetation ... " " replaces all nosks with similar nosks . " I liked the lessons . I tried to get the most out of them . " The cliffs on the fepular sea are eroded ... " by rains that often last long . " Tiwa , bring your animal ! Jurgal has his and we 'll have some fun . I don 't want him hurt . Jurgal 's animal is insane ! Once , he almost tore off his ears ! He won 't damage your Om . Come and play ! Come and see ! Let Terr fight , it will be more fun . Terr will win , he 's a real demon ! Now fight ! He sings well . Terr can sing too . Sing , Terr . Go on ! - He 'll strangle him ! - He doesn 't know what he 's doing . What a mean animal ! " It is simple to see a tark 's fladed muscles ... " because the animal 's easily skinned ... " Do you hear the Om ? That 's Tiwa 's lesson ! She loves Terr so much that he is with her always . Can he understand what he says ? I don 't think so . Anyway , I 'll forbid her to keep Terr during infos . She must study seriously . " The liscinian muscle of a trak 's leg ... " is a fleshy , fuliform vilok ... " The molog is an enviparous animal ... " It has more than half a billion lucons . " The entire surface of their walls ... " is made up of little cells ... " separated by leaves of thin organure . " " Some scientists ... " today believe it is not organure but only gambous amalga ... " an artificial structure ... " Have you got Terr again during you info ? I told you to stop ! Into the Omhouse ! But father , he doesn 't bother me ... And he 's so happy . The infos are for you ! Get back to work ! It was time for the Traag children to have their first Meditation ... The initiation ceremony was a major step ... on their road to knowledge . After a while I lost my intimacy with Tiwa . As she grew up , she gave up her playthings . Deprived of lessons , I decided to run away . Mother , I can 't find Terr . And my headphones are gone . Use your bracelet ! If he 's far away , it 'll hurt him . Put your bracelet on maximum , please . No , mother ... You 're pretty stupid . Like all tame Oms ! You have a collar too . It 's a fake , to fool the Traags . What 's that ? The Traags invented it . What ? The Traags made it . Listen ! " Valio , cycle , info 4 ... " You will observe that Aklon research ... " in solid pernetrope ... " works the same as in plane pernetrope . " Notice that we look for festation groups ... " Don 't worry , it 's not dangerous . Where are you taking it ? - I don 't know . - Come with me ! My new friend took me to her people who lived hidden in the Big Tree . deep in an abandoned park . As a silly tame Om , my first meeting with wild Oms was a failure . Don 't touch that case , it 's a trap ! Since I brought the headphones of knowledge ... the wizard opposed me at once ! We 've brought 5 cases , Chief . What ? Is that all ? One of them was a trap and Speed is dead . He knew it was a trap . He 's a tame Om . He ran away with a Traag device . It taught him to read Traag writing . He knows what 's in the cases ? In that one ? Color powder . " Urtana is covered with blue assonic blocks . " Its temperature range is from 8 to 243 laiks ... " making ripocal exploitation impossible . " Our Uva , Goham , has a fepular inland sea " stabilizing the apenosh at about 20 laiks . " Fixations blocks ... " offset ontic rebation . " Er-shaped globes regulate pressure ... " Why interrupt the info ? Traag knowledge is bad . We don 't need it . We are not tame Oms . It is great offense ! You must battle according to the Law . Bring the combat animals ! You win . Stay with us Oms of the Big Tree . You can be of use to us . Tomorrow we go on an expedition . It was my first expedition to steal Traag food . We brought a great deal back . Be brave , the Big Tree isn 't far . The Hollow-Bush bandits ! Look out ! Why attack us ? They 're from the Hollow Bush . Beware of them . They are thieves from the other side of the park . The Great Zarek 3000 cycles before Krowp ... " created the pyramidic civilization . " From his tomb - they say he still animates ... " the ball of Life . " Projectiles pierce him but he does not change . " His mind travels through Ygam 's skies ... " regularly ever since he led the Traags ... " to victory against the Jankos . " This may well be how Meditation originated . " Some believe that Zarek is immortal and ... " that from the flames of time he reappears in infinitely varied ... " whirling reality ... " to combat the Traags will to die . " Actually " driving out the Jankos made ... " the Traags develop a spirit of enterprise ... " The Oms are learning if only we had more headphones . You know as much as the Traags . I am barely learning to write . Look . Are you sure ? Did you read it right ? All the park walls read " de-om " ! What does it mean ? The Traags want to kill all the Oms ! Long ago ... I saw them de-om the park . It was horrible ! But now on our tree , there 's not much danger . What will we do ? - It had to come . - Anyway , we have time to prepare . We 'll post sentries . They 'll slaughter us ... to punish us for stealing knowledge . Let us pray to the Fantastic Planet . Sentries will warn us when they come . Tomorrow we shall see . What are you doing on our land ? I came to warn you . The Traags intend to de-om the park . De-om ! You don 't say ! How do you know ? One of us read it on the wall ! Can Big-Tree Oms read Traag writing now ? Don 't listen to him ! It 's a trap to get us out of the Hollow Bush ! Believe me , the Traags will de-om ! Take him away ! Someone go look at the walls ! Listen ! - Traags ! - Quiet ! I smell Oms here . That vermin ! The Masters should ... de-om more often ! It 's not bad to have pet Oms ... They 're fun . But all those wild Oms ... They steal . They 're dirty and multiply appallingly fast . Look ... A nest by the walk . See ... A whole colony . Let 's kill Them . Chief is dead . Stop weeping like children . We must go where the Traags can 't find us . I know a place , I 'll take you there . This road leads to an abandoned rocket dump . We 'll be safe there . I regret that we de-om only every 3 cycles ! This killing proves it is not enough ! A Traag murdered ! It 's unbelievable ! Are we so weak that Oms can kill us ... so easily ? Wild Oms are much more numerous than we thought . The body showed many ... bites and wounds , said Traag who managed to escape slaughter . Oms ' bites were very numerous . Every day wild Oms become bolder ! They multiply at a terrifying rate ! Master Sihn , it is disturbing to note that your Uva at Telez is not the only one that has been very difficult to de-om . Two other Uvas ... Goham and Urtana ... have had similar problems ... Near the murdered Traag we found ... two surprisingly well organized lairs . Most disturbing of all was ... that in one of the lairs ... cases were sorted according to contents . But they were unopened . How could the Oms know what they contained ? It is high time to take efficient measures ! I suggest we de-om twice a cycle . I also request strict regulation of breeding ... and selling of tame Oms . Too often they turn wild again ... and go join the throngs of Oms ... living in parks and other isolated areas . We must use the new , much-discussed de-om-ing devices at last . We must exterminate all wild Oms . And I ask you : Should we keep our tame Oms ? We are wrong to believe Oms are merely vicious animals . If we do , we may commit ... an error of serious consequences . Ygam had .. 3 seasons equal to ... 15 of our years . The Traag rocket graveyard was abandoned . There we built our city . We planned to go to the Fantastic Planet . Many tame and wild Oms came to join us . Knowledge acquired from the headphones ... enabled us to reduce ... Traag rockets ... to our size . " Trinur is a metal that palsifies Matwar " top-grade reculid gives it a remarkable metallic shine . " We have succeeded , Terr . Two rockets are for testing . We will start with those . - It 's only a matter of work and time . - We must hurry ! Om informers say ... that a large-scale de-om-ing is near ! They may know where we are . We must send up our two rockets at once ... to see if we can live on the Fantastic Planet . We cannot wait any longer ! Too bad . I can 't go with you . I 'm not afraid . I 'm sure you 'll succeed . I know you will build ... a new world where Oms can be happy ... far away from the Traags . The Fantastic Planet will be our planet ... a world for our children . You must go ! You must hurry ! You must ... We had discovered the secret of the Traags . The Spheres of Meditation there enabled Traags to meet ... beings from other galaxies and hold strange nuptial rites . This union gave them vital energy which they needed ... and enabled them to reproduce . We were afraid ... The statues feet might damage our rockets . We found the only weak point of the Traags . On Ygam , the de-om-ing was halted . Never have the Traags been in such great danger ! Our entire civilization is threatened ! The Oms are taking revenge . They have incredible scientific knowledge . They must be stopped ! It may be too late . Neither Oms nor Traags ... will profit from destruction . We must try to make peace . " Since the Sihn era , " the Traag civilization has undergone a remarkable evolution . " The Oms , instructed by our philosophy and ... " technology ... " now provide the Traags with ... " dynamics and a new way of thinking . Our planet now has two satellites , one natural and one artificial . " The natural one , the Fantastic Planet ... " is kept for Traag Meditation . " The artificial one was made by Oms . They named it Terr . " Oms live in huge cities on the various Uvas . "

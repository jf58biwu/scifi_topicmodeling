 [ Animal Whining Eerily ] [ Whining Continues ] Oh . [ Grunts ] Careful , Doc . [ Grunts ] Easy . I got it . I got it . I got it . [ Grunting ] Come on . Christ , he 's heavy . Yes , he is . [ Animal Whining Loudly ] Doesn 't sound like he wants to leave you , Doc . I 'm sure you 'll give it a good home . Oh , yeah . He 'll have it real easy . He 'll just lie around all day , you know . He 'll travel a little , get to meet a lot of interesting people . I kind of envy him sometimes . I really do . [ Whining Loudly ] [ Rattling Box ] Shut up in there ! [ Whining Subsides ] You got to learn some manners , before you and me are gonna get along . Ain 't that right , Doc ? It 'll settle down in time . [ Whining Loudly ] What time is it ? Well , it looks like day is about to pop in . I 'd say about 4 : 30 . There you are , Doc . That 's 800 bucks . Thank you . Aren 't you gonna count that ? I trust you . [ Chuckles ] Boy . Ain 't many people ever said that to me before , Doc . You 're a real gentleman , you know that ? And a genius besides . Yes , sir . You 're a real and a bona fide genius . - First one I ever met . - It 's rare to be appreciated for one 's failures . You mark my words , Doc . You 're gonna go down in history as a great man . As a great man , Doc . [ Whining ] I 'm gonna get this show on the road . See ya . Good-bye . [ Whining Continues ] [ Truck Door Shuts ] [ Engine Starts ] [ Engine Starts ] Here we have two of the most commonly confused snakes . Uh , that is , the snakes themselves are not confused , but we have a tendency to confuse them . [ Students Laughing ] Let me put that another way . Uh , the difference is , in the case of the poisonous coral , the red and yellow bands touch . Whereas , in the case of the non-poisonous king , the red and yellow bands are separated by black stripes . Now , a good way to remember that is the old folk saying .. " Red touch yellow , kill a fellow . " [ Laughing ] [ Period bell Rings ] And they 're off- - uh , with the exception of Miss Stewart . Dr. Daniels , I don 't want you to think- - Oh , but thinking comes naturally to me , Kitty . Just as , uh , apparently- - [ Giggles ] Red touch yellow , kill a what ? Kenneth Daniels , I 'm confused . Miss Stewart , you 'll have to excuse us , unless of course , you 've a good stomach for bloodletting . Pretty girl . Still up to your old vices . Shame on you . Here . No , thank you . Oh , you might as well . Neither one of us have very long to live , anyway . [ Laughs ] You might as well enjoy yourself . That 's been your attitude for 20 years . Ahhh . Now we 'll hear about the carefree grasshopper and the busy ant . No . Not my field . Oh , that 's right . You 're our ophiological expert , aren 't you ? The esteemed Dr. Stoner in his country laboratory ... cackling over his bubbling bottles and dripping serum . The theories I 've originated ... are now being considered by world medical opinion . Considered inconclusive . Now , let 's get to the point . Since I 'm chairman of the department , you 'd like me to recommend an extension of your research grant for another year . Isn 't that it ? Look , Ken , I am not some crackpot who has come in begging , hat in hand . I 've got 30 years in the field of venom research . I 've got seven books , 63 articles and monographs . Please , don 't haul out those thumb-worn and yellowed credentials . Please . Oh , I feel sorry for you , Carl . A first-rate mind ... gone to seed . Well- - Well , I suppose I have been a little bit out of it , lately . As you 've said , we haven 't got that long to live . Of course , I need that grant . I was hoping you might recommend ... some bright young student who 'd be willing to help me this summer . I thought you had someone working for you . I did have , but he left me on short notice . I 'm not exactly sure I want to place one of my students in your hands . Oh , come on , Ken . You 've ridden my ass enough today . I may be a little self-involved , but I 'm hardly Dr. Frankenstein . You are to me . You 've been a thorn in my side for 20 years . - I 'm sorry , Ken . - It 's not Ken . It 's Dr. Daniels , Dr. Stoner . If we can 't be friends . at least we ought to treat each other with proper accord . - Agreed . - Say it- - " Dr. Daniels . " Dr. Daniels . Well , [ Chuckles ] it 's about time I had a little respect from you , eh ? You have it ... . and my gratitude , if you 'll just recommend somebody to help me . Well , I suppose I could find it in the goodness of my heart . [ Clears Throat ] As a matter of fact , I think I know just the boy . You got Kitty in trouble . I don 't like that . Oh , come on , Steve . You know he didn 't mean to . If anybody gets a chick in trouble , it 's old Steve-O . Are you going to apologize to her or am I gonna have to make you do it ? I don 't think there 's anything to apologize for . - This says different . - What 's that , proof of Darwin 's theory ? - What the hell does that mean ? - It means natural selection . Survival of the fittest . Are you David ? Uh , yes . David Blake ? Yes . I 'm Dr. Stoner . The herpetologist ? The herpetologist , yes . I 'm into snakes . Uh , David . Excuse us . Lucky . [ Chattering ] [ David Chuckles ] I can 't believe that Dr. Daniels really recommended me for this job . Why do you say that ? Well , he 's just not my idea of a real teacher . Every time I ask him a question , he just says , " Why don 't you work on that little problem for yourself- - and please spare me the results of your efforts . " [ Chuckles ] That sounds like Daniels . In the future , let 's try to respect each other 's questions , see what happens . Incidentally , I don 't think wisdom will die with Dr. Daniels . - [ Hissing ] - Oh ! Oh . It 's all right , Harry . This is Harry , my obedient serpent . Hello , Harry . Wow . He 's a real beauty , isn 't he ? Red-tailed boa ? Yes . Wow . He 's hot . Hey , you 're thirsty , aren 't you boy ? Oh . I 've got a little something here for Harry . Here you go , boy . Can 't deny an old man his nip now and then . After all , in human terms , Harry 's almost 63 . I 'll just get some water for Harry . Hey . What gives , kid ? Oh , I was just helpin ' you out . Helping yourself , you mean ? Now , I am sorry about that , but maybe that 'll teach you to ask before you touch . [ Chuckling ] [ Hissing ] [ Harry Hissing ] Holy shit ! Help ! It 's all right . Don 't panic . Don 't panic . Get it off . Just get it off . Relax your arm , please . Well , just get it off of me . I will . David , could you give me a hand , please ? It 's his tail that 's caught so tight . Let go , Harry . Let go . What 's the matter with you people , anyway ? You crazy or somethin ' ? Carryin ' a snake around like that in a car ! Sorry , but that 'll teach you to ask before you touch . David , we 're home . Hi , Dad . I wasn 't expecting you back until tomorrow . Oh , a friend of mine gave me a ride , so I decided to save time and money . You know , you would be amazed at how much work babies are , even your sister 's . - I missed you . - Grandpa . Oh . Why , hello , Jeffrey . [ Giggles ] Oh , excuse me . Uh , this is my daughter , Kristina . - Kristina , this is David Blake . - Hi . Hi . David 's going to be my new assistant . Where 's Tim ? Tim left . He left ? Just like that ? Oh , an illness in the family . His father was seriously ill . Oh , he 's a handsome fellow . You know , I thought he told me his father was dead . His fath- - You 're right . It was Tim 's uncle . It 's a shame . The fear that most people have of snakes ... is based on the same misunderstanding ... that they have about any other minority group . If they 're told that one member is harmful , then they generalize and believe that they 're all dangerous . [ Chuckles ] It 's so stupid . For example , uh , the hognose is completely harmless . So much so , that he can 't even be induced to bite . Watch me . Watch my finger . See him get away ? See ? See him run away from my finger ? [ Chuckles ] Put your finger in there . Go ahead . Right up to his nose . He 's a consummate coward . [ Chuckling ] That 's enough . Let 's leave him alone . Uh , this is Sam . It 's Kristina 's turtle . He 's an albino from Malaysia . He 's a little peculiar . You 've , uh , probably noticed , David , all the tags in the laboratory . The color of the tag indicates the comparative degree of danger of the species . Now , a green tag means nonpoisonous . Ayellow tag means poisonous . [ Rattling ] but , uh , serum for all of these snakes along the wall here is easily obtained . Now , a red tag ... means highly venomous . Uh , serum is available for these species , but in most cases , it arrives too late for help . The , uh , Black Mamba , for example- - that 's him in the cup- - secretes enough poison in a single bite to kill 1 0 men . Oh ? Where does he come from ? Africa . This one was from the Congo . I see by the chart he 's hungry , or at least he ought to be . Uh- - Would you , uh , stand back , please ? Oh . He may appear to be a little shy at first , but ... [ Hissing ] he 's the fastest snake in the world . But I have him- - near the head too , where I need him . His , uh , venom is neurotoxic , inhibiting the breathing ... and affecting the vagus nerve that controls the heartbeat . The victim 's heart beats wildly ... and he usually succumbs within an hour to symptoms that appear very much like a heart attack . Would you hand me that feeding gun , please ? You know , uh , most snakes will not eat in captivity . This , uh , force-feeder contains a premeasured diet ... of , uh , milk , eggs , vitamin concentrates , liver , gelatin , bone meal and chicken blood . Chicken blood ? For flavor . Give it a little squeeze , please . Gently . That 's it . Now , we don 't want to give him indigestion . That 's enough . David , together , we 've just fed ... a very hungry Black Mamba . Excuse me . This room here is where we store venom ... and dry freeze it into crystals ... just like coffee . Then it 's blended and ground ... and , uh , shipped to pharmaceutical firms and research laboratories ... where it 's used as , uh , coagulants ... and , uh , pain relievers ... and in treatment of certain blood diseases . Bookkeeping . When I have the time , all of this , which I detest so much . [ Snarling ] You do all this by yourself ? No . Kristina helps me with the feeding and the paper work . And , of course , she runs the show on Sunday . It 's basically a family business . Well , Dr. Stoner , if there 's anything I can do to help- - I just hope you 're not afraid of needles . Immunization is an occupational necessity in our house . That hurts more than the bite of most snakes . What is it , some kind of antibiotic ? Not precisely . You can put your finger on that for a few minutes . It sure does sting . That 'll only last a few minutes , and you won 't even feel that during the booster shots . Booster shots ? Every few days for the next month or so , until you can sustain a full drop of raw venom . Oh . Wait a minute . What are you trying to do , kill me ? On the contrary . I 'm trying to make sure that nothing else does . Come here , David . The king cobra- - the most dangerous of all living creatures . It 's six years , and he still doesn 't like me . But why should he ? I 'm just a common human and ... he 's the king . The most cunning , the most vicious , the most insolent of all God 's creatures . [ Hissing ] It 's only Friday , Your Majesty . In two more days you 'll get your chance again . He 's not afraid of anything , is he ? [ Chuckles ] Nothing human . [ High-pitched Snarling ] You recognize the common mongoose ? Harmless , furry little animal- - except when he faces a cobra . [ Snarling Continues ] [ Hissing ] Are you religious , David ? Well , I 've- - I 've never really given it much thought . I 've given it a great deal of thought . You 've read , of course , that the serpent who tempted Eve was actually- - Oh , come on , Dad ! David doesn 't want to hear about all that right now . Kristina , I 'm not going to bore him with the whole Book of Genesis . The serpent who tempted Eve in the garden ... was actually Lucifer , the Devil , cast down on Earth in another form to do the Lord God 's work . Dr. Stoner , do you really think it was God 's work ? To tempt man with the fruit of knowledge ? What else would you call it ? Granted , we have misused that knowledge ... and brought man to the brink of extinction . Well , I don 't think man will ever become extinct . I think he has the will and the knowledge to find some way to survive . Do you really ? So do I. To evolve in order to survive . And I think we can help him . [ Huffs ] I don 't know if I 'll be much help to man tonight . Well , forget man . What about woman ? Who 's gonna help me wash the dishes ? I will . Oh . [ Exhales Deeply ] I feel so ... sleepy . I- - It 's the effect of the inoculation . You 'll sleep very soundly tonight , David- - and , perhaps , even through tomorrow . And if you 're lucky , you may experience what few persons have ever known and lived to recall . You see , the venom of the cobra ... is one of nature 's strongest hallucinogens . Kristina . Kristina . We 'd better help this boy to his room . [ Grunting . Breathing Heavily ] [ Hissing ] You 're asking me questions , Harry , and I hear you . But a scientist cannot afford the indulgence of guilt . And after all , if God doesn 't want me to continue , the means of my disposal ... are always at his command . A little more ? Come on . You 're gonna turn him into a alcoholic . Here . Drink thejuice . - Thank you . - Harry , don 't listen to him . He 's past it , isn 't he ? He 's going to be fine . [ Kristina ] Please , uh , don 't crowd up to the enclosure . There 's plenty of room for everyone to see . You can sit on your cars , or you can sit on your neighbor 's cars , but please do not crowd up to the enclosure . [ Car Horn Honking ] [ Kristina ] back off . Would you back off- - just about around in here is fine . Children , back off over in there . Ladies and gentlemen , you are about to witness ... one of the most dangerous demonstrations in the history of modern science . Dr. Carl Stoner , my father , will capture and extract venom ... from one of the deadliest creatures on Earth- - the king cobra . Although many snake venoms are considered more toxic or poisonous , the king cobra has enough venom in a single bite to kill 30 men . And unlike most snakes that attack and then retreat , the king cobra is apt to chew into his victim several times . However , being of royal heritage , the king will never attack unless annoyed . Unfortunately , almost everything annoys the king . [ Laughs ] Sounds like my wife . [ Audience Laughing ] Complete silence , please , and no pictures until I give the signal . Ladies and gentlemen , one of the world 's greatest scientists ... and- - and experts in the field of herpetology , Dr. Carl Stoner . Now , if you would please form a circle around the enclosure , but please stand back about two or three feet . And remember what I said about not taking any pictures . [ Chattering ] [ Hissing ] Ladies and gentlemen , the king cobra . ! [ Hissing Continues ] [ Audience Gasping ] [ Hissing Continues ] [ Man ] Watch out . ! [ Commotion ] Dr. Stoner is now extracting the venom from the king cobra . In the extraction process , the snake secretes its venom voluntarily . And by this method , a snake can be kept healthy ... and producing venom for many years . Now , I 'm helping Dr. Stoner feed the snake using a pressure gun , which delivers a completely balanced combination of nutrients . For those of you who are now leaving , may I remind you that contributions will help Dr. Stoner continue his research . We really appreciate your support . [ Coins Clinking ] Only $ 1 8.1 5 . It 's better than last week . $ 1 8 to risk your life ? What 's the matter with those people ? Don 't they realize the importance of what he 's doing ? They come for the show . Some of them come hoping he 'll get bitten . Has he ever been bitten ? More times than I care to remember . I 'm glad the immunization really works . With the smaller snakes , yeah , but nobody knows about the king . [ Hissing ] Damn ! Now , I 've got you . He got me , Harry . I 'll milk you tomorrow . You African bastard . ! [ Sighs ] I 've got enough serum in me for 1 0 Mamba bites . We 're both getting older and slower , Harry . I think that 's a sign that I should stop dueling with the king . Too many important things to think about . You know , I saw an intriguing article yesterday . At our present rate of consumption , we can expect worldwide fuel shortages in less than 50 years . The world is gonna belong to the cold-blooded species . But we already knew that , didn 't we , Har ? [ Ringing ] [ Ringing Stops ] [ Groans ] [ Water Running ] It 's a perfectly natural reaction to the cobra inoculation . I just wish you 'd told me about it before . I feel like an orange . Yes . You see , the venom burns off the superficial layers of the skin- - much like a sunburn , only from the inside . It 's the same principle that allows a cobra to shed his skin every few months . Don 't tell me this is gonna happen every few months- - ' cause , if it is , you should 've got a fatter assistant . [ Chuckles ] This is the first and last time . I feel positively naked ... and cold . Good . What ? You 'd best put on a sweater . I feel a little chilly in here , myself . Dr. Stoner . I don 't know if you remember me . I 'm Dale Hardison . I 'm an old student of yours . Yes . I think I do recall . Well , there 's no reason why you should . I never was too good a student . But , uh , well , I 'm the one that never could remember the name of those plants ' phylums . " Phyla " - - still the plural . [ Laughs ] But , uh , you seem to have found a worthwhile calling preserving the status quo . Well , yeah , it , uh , takes all kinds . This is my deputy , Morgan Bock . How do you do ? But not spelled the same as the composer . Well , uh , what can I do for you gentlemen ? Well , you could get us a couple of girls . [ Guffaws ] We were kinda hopin ' , Doc , that you could give us the 25-cent tour of your place . We 've heard a lot about it up in town . Be a pleasure . This way . Come ahead , Mr. Bock . This is the laboratory . And this ... [ Snake Rattling ] is my daughter , Kristina . Ma 'am . Hi . And a female python . A couple of girls . [ Chuckles ] Don 't tell me my old parking tickets have caught up on me . Well , if they have , looks like you 've got a pretty good lawyer to defend you . No . No , she 's sick . Poor thing , she won 't eat . That 's three and a half weeks . I think we should isolate her , so she doesn 't infect the others . Gentlemen , she 's heavy . Could you give me a hand ? Geez , Doc . Is it- - is it safe ? Pythons rarely attack except when they 're hungry or if they sense great fear . - All right . - Hey , Dale . - Come on , Morg . - It 's okay.Just go right behind me . I 've got its head . It 's all right . [ Hisses ] Whoa ! It 's okay . I 've got its head . About four feet behind her . Yes , right behind me . Oh , right about there . It 's okay . Just grab on right there . Yes . That 's a good spot . Right here ? Let 's lift . One , two , three , up . Come on , Morgan . Whoa . Okay ? Got it ? On the way to the storm cellar . That 's the isolation spot . Oh ? [ Hissing ] Easy . Easy . I appreciate this , so much . Are you doing all right there ? Doing okay , I guess . Sure is a big snake . [ Dr. Stoner ] I know . [ Dr. Stoner ] Gently . Dad , I left some cages open . I better go lock them up . Thank you , Kristina . Damn it . That virus is hanging on . You and , uh , your daughter live here alone , Doc ? Yes . And my assistant , David Blake . Possibly you saw him as you drove up . Mm . You 've got another boy working here for you , don 't you ? Tim McGraw ? He left some time ago . Mm . Went back to school , huh ? No . I think a relative was ill . That 's , uh- - That 's what I wanted to talk to you about , Doc . Uh , I got a letter from his aunt . She hasn 't heard from him for a couple of months and she 's kinda worried . I went over to the school to check out the records and ... nobody over there seen or heard from him since he came to work for you . These kids today just pick up and take off . Some of them do . [ Hisses ] You , uh- - You just gonna leave that snake runnin ' around down here , loose ? The cellar door is secure enough . And she 'll probably nest up there in the roofs . Well , Morg , I guess we better be goin ' . Uh-huh . Thank you , Doc . Thank you , gentlemen . [ Mongoose Snarling ] [ Hissing ] What do you call him ? His name 's Aaron . And what do you call him ? Aaron II . It 's not infrequent that they 're born with two heads , it 's just that only about one in a million survive . Huh . [ David ] So that 's what a baby cobra looks like . Mm-hmm . [ Gasps ] Careful . Careful . They already have fangs and venom . You know , they 're the only creatures that can protect themselves from the moment of birth . Father says it 's because they 're God 's favorites . See ? Look . [ Hisses ] [ Alarm Ringing ] Bye-bye , Dad ! Bye ! $ 1 1 .20 . I 'd like to insure it too , for $ 3,000 . You people sure got the racket . All you do is give them snakes a little squeeze ... and the money comes pouring out . You know , if we could just get an urutu , we could actually start to make real profits . The urutu is one of the rarest snakes in the world ... and is found only in the jungles of the Amazon . Hey . Where does that go ? Oh , it goes around the lake . You know that one drop of urutu venom- - What are you doing ? [ Water Plops ] Uh , hey , uh , let 's go for a swim . Don 't be silly . We didn 't bring our suits . It doesn 't bother me if it doesn 't bother you . Come on . Come on , Kris . Look , you 're a naturalist , right ? Well , what could be more natural than the two of us going for a swim in the lake ? Come on . Ready ? I 'll go first . You 're comin ' ? Hurry up ! Don 't look ! Why ? You 're going to be looking . Well , that 's the problem ! I can 't see without my glasses , so you can 't look , either ! Okay , okay . I won 't look . Hurry up ! Promise ? Promise ! [ David ] Whoo . ! Wow , is it warm . ! Cover your eyes . ! Kristina , get in the water ! David , cover your eyes . ! All right , all right ! Come on . It 's not getting any warmer . I 'm coming . Hey ! You 're peeking . [ Chuckles ] No . I 'm not . Come on . Cover your eyes . Hurry up . Oh , it 's nice . [ Splashing ] Oh . It 's freezing . ! No , it 's warm . It 's freez- - You lied ! Watch out . [ Giggles ] Hug me . No touching . That 's not fair . [ Giggling ] [ Voices Grow Indistinct ] No . No . [ Squeals ] [ Both Giggling ] [ Hissing ] [ Recording Of Dr. Stoner ] The skin shedding is complete- - on schedule and no complications . David 's body temperature is dropping at the rate of three degrees a day . Should stabilize at 80 degrees by the end of the week . The prognosis is perfect . Slight flattening of the nostrils . Eyelids beginning to recede . Facets that will not be readily apparent for several days . After that , however , the evolutionary process should accelerate greatly . [ Leaves Rustling ] [ bird Coos ] Cataclysmic changes should occur- - [ Wings beating ] Oh . I have you . And I set you free . Ohhh . You know something ? What ? I think your father 's actually worried I might try something with you . Well , aren 't you going to ? Of course not . Not while you 're driving , Doctor . Look ! A carnival ! [ Calliope ] [ Crazed Laughter ] [ Noisy Chattering ] Ohhh ! Whoa ! [ Laughs , Squeals ] [ Both Laughing ] [ Screaming ] Ohhh ! Geez ! [ Kristina Laughing ] You look terrible . ! Aaah . ! Come on ! It 's the High-boy ! High-low fast and safe ! Sensational ride . ! Okay , we got a winner . ! [ bell Clangs ] [ Cheering ] All right . Here it goes , guys ! [ Clatter ] All right ! All right ! [ Gunshots , Rifle Pumps Continue ] [ Gunshots , Rifle Pumps Continue ] I don 't know , Morgan . Maybe you should 've gone into some other kind of work . [ Chuckles ] Here , Daniel Boone . You try it . Go ahead . You paying ' ? I 'll pay . [ Gunshots , Rifle Pumps Continue ] Feel a lot safer now , Morgan ? Oh , yeah . If you live to be 1,000 , you may never again get the chance ... to see the most fantastic , the most bizarre , the most incredible creatures in all of creation ! Twenty-five cents is all it costs .

No mirrors distort him . You may see him , speak to him , touch him , if you dare . And the person that proves that the incredible snakeman ... is not real , alive and as presented , will receive $ 1 , 000 in cash . - What do you say , sonny ? The little lady says the thing is a fake- - - Come on . Let 's go see it . All it costs is one thin quarter to prove she 's right and collect yourself $ 1 , 000 in change . Come on . Let 's go check it out . No . No . You go . $ 1 , 000 just to prove the snakeman is a fake . I 'll wait right here . You go see . Real as life . One look . Don 't touch , just look .

And in appreciation , I 'll even let you buy me a beer . Oh , no . Really . I 'm waiting for someone . Who could be more important ? Kristina , you 've gotta see it . It 's incredible . It 's got blue eyes . Hello , little David . How are you doing tonight ? Hi , Steve . How are you ? Yeah , good to see you . Real good to see you . What are you- - What is this ? What the hell is going- - What are you doing ? - Oh , don 't hurt him , Steve . - [ Kristine ] Don 't do that . Don 't do that . Hey ! What do you think you 're doing ?

I don 't like the sound of that ! All right . This is gettin a little wearisome for everybody . Come on , you two . Let 's go . Randall . Goddamn it . I said move . Let 's get out of here . Come on . " I think I could turn and live with animals . " They are so placid and self-contained . " I stand and look at them long and long . " They do not sweat and whine about their condition .

Steve , no . Come on . What 's the matter with you ? He 's still steamed about getting shot down by the redhead . She dug me . Sure . She just didn 't see your clippings , that 's all .

[ Giggling ] Oh , God . That hurts , honey . I 'm sorry . Hey , weren 't you frightened ? Makes me shiver to think of snakes . Have you ever seen me frightened of anything ? You 're so brave . [ Giggles ] Right and tired . Hey , it 's only 9 : 30 . Curfew 's not until 1 1 : 00 . I 'm serious . I 'm still in training . Twice a night is all the coach allows me . What about weekends ? [ Laughs ] Later . Hey , uh , look . Francie told me you were like this , but I didn 't believe her . You should have . I gotta take a shower . I 'll see you around . [ Engine Starts ] On top of old Smokey all covered with snow I lost my sweetheart For a 'courtin ' too slow Courting 's a pleasure But parting 's a grief A false-hearted lover is worse than a thief Shit ! God ! Oh , God ! No ! Get off me ! God ! I think you 're supposed to say something . [ Exhales ] I love you . I didn 't mean that . I did . [ Sniffling ] Don 't cry . Why are you crying ? There 's nothing to cry about . I can 't see you . [ Laughing ] I 'm crying because I can 't find my glasses . [ Both Laughing ] On top of old Smokey All covered with snow I lost my true lover For a 'courtin ' too slow Oh , no . Shh ! Dad . [ Giggling ] Oh , shit . Oh ! Where 's my shirt ? [ Laughing ] I don 't know . Oh , this . That 's it . [ Laughing ] [ Whistling ] [ Stops ] [ Knocking ] [ Kristine ] Come in . Oh , Kristine . You 're back early . Yes . Maybe not early enough . You and David seem to be getting along well together . We like each other . Yes . Maybe we have different definitions of " like . " You 're an innocent girl , Kristine . You 've had a very sheltered life , and I can understand how lonely- - Wait . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Don 't you think it 's a little late to be telling me about the birds and the bees ? - I 'm very serious , Kristina . - Well , what do you want me to say ? That you haven 't slept with him . I don 't think that 's any of your business . You don 't understand the consequences of what you 're doing . Oh , come on , Dad . I mean , I may not be very sophisticated , but I do think I know- - No , you don 't . Kristina , one drop of David 's blood could- - Could what ? Have an effect . The inoculations . There 's a period in which the venom could have a damaging effect on his nervous system . I want you to promise me you won 't have intercourse with him . I don 't think you have the right to ask me that . I have more than a right . You are a stupid little child . You don 't understand what 's happening . And you 're a stuffy , selfish , overprotective , old man , and you could care less about me or my happiness ! Kristina , I want your promise . ! No ! [ Alarm Ringing ] [ Stops ] [ Screams ] David ! David ! David ! [ Lock Clacks ] What is it , Kristine ? I wanna see David right now . Well , he doesn 't want to see you . He 's had an allergic reaction ... Look , I don 't- - to the immunization . His face is broken out . You 're hiding something from me . I know it . He 's gonna die , isn 't he ? He 's not going to die . David ! Yes ? How do you feel ? Ugly . You see ? [ Laughing ] What the hell are you laughing at ? [ Laughing ] Male vanity . Yeah , well , what would you do if you woke up one morning and looked like a beehive ? He 's going to be all right , isn 't he ? Of course . Now , Kristine . [ Shivered Breathing ] I 'll call you as soon as I get there . Kristina , drive carefully . I can 't believe you 're really letting me do this all by myself . - It 's only a snake . - Only a snake ? - It 's an urutu . - I wouldn 't trust anybody else to pick it up . - I 'm sorry about last night . - So am I. Everybody forgiven ? I 'll call you tonight . Please do . - Take care of him . - I will . [ Engine Starts ] Dr , Stoner , I- - I feel- - I feel terrible . David , drink this . What is it ? A mild sedative . No , I don 't feel- - It 'll calm you . [ Groans ] [ Breathing Rapidly ] Doctor , what 's happening to me ? You 're gonna be all right , David . [ Whimpers ] You 've just become hypersensitive to the venom . Yeah , well , don 't- - don 't you think I should check into a hospital or something ? You may if you like . But I 'm not sure how much they know about cobra venom infections . [ Moaning ] What is it ? My- - My stomach . [ Whimpering ] It- - It feels like my insides are being twisted . Yes . No . No , no . Please . David . No ! David , it will relieve the pain . [ Snarling ] You 're gonna be fine.Just fine . [ Moaning ] A little alcohol on that . [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Vehicle Approaching ] I 'll be right back . [ Car Door Opens , Closes ] Hello , Carl . What do you want ? Well , uh , I have a little piece of news for you , and , uh , I thought rather than call , you 'd appreciate it if I came by and told you personally . Are you sure that the college can manage without you for an afternoon ? [ Forced Chuckle ] Class is suspended for the day for the funeral of one of the students- - Steve Randall , the team 's star fullback . It 's a dangerous game , football . I 've always thought it should be outlawed . Oh , he didn 't die of a football injury . Heart attack . Too bad . David around ? Working in the lab . I 'd like to say hello to him . Uh , look . I have just said that we 're busy , and you just said that you had something to tell me . Well , I was gonna try to soften the blow , but since you 're not being very civil , I might just as well drop it on you . The board rejected your request for an extension of the grant . Fine . Good-bye . You don 't seem very upset about it . I 'm too busy to bother about it now . Just too busy . Feeling better ? Doctor , what is this ? I feel like my guts are being rearranged . Your system is changing to assimilate the venom . [ David Groans Loudly ] - [ Engine Off ] - [ Whimpering ] [ Groaning ] It 's time for you to lie down . [ Groaning Loudly ] [ Metallic Clang ] [ David breathing Loudly ] [ Snarling ] [ Groaning ] [ Daniels Groaning ] Where are we ? The storm cellar . It 's almost soundproof , in case you 're considering shouting . [ Groans ] Shouting ? You 're goddamn right I 'm gonna shout . - What are you doing to that boy ? - Call it a Halloween prank . His face ... was distorted . It looked like he was turning into a snake or something . Very perceptive of you . But , of course , you know that 's impossible , don 't you ? All I know is you 're insane , and I intend to have you locked up . [ Chain Rattles ] What is this ? Is this some kind of joke ? I hope you find it amusing . There 's a key for that lock in those tanks . You know , I was so impressed with your lecture on the difference ... between the coral snake and the king . You know , " red touch yellow , kill a fellow " ? I was hoping you might enlighten me ... on the difference between these two . Now , in one of these tanks , we have the Western Hognose , which we both know is completely harmless . And in one of these tanks is the Hognose Pit Viper , which we both know is highly venomous . You have a decision to make . I advise you to make a good one . You 're free to go whenever you wish . Just reach in a tank and pick a key . I 'm sure you won 't have any trouble picking the right key ... Dr. Daniels . Of course . [ Whimpers ] [ Relieved Laugh ] [ Key Rattling In Lock ] [ Chain Clatters To Ground ] [ Relieved Sigh ] What ? [ Growling ] [ Yelling , Choking ] [ Choking , Yelling ] [ Ringing ] [ Mongoose Snarling ] [ Whimpering ] [ Ringing Continues ] - Hello . - Dad . I 'm here at the cargo office and they don 't seem to have any record of it . They don 't ? That 's odd . Well , you know Brazilian mail , Kristy . It 's about as botched up as our own . [ Laughs ] Right . Well , do you have the order ? No . The shipping agent phoned . [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Clatter ] What was that ? - Uh , bad connection . - How 's David ? He 's greatly improved . Can I talk to him ? At the moment , he 's resting . Oh . Well , make sure you tell him I asked about him . Yes . What do you want me to do about the urutu ? Well , when it arrives , tell them to hold it , and we 'll make some kind of arrangements to get it here . Okay . Well , listen , I 'll wait here until morning , and if it doesn 't arrive , I 'll just drive back again . Fine . And don 't forget to tell David I called . I won 't , Kristy . Good night . Good night . [ Dial Tone ] [ Whimpering ] Kristina sends her love . You so interested in snakes , I got a beauty for ya . Oh , yeah ? What kind of snake ? Don 't know the name of it , but it sure is the biggest one I ever saw . Fella down at the carnival 's got it in his freak show . Half-snake and half-man . Sure worth a look-see . Oh , come on . You don 't really believe all that stuff , do you ? I 've seen a lot of freak shows . Used to be a donnicker man with the Westcott Brothers Amusements of the World . Fifty-three years on the circuit . Never seen one like that before . Well , I 'm sure it 's just a python made to look like a man . His blue eyes sure fooled me . Never heard of a snake with blue eyes . - Where did you say this carnival was ? - Couple of blocks down off Main . Better hurry though , because they 'd be closing ' down about now . [ Chuckles ] There 's sure one born every minute , ain 't there ? [ Gurgling ] [ Man ] Patch says that he can 't spring Chip until next Wednesday . [ Man # 2 ] He keeps gaffing that wheel , jimmyJr . ' s gonna dump him . [ Man # 3 ] Chip gives the whole show a bad rap . - Marks don 't believe in nothing anymore . - Yeah . Come on in . Come on in . Here , sit down . Take the load off . I know you 're closed , but , uh , I was wondering if you would let me see the snakeman ? The snakeman ? Well , how do you like that ? The snakeman 's got himself a late date with a little chicken . [ All Laughing ] - He expecting ' you ? - I know this sounds crazy , but you see , I know a lot about snakes ... and I was just wondering if you would let me see him ? Well , the snakeman 's sleeping now . You come back tomorrow and you can have a nice , long look . - I 'll be glad to pay you . - I told you , he 's sleeping . You see , this is an entertainment , girlie , it 's not an all-night diner . I don 't think it 's clear to you how very important it is for me to see him . You heard me . Beat it . - Good night , honey . - [ Man # 2 ] See you around , baby . Hoo-hoo . All right . [ Whimpering ] [ Continues ] [ Thumping ] [ Thumping Continues ] [ Whimpering ] [ Kristine Gasps ] [ Gasps ] Oh , God ! Oh , Tim . ! Oh , no . Oh , Tim ! [ Crying ] Oh , Tim ! [ Screams ] [ Screaming ] Hey ! Hey , you ! Hey , you ! Come back here ! [ Engine Sputters ] [ Engine Sputters , Starts ] [ Crying ] Oh , no . No , not David too . No . Dale ? Hmm ? There 's a girl here to see you . Well , is she pretty ? She 's pretty upset . She says she killed Steve Randall . I knew he was in training . I mean , I knew it was bad for athletes to get overexerted . [ Sobs ] But , I couldn 't help myself . I loved him too much . Well , just how much did you love him ? [ Crying ] Three times . His poor heart ! Three times ? I mean , he looked a little tired . He told me this story about how he killed this snake . Snake ? I don 't know anything about that . [ Sobbing ] This girl made a pass at him . Girls are always making passes at Steve . He took her home , and it turned out that she was Dr. Stoner 's daughter . And there was this big snake . Stoner . - [ Door Opens ] - Excuse me , Dale . I just got a call from Dr. Daniels 's wife . She 's worried because he didn 't come home last night . Well , tell her to check the girls dorms . Well , the last she heard , he was on his way to Stoner 's place . Stoner . All right . Let 's go . Thank you , miss . The last one , David . And , unfortunately , the most painful . - But think of it as your baptism . - [ Muffled ] Oh , no . The final agony of your old life as a puny human . And the beginning of your new existence . A new existence for all mankind . [ Groaning ] You are the future , David . Just as Adam was the first man , you are the first creature of the next evolution . You will survive pollution , the holocaust , the famines ... and the plagues that will make man extinct . You will survive and multiply and prevail . [ Gagging , Grunting ] [ Rapid Breathing ] - Hit it . - [ Siren Wailing ] [ Erratic Breathing ] Long live the king . [ Hissing ] [ Mongoose Snarling ] [ Snarling Continues ] A new life , David . A bright , clean new life . [ Siren Wailing ] [ Cobra Hisses ] Your Highness , I 'd like an audience with you . I command it . [ Hissing ] Your Majesty , I regret to inform you ... there is a pretender to your throne . A king with the power of a cobra , but with the intelligence of a man . The creature is different from- - Ow . [ Grunting ] [ Heavy breathing ] [ Gulps , Shudders ] A creature who is different from- - It 's natural for you to resist change . [ Labored Breathing ] And ... change is the hope ... of the world . Great change . [ Erratic Breathing ] Is- - [ Snarling ] Dad ! Dad ! Oh , no ! Oh , no ! Dad , I saw Tim . I saw him . What did you do to David ? Dad . Dad . [ Screams ] [ Hissing ] [ Gasps ] David ! Da-David ! [ Siren Wailing ] [ Tires Screech ] My father 's dead . [ Mongoose Snarling ] David ! David ! David !

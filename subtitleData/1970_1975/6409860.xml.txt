 [ theme music plays ] That 's it then ? I 'm discharged ? Frank , it 's been a long recovery , you 're still weak . - I 'm fine . - A few more days , eh . Oh , no . But you 're still convalescing , your injuries are barely healed . Healed . And I can convalesce at home . - I 'm a doctor , remember ? - Uh , psychiatrist . Liam , it 's my wedding anniversary tomorrow . Hmm , well , perhaps if Penny came to pick you up . And spoil my surprise ? Come on now , it 's the best present I can give her , the homecoming . - Well ... - I 'm all right , aren 't I ? - Physically . - Well , then ... - Miss Pringle ? - [ over intercom ] Yes . Would you arrange for Dr. Bowers to be discharged tomorrow ? [ ticket puncher clicks ] [ clears throat ] Well , it 's our stop next . I was stationed at Castleforge during the war . Flew over 50 missions . - Really ? - Married a local girl , too . Jean Grant . You know the Grants ? No , I 'm from London , actually . It 's my first visit . Oh , I thought you lived here . No , Penny my wife , she found this place . Fell in love with it at first sight , so she bought a cottage . She says it 's perfect peace and quiet . Is she meeting you ? - She doesn 't know I 'm coming . - Oh . Well , it 's just one of those silly things we have between us . Whenever we have anything special , we like to keep it as a surprise . Well , I hope it works out all right . What do you mean ? Well , my wife , if she actually wasn 't entertaining the milkman , she 'd accuse me of trying to catch her at it ... [ chuckles ] Penny and I haven 't been married that long . What brings you here ? Well , best fishing in the country . Do you fish ? No . Oh , well , you should . There 's nothing like it . You just drop the line in and let them bite , ideal form of convalescence . Sounds it . Well , not as though you look as though you need it . It 's unbelievable , isn 't it ? Hardly a mark left . I wish I could say the same for the car . Oh , well , this is it . You know , it 's been a great pleasure , Dr. Bowers , meeting you . I do hope we bump into each other again . Why don 't you pop in sometime , Mr Sheppard ? Sam , please . Well , fine . We 're at Pretty Cottage , Chalk Pit Lane . Pretty Cottage ? I might take you up on that . [ birds chirping ] - What the- - What ... ? - Happy anniversary , my darling . - What are you doing ? - Don 't worry , I couldn 't take that bloody hospital any more . - It 's been too long . - Frank ! - It 's all right , darling . - Frank ! Frank ! Who the hell are you ? How did you get in here ? How did l- - It 's my home . Who the hell are you ? Your home ? Look , if this is some sort of joke . Joke ? Penny , who is this character ? - My husband . - Your- - - I 'm Dr. Frank Bowers . - Frank Bowers ? Yes . Now , if you don 't mind ... I 'm Frank Bowers . I 'm Frank Bowers ! - I 'm her husband ! - Frank ! - Oh , no ! - Penny ! Get off of me . - Get my kit ! - Get off ! - Steady , now . - What 's going on ? Penny , help me . We 'll take care of you . No use . The brown bottle , 20 ccs , quick . Leave me alone . - Stay still . - Leave me alone ! - I 'll hold him . - Penny , help me . Careful now . [ church bells chiming ] [ Wedding March plays ] [ male voice ] Where did you come from ? Your name ? Where did you come from ? Your name ? Your name ? Your name ? Frank Bowers . Where did you come from ? Hospital . - Which hospital ? - The Imperial . - Where is that ? - London . Knightsbridge . New to me . - Why were you in the hospital ? - Car crash . Does anyone know you 've come here ? - Dr. Liam Moore . - Never heard of him . Penny , you know Dr. Moore . - When you came visiting ... - I never visited you . You did . Why did you come here ? It 's my home . Who told you it was your home ? Penny you wrote to me about it , your letter- - A letter ? - No letter here . - There is . - Where ? - In my wallet . You haven 't got a wallet . It 's in my pocket . No , nothing here , some money , nothing else . I tell you , there 's a letter . There 's no identification at all . - Nothing to show who you are . - I know who I am . Where is this letter ? I had it , and my wallet . You must have destroyed them . Penny , please , help me . [ doorbell rings ] - Heavens , the Sherwoods ! - Blast . What about ... ? He 'll be all right . So he said your dog needs his head examined . - Quite right . - Oh , Frank ... Would you take him on as a patient ? No , but I could recommend a good canine psychiatrist . - Canine headshrinker . - Why not a canine spiritualist ? Oh , dogs aren 't superstitious . Well , Sheila , now you know what to do . But there 's nothing wrong with our dog . Of course there isn 't , Sheila , but don 't forget , the poor beast is subjected to the same stresses as you and I. All that dog is subjected to is an excess of love , nothing more , nothing less . Oh , love can cause psychological stresses . - Oh , really ? - Of course it can . Ask Penny . [ laughter from downstairs ] Well , Penny , how does it feel to be a veteran ? Oh , married a whole year , you mean ? Uh-huh . Wait till the nappies come along . I can 't wait actually . I 'm ready . [ Frank laughs ] You won 't laugh when it happens . What about you , Frank ? How does it feel ? - A whole year ? - Sheer bondage , but I love it . It 'll be a darn sight more than bondage when those nappies do come along , believe you me . What are you two trying to do anyway ? Prevent a population explosion ? [ laughter , incoherent conversation ] [ receiver dings ] Get me the police . - Oh , there we are . - Well done . - Sheila . - Thank you . Oh . Just look at that , Penny , that 's lovely . Happy anniversary , darling . - Frank . - Yes , indeed . Happy anniversary . All right , that 's enough . John ! Sheila ! Thank heavens you 're here . You shouldn 't be up now , come along ... No , John , stop him . He 's got my wife . I 'm sorry about this . He 's a patient . [ doorbell rings ] - Oh , Sheila , answer the door , would you ? - Extremely disturbed . He just walked in , what could we do ? John , you know me , you were my best man . Your best man ? - John ! - [ Penny ] Sergeant Greene- - We received a call , Mrs. Bowers . I called you . That man , he 's- - I came home and , he seems to have some hold over my wife . I don 't know what , but together they 've been ... That man is pretending to be me ! Now just one moment , sir . Are you claiming to be Dr. Bowers ? - Sergeant ... - Claiming ? - I am Dr. Bowers . - Are you now ? Doctor , who is he ? He just appeared this afternoon . I 've managed to establish that he 's just come out of hospital . The Imperial Hospital . Just , just check with Dr. Liam Moore . I see . But he 's claiming to be you , sir ? Yes , he 's obviously suffering from some sort of identity transference , probably schizophrenic , though Lord knows how he came to pick on me . Have you never seen him before , sir ? Not that I know of . Then how did he come to pick on you , sir ? The identity transference . He could perhaps have seen me at my hospital . Oh , God . John , please tell them . He was my best man . Sheila ! He needs treatment , sir . He does , indeed . He must stay here . Here , sir ? I 'm qualified to treat him , Sergeant . His condition interests me . Besides , he thinks this is his home , a total rejection now might unhinge him irreparably . - Yes , sir , but- - - It 's all right , Sergeant . I 'm on holiday , I 've no commitments . I don 't know . You 'd like to stay here , wouldn 't you , at home ? Penny ... Of course you would . Come on , Frank . [ Frank 's voice ] Who loves Frankie ? [ child ] Daddy Who loves Frankie ? Daddy . Who loves Frankie ? Daddy . [ Penny 's voice ] Breakfast . [ dog panting ] - [ Penny ] Bye , bye . - [ child ] Bye , bye . [ dog barking ] [ Frank ] Penny ... Penny . Darling Penny ... [ Wedding March plays ] [ brakes screech , crashing ] [ Penny ] Frank , you 're going to live for me . [ Frank ] Yes , for you . Penny ... Penny ... Penny ! Penny ! [ muted shouting ] Penny ! - Penny ! - It 's all right , I 'm here . Hmm . Time to put phase two into operation . Penny , what about all my things ? My clothes and things , all my books ? I don 't know . All that stuff we had at the flat ? Suppose you tell me then , about us . You love me for my ugly face as much as my brilliant mind , as you put it . When did we meet ? When you brought that sick child into my office . Do you remember our honeymoon ? Sunniest fortnight in living memory . What about Rome ? Rome ? When was that ? Three months ago . I was in hospital three months ago . Oh . Penny , why this charade ? Charade ? We 're alone now , you don 't have to reject me ! - Why ? - I 'm not rejecting you . Were you in Rome with him ? Yes . - I see . - What ? You 're trying to get rid of me . - It 's all some crazy plot . - No ! What then ? - Please don 't ask questions- - - Why are you doing this ? Are you- - Is he threatening you ? What hold has he over you ? - You mustn 't excite yourself ! - Oh , for God 's sake ! Look , we can get away from here now if you like ! I love you , Penny . I am your husband . - You 're not my husband ! - I am , you know I am ! No ! What do I have to do , Penny ? Kill him ? Don 't . - Don 't ever harm him . - Why not ? He 's- - If you touch him ... You love him that much ? Yes . You could have told me before that you were in love , that you wanted to be free . Oh , God . These are his fingerprints , Sergeant , and a photograph . I managed to get them while he was unconscious . There must be a record of him somewhere . Do you think you could check ? Well , I can circulate them around the hospitals , sir , yes . And police records , if you can . We 've got to establish his real identity , whether he 's ever been known as Frank Bowers before . Whether he 's had any treatment , and if so , where and what , everything . What are you trying to do ? Frank , open the door ! [ Penny ] What are you up to ? Please , open the door . Frank ? Frank , please don 't ! If you love me , don 't do anything ! Frank , I care for you ! I do , I do ! [ shattering ] You must promise you 'll never try . - It would have been best . - No ! Yes . You must rest , please . Afterwards , later , things won 't seem so desperate . Won 't they ? Is there hope for us ? - Is there ? - Please don 't question me ! You are being threatened , aren 't you ? Please ! Don 't ask . Penny , Penny , I won 't desert you . You need me still . [ Penny ] He could try again . Hmm . He won 't . I promise you . You 're very confident , aren 't you ? I 'm not God . Cheer up , it won 't be for long . - But- - - Come here . Trust me . [ doorbell rings ] [ man ] Well , the name 's Sheppard , Sam Sheppard . Surely he told you about me , how we met on the train ? He hasn 't been too well . It is Penny , isn 't it ? It must be Pretty Cottage . - Yes , of course it is . - Well , I 'm delighted to- - - Sam ! - Oh , excuse me . My dear old chap , how 's it going ? - And what 's all this ? - Am I glad to see you . Mr Sheppard ! I thought a spot of fishing might help with the convalescing . - [ Penny ] Just a minute ... - [ Frank ] It certainly would ! Well , come on , the fish are not going to wait . Mr Sheppard ! Frank , get straight back to bed . - No . - No arguments now . I 'm sorry , Mr Sheppard , but I 'm afraid you came at a rather inopportune moment . - No . - Frank 's due for his treatment . Could you perhaps come back some other time ? Oh , I am sorry . Well , yes , of course I could . I only just popped in on the spur of the moment . No , Sam , don 't go- - Now , look , I 'll be down at the weir all day , if later you feel like it , join me . Is that all right with you , Mrs Bowers ? - If he 's well rested . - Well , that 's magnificent . Sam , no , don 't go , Sam . Stay , Sam . My wife and I ... Sam ! Once again I apologise for my bad manners . - That 's all right . - But I do hope he 'll be able to join me . - Bye for now , Mrs. Bowers . - Bye , Mr. Sheppard . [ creaking ] [ gasps ] Oh . It 's getting to be too much . Well , you know what to do , don 't you ? [ footsteps on stairs ] [ barrel clicks ] Why did you send him away ? Time for your pills , Frank . Sam knows me , he would have helped . - We must fight back . - We must do as Frank says . Why must we do as he says ? Hasn 't he got his own name ? Take the pill , Frank . - To hell with the pills . - Frank ... I 'm going to find Sam . [ gushing ] [ panting ] [ gunshot ] [ gunshot ] - He shot him ! - Now , just a moment , sir ... Oh , don 't you see , his plan misfired when I turned up unexpectedly . I mean , if he 'd known I was going to discharge myself from the hospital a day early , he would have killed me on the way here , like he just killed Sam Sheppard , the only man who could identify me as the real Frank Bowers ! It 's not easy to assume someone else 's identity . What about the records , birth certificate , marriage certificate , passport ? They can be faked ! Of course they can , but , you know , the point is that Dr. Bowers had no difficulty in proving his identity . Of course , he wouldn 't . But I can 't say the same about you , sir . Not only can you produce no identification but you can 't even remember which hospital - you 've been discharged from . - I told you , the Imperial . Yes , I checked the Imperial Hospital , sir . ln fact , I spoke to Dr. Moore as you suggested . And ? He knows of no patient with your name and description . He- - He what ? - I see . - Do you , sir ? So what about Sam Sheppard ? I 'm telling you that man killed him ! - Did he , sir ? - I tell you , I saw the body ! Oh , yes , the body . Well , I expect we shall hear soon enough . [ water rushing ] ln a way , I ... I can understand it , Sergeant . My wife 's bloody marvellous . They 're taking a long time . Yes . Is Jones back yet ? Yes , well , what 's he waiting for ? [ knocking ] Come in ! - Well , did you find it ? - No , Sergeant , nothing . Charlie and me , we searched everywhere , upriver , downriver , all them little islands , nothing . What do you mean , nothing ? It was there , caught in the weir , - against some driftwood . - No , sir . Did you check the hotel ? Yes , sir . Mr Sheppard left at 12 noon . Station master said he got the 12 : 51 train . You 're in on it , too , aren 't you ? The plot ? You 're all in on it , aren 't you ? All right , Sergeant . I 'll take care of him . Dr. Bowers , I 'm glad to see you . Look , sir , don 't you think it 'd be a good idea if our friend here went back to hospital ? No , no , it 's quite a familiar pattern . You see , these delusions of his , his confusion of identify , this body he thinks he saw in the weir , it 's all part of his persecution complex . They could be manifestations of disintegration . He doesn 't feel safe in his assumed personality anymore . Now I want to try a different course of treatment . There 's a new drug I 've managed to get hold of . - What drug ? - Well , all right , sir , but if there 's a slightest chance - that he might get violent- - - What new drug ? Sergeant , he 's committed no crime , there 'll be no complaints against him . Well , if you 're prepared to take responsibility , sir ... I am . This new drug ... - Yes ? - It 's DK-5 , isn 't it ? What do you know about DK-5 ? - Enough . - What ? It enables you to substitute suggestibility for memory . - It 's uncanny . - What is ? That you should know about it . I 've kept up with developments . What are your views on it ? Would you use it ? - No . - Why not ? It 's bound to revolutionise psychotherapy . - It 's too open to abuse . - How ? Like you 've misused it . I ? On Penny , Sergeant Greene , and the others . Like you intend to misuse it on me . [ horn honking ] Blast . [ ringing ] Dr. Moore 's office . Yes . Oh , Dr. Bowers , Miss Pringle here . How are you feeling ? Hello , Miss Pringle . Is Dr Moore there , please ? It 's very urgent . No , I 'm afraid he isn 't . Well , he won 't be back until late this evening . Can I get him to call you , about 9 o 'clock ? It 's a call-box ... Castleforge 0396X . Yes , I 've got it . Pardon ? No , nobody rang about you . Not even a Sergeant Greene ? I see . No ... You 'll give Dr. Moore the message , won 't you ? Most certainly , Dr. Bowers . Goodbye . [ piano music plays ] He could be anywhere . He had money . Don 't you care ? Of course I do , I 'm also relieved . Relieved ? His being here all the time , it was getting me down . You knew what it would be like . I thought I did . But being in the same house with him ... The way he kept looking at me , so so helpless , so hungry for love , you know . No , I don 't . Pity , I suppose . The frustrated maternal bit . Then again , he 's so much like you . - Like me ? - Like another you . Don 't you see ? Yes . Like another me . Only younger , more attractive , more in need of you . You 're not jealous ? - About to be , I think . - Oh , no , I 'm just being silly . Are you ? I hope so , because this is something I didn 't anticipate . I love you , you know that . Say that again . I love you . [ Frank ] Yes , I should have thought so . [ phone ringing ] [ Frank ] Speaking . Hello . Yes . I see . When was this ? How long ago ? Ah-ha . Right . Thanks for letting me know . Bye . How would you like to go to Rome again ? What ? When this is all over ... Frank , how can you , when we 're in the middle - of this crisis ? - There 's no crisis . - A minute ago- - - He 's all right . I 've just seen him . He 's just burgled the study . Well , I knew something was wrong , but this , it 's unbelievable . We 'll have to do something . Perhaps I should go to the cottage . - And risk getting killed ? - Oh , come on . He killed Sam Sheppard , a total stranger . Do you think he 'd hesitate killing you ? There must be something I can do . There is . I managed to get hold of these . - Is that him ? - That 's him . Careful , it 's got his fingerprints on it . - And so ? - Check them with Scotland Yard . Find out who he is , and bring help . But , Frank , it 's all so incredible . I mean , however desirable Penny may be , for him to go to such lengths to brainwash the police and the entire village with the- - What 's the name of that drug again ? DK-5 . DK-5 , to do all this just to get a hold over Penny , well , it 's really inconceivable . And murder . Maybe it 's not just Penny that he 's after , - maybe there 's more to it . - What do you mean ? I don 't know . It could be anything . - Such as ? - Anything . From an irresponsible field experiment with a whole village as the guinea pig to an alien takeover . Alien takeover ? You mean from outer space ? Not necessarily . An enemy country looking for a bridgehead . Oh , really . It sounds wild , I know , but the facts are there . Take your pick as to what they add up to . No , no , no , it can 't be . Well , we have to find out somehow . I 'll meet you here same time tomorrow night . What , you 're not going back there ? - I have to . - But , Frank , you 're in danger . So is Penny . - He 'll be back . - And then ? We go on . So much depends on it . What happens if you break him and it proves irreparable ? - Nothing is irreparable . - The mind is . He can hardly be worse off . You won 't break me , I can assure you . Where have you been ? I won 't be broken . Well , sit down . You must be tired . - Have you eaten ? - No . - Penny ... - I just want to talk . - Very well . - When you ... When you say break , I presume you mean you will divest me of my identity , is that right ? On the contrary , I want to reinvest you with your real identity . Let 's drop the pretence for once . First , I thought it was Penny , but since Sheppard 's death , I 've begun to think all sorts of things . Sheppard is not dead . I suggest you tell me just exactly what it is you 're up to . Why all this mind-bending ? Mind-bending ? What good will it do ? Tell me . Will it help anyone ? Will it improve humanity ? Will it , for instance , stop an inhuman father scalding his child almost to death ? Will it ? Tell me ! Why ? Were you scalded almost to death ? Were you ? Belt up ! [ child shouting ] Shut up ! [ shouting continues ] Shut up ! [ clattering ] [ child screaming ] No ... No ! Then what about the scar on your face , Frank ? What scar ? No scar on my- - My scar ... - My scar ! - What about your scar ? [ doorbell rings ] [ screaming , groaning ] Good morning , Mrs. Bowers . Could I speak to the doctor , please ? I have the file on his patient . Oh , do come in . Thank you . Would you mind waiting in there a minute ? I 'll tell my husband you 're here . Thank you . - Sergeant Greene with the file . - No , not now . - What shall I say ? - Anything . No , wait a minute . - Yes , we 'll see him . - Are you sure ? So soon after the session ? You can 't ... You can 't , even with DK-5 . You can 't wipe the mind blank ! You don 't think so ? You haven 't broken me . I 'm still Frank Bowers ! Yes , well , we 'll see , won 't we ? - Frank , he 's not- - - Don 't interfere ! Come on , Frank . All yours , Sergeant . I don 't think that what I have to say is for your patient 's ears , Dr. Bowers . I want him to face the truth . Yes , sir , but- - Truth is an essential part of the therapy , Sergeant . Yes , sir . Well , the fingerprints took us to Borstal , sir . - His name is Peter Johnson . - Peter Johnson ? An aggressive psychopath with a long case history , and there 's reference to the father as well , sir , brutality . Battered baby syndrome ? Yes , that 's just what it 's got here . Apparently that was at the root of his maladjustment . Yes , and there 's a photograph , too , sir . Apparently , Peter Johnson had a pronounced scar . It 's pretty ugly as you can see , sir . Let me see that . It 's me , but it 's been retouched . I haven 't got a scar . [ child 's voice ] No ! No ! No ! But you have , sir . - That 's from my accident . - Oh , yes . Go on , Sergeant , anything else ? Yes , sir . For the past seven years , he 's been in and out of mental institutions . It 's all here in the file , sir . Good . He has never had a regular job , sir , and the odd times that he 's been out of hospital , he 's lived as a tramp . That 's the usual case of vagrancy , sir , poor education , but a very high IQ . Yes , I was wondering about that . There 's plenty more , sir . GBH , larceny . That 's all part of the psychosis , Sergeant . If you leave the file with me , I 'll look into it . Yes , sir . Couldn 't you 've been more original ? Original ? I didn 't expect Sergeant Greene to say that I was Frank Bowers , but I hoped for something more than a psychopathic tramp . Indeed . Logic , mate , when a psychiatrist flips , he doesn 't become a psychopathic tramp ! I never said you were a psychiatrist . You were the one who invented that identity . Sergeant Greene 's report states officially that you 're Peter Johnson . Sergeant Greene is part of the conspiracy ! Very well then , let 's assume that Sergeant Greene and I invented the identity of Peter Johnson . - Lets . - Why should we ? - You tell me . - No , you tell me , - you 're the psychiatrist . - I don 't know , do I ? You don 't know because we had no reason to invent it , it 's the truth . - Indoctrination ! - Face it , man . - You 're Peter Johnson ! - Look , shut your face ! Your accent , can you hear it ? - What accent ? - Cockney . You 're slipping . - I 'm not ! - Oh , yes , you are . You can 't fool me , Peter Johnson ! No ! No ! No ! [ smashing ] There you are , reverting to psychotic behaviour . You 're provoking me . Yes , I am . I had to . But that 's enough for now . Penny , he should rest . [ whispering ] Come on . - He 's getting at me . - He 's trying to help you , too . Uh , just a moment . Dr. Bowers ... Not now , Sergeant . He was violent , sir , and you saw it . I 've treated hundreds like him . Yes , all the same , sir , I 'll look after him now . It 'll be safer all round . Sergeant , is he officially certified ? No , sir . Then how do you propose to take him ? By force ? [ ticking ] [ clock chiming ] [ rattling ] The memory , it came back ! - Not altogether . - It did ! The fear , the terror , even the accent . Agreed , but- - Well , doesn 't that mean that DK-5 could fail ? Not necessarily . Oh , you and your beloved drug . Look , Penny , all right , so the memory came back , briefly , under the shock and stress of having his identity constantly challenged . Yes ! And DK-5 failed . A temporary setback , that 's all . - [ Frank ] Help ! - It 's him . Help ... Someone ... Quick ... [ groans ] [ door rattling ] [ lock clicking ] [ continues to groan ] - What have you done ? - Come on . - No , you 've hurt him . - No , come on . - Dr. Moore 's bringing help . - I 'm not leaving here . All right . I 'll come back for you . But keep that door locked . Don 't open it , whatever he says ! I won 't be long . [ knocking ] [ Frank ] Penny ? Penny ? - Darling , are you all right ? - Just about . - He 's gone . - Yes , I heard . Now what ? Well ? It 's all right , everything 's all right . Now come on , sit down , have a drink . The fingerprints , the photograph , what did you find out ? Well , who is he ? Ex-colonial civil servant , served in the Caribbean 20 years or so . Name ? Frank Bowers . Frank Bowers ? How ? He ... Go on ! He 's been dead for two years . No ! They 've given you the wrong information . They double-checked . Then he 's been falsely reported dead . Frank , listen to me . I think your homecoming , the excitement has been too much . What are you talking about ? It 's disorientated you . I should never have let you leave the hospital . You think I 'm imagining it all ? I think you 're having hallucinations , Frank . Do you know what they tried to do today ? They tried to make out that I had a history as an aggressive psychopath . - Frank ... - And they nearly succeeded . How ? They managed to suggest a childhood vision ... An inhuman father scarring him horribly . [ child 's voice ] No ! No ! No ! Frank , you could be having delusions . It happens in cases like yours . I mean , there was extensive brain damage . I know all about cerebral injury . All right then , whatever is going on , leave me to deal with it . You will need proper care and treatment back in hospital . - Oh , l- - - I mean it . ln a month , we 'll make you ... You 'll soon forget all about this , you 'll be a new man . " We 'll make ... " You , they 've got at you , too . Frank ... They 've made you one of them . Frank , don 't be a fool , you 're not well . No ? I tell you , Liam , I think it 's time I stop listening to people who tell me that . Where will you go ? What can you do ? Save Penny . At least , I can save Penny . - That 's what I can do . - Frank ! A gun , sir ? What sort of gun ? Shotgun . Anything else missing ? Just the gun and cartridges ? All right , sir , thank you . We 'll be in touch . Well , I think we ought to call it off . - Yes . - Not yet . Look , by using DK-5 , we 've made the poor fellow believe that he is someone else . You , in fact . Now , we 've tested that belief under maximum possible stress . We 've made him think he was the victim of a fantastic damn conspiracy , with fake murders , false identity reports about dead colonial civil servants and God knows what , lie after bloody lie . We 've contrived the most horrific situations , the full paranoia pattern , in fact . We 've challenged the poor man 's identity to the limit . Yes , but- - It 's been the most useful field experiment , and almost completely successful . The only thing we haven 't been able to do is to completely eradicate the memory of his father . I still maintain , if we persevere , in the final phase , he 'll wipe that memory out himself ! How can you say that ? You pump his subconscious mind , fill a whole lot of photographs and phrases under narcosis , pictures from somebody else 's past , and you expect that to overlay the memory of a traumatic scalding that- - Yes , if we go on with DK-5 ! No , Frank . We 've already shown how DK-5 can help to rehabilitate a psychopath as a useful member of society , isn 't that enough ? What are you doing here , Liam ? Have you come to have a look for yourself ? You , you 're dead . Dead . Dead ? What are you talking about , Frank ? - I saw your body in the water- - - No , Frank . - No , it was an hallucination . - No . Frank . Frank , give me the gun . No . I 'm taking you back to hospital . The gun , Frank . Come on . Come on , Frank , give him the gun . No ! Now , get over there , all of you . Move ! Penny . Give it to me . I won 't harm you . Penny , help me . Yes , dear , yes- - Frank ! I 'm not leaving you here , not with them . Look , you have to try and understand . They 're doctors , psychiatrists . They 've been giving you this new form of treatment . Can 't you see ? We 're trying to help you . [ knocking ] Johnson , think what you 're doing . I 'm not Johnson . Now get over there . Look , be sensible , man . Now come along , Johnson , give me that gun . I 'm telling you , I 'm not Peter Johnson . I am Frank Bowers . [ child 's voice ] No ! No ! No ! Shut up ! Shut up ! [ child screaming ] I am Frank Bowers ! - Johnson ! - Sergeant , listen to me ... Yes , of course , you 're Frank Bowers . Sergeant Greene here has made a mistake , Frank . What do you mean ? Please , Sergeant , leave this to us . Penny , I 'm trying to save you . We can get away . [ father 's voice ] Shut up ! Shut up ! [ child screaming ] I am your husband , Penny ! Please , do as they say , please . I 'll explain it to you when you get better . Please , Frank , give Sergeant Greene the gun . I 'm Frank Bowers . There can 't be two of us . - No ! - Penny , get out of the way ! [ father 's voice ] Shut up ! [ child screaming ] If I 'm not your husband , Penny , then who- - Shut up ! Who am I ? What am I , Penny ? You 're a sick man , you need treatment . [ child screaming ] No ! If I 'm not Frank Bowers , if Penny 's not my wife then I 'm nobody nothing ! Don 't ! [ echoes of child screaming ] [ gunshot ]

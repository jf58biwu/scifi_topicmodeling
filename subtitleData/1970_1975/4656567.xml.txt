 - Have you thought of names yet ? - Not yet . Commander Straker , have a cigar , sir . Thank you , Grey . What 's the occasion ? You get a raise ? I just became a father . - Congratulations . How 's your wife ? - She 's fine . - Good . Boy or girl ? - Twins . Twins ? You owe me another cigar . Everything seemed to happen so fast . The hospital didn 't want to let us in . She was only in the operating theatre a minute . I never knew Caesarean section happened so quickly ... - Oh , no , I have to drive . - A toast . - Another one ? - Yeah . - What to this time ? - Champagne . - Come on , cut the cake . - Ahh , the cake . Now ... just hold it right here . 1 , 2 , 3 ... # Will you lay down a dollar or two ... # Where to , sir ? Oh , anywhere at all . It 's irrelevant , irrelevant . - Shall I sing some more ? - Do . # You 'll go round the bend when you come back again ... # Ed ... Alec Freeman , last of the clowns . I 'll be with you in a minute . - Where are you going ? - I 'll be with you in a minute ! Ed ? What are you doing ? Nothing ! - Ed ! - What ? There 's a car coming . It 's all right , we probably don 't know them . New suit . New wife . New husband . New life . Confetti check . A - OK . - May I take your bags , sir ? - Thank you . - Hello , sir . - Hello , there . - I have a reservation . - Ah , yes . For my wife and I. Mr and Mrs Straker . Ah , yes . If you 'd just like to sign the register , sir . Sorry . Thank you . - Thank you . - Thank you , sir . This way , sir . Are you going to tell me , darling ? - Tell you what ? - The secret . Oh ! The secret . Well , Mrs Straker , the way I figure it is if I tell you , - it won 't be a secret any more . - Oh , come on , where are we going ? Well , now , let me see . I got the tickets right here . I just can 't make out what they say . Now let me see ... London , England to ... I just can 't make out that destination . It could be anywhere . Let me see ... Are you expecting somebody ? Compliments of the management , sir . That 's all right , sir . I 'll see you later . Well ... - Confetti check ? - We blew it . Oh , well ... - Cheers . - Cheers . Gosh , I 've no idea what the weather 's gonna be like there . I still can 't remember where we 're going . 'Passengers for BEA flight number BE 250 for Athens , 'please proceed to gate 6 . ' - Well , come on , darling ! - You knew ? How did you know ? Well , I just happened to find a couple of tickets on the floor ... Two tickets , on the floor ? - See , I was preoccupied ... - Colonel Straker . Can I have word with you , please , sir ? Please , it 's important . What 's wrong , darling ? Listen , sweetheart , I don 't know how to tell you ... What is it , Ed ? I have to see General Henderson . Now . Now ? But Ed ... ! It 's all right , darling . I understand . - I 'm so sorry , sweetheart ... - ' Passengers for flight BE 250 It 's all right . I married a colonel in the military intelligence . That 's part of your fatal attraction . Come in ! Ahh , Colonel ! Good to see you . - How are they treating you , sir ? - Fine , fine . Sit down . - Sorry to foul you up like this . - That 's all right , sir . - How did your wife take it ? - She 's fine . That 's what you need in this job , an understanding wife . Let 's get on with it , shall we ? I 'm stuck in this chair for another two months . A lot of things are gonna fall on your shoulders . The United Nations special committee meets day after tomorrow . - We get the decision then . - You want me there ? Who else ? 'Turn around , Colonel . ' - Ahh , Colonel Straker . - Gentlemen . - Please sit down . - Thank you . I should like to apologise on behalf of General Henderson for his absence . He 's still recovering from injuries he received in the car crash . Thank you , Colonel . No doubt you will make an excellent substitute . Now , gentlemen , I suggest the best way for us to proceed is by a process of question and answer . Colonel , as representatives of our respective governments we are being asked to approve the largest financial appropriation ever envisaged for a international project . Two questions : Is the project , the whole project , absolutely necessary ? And if it is , are we getting value for money ? I believe the setting up of SHADO is as necessary as absolutely vital . Every day we sit about and talk about it , the potential danger increases . As to your second question , I believe this breakdown of expenditure might be helpful . A fleet of submarines ? Base on the moon ? Satellites ? If I might point out , sir , these are alien spacecraft , possibly from another solar system . Maybe you have been reading too much science fiction . Earth is faced with a power threat from an extraterrestrial source . This is an age when science fiction has become fact . We need to defend ourselves . And how long will it take to set up this defence organisation ? We estimate 7 to 10 years . 10 years ? ! But you say , Colonel , the danger is imminent . That 's true but the organisation we need can 't be set up overnight . All I say is any delay only increases the danger . The estimate for security is astronomical . - It 's a vital aspect . - Everything seems vital . How is SHADO to be organised regarding personnel ? On strictly military lines . We hope to recruit the best people available . - Internationally ? - Yes . And who will command this international band of heroes ? My government has stipulated it must be an American . Yes , we know . - We 're digging deep in our pockets ! - Naturally , naturally . Gentlemen , we asked Colonel Straker here to answer our questions . I suggest we let him do so . There 's no question in my mind , gentlemen . There 's one man for the job : General Henderson . He 's the obvious choice . Any further questions ? Thank you , Colonel Straker . Monsieur Duval , I understand you have three daughters ? Yes . I pray that you never find yourself looking down at one of their mutilated bodies . I hope that the next UFO incident is not in your home town . Thank you for your time . Well , gentlemen ? It has been approved unanimously . You 've done a great job , Ed . I thought I 'd screwed it up , sir . I was only in there 10 minutes . All you 've got to do now is work 16 hours a day for 10 years . Sure . There is another thing I had to tell you . They appointed the commander-in-chief . - Who ? - You . - Me ? - Again , it was unanimous . The French delegate , Duval , was particularly insistent . - But sir ... - Why not choose me ? Come on , let 's not kid ourselves , Colonel . What sort of shape am I in ? What about in ten years ' time ? Nonsense , General . In a couple of months you 'll be up and about , as fit as ever . You can always refuse , but if you do it 's gotta be now . There 'll be no turning back later . Tired ? Oh , no , no . Wanna know something ? I love you . Do you ? How much ? That much . This is a fine room . Plenty of scope . Yes ! Let me see , the master bedroom 's just above us here ? Yes , with a small room to the left . That would make a fine nursery . Yes . I like it . I like it . Hello , darling . - Had a busy day ? - That is an understatement . - You tired ? - No , not too tired . - Hungry ? - Yes . Then I 'll go and make you some supper . - The drapes are coming tomorrow . - Fine . I 've ordered a turquoisey-blue . I hope you like them . Turquoisey-blue ? Oh , that sounds great ! And the insurance agent came . He 's coming tomorrow evening . Sorry , Mary , I have to work late tomorrow . I won 't be home until around 11 . But he 's coming at 8 ! Sorry , I have to work . I 'll go and get your supper . 'Commander Straker and Colonel Freeman , sir . ' Send him right in . Gentlemen , nice to see you . - How are you , General ? - Fine . Our first recruit , Alec Freeman . - Freeman , welcome to SHADO . - Thank you , sir . I 've glanced through your record . Combat pilot , then air force intelligence , that 's the background we need . Ed , how do you like the office ? Looks very nice . I 've been kicked up here to keep a fatherly eye on you . - I 'm holding the purse strings . - That could be fun . How is the building programme coming on ? Fine , fine . Sit down , Freeman . The studio may be worth a visit in a couple of months . - It 's quite a construction job . - Yes , it is . The main problem is still finding the men to man it . We 're working on it . Right . Let 's get down to business . This could be a very late night . Hiya , sweetheart . That a good book ? All right , I 'm sorry I didn 't telephone . I got tied up . Do you know what time it is ? Why didn 't you go to bed ? Because just occasionally I 'd like to see my husband ! Maybe even talk to him ! Things have been hectic but they 'll break soon , Mary . Ed , this is our home , we 're supposed to be trying to build something ! - Mary , Mary ... - No , Ed ! How am I expected to take this work , work , day and night ? ! Because it 's necessary ! Next you won 't even bother to come home at all . That 's not a bad idea . Then maybe I 'd get a decent reaction from my wife ! I 'm sorry , honey . I didn 't mean that . Look , I need a break . We both need one . What do you say we go out sometime next week and paint the town red ? What do you say ? Confetti check ? A - OK . - Block 's nearly finished . - Yes . What happens then ? When it 's finished a government department 's moving in . - Income tax , probably . - All that for the sake of security ? How can you cover the excavating of 2 million cubic feet of earth ? I hear they 're installing a voiceprint ID mechanism . I tried the prototype last week . It identified me as a female technician from Dublin . - They said it 's a teething problem . - Well , you do look like one . A female technician from Dublin . Nice to see you smile again , Ed . Hello , fellas . - Hello , sir . - Hello , sir . - How 's it all going ? - Slow but we 'll get there . - We can make it up later . - Good . That 's what I like to hear . - Let 's take a look at the office . - See you later . Well ... it 's all beginning to take shape . Yes , this is it . SHADO HQ . The nerve centre of the whole organisation . You know , Alec , setting all this , the delays , the problems , security , personnel , a thousand details , a hundred hold-ups , sometimes seems like we 're fighting a ten-headed monster . And what drives you on ? Fighting the monster . I don 't know . Something inside me , I guess . It 's called dedication . Pig-headedness would be nearer . - How 's Mary ? - Mary ? She 's fine . Fine . No , she 's not , Alec . She 's ... She 's problem number 1 . Alec ... I want to tell her . You can 't do that . Not everything , just enough for her to understand . - It 's impossible ! - She 's got to know . She 's got to realise how important all this is , how much time it takes . How else can I make her understand ? It 's out of the question , you know it . What can I do , Alec ? There must be something . But there isn 't . Do you really want to risk Mary 's life ? That 's what you 'd be doing . I don 't like this any more than you but you know what Security are like . Make the CIA look like Sunday school teachers . If you told Mary and they found out ... The security of this , billions of dollars , outweighs any individual . You , me , Mary , anybody . You can 't tell her . It 's the safest way . The only way . - Hello , darling . - Sweetheart . Looking very , smart tonight . Thank you . How was work ? About the same as yesterday and the day before that ... What did you do today ? Oh , nothing very much . - Drink ? - You know I don 't drink . This is ... an occasion . You mean ... ? Here , you , you sit down here . - I have to make a phone call ! - You 're not working tonight ? I have to get onto that decorator , get him to paint that nursery blue ! Pink . Blue . We 're working night and day , General , why shouldn 't some fool subcontractor do the same ? A week ? I 'll give him 3 days to deliver . Right . Goodbye . - We can 't find the fault , sir . - Keep checking . Don 't look like that , you 're not the only one with a home to go to . Put me through to Supply . All right , switch on again . Yes , yes . Let me know as soon as you can . Thanks . - Trouble on the computer interface . - Oh , no . Let 's hope it 's just a plug-in circuit and nothing more serious . 0218434 . Oh , it 's you , mother . How are you ? Yes , yes , I 'm fine . Yes , I went to see him today . He confirmed the first week in April . Of course . Ed . No , he 's working late . Yes , I ... I know , Mother , but ... It 's his job , he ... No , I 'm ... No , mother , don 't be silly , of course there 's not another woman . No . Yes ... Look , I 've got to go . I 'll ring you tomorrow . Bye . All right , let 's try it again . Seems fine . - Let 's call it a day , eh ? - Yes , sir . Good night . And thanks , fellas . It 's late . You can come back to my place , save you the drive . Yeah , maybe , Alec , maybe . I 'll phone Mary and explain in the morning . Mary ! I was supposed to phone her 3 hours ago . - Hello , Mary . - Hi . - How do you feel ? - I 'm fine . Why aren 't you in bed ? I was waiting for you to come home . For four hours , waiting . What am I supposed to think ? - Come on ... - No ! Why come home at all ? ! Why didn 't you spend the whole night with her ? - With who ? - You tell me , Ed . What a crazy idea , Mary . Come on , let 's go to bed . Why is it a crazy idea ? If it 's so crazy tell me where you 've been . - Come on . - Where have you been ? - You know I can 't tell you ! - Oh , break the bloody rule for once ! - I 'm your wife ! - And you know I can 't tell you ! I wouldn 't ... Just calm down and let 's go to bed . No ! I have a right to know . - Mary , stop this ! - What 's more important ? Me or whatever you do until 3 in the morning ? I 'm going up . I love you . I 'm going to have your child . When he 's born , when he 's old enough to realise , will he have a father or a man he hardly knows ? Someone he sees every now and then ? Mary ... I hope you still have a choice , Ed . Perhaps you should decide before it 's too late . The control complex is fully operational . All we need now are the technicians . How are the first batch of recruits making out ? Security checks , aptitude tests , six-month training , more tests . It 's a tough schedule . - The original 50 are now 8 . - 8 ? The second batch seem to be doing better . When will the first group finish their training ? A few months . It 'll be spring , a good time to start . Spring . My son will be born in the spring . Your son ? How ... Your place ? My place . Well , it 's been a long hard slog but we 're ready . We 're ready . I know how hard you 've all worked . I think we can assume the worst is over . And I want to thank you all . Thank you , sir . Mary ! Mary ? Mary ! What are you doing ? - I 'm leaving . - Leaving ? You shouldn 't be carrying that case . I 'm leaving you , Ed . I 've explained it all in the letter . Wait a minute ... If something 's the matter I want to hear it from you . I know . Don 't you understand ? I know everything . What do you know ? Tell me what you know ! My mother had you followed . Go on . You were followed to the flat ... with the girl . Oh , is that it ? Don 't touch me ! - Mary , darling , I can explain ! - Don 't ! It 's dirty enough , don 't lie ... Mary ! The man was here this morning . He ... He had a photograph with the time , everything . Darling , I can explain ! - I don 't want to hear ! - Listen ! - Give me my case . - You 're gonna stay here and listen ! - What 's going on in there ? ! - I 'm coming , dad ! - No , Ed , I 've had enough ! - All right ! I 'll tell you everything ! - It 's no good , Ed ! - This may sound crazy ... - Don 't ! Don 't ! Don 't ! - Mary ! Mary ? Mary , what 's the matter ? ! Open the door , Mary ! God ! Don 't touch her ! Your wife has an internal haemorrhage . I 'll have to perform a Caesarean section . Doctor , if there 's any complication ... If you have to choose between my wife and ... I understand . It 's a boy . - How 's my wife ? - The doctor will be out in a moment . - How is she , Dr ? - As well as can be expected . - She 'll be all right ? - Yes . - When can I see her ? - When she wakes up . - But only for a few minutes . - How 's my son ? He 's fine . Ed ? It 's me , my dear . How do you feel ? Fine . Where 's Ed ? Ed said he had to go , he ... He said he couldn 't tell me why . I know why . Now , you just get well again and we 'll sit down quietly with your mother and have a chat . I 'm sorry about this , Ed . I wouldn 't have done it if it hadn 't been necessary . Anyway ... Congratulations . There 's too much cigar smoke around here , Alec . Tell someone to turn on the fan and get rid of it . Right . - Lieutenant Grey ! - Yes , sir ? Take a week 's furlough , starting now . That 's an order . Right , sir . As for the rest of us , let 's do a little work while we celebrate .

 One more day to go . Yep , one more day . Then , back to my favourite planet : earth . - Grant , we 're gonna miss you . - Sure No , having a character like you around breaks the monotony . I 'd love to stay , really , but ... You got 100 chicks just waiting for you to call . Well , let 's not go overboard . 80 or 90 maybe . - More coffee ? - Thank you , sir . Pressure leak ! Bill ! Bill ! Bill ! New port secure and tested . Repressurized . I want every part of this sphere searched . I want the remains of that port collected and reconstructed . I want the answer . Astronaut William Grant , killed in the line of duty , April 12th , 1981 . There 's your answer . We 've calculated that the projectile was fired from rocks about 200 metres from the base . The chemical analysis hasn 't told us much except it 's part alloy . One of the constituents is unknown on earth . You 're saying that a UFO landed on the moon , undetected , and one of its occupants got out and fired this projectile at Moonbase ? 3 days ago some meteorites played havoc with our tracking system . - It could have landed then ? - Yes , yes . Then took off again after the attack ? No , the interference didn 't last long enough . It 's still on the moon . The Interceptors are searching 24 hours . - And if they find it ? - My orders are seek and destroy . When is the next lunar launch possible ? 'At 1400 hours tomorrow , sir . ' Alec , I 'm going back to Moonbase with Commander Foster . You will assume command here . - Right . - Alec , get me everything we 've got on the disintegration of UFOs in the earth 's atmosphere . Give me 30 minutes . Commander , I want you to countermand your orders to the Interceptors . Tell them to seek and observe . Yes , I know , I know . The natural reaction is to want to hit back . I liked Bill Grant , too . But we know a UFO disintegrates if it stays too long on earth . All our evidence suggests it has some reaction with our atmosphere . And there 's no atmosphere on the moon . Exactly . This may be our best chance ever to get our hands on a UFO , intact . Foster , we won 't be able to leave for another 23 hours . Why don 't you go somewhere and unwind ? Yeah , I think maybe you 're right . I 'll leave an address where you can contact me . I think I know where . - Paul ! - Hi . Paul , they 're beautiful ! Why didn 't you call ? I look such a mess . Well , Foster , we 'll be home in time for supper . Home ? Moonbase . Tell one of the astronauts to get those aerial photos , that 's the first thing he 'll ask for . The second thing , Space Tracker Harrington . The first thing is a cup of coffee . It helps to organize that . - Miss Barry ! - Yes , sir ? I met your father last month . I was happy to tell him you 're doing well . Thank you , sir . Now , if you 'd ask someone to take the aerial photos to the Leisure Sphere . Sir . Harrington , that 's with cream and sugar , please . Yes , sir . Infrared from 30,000 feet . - You say it 's in there ? - Yes , sir . Here 's a blow-up . Ah , yes ... There it is . How long would it take a Moon Mobile to get to that area ? - It 's just below the Terminator . - All right , let 's set it up . I suggest we use two Mobiles , two men in each . Who do you suggest as crew ? - I 'd like a crack at that , sir . - Thank you . Mark can handle it . He knows the area . - Fine . Choose a navigator . - Thank you , sir . Now , that just leaves the other Moon Mobile . I 'll pick my own crew as well . I suggest we use a missiles operative . As Moonbase commander , your place is in the Control Sphere . Maybe , sir . But I was the one who saw Bill Grant 's face as he tried to make it to that airlock . 4 to Control , three miles from Terminator . 'Roger . ' They 'll soon be in darkness . Tell them to stick together . Control to Mobiles , maintain close visual contact . Roger , Control . - Did you hear that , Mark ? - Don 't worry , sir . I 'll be breathing down your neck all the way . 'Just under 2 miles from target . ' Foster , at the first sign of trouble , get out and I 'll send the Interceptors in . Understood ? Understood . But we won 't need them . Out . Lights . Mark , we should be able to see them from the top of the next ridge . - ' Leave the Mobile . We 'll go in on foot . ' - Roger . Right , let 's go . - It 's there all right . - Any sign of life ? No . Control , have positive sighting of UFO . 'Position ? ' In the centre of a crater , as in the aerial shot . - What does it look like ? - Difficult to say , but it could have been damaged on landing . And the radiation check ? Negative . It 's just sitting there . I suppose it 's possible it might be abandoned . There 's only one way to find out . - We 'll move in in 2 minutes . - Right . Yellow alert ! All air supplies A-OK . Time check . 11 : 04 : 45 ... now . Check . There 's a rock just over that ridge . Wait till the guy ahead reaches it before you move . - Right . Who 's first in line ? - My privilege . - I 'll follow you . - Then Brad and Don . Any questions ? - We could run into an alien . - Remember they 're expendable . We want the UFO . Hold it ! Get down ! Control , the UFO has opened fire on us . Red alert . Interceptors : immediate launch . Program onboard computers for attack . Get out of there . Fast ! Send the Interceptors . Tell them to hold fire till I say . - Are you OK ? - Yeah . - Straker says to pull out . - We 're pinned down here . - I 'll get the Moon Mobile . - What if the UFO takes off ? It 's a chance I 've got to take . Give me 2 minutes . ETA target , 4 minutes . This is Control . How soon you 'll be clear ? A couple of minutes , sir . - What 's the hold-up ? - We 'll be clear any minute now , sir . Fall back to the Mobiles . Come in , Mark . Can you hear me ? Come in , Mark . Can you hear me ? Come in , Mark . Mark ! Interceptors : 90 seconds from target . Something must have gone wrong . Come on . Let 's go . The Interceptor leader has visual contact . The UFO 's lifting off . Order the attack ! Take cover ! Maybe he was thrown clear . If I thought there was one chance in 10 million . - It could happen . - You said the Mobile was destroyed . No . It 's a bad business , Alec . One Moon Mobile totally destroyed , the other so badly damaged it 's a miracle it made it back . The Moon Mobiles can be replaced . And Commander Foster can 't . Yes . 'That 's one of the reasons I 'm staying here for a few days . 'A new commander will have to be appointed . ' - I didn 't mean that . - ' I know . ' I feel the same way . Alec , there 's one thing you can do for me . Foster had no close relatives but there was someone . - ' A girl ? ' - Yes . She was as close to him as anyone . - I think she should be told . - All right . - What 's her name ? - ' Tina Duval . 'Apartment 19 , Windermere Hall . ' Right . - Miss Duval ? - Yes . My name is Alec Freeman , a friend of Paul Foster . Relax , Lieutenant , relax . I was just gonna grab some sleep , sir , Yes , it 's been a long 12 hours . Mark , I 'm sure you realise how important this base is . It 's a vital link in our defence system . Whoever commands it has one of the most responsible jobs in SHADO . I 'd like you to consider it , Mark . - Are you offering me the job , sir ? - Yes . Does that surprise you ? Not altogether . And does it surprise you if I say no ? Well , it disappoints me . You 've done your duty . You 've asked and I 've given you the " no " you wanted . What do you mean " I 've done my duty " ? After Foster I 'm the senior man . The obvious choice if you like . So , I offer you the command of Moonbase and you say no . Why ? I asked you why . - Because of this . - Don 't give me that . Racial prejudice burned itself out 5 years ago . How would you know ? All right , on the surface maybe . But deep down it 's still there . Maybe it will never show and maybe it will . Like some time I 'm ordering a guy out on a mission , a time the chances are he won 't come back . Look , I 'm not offering you some easy number . I don 't care if you 're polka dot with red stripes . Do you want the job ? Do you want it ? ! Yes , sir , I would like it . But not like this . No one wanted it like this . Now , you get some rest ... Commander . 'Astronaut Watson please report to Medical . ' - Morning , sir . - Morning . Can I just say we 're glad to have you with us , sir . Thank you very much . This is Control to Moon Mobile 3 , proceed to area 183 as instructed . 'Yes , sir . ' - You 've sent out a Mobile ? - Yes , sir . - To the UFO crater ? - Yes . To look for wreckage of the UFO . I did not know I needed your permission . You don 't , Commander . Carry on . I 'll take her a couple of degrees over to port . There 's a bad crevasse field about ten miles on . - We 'll go round it . - Right . I see what you mean . - About what ? - That crevasse field . Rough terrain . Help . Help ! Help ! Over here ! Help ! Hold it , sir ! Over here ! They 've seen us . Come on , wake up ! We 're saved . They 've seen us ! We 're OK ! Bring an air cylinder . Hurry ! Listen , listen . We 're safe . We 're safe . They 've found us . Now , now ... You ... stay here . Do you understand ? You ... stay here . Listen ... there 's an alien ! He 's back there . He saved my life . He 's a friend . - He 's trying to say something . - His radio 's US . Can 't you hear me ? An alien ! OK , Commander , we can 't hear you . Right , let 's lift him up . Don 't you understand ? He 's a friend ! - Take it easy , Commander . - What 's he trying to say ? Let 's get him back to the Moon Mobile . - Shall we carry him , sir ? - Hold it a minute . Listen , there 's an alien . He 's a friend . He saved my life . ... an alien ! Alien ? ! - He said something about an alien ! - An alien ? ! No ! No ! No ! You 're right , I don 't understand . I 'm told you 're dead and you 're alive ! And you walk in here as if nothing has happened . I can 't take it any more . You 've always known there are things I can 't tell you . About your job . But does it come before everything ? Even me ? Tina ... I 'm sorry . So am I , Paul . Paul ! Can I buy you a drink , Alec ? Fine .

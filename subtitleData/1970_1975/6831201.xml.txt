 Hornet-gun . Check . Hornet-sting . Check . Let 's roll , Kato . Why do you suppose Hurk wants to meet in the park ? He 's frightened . Doesn 't want eyes orears around . Do you trust him ? Two weeks ago the answerwould have been " No " . Tonight ? Who knows . There 's the carriage house . No Hurk. I wonderwhat ... Hornet ! Over here ! Wait , wait ! It 's me , Hurk . I hope this will be afriendly meeting . How many " friends " have you dumped in the river ? Look , I 'm trying to do you afavor . Someone is out to take care ofthe big racket guys . And you and me are on the list . How do you know about the list ? Nevermind . But I 'm not gonna be a pushover And if you go along with me , neitherwill you . How do you know about the list ? It 's bought and paid for . What else have you bought ? If we work together I 'll tell you . Otherwise ... We 're gonna play it my way . You first . Who did the killings ? Don 't push me , Hornet . You need me ! I don 't need you . I never have and I neverwill . Don 't you forget that . Let 's go . Hornet ! Wait ! Listen ! Don 't touch it. lt 's poisoned . No ! Listen . Come on ! Don 't lose him . No chance . Nothing we can do here . What gives with the racketeers ofthis town ? What about them ? Two weeks ago , Kilton , the trucking racket . He gets it . Afew nights later , Al Alberts , jukeboxes . Last Wednesday , Klinger , gambling . And last night Mel Hurk , the numbers boss . Good. lfthey keep at it , maybe they 'll finish each otheroff . That 's not the point . Listen . Kilton , killed by bow and arrow . Alberts , strangled with a silk handkerchief Like a rat . Yeah , I guess that 's whythey call it . Then Klinger buys the whole package with a native spear . And Hurk , a poisoned dart . They don 't die like they should . The effect 's the same . But who 's doing it ? That 's the puzzle . There 's a call foryou on the private line . Thanks , Miss Case . Excuse me , Mike . Playthe story up big . Yeah , sure . What 's happened to the good old days ? It 's the district attorney . I got the scrambleron . Yes , Frank ? I got what you wanted , Britt . The id ofthat accident victim that you chased . Are you sitting down ? Why , who was it ? H. J. Clark . A respectable accountant with no mob ties at all . I knew Clark ! He was a member ofthe yacht club . Nice little guy . Any chance that you were chasing the wrong man ? None , Frank . Thanks . There 's a pattern forming here . But which way does it lead ? To the list that Hurk bought and paid for . And the person from whom he got it . Now , hold on , dammit . Just you listen to me . Hurk 's dead , d 'you hear me ? Hurk 's dead . From here on you 'll be taking orders from me . The operation goes on in the same way . Youjust make yourcollections like always ! Some ofthe nutheads you have to do business with these days ! Who are you ? Any more unfriendly greetings ? Come on , Hornet . All you had to do was knock ! Then you would have misunderstood the purpose of my visit . You didn 't waste much time moving in behind Hurk 's desk . Somebody had to run the operation . I was numbertwo . Maybe with the idea to become numberone ? D 'you mean that I knocked Hurk off ? Not necessarily . But maybe you know who did . You got me all wrong . How would I know ? He did . But he was killed before he could tell me . I wanna know who told him . Beats me . Wait a minute . You got ten seconds . OK . But I 'm only second guessing . Hurk got a call fromjockey Tabor . The tout ? He 's not touting , he 's stealing . I figured Hurk would hand up . But instead he sets up this meeting . Who do theythink they 're pushing around . Put your hands up ! Keep them up and don 't try anytricks . Too late . Not very , just enough . His body is still warm . This is no coincidence , Kato . That 's what I was thinking . Now , what ? Check around the room . Look fora lead , any kind of lead . Crane , this plan of yours has gone too far . We agreed on our list . Then you went and killedjockey Tabor , why ? Killing that innocent little man was not on ourschedule . He was only a waiter here . Innocent little man , you say . ? No danger , you say ? Listen to me , and listen to me good ! Who do you think you 're speaking to ? We 're not yourservants , Crane . You three men are as deeply involved in this hunt as I am . Before you go further , rememberthat last night there were five of us . Jockey Taborwas responsible forthe death of ourfellow Clark . He was discharged for bookmaking three days ago . And at that time he approached me and tried to blackmail me . It seems he overheard bits and pieces of ourconversations . and , unfortunately , totaled them correctly . You denied everything . Of course . And threw him out of my office . How does that fit into Clark 's death ? Simple . He found another buyer forthe information . That means that we 're all in danger . Isn 't that the game we 've always played ? We faced the fiercest animals thejungle could offer us . And we 're still here . Some day soon , we 'll be recognized forwhat we 've achieved . Ridding the city ofthe scum , ofthe archcriminals that sucked our blood from the veins of existence . Gentlemen , I propose atoast forthe next target on our list . The biggest game of all : the Green Hornet . Sir , may I help you ? I 'm interested in applying for membership . But this is not a regularclub , sir . The requirements are unusual , big game hunting , exploring ... I 've done a little of both . Here 's my card . Mr Reid . Of course . If you make yourself comfortable , I 'll get MrCrane . He 's chairman ofthe membership committee . Fine . Britt , how are you ? Hi , Quent . Haven 't seen you in a long time . I was asking about you at the country club . Hasn 't my advertisement department been paying its bills ? Seriously , I 've been away fora year . Africa and the Near East . My latest trophy . Mean looking guy . And atricky one , too . Come on , sit down . Thanks . What 's this about your wanting tojoin the club ? That 's one ofthe reasons I 'm here , Quent . There 's anotherone . Have you read about our latest crime wave ? I never miss my copy ofthe Sentinel . I even had it sent to me overseas . Then maybe you can tell me what I 'm curious about . The strange way in which the racketeers have died , the unusual weapons used . Odd you should mention that . I was puzzling on that this morning . It 's as though someone were trying to implicate this club . What do you think ? Frankly , Britt , I think it 's ridiculous . I 've known every memberofthis club fortoo many years . There 's not one capable of killing . Then what about the connection with H. J. Clark 's death ? He was a memberofthe club . That 's what started me thinking I 'll tell you what I 'll do. I 'll run a little investigation myself . Look back in the membership applications . If I turn up anything , I 'll give you a call . Good. I 'd appreciate that . And let 's keep this conversation between ourselves . You have my word . If you 're still interested injoining I can send you an application . Do that , Quent . See you . This is Crane . I want a man taken care of . His name 's Britt Reid . You mean Reid ? Britt Reid ? The publisher ? That 's crazy ! It 'll blowthis town wide open ! He might do that anyway . He 's getting close to some answers . Too close . But I 'm not set up forthat kind of a rub-out ! Then get set up. I gave you Hurk 's spot with the understanding that you 'd take my orders without question . But , boss ... No buts . Do it ! Thanks , Kato . You see who they are ? Yeah . Crocker 's men . Yeah ? I don 't know yet . I thought this was them calling . I 'll let you know . Sir . Come on , Hornet . You 're gonna break me , getting that doorfixed ! The information I have might make that very unimportant . What are you trying to tell me ? Whatjockey Tabortold me . But he 's dead . We know . We watched him die . You mean , you got there while he was still alive ? Just barely . But he managed to whisperafew last words . Quentin Crane . Crane ? Ijust had anothervisit from the Green Hornet . Nevermind about that . What about Reid ? You listen to me . He says I 'm on your list . And you believe him ? He said Tabortold him before he died . Listen , Crocker , I took care of Tabor myself . He couldn 't have told anything . I 'm not afumbler . And why do you suppose the Hornet said what he did ? I can onlythink oftwo reasons . One , he wants to come between us . " Divide and conquer . " Yeah . He could trythat . Got him on the action , huh ? Or ... This is what I want you to do . The speartrap is set . Good . Ifthat doesn 't get him , the snare will . Excellent . You haven 't told us how you 're going to get the Green Hornet here . The method is unimportant . It 's the end result that counts . And afew minutes will give us the answer . What do you think ? Probablythe same as you . He knows he 's being followed , that 's exactly what he wants . I can see everyone who enters and leaves that gate . It would be a marvelous thing to have in thejungle . You sit in the comfort of your lorry until the game shows up . Who 's that ? That , gentlemen , is the bait . The bait ? What do you mean ? Look . To yourstations ! No guns . Why no guns ? We have every policeman on the area on us . We 'll use bows and arrows . Silent and efficient . Ok . Let 's go . What 's the plan ? It 's their plan . Who knows what they have planned for us . It 's not good , we knowthat . Don 't look , but there 's a camera up above us in that tree . Our presence has already been announced . Let 's stick together . Watch out fortraps and snares . That was a near miss . And deliberatelytoo . They 're steering us . They want us at a certain point . There it is . That 's where they want us to go . Now listen carefully We 'll get behind them and herd them toward the snare . Freeze ! Right there ! Here 's one half ofthe quarry . Look , Hornet . Can 't we make a deal . There 's plenty for both of us . No deal , Crane . But my position in the community is a perfect cover . For more murders , including mine . There isn 't room for both of us . Hornet , get me out of here ! That 's one wayto get to the top . But it 's hitting bottom the hard way . Let 's call Scanlon . Let him clean up out here . Let me down from here ! Get me out of here ! Hornet ! " As publisheryou have my assurance that the Sentinel will give full cooperation to yourcharity drive . Please let me know if I can be of furtherassistance . Verytruly yours , etc " . Send a copy to Edwards and society . Anything else ? There 's a memo from the research department on the safety driverseries . I took care ofthat this morning . How about a drink ? What about yourdate ? Plenty oftime . We 're having a late dinner . That 's the least I can offeryou forworking overtime tonight The Sentinel News brings you a special bulletin . And unidentified flying object has reportedly crashed and burned in the fields some two miles outside the city limits . Kato , quickly . - First reports coming in state eye witnesses sighted the object flying due east just before it crashed ... Who 's on the city desk tonight ? Corman . Get him on the phone . Trouble ? - Sounds like it ... this is Mobile Unit 2 at the crash site . Flames and atremendous explosion when the craft reportedly crashed have consumed the entire object , leaving debris spread overthe area . Seconds before the craft exploded and burst into flames , 6 to 8 persons exited the object and race across the open fields ... Hold on for Mr Reid . ... returning nowto News Sentinel . Bill ? What 's the story on that crash ? Several people sawthe saucer flying East . Then it started to wobble , lost control and crashed . A reportjust came in . There 's a rumoraround town that we 're being invaded from outerspace . The people are beginning to panic . The highways leading out ofthe city are beginning to swell up . I 'll send out all available mobile crews to coverthat . Bring the cararound , Kato . Get Scanlon . Good evening , Mr Reid . You 've killed him . He 's merely stunned , my dear . Vamajust used a manutraction overpower . Take him overthere . You are an extremely lovely young woman , my dear . I hope we will have mutually pleasant memories of our meeting . Who are you ? We 're wayfarers , Mr Reid . Wayfarers on an interruptedjourney . What we want is yourcomplete cooperation . 45 minutes ago ourship ran out of control and crashed . You were in that saucer ? Precisely . You don 't expect us to believe that you are visitors from space ? I not only expect you to believe it . I insist upon it . We do not wish to remain here any longerthan necessary . That is why we sought you out . Why me ? Yourtelevision station . You are telling yourfellow citizens to leave us alone . All we want is safe passage out ofthe cityto an unpopulated area . Where one of oursisterships can land and pick us up . And if I refuse ? Vama . Tell Mr Reid what would happen if he refused . At this moment five of ourships are hovering high above us . Unless you do exactly as Litta asks they shall destroy yourentire city in an instant . Well ? You got all the answers worked out , haven 't you ? You are wasting precious time , my friend . Surelythe intelligence level here on ... Earth . ... yes ... is up to accepting simple logic . The highways are filling with panicked people . Panic breeds more panic . It 's bound to be accidents . Needless deaths . Now , what betterthing can you do , as a responsible TVstation owner , than to make a simple announcement suggesting that the people remain offthe streets , calmly remain in their homes , and arrange to give us clear passage out ofthe city . Why not be the voice of reason in a moment of panic ? Do you have a camerato cut into programs foremergency announcements ? Why use violence , Mr Reid , when logic should triumph ? Among the higheranimals , at least . Don 't you agree , Vama ? Logic should triumph . Among the higheranimals , at least . I 'll make the announcement . Marvelous . This is Britt Reid , publisher ofthe Daily Sentinel and general managerof DSTV . Here 's a special announcement . Until all the facts ofthe crash ofthe flying object are known , I urge all citizens to remain calm . There 's no evidence that the city is in any danger . The only danger is from ourown panic . I urge all citizens to remain calm . Alright , whateveryou 're up to . Call the authorities . Tell them I want secondary route 210 out ofthe city and highway 7W18 cleared of all traffic fora distance of 15 miles both East and West . They won 't do it . Why not ? All we want is the roads to be absolutely clear when ourship lands to pick us up . We 'll take you with us , my dear . The slightest deviation from my request and you 'll neversee this charming young lady again . Vama ! Please , sit down , Miss Case . Anything ? No signal yet . What happened ? Where are they ? They got Casie . Kato , get ... Wait ! Ijust had word from the Air Forces . They 're sending top secret electronic equipment through this area within they are . That includes an H-bomb missile warhead . You know what road the truck is taking ? The same one we 'vejust cleared . The leader . Ten years ago I covered a story . He was booted out ofthe atomic energy program forconducting unauthorized nucleartests . He destroyed a multimillion dollartest center . Two lab assistants were killed . He must have found out about the shipment and forwhatever reason he 's afterthe H-bomb . The police have cleared the way for miles around And he has Casie . I 'll go to my car radio . We got to get there on time ! Let 's go , Kato . The Green Hornet can travel faster . If he harms Casie ... Mabouse ! That 's the leader . Dr Eric Mabouse . If he gets the bomb , what are the chances of it exploding ? The warheads are nevertransported with the detonators on board . But it would be easier for Mabouse to make one . He may have a plan , he thinks he 's fail-safe . But his sure-fire experiments have blown up before . If he slips up with an H-bomb , this whole area will be destroyed . Kato , we 're dealing with a man of infinite brilliance and madness . He publicly airs the use of nuclear weapons against aggressor nations . He may have the scheme to drop an H-bomb on aforeign country . If he does not retaliate , ourcountry might be at stake Central communications calling Air Force Conway . Air Force Conway , come in . Do you read me ? Come in . Over . Now what ? There 's only one way to find out , sergeant . This is Airforce Conway . We read you loud and clear . Over . Air Force Conway ... Air Force Conway ... You can 't beat this modern equipment . Ten years ago I offered them communication channels that couldn 't bejammed . Afool and his bomb are soon parted . What happens ? Probably some hand operator jamming the channel , sir . Leave the channel open and see if it clears . I 've always been a man of simple taste , Miss Case . Ijust like the best . Wine , women and power . It 's all so childish . Martin , do lowerthe loudspeaker , won 't you ? is that the Air Force Frequency ? Positive . Switch overto the police band . Mabouse doesn 't miss atrick . Vama , go outside and prepare . The scanner 's signal . Casie ! Switch over to the higher beam . We 'll tryto track her with the oscilloscope . I 'm done with the trigger mechanism . Would you like to check it ? Of course . Keep the safety switches on till the very last second . Yes , sir . It looks like the Air Force truck and the escort vehicle . They 're ten minutes early . But that 'll throw ourschedule off . Youjust can 't depend on people these days . Still . What 's 10 min when you hold the fate of millions in your hands ? What are you talking about ? What 's going to happen ? They 'll reach us in ... 6 min and 10 seconds . Kerry , tell Vamathey 're in . Miss Case , I hope you enjoyed living dangerously . Because in afew minutes we 're gonna take a new passengeraboard . An H-bomb warhead . They 'll never let you get away with it . I beg to differ . They won 't have any otherchoice . And before they know what 's happening I will have armed the warhead . And I , Miss Case , will have my fingeron the trigger . What are you going to do with it ? What am I going to do with it ? What does one do with an H-bomb ? I 'm going to drop it . Come now , Miss Case . I insist youjoin me . Shugo ! Be so kind as to kill her . Up the road ! It was onlythe transisolator , no problem . No . No problem at all . Come on ! Casie is moving . And fast . She orthe scanner . She may no have it on her . She 's changing direction now . It 's getting stronger . There she goes ! The signal 's changing direction again . It 's coming from overthere . Stay in the car . Spread out ! Help me , please , help me ! It 's the Green Hornet ! She 's going into the incinerator . Let her burn ! What ? Who the devil are you ? Before you do anything foolish , I must warn you . I 've armed the warhead . If you make any move I shall blow us all to kingdom come . If I press this button , the device on the side ofthe truck will detonate the warhead . At this range everyone in the city will be instantly annihilated . We should make contact with the truck soon . Keep the sensor running , Kato . From what Casie told us , he has that truck outfitted with ultrasensitive detection equipment . This is got to be it. turn it off . We should be right on top ofthem . They must have pulled the truck offthe road . Turn offthere . We have to move carefully , Kato . ... to thejunction and you go on ahead , Shugo. ls that clear ? Shugo , I ask , is that clear ? Yeah , it 's clear . ... then here ... A mirror ! And a loudspeaker . Don 't turn around , Green Hornet . Throw down yourweapons . Yourweapons , please . It 's all done with mirrors , isn 't it , Hornet ? I 've been an ardent admirerof yours forquite some time . We should get along well , then . And this can only be Kato . You 've both wondered farafield , haven 't you ? When there 's action , I like to be in on it . You thought if I dropped the ball perhaps you 'd pick it up ? Something like that . If anyone drops this ball , dearfriend , they 'll pick us all up . In little pieces . You 'll never pull this off , Mabouse . Correction. I already have . And not only do I have the warhead , I also have the Green Hornet . What about the police ? Yourconcern for my well-being is most touching . In fact to show my deep appreciation , I will let you act as my stand-in . What will the police conclude when they discoverShugo with you ? Exactly , my friends . That the Green Hornet masterminded the entire operation . What about the warhead ? Gone . Spirited away by double-crossing underlings . A neat solution to my problem , wouldn 't you say ? The Hornet-sting is aimed directly at the car . I 've set the mechanism so that , after it 's activated , the slightest movement inside the car oron the road will trigger it . The explosives underneath the car will take care ofthe rest . Please , let me go ! Afteryou , gentlemen I knowthe police are staying afew miles back . And as soon as we pull out they 'll move forward a little . Even if you remain still as statues they 'll pass here in minutes . And the vibration caused bytheircar will be more than enough . What are we gonna do ? The first thing we 're gonna do is stay calm . There 's no way out . Listen . I 'm going to fire the rear rocket . It mightjolt the carforward farenough to clearthe explosion . There should be a split second between the time that I fire the rockets and the Sting reactivates the explosives . In that instant the carshould move away . What if it doesn 't move fast enough ? It 's the only chance that we got ! When that police cargets in the area its vibrations are gonna set offthe explosives How close is your hand to the rocket switch ? About 3 or4 inches . He said any movement would set that thing off ! We 'rejust going to have to risk it . I 'm getting out of here . Don 't be afool ! I 've got it . Let 's take this ropes off and get out of here ! Get out the warhead . Put it in that bush overthere . Doctor , you can 't do it . This isn 't what we planned . It was onlyto be used as athreat ! I swore vengeance would be mine . And now , it will be . I beg you , don 't do it . Don 't make me a part of it . Alright then . You 'll stay . No , please. I 'll go with you . Oh no , you 're staying , we 're leaving . Doctor , please . With thatjet he 'll nevertry fora rendezvous at that airstrip . We 'll have to double back . It 's one of Mabouse 's men . Please get me out of here ! Where 's Mabouse ? There 's no time forthat . Listen to me ! You 're gonnatell me where Mabouse is , and the warhead . He 's gone , and if we don 't get out of here we 'll blow sky-high ... There won 't be no sky-high . Where is it ? The warhead 's there in the bush but he 's off with the detonator . Can he set it off by remote control ? Yes . Can you disarm the bomb ? No . He 's gonna wait until he gets farenough and then blow it . Exactly what he has to do to detonate it ? He activates the button and presses it . Get in . Take off , Kato ! Kato , anything ? Not yet . But even at maximum speed , that van can 't get away from us . If only we could catch up with it , and we had the moment we need . Leave the scanner running . He must have picked us up with his radar . He may not have it running . He must have it running . No , I know him . He 's got the detonator , he doesn 't care about being followed . Out ! Mr Reid ? I knowthe Sentinel has been campaigning against the protection rackets in the city . Who is this ? Nevermind who I am . But if you want a big story foryour newspaper , send a reporterto the Golden Lotus as soon as possible . What 's the matter ? Somebody calling about the Sentinel 's crusade against the protection rackets . With the tip that something 's about to happen at the Golden Lotus Café . The Golden Lotus ? You know it ? Yeah . Get the Black Beauty ready . They 're closing . Forget it , Low Sing ! What are you doing here ? You can 't use our Tong this way any longer . The Tsoy Yen is my Tong . I 'm warning you . Nobody warns Low Sing . What do you want ? Atribute forthe benevolence ofthe Tsoy Yen Tong . Benevolence ? You mean blackmail . Get out ! We 're willing to be reasonable , Win-ho . I said get out ! Or I 'll call the police . He 's gonna be alright . What happened to you ? I ran into a little ambush . Jimmy ! Oh , Jimmy ! It 's not mine . You were one ofthem . My uncle may die , you may have killed him . No , I had nothing to do with it . You must believe me ! ... and although the attack on the Chinese restaurant had all the aspects of Tong rivalry , it is suspected that something more malevolent is reallythe case . As the Daily Sentinel has reported in a series of articles in recent weeks , there has been a resurgence ofthe vicious extortion rackets in the city . It is the Daily Sentinel 's belief that this criminal operation is now attempting to invade the Chinese community . I 'm certainly glad that your newspaper is taking that position . I nevercould buy that Tong warangle . Somebody is using the Tong for his own purposes . There 's one person who knows who it is . Jimmy Kee . You think so ? - l 'm positive Mary Chang thinks he 's one ofthe gang . She 's wrong . That mask was not his . He was unconscious during the raid . Frank , we got to find that boy . I got a hunch we 're not the only ones after him . If he poses athreat to the Tong and they 're after him , they 're gonna silence him permanently . I 'll tell the police to put every available man on search . Kato ? Yeah ? Talk to Mary Chang , see if she knows whereJimmy Kee may be hiding . If we ever meet with that masked kung-fu guy again ... I warned him . You got him . The praying mantis school of Kung-fu has 500 years of refinement . Like herwise founder . You can learn much from watching the mantis himself at work . Note the tightness ofthe defense . Elbows well tucked in . My friend . You delay yourself . Haven 't you heard ? Heard what , MrSlate ? The old man you beat up last night . He 's in pretty bad shape . So ? So you 're supposed to make them buy our insurance . Not to send them to the hospital orthe cemetery . I 'll handle things my way . As long as you 're working for me you 'll handle things my way . And don 't you forget it : I could kill you with one cry . About that kid . The cops are looking for him . He who saw you going in the café last night . What 's his name ? Jimmy Kee . You realize if we don 't get him before they do we 're in serious trouble . Jimmy Kee will come to me , all I have to do ... Do it ! Don 't talk about it . I guess you have this undercontrol . The old man ofthe Tong are frightened . The young men are with me . Except one . Now you find him . I decided to go to the Tsoy Yen , see if I could get someone to talk and when I was walking in , who do you think I saw coming out ? Well ? Duke Slate and a couple of his boys . Who 's Duke Slate ? Among otherthings , the boss ofthe protection rackets on the West side . And now he 's expanding into Chinatown . Looks like it , doesn 't it ? Let 's keep the lead on this until we get the whole story . Sure . Sometimes I can see a bit ofthe old man in you , afterall . Bless his soul . I hope you realize that 's the highest compliment you 'll receive . I know , Miss Case . And it humbles me . Mr Reid 's residence . Kato , this is Mary . Yes , Mary ? I know whereJimmy is . Where ? In the Buddhatemple , at the end ofthe Mandarin park . He called and asked me to meet him at 9 tonight , but ... But what , Mary ? I don 't know what to do ! I can 't explain , something 's happening . I got the feeling ... I 'm being watched ! Mary , this is Britt Reid . Where are you ? In the restaurant . Staythere. I 'll have Miss Case , my secretary , pick you up and take you to herapartment . Thank you , Mr Reid . Thank you . Hold it ! Ladies and gentleman , I 'vejust been handed a bulletin . Atremendous explosion of unknown origin blocked this city 's financial district at 9 this evening . The blast occurred in an alley behind the Central Bank . Police have not yet determined whetheranybody was injured . However ... My dear , I thought you 'd left forthe night . Ijust dropped by to dissolve our partnership . Get him up to the Sentinel room right away . Eden is all set . Nice music . Beethoven ? I think he will like that . So do I . This is afriend of yours , Mr Eden . Afriend in whom you can confide and tell your innermost secrets . Time 's up , Eden . Hi , fellas ! My friend . How did it go tonight ? Hod did what go tonight ? Thejob , tonight , aren 't the boys back yet ? Not yet . Well , it 's a long way back from the race track . The race track ? What 's the matter ? You forgotten ? We 're gonna knock over the Riverview race track tonight . Oh , yes . We had forgotten . Do you think he 's hurt badly ? Just stunned . We 'll take him to Scanlon . Maybe he 'll tell Frank what happened outside the Golden Lotus last night . He will , I knowJimmy . Then Frank will have them right where he wants them . Hello ? What ? No , you go on home , Miss Case . Mary Chang has been kidnapped . Kidnapped ? But why ? Do you thinkJimmy would talk if it means endangering Mary ? No . Obviously , Slate and his friends don 't either . OK . We gotJimmy , they got Mary . What do we do now ? There 's one thing we can 't do . We can 't turn him overto Scanlon . And although the police refuses to speculate it is believed that the mysterious disappearance of Miss Mary Chang is connected with a protection racket which has been operating recently in Chinatown . I hope your plan works . It will . Jimmy Kee is no fool . Get that . I wouldn 't if I were you ! What is this ? We have met before . Not now . Let 's talk . What have we got to talk about ? Mary Chang . And the reason why she 's been kidnapped . I don 't know what you 're talking about . You kidnapped Miss Chang to force Jimmy Kee into giving himself up . Then you plan to kill him to prevent him from talking . Are you sure you 're at the right address ? It won 't work . He can 't give himself up to you. I got him . What 's your interest in Kee ? Purely monetary . What does that mean ? It means I 'll be happy to turn him over . For $ 25.000 . 25.000 ? Get out ! Friend of yours ? He works for me . You should teach him some manners . Hold it . You 're not gonna deal with him ? Bettersuggestions ? Yeah , let me handle them ! What are you laughing at ? You . Observe and shut up ! Alright , that 's a deal . One more thing. I want Mary Chang . She should be worth some dollars to her uncle if he recovers . Now about the delivery of Kee . When and where ? Midnight , tomorrow night , at Tsoy Yen 's headquarters . No , I prefer a more neutral territory . Saythe Buddhist temple in the Mandarin Park . Until tomorrow night . Until tomorrow night . You gotJimmy Kee , here ? In the basement . Kato fixed up a guest room for him . It 's comfortable and inescapable . Has he any idea where he is orwho you are ? No . He was unconscious when we brought him . What makes you think you 'll be able to spring Mary Chang ? Low Sing will have his gang ofthugs at the temple , you can 't handle all . Forwhat I 've seen of Low Sing , we won 't have to worry about that . I 'll have a couple of police cars standing by . And keep this handy . Where are you taking me now ? You 'll see . My fatherwas head ofthe Tsoy Yen for30 years . I 'm glad he didn 't live to see what you and Low Sing have done to our Tong . Low Sing and I ? Don 't kid me . You 're partners . Low Sing 's gonna be pretty surprised to hearthat . No , wait . Wait until they get on the steps . Good evening , MrSlate . Get out . You too , Slate . What is this ? A meeting ofthe Tsoy Yen . What 's he saying ? He 's calling Low Sing atraitorto the Tong . And he 's telling others to remember Tsoy Yen 's honorable history . He 's pleading others to overthrow Low Sing . Mary ! Jimmy ! Alright , let 's get this overwith . Take the money and the girl and ... Alright , what is this ? Where 's the money ? I do not paytribute to anyone . Alright , this has gone farenough . Give him the money and wrap this up . You 'd better listen to him , Low Sing . I no longertake orders from MrSlate . Big talk ! - That 's all that it is . Low Sing , you were nothing without me . He 's nothing with you . I was willing to let you two operate provided you played straight with me . As of now you 're both out of business . Now who makes the big talk ? is that all that you think it is ? How would you stop us ? Kung fu ? Isn 't that the traditional way ? Hold it ! We 're not playing any games . Stay out ofthis , Slate . What do you say , Low Sing ? Man against man . Slate is right . What 's the matter Low Sing ? The stake 's to high ? You 're afraid you might lose ? I 'd kill him as I would afly . More big talk . This man is your leader ? Your hero ? He backs down like a woman . Enough ! Any questions ? Untie me ! What now ? That 's up to Jimmy . Low Sing is finished . So end the evil times this Tong has fallen upon . Let 's be wise and return the Tong to the tradition it represents . To the tradition of my father . OK , move in . We 're not needed here anymore .

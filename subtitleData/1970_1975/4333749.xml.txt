 PLANET OF THE APES 1x09 " THE HORSE RACE " Subtitles by subXpacio . - Relax . - Yes , Urko . After all , it 's only a horse race . With half my horses and half my land bet on the result . Think of how rich you 'll be if you win . If , if , if ! You insist on the race . You make all the arrangements . You demand the bet , Have you ever lost a race to any prefect ? There 's always a first time . My horse is leading . Well , better luck next year ! - There is a first time ! - Shut up . - The horse threw a shoe ! - Who shod that horse ? The blacksmith . I want that horse shod in time for the next race in the village of Venton . If this happens again , I won 't just kill the blacksmith , I 'll kill you too . It 's not necessary you work for the little food I 've given you . It wasn 't necessary for you to give us the food . I never talked to an ape before . Really ? Well , I mean , they talked at me , you know , giving me orders , things like that . But never just like you and I are talking . Saying the things you feel like saying . Well , would you believe , that , uh , it was many years before I spoke to a human ? Well , except for giving orders . Well , why should apes give orders ? Why do we have to obey ? Well , there are two answers to that - mine and , uh , the authorities . See , mine isn 't backed up by bullets . I think you should listen to the authorities . Horses . - Alan , Pete , horses . - Stay here . You 'll be safe . This is Urko 's favorite horse . - He 's thrown a shoe , - I 'll take care of him well , sir . You will if you want to keep on living . There have been reports of a young human riding a horse near here . " Human riding a horse " ? They must be crazy . Why would anyone take a chance on being shot , just to ride a horse ? Perhaps he 's crazy as you say . In any case , he 'll be caught . You know what the law is for humans riding , You 've been seen . How many times have I warned you ? Being seen is not being caught . Don 't worry , Father , I 'm careful . You 're not careful . You just won 't believe anything can harm you . Well , the apes can , and they will . You 're not so smart you can go on fooling them forever . I 'm not trying to fool them , I just don 't see why I - I don 't care what you see , I care about your staying alive . I won 't have you risking your life trying to prove how clever you are . Now I want your word you won 't ride again . Father , I can 't . I 've been bit ! It 's a tiger scorpion . Sit him down . Here he goes . - A tourniquet - Give me a rope . - Right . - It 's no use . - What do you mean , " It 's no use " ? Without an antidote , the sting of the tiger scorpion is fatal . - Where do we get an antidote ? - The clinic in town . - I 'll go . - It 's five miles . By the time you get back , Galen will be dead . Martin , I 'm going to steal one of your horses . You 'd be caught before you got halfway there . - Maybe not . - I 'll go ! No , you won 't . If anybody 's gonna ride for that stuff , it 's gonna be Alan or me . - Galen 's our friend . - I 'd like him to be mine . Believe me , I know a back way , I can be there and back in no time , You 'd never make it , and Galen will die . - Galen needs help now ! - Yeah , okay , then go . Go ! If he just hadn 't moved . A tiger scorpion never stings if you don 't move . Now , remember what I said . Stay off of the leg . Excuse me , but my brother 's been bitten by a tiger scorpion . - How long ago ? - A couple of minutes ago , right down the road - Are you telling the truth ? If it 's been any longer , the antidote won 't help . I am telling the truth . Wait here . This is to be given by mouth as soon as possible . Thank you . Halt ! We 'll make camp here . We could stay in the village . but there are too many loudmouthed humans here for the race , Hyah ! Did you see his face ? I think it was the blacksmith 's son , but I 'm not sure . Shoot him ! Oh ! After him ! He 's back . - You made it . Thanks . - Use this immediately . Nice work , Gregor . We 're indebted to you for Galen . Good boy . Martin says it takes about half an hour for the antidote to work . If it works . What 's this ? What happened ? It 's a bullet wound , I was seen , Now we are in trouble . The bullet was stopped by the shoulder blade . It 's nothing serious . Just be glad they missed me . Let 's get him into the barn . I 'll see if I can dig that bullet out . Stay with him , Pete . That horse looks like it 's been wounded . - I 'll see if I can 't lend a hand . - Right . Let me take a look at that , I 've had some experience with horses , It 's not too bad . Give me a knife . You hold his head tight . Quick , Gregor ! Out of sight ! Go on ! Was it you riding the horse ? Do you deny it ? I don 't deny anything . This horse has been hurt . He 's gotta be taken care of . Take him to the village , We 'll make an example of him ! - I rode the horse . - So , it was him after all . Come on , Gregor . Don 't lie just to save my neck . Please ! He-He 's young . He meant no harm . His own father confirms it . Let the other one go free . I won 't be so easy on you if you ever lie to me again , Seize him ! No ! Please ! Very , very foolish . You 'll be invited to witness the execution ... as part of the celebration after the race . Here 's your new saddle . Prefect Barlow . You 'll find it very good , Your horse will run well under it . It 's no use . We have no chance of winning the race . Urko 's horse will win as usual . It doesn 't seem fair . Fair ? When has Urko ever been fair ? Look at the way he transferred me here from Kaymak . Yes , and the stakes - half my land and half my horses if I lose . And , of course , I 'll lose . Martin , Galen 's gonna be fine , - Pete and I talked it over . - We want to help Gregor . If there was any way , do you think I 'd be here working ? We can talk to the prefect . We 'll tell him Gregor was only riding to save an ape 's life . The prefect will not listen to humans . Then we 'll try something else . We 're gonna look around . Venton is a small village , isn 't it ? - We don 't need identification ? - The new prefect , Barlow . - lets humans come and go freely . - Barlow ? - Barlow ? - Galen . What are you doing here ? You 're supposed to be in bed . Oh , no , I 'm fine . Is that the same Barlow who used to be prefect at Kaymak ? Yes , that 's what they say . - Well - - Wait a minute , I know what you 're thinking , We 'll talk to Barlow . You belong in bed . Oh , no , no , no . He 's a friend of mine , I think he 'd pay more attention if I talked to him . We 'll tell him we 're delivering your message . - You 're too weak from the scorpion , - Fine , And just to make it more convincing , I 'll go along and faint in his presence . - Very funny . - Is Barlow really your friend ? Would he listen ? Could he help to save Gregor ? I 'll do everything I can . - Come along . What are we waiting for ? - Galen , be reasonable . Venton 's five miles from here . You 're not strong enough to walk . An ape of my wealth and position , with two human servants , walk ? I can borrow a horse , can 't I , Martin ? - Right away . - Ah ! You two walk . And please ... be sure to maintain a respectable distance behind me , hmm . - Someone to see you , sir . - Who ? I don 't know , sir . He didn 't give his name , but he said he 's a friend of yours ... from Kaymak . Please come in . Ah , Galen , And Virdon and Burke , What are you doing here ? Don 't you know they 're still looking for you ? Of course , but I simply had to see you , You are looking wonderful , Oh , you probably need my help again . Oh , no , no , no . No , no , not us . - But a friend of ours . - A human arrested for riding a horse . Oh , that one , Young Gregor . - He 's a friend of yours ? - Yes . There is absolutely nothing I can do . - But he saved my life . - Galen was stung by a scorpion . I 'd have died if Gregor hadn 't come to town to get that antidote . He did it for one of your own . If you can get to Zaius and tell him that - You suggest I appeal to Zaius because he saved the life of an outlaw ? You don 't have to put it that way . Of course not . Come on , Barlow , be reasonable . Well , there was a time when I tried to be reasonable . Now I 'm less reasonable and more safe . I hate it here . I want to go home , back to Kaymak . There 's a chance that I can if I keep my record clean . Is a comfortable job more important than saving a boy 's life ? I have sympathy for humans when they behave themselves and know their place . But that boy 's a fool . - He deserves punishment , - For saving Galen 's life ? It 's a wonder the horse didn 't throw the boy . These laws protect humans as well , Only apes know how to handle horses . I grew up on horses . I 've been riding since I was seven . No , no , no , no . Humans can 't ride like apes . For what it 's worth , Alan 's as good a rider as anybody in this whole world . He telling the truth ? My friends don 't lie . Would you - Would you be willing to prove that your skill is not only talk ? - What about Gregor ? - Well , let me see how you ride first , then we 'll talk about Gregor , All right . - Never been ridden , right ? - Even without a rider , he runs like the wind , but she 's a killer . No ape has been able to ride him . Forget it . Oh , so you 're not the great rider you say you are , Now , you give me one good reason why I should risk my neck on a wild horse . If you can ride him . I 'll be very helpful to you . Uh-huh . - All right , I 'll do it . - Good , Saddle him up , Martin . Hyah ! Come on ! Come on , baby ! Come on ! Come on ! - Look at him . - I told you he could ride . Mm-mmm . Come on , Come on , Come on . Come on . Whoa . Whoa . Whoa . Here you go . There . You 're not as tough as you thought you were . What a beautiful animal . Good riding , for a human . - Thank you . I never saw a horse go so fast , Maybe that 's because you 've never seen a human jockey before . Huh , I have a proposition to make to you . I 've been challenged to race my best horse ... against the fastest horse in the territory . I want you to ride Woda . Virdon can 't ride in a race . He 'd be seen . I have a certain influence with Zaius . I can get him to make an exception . What do you say ? Why should I say anything ? I 'm not interested in racing . You ride Woda , and I 'll get Zaius to pardon your friend , Gregor . - That is , if you win , - Okay , you got it . Wait . What if he loses ? Well , well , Gregor dies , of course . But if you don 't ride , he 's certain to be shot . - Excuse me . Do you know who Urko is ? - Yes , sir . I just saw him . Does he come to town often ? No , sir , only for something important like the big race . Oh . I won 't interfere with your departure in any way . I knew I couldn 't trust Barlow . Come in . Barlow , what is this I hear ? Are you seriously going to use a human as a jockey in the race ? I have received permission from Zaius . You 're a bigger fool than I thought . All Zaius has done is to make certain that your horse will lose to mine . We shall see . Who is this human ... who 's foolish enough to ride against one of my apes ? What does it matter ? He 's just a human . Well , has he ever ridden a horse before ? Yes , he 's quite good . I trained him myself . Oh . Well , in that case , you won 't mind if we ... - ... raise the stakes just a little bit . - How much ? Instead of half your horses , all of them , if you lose . And all of your lands . And if I win ? - What do you want ? - Transfer me back to Kaymak . Hmm . Well , if that 's what you want . I 'm determined to win this race . Everything I have depends on it . You 're going to win . When Urko sees Alan on your horse , he 's gonna kill him ... and us too . I don 't understand you . Don 't you feel guilty about tricking us ? Absolutely . Well , that 's a big help . Well , what was I to do ? I was forced into this race and my entire future depends on it . And , besides , I wasn 't sure that Urko was coming . Oh , and I used to boast about honor among apes . Oh , speaking of honor , I don 't like to spread gossip , but I 've heard talk that Urko 's horse doesn 't always win by fair means . Is this designed to cheer us up ? I 'm only trying to be a big help to us both . Come on , Galen . But where ? Well , if Urko has all this going for him , maybe we should jiggle a few odds to get things in our favor . Hmm . Make it deep and muddy . I wish I could help you . Ah , but you 've got to keep up appearances . - Yeah , right . - I mean , if someone saw me ... doing something like that , they 'd say . " Why are you doing such a thing ? Such work is for humans . " Otherwise , I would be right in there giving you a hand , Hey , will you cut it out ? You love it . Anyway , I 'm doing what you asked me to do , even if I don 't understand it . Do you think this is really gonna help Virdon ? You 're getting warm , buddy . You 're getting warm . Warm ? I 'm not the least bit warm . Sometimes I do not understand you at all . First of all , you have me carve a spool with notches in it and now - What are you complaining about ? I 'm the one who 's doing all the hard work . - You 're terrible . - Whee ! Thinner , Martin . You gotta make it thinner . A racehorse has got to have thin , lightweight shoes on his hooves . Urko 's racehorses use the same shoes as any other horse . That 's the point . That 's where we have an advantage . In a horse race , every little bit helps . If it 'll help save my son . I 'll make them featherlight . Twist them , but leave the way open at the side . Kagon will be told to ride my horse across to where he will be clear of the vines . The human will be stupid enough to jump across the middle . I want to be sure he falls . More vines here . Make it thicker . More vines here . There you go , Martin . With those shoes . the only thing that gorilla 's gonna see is Woda 's tail . I still don 't see how you hope to beat Urko . His horses never lose . Come on , Martin . Nobody 's got this race sewn up . Even if you do win ... what 's to keep Urko from killing you just for daring to ride a horse ? I 'm not gonna ride up to Urko and see if he shoots me . We got a couple of tricks up our sleeve . I know you 're doing this for Gregor , and I thank you . But if you trick Urko , Gregor will surely pay . If everything goes all right , we 'll bail out Gregor and I 'll be in the clear . I 've got to take Urko 's horse to him . I 'm gonna ask him to let me take Gregor 's place . I don 't care what happens to me , This way , you won 't have to ride , you 'll be out of danger , And so will Gregor . Uh-uh , Urko doesn 't make that kind of deal . Look , Gregor 's only chance is for me to win that race . I think I 've got a pretty good shot at it . Come on . Beat that if you can . Ah ! I 'm a little out of practice . Barlow ! - What about the tree ? - We have something special planned . - What ? - A net . Better work . Zilo , you know you 're to be in place 50 yards before the end of the race . If the human is winning when he passes you , shoot him . Of course , The human will surely lose the race , Shouldn 't I shoot him anyway , just for riding ? Zaius has given his permission . This one time , Anyway , it isn 't important enough to kill the human ... just because he looses the race , We still have the other young human to serve as an example . - Urko , the blacksmith . - Huh ? What do you want ? Excuse me , I 'm Martin . I 'm the one who shod your horse . What do you want ? I can be of help to you . I also shod the horse Barlow will race against you . I know how to make sure you 'll win . Is there any doubt about my winning the race ? Yes . Barlow 's horse , Woda , is very fast . But I know how to fix his shoes with wedges ... that will cause great pain and slow him down . I know where to put them , and it wouldn 't be found out until too late . Why do you want to help me against Barlow , who pampers all the humans ? It 's for my son , Gregor . He 's the one that 's been sentenced to die . Please , he 's very young . He didn 't know . He just didn 't think . He - Let him go , and I promise you he 'll never ride a horse again , I 'll help you win . Gregor will be safe ... and there 'll be no need to worry about the other man riding Barlow 's horse . Say nothing about this to anyone . If my horse wins the race , I 'll set your son free . Thank you . Thank you . Zilo ! Release the human from the cage . At the start ? What-What if the blacksmith is lying ? What is done to a human who tries to run away and escape ? In the meantime , if the human is winning , kill him before he reaches the finish line . - Uh-huh . - If the human is losing . kill him after he reaches the finish line . Just a matter of when . Look at that horse . Oh , a magnificent horse . I love racing ! Well , Barlow , we 've finally arrived at the moment of truth . Not quite . The moment of truth comes at the finish line . Well , we 'll see . It 's quite a show you 're putting on here today . We always try to please . Zandar , is everything prepared ? Everything will be to your total satisfaction , Urko . Good , Barlow . this may come as a surprise to you , but I dislike losing so much , I 've always made it a habit of winning . I always thought the enjoyment of a race depended on being unsure of the outcome . Well , don 't worry about my enjoyment of a race . I intend to have a marvelous time . Ah , there are the horses . Well , I see your horse , - but where 's your wonderful human jockey ? - Oh , he 'll , uh - I 'm certain he 'll be here . There 's time . The race won 't begin for a while yet . It 's all right if he doesn 't turn up . I don 't mind winning by default . I don 't like the way that horse is acting . I don 't like anything about this whole race . Well , Alan. now is probably as good a time as any . Be careful . You better take off first , Galen . There 's something the matter with that horse . Maybe he 's just nervous being near the crowd , We 'll soon find out . - See you after the race , Pete . - Yeah . Hey . Be careful . - You too . - Yeah . He 's a wonderful jockey , your human , except he can 't sit on a horse . Hey , that 's great . You look awful . Urko would never recognize you . Whoa . Hey , hey . Easy , easy . Come on . Hey - What 's the matter with him , Martin ? There 's nothing wrong with him . He 'll be fine . Good luck . Hey , Pete , look at this . Give me your knife . What 's holding up the race ? - Races never start on time . - Well , this one does ! That 's it . Let me get that one . - Start the race . - Get ready for the start ! Same way . Okay , good . Let 's get the other one too . I said start the race now ! Bring your horses to the starting line . Three times through the village and around the course , Now pull it . Okay . Good start . You put those wedges in the horse 's shoes . Why ? - You didn 't take them out . - Yes , of course I did ! I promised Urko I 'd make Virdon lose if Gregor was spared . Alan 's riding in this race to save your son . He can 't ! Urko has a gorilla there to kill him if he wins ! Two more to go . There he goes ! There he goes ! Well , Barlow , it 's all over . Too bad , Barlow . I 'm going to win ! I 'm going to win ! I think it 's time we made our move . Careful . Don 't move . Ah . Oh , I won ! I won ! I won ! That 's Virdon . Kill him ! Kill him ! Come on , kill him ! Kill him ! Kill him ! Shoot him ! That was Virdon ! Your jockey ! Your human jockey was Virdon , the fugitive ! Is that a fact ? Oh , well , it has nothing to do with our bet . Get the horses ! Follow them ! Follow them ! - Did Barlow 's horse win the race ? - Yes . Now you can run . Why should I run if I 'm supposed to be free ? You run because I tell you to run ! No . Something 's wrong . Move out of there , or I 'll shoot you right where you are . Pete ! Pete ! Ya-hoo ! Hyah ! Hyah ! Hyah ! Come on ! Come on ! This way ! Let 's go ! Hyah ! Hyah ! - Have you seen the fugitive ? - Yes , with you , when he won the race . Barlow , if I thought you knew anything about this beforehand - Oh , how could I dream that a fugitive would dare to ride a horse ... - under Urko 's very nose ? - I don 't trust you , Barlow . Oh , Urko . I 'm an honorable ape . I don 't lie . I don 't break promises ... and I always pay my debts , when I lose . - The payment has been arranged ! - Yes , I know . I 'm on my way back to Kaymak . I heard what you said to Urko . You don 't lie . Perhaps not , but you certainly know how to tie the truth into a knot , I also said I don 't break promises . Where are they ? Uh-huh . You two may come and live with me in Kaymak . There you 'll be safe . But you ... - ... are not to ride on horses ... - Yes , Prefect . - ... when I 'm watching . - Thank you , Prefect . Thank you . Good-bye . Friend . Friend . Subtitles subXpacio

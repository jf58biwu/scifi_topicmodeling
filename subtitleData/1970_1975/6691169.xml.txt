Open the door ! How did you get in here ? - And who are you ? - Where is Dr. Kopot ? At this hour ? Please . He 's probably home , asleep . - He said he 'd be here . - But he 's not . - Why are you here ? - I was to see Dr. Kopot . At 1am ? Just who do you take me for ? - Which way did you get in here ? - Through the reception . Don 't you remember ? You let me in . I let you in ? Are you drunk ? You checked my name on the list . Don 't you remember ? You directed me to room 125 to see Dr. Kopot . So you 're here to see him ? What kind of a story is that ? Maybe you have been drinking . - Watch your words ! - How did you get in here , anyway ? Where is Dr. Kopot ? He was in his lab a while ago . Let 's go to the reception and call Dr. Kopot . That way we 'll clear up everything . Please go before me . Please sit down . Is that clock on time ? - It 's 1am . - Really ? At night ? It 's dark , so obviously it 's night . Let 's see your ID . Night ? 1 at night ? Hello ? Good evening , sorry for the late hour . This is the night watchman . There 's someone to see you here . I 'll hand it to him . Jan Siwiec here . You invited me , and now what ? Where did I invite you ? What experiment ? With your titrome , or was it totrome ? You said it 'd be a sensation . Jan ... Admit it : you 've been drinking . Okay ... Let me speak to the night watchman . What is this all about ? I see . Now listen to me ... I see . Yes , I agree . Of course . The doctor still has something to say to you . Hello ? Do me a favor . In the future , don 't get me mixed up in your shaninagans . I don 't want everyone at the institute to know that my drunken friends are making havoc there . Don 't interrupt me ! I told the night watchman that it was all a bet . I told him to let you go without making a note of it . Now just go home and get some sleep . Excuse me ... Here 's your ID . Is that you , the editor in chief ? I could swear I let you in just an hour ago . - Me ? - That 's what I thought . - If it wasn 't you , who could it be ? - How should I know ? - What happened ? - Open the door , quick ! - Something wrong ? - Just open it ! Something is wrong ! - Who is it ? - Siwiec , open the door . Didn 't I tell you to go home and sleep ? You did , but I 'm not drunk . I 'm not fooling around . Now they 'll think I was behind that havoc . That I 'm up to some silly jokes . What made you grant me this honor ? Something extraordinary . Something I can 't understand . So something happened , and extraordinary at that . Could you tell me what it is ? First tell me : did you want to meet me today that is , yesterday afternoon at the institute ? - No , I didn 't . - But you were there yesterday . No , I was at a meeting . But you called and asked me to come see you there . To see the expirement with your new equipment . - The totrome ? - So you did invite me ! I didn 't . So who invited me ? Listen ... I even saw you yesterday at the institute . That 's impossible . Impossible ? Just as impossible as finding yourself in your own bed , and at the same time standing besides it ! So it works ! I don 't know what works . I don 't understand a thing . I don 't know what 's going on . Am I myself ? Or am I the one who 's sleeping in my , or his bed ? - And are you my friend or his ? - Calm down . I 'll explain it in a minute . This is a great day ! - Will you have some wine ? - What great day ? I 'll have some wine , sure . What happened guarantees my experiments to be successful . - Yesterday wasn 't a success ? - I made no experiments then . I planned them for the end of the week . - This week ? - No , next week . It 's Saturday now . - Saturday ? - Surprised ? Maybe you think Saturday has just gone past or is only coming in a day or two ? I think we are two hours to Thursday . - Not quite , you see ... - Kopot ? You 're forgetting something . You don 't need to explain . You wanted to reveal it all . Kopot , the great physicist . - I didn 't tell him a thing . - Time-transfering him was enough . You forgot you 're here as a sociological researcher , not playing a genius in their age . But , gentlemen ... Don 't interrupt our talk with our colleague Kopot , OK ? - You nearly made a joke like Eliasz did . - Not at all . He also thought he didn 't do anything special , just lifted himself up on the anti-gravitator . - It 's still talked about today . - Please , Jan is listening . No matter . Even if he speaks , no one will believe him . In their age , no one treats such stories seriously . - He 's a journalist . - All the more so . You know what , Ou ? Let 's experiment with him . Please be careful , so there won 't be any complications . - Did you check who his son is ? - You know I 'm a batchelor . I have no children , even out of wedlock . Kopot , where did these guys come from ? How to explain it ... Let me explain it . Our mutual friend Kopot was sent to your age for sociological and historical research . He was to test your reactions to certain inventions that don 't confirm to your conceptions of physics . One of them was the totrome , a common device in our age . But he wasn 't supposed to transport you through time . And in doing so he abused our trust . It was an accident . You should have taken measures to prevent it . In our age , people take responsibility . Nou , don 't you agree our friend has forgotten that ? - Sorry , but I don 't understand . - What ? - This time-transportation . - It 's all very simple . You are moving in 4-dimensional time and space , but your time always moves forward . Through the 5th dimension you can move to any place in a 4-dimensional space : to yesterday , to tomorrow , any moment you choose . What ? To yesterday ? Don 't tell me that yesterday exists ! - Of course it does . - Nonsense ! Don 't be so sure . Think that you are walking through a field . Now think that you can 't look back no matter how you try . On your path there is a tree . When you get closer , you can see it . It exists . But when you go past it , it ceases to exist . That 's because you can 't turn around . So what you mean is that we can 't turn around in time ? Of course . Only when going to the past you mustn 't change anything . - Any changes can change our world . - In what way ? Say you are moved 100 years to the past and you kill your grandfather . Then you go back to your age , and one of your parents was never born . - What is more , neither were you . - No , that 's just too much ... - You 're talking nonsense . - Unfortunately it 's the truth . It 's a classical problem , the " grandfather paradox " . - And that was your experiment ? - Not yet . It 's about to be . - Of course . It will take place . - Only it won 't . How about me ? How did I come here ? By accident , out of carelessness . What will happen to me ? What will happen to the other me , who is asleep ? It can 't go on like this ! It 's only a copy . Don 't worry , he was never alive . To your doctors he 's the same as Kopot . They 'll say he died of a heart attack . We have to get going now . Just swallow this . Don 't be afraid . Swallow it . - Is everything all right ? - Yes . Please step off the screen ! - I 'm sorry . I think it 's unharmed . - It 's not working yet . - When will you turn it on ? - We 're waiting for Dr. Kopot . He should be here . He 's usually never late . I see . Thank you . Hello , how can I help you ? I 'll ask him . Jan , the boss is asking about that front page story . I 'm finishing it . Written by Marek T.

 WORLD ON A WIRE - Günther ! - I 'll be right in . Secretary of State von Weinlaub . I 'm Hirse , Mr. von Weinlaub 's assistant . Hello , my name 's Lause , I 'm chief of security . Please , Mr. Siskins expects you . - Wasn 't that Dr. Vollmer ? - It was . To get right to the point : Simulacron is almost fully operational . I may seem ill-informed but what interests me is your definition of " almost " . Of course , Mr. Secretary . I apologize . The margin of error for our prognoses currently reaches as high as 5.8 % . I see , thank you . Yes . Professor Vollmer can tell you exactly about the state of things . He 's overseen development of the computer . We know that , Mr. Siskins . Professor Vollmer , please ... So , you 're secretary of state ? Naturally . I really don 't care , to be honest . Do you have a mirror on you ? A mirror ? Why ? Here , take this . What do you see ? Come on , what do you see ? Let me help you , Mr ... . ? Von Weinlaub . Alright , von Weinlaub . You are nothing more than the image others have made of you . - That 's all . - Enough ! Thank you . And the rest of you ? Vollmer ! You too , Siskins . Want to look in the mirror ? Go on , look at yourself . It 's a sad joke . That 'll do , Vollmer ! This has gone far enough . Hirse , let 's leave . Headache . It pounds and pounds and pounds . Do you know what 's pounding in my head ? I know . Lause ... Please come in . Why don 't you lie down ? Lause will take you to your office . Come on , ? enri . It 's not a headache . It 's much , much more . So much that my head 's about to explode . Come on . I 'm coming , Günther . They refuse to understand ... those poor worms . - Take care of him . - Yes , Mr. Siskins . I must apologize for Professor Vollmer . He 's been working day and night . His nerves have always been delicate . The line between genius and madness , you know ... Strange kind of madness , wouldn 't you say ? Of course , Mr. Secretary ... very strange . One moment , please . Go ahead . Please ... - But I ... - Look at yourself . - What do you see ? - Me . Stiller was due back yesterday . He 'll come , Henri . I 'm scared . I 'm with you . You 're here . The constant throbbing in my head ... Have you ever heard of a head exploding ? Like that , into a thousand pieces ? No , never . Really ? Anyway ... Do you remember ? As a boy you must have played " I see something you don 't " . Sure , all kids do . Günther ... I know something you don 't . Something no one must know . It would mean the end of this world . Henri ... Vollmer ! Sorry , the bar 's over there . It 's padding , not muscles . To look manlier . It 's not all padding , is it ? If you 're interested ... Fred Stiller . I 'm in the phone book . Can 't you get a drink ? Guess I 'm small fry . Too bad , but maybe you 'll grow . Maybe . Whiskey ? Yes , with water . Rainer , two whiskeys : one ice , one water . Yes , Mr. Siskins . Coming to the funeral ? I 'll be there , although ... the dead don 't really care , do they ? Your whiskeys . Thank you . Can you debug the computer without Vollmer ? I think so . We can 't afford further delays . The Ministry 's impatient . By the way ... What ? Oh , nothing . Tell me , what 's your dream car ? Pardon me ? Your dream car . It 's a simple question . Oh , God ... A Corvette . I see , a Corvette ... 275 HP . And about 40,000 marks . Beyond your wage bracket ? Somewhat , but you asked about my dream car , not my wage bracket . - What bracket do you want ? - The next one . Why not , if you 're as good as Vollmer . I 'm not , but I 'm tough . I see you 're aware Vollmer and I had our differences of opinion . I believe so . He was pigheaded , don 't you agree ? Well , I ... Think about it . Just so you don 't misunderstand ... It was simply a hypothesis , not an offer . I understood you , Mr. Siskins . 275 HP . Quite something . I 'm Gloria . Great . Care for a drink ? Champagne . What else ? Still 42-26-39 ? 39 1 / 2 . You get fat , just sitting around . But every inch is precious . Thanks . How 's the computer coming ? OK , and how 's working for Siskins ? No , I mean it . I 'm very interested in Simulacron . Is it true you 've created an artificial world ? " World " is an exaggeration . Currently we 've some 10,000 identity units . That 's all we need for now . The world in a nutshell , you see ? 1 0,000 people . They 're people , aren 't they ? As you like . To us they 're merely circuits . But to them ... They live just like we do ... build roads , listen to music , eat ... And make love ? That , too . Make love , enjoy life ... have kids . Exciting . Pardon me ? Making love ? Yes , that too . But I mean , a living world ... in a box full of microchips ? We 're alive . They 're like people on TV dancing for us . The way you describe it is fascinating . You 're fascinating . Hi , Lause ! Hi . Have you seen Stiller ? Yeah , a minute ago . Come in . No , I 'll wait here . Bring him to me . Sure . - Fred , come with me . - Me ? Lause wants you . Excuse me . See you later . Pity . Lause ! My God , finally ! I have to see you . You look awful . Where have you been ? After Vollmer 's death , I drove to your place in the country . You found him ? Yes , but ... where were you ? I came back earlier than planned . What 's up ? Not here . Come ... Well ? It 's about Vollmer 's death . But ... I thought it was an accident . I don 't know , I didn 't see it . But it was very strange . What ? What was strange ? Vollmer was strange . Something had happened to him . I spoke to him shortly before he died . He was afraid . Then he told me something that was so ... that was ... absolutely crazy . What ? I can 't tell you , it 's too crazy . Perhaps he was crazy . Do you know what fear is ? Yes , Lause . I think so . You 've no idea . Alright , fine . But ... Tell me what he said . OK , then . It sounds incredible , but who knows ... See what you make of it . My God , I 'm so clumsy . I 've startled you . I 'll be right there . " Vanished into Thin Air . At a party last night in the home of Herbert Siskins - prominent head of the IKZ Institute - an Institute employee reports that Chief of Security Günther Lause vanished in the middle of a conversation . Police have opened an investigation . " What are you up to , Stiller ? What 's this about Lause and Vollmer ? I told the police what I saw . Trying to make yourself and the IKZ look ridiculous ? But it happened exactly as I described . Fine , have it your way . Inspector Lehner , Missing Persons Bureau and Detective Stuhlfauth , Homicide . Dr. Stiller ... our acting technical director . You seem to be the only one who saw Lause last night . What do you mean ? My men have interviewed everyone at the party . No one else saw Lause there . Did you have too much to drink ? No , I wasn 't drunk . It 's true that we didn 't find Mr. Lause at home . But that could be a coincidence . What did Lause say about Vollmer 's death ? He just said he found it strange . Where were you when Vollmer died ? At my cabin . With others ? No . We 'd like to see where Vollmer died . Please show the gentlemen the computer room . Yes , Mr. Stiller . Good-bye . This way . See you again . Let 's put this incident behind us . You already have . Good . I 'd like to discuss Vollmer 's job with you again . Go ahead . As I 've already told you ... Vollmer 's pigheadedness , I mean ... It was a strain on my nerves . I 'm not pigheaded . That 's what I wanted to hear . I 'm a good judge of human nature . I knew we 'd see eye to eye . Tell me your dream car , I 'll tell you who you are . Oh , that ... Good . I 'll sound out the board of directors but I don 't foresee any obstacles . Good-bye ... Mr. Director . Bring me an aspirin , please . Right away . Problems ? Yes , I 'm being promoted . Fred ! Did he name you technical director ? You don 't seem very pleased . Why should I be ? I 'll have the same problems with Siskins as Vollmer did , just wait . Then why did you accept ? Simulacron 's the most exciting research project in the entire world . Nothing else comes close . I 'll earn a good salary and ... It 's just Siskins . If Vollmer was right , then ... Maja ... Forget all this . I 'll forget it . Thanks . Has Vollmer 's office been emptied ? No . His things are still there . Cancel my appointments . I 'll be in Vollmer 's office . What are you doing ? You 're hurting me . Thank you , Fred Stiller . - You are Fred Stiller ? - Yes , but what are you doing ? The guard at the front desk showed me in . Aren 't you ... ? I 'm Eva Vollmer . - I didn 't recognize you . - Naturally . I 'm here because I was asked to pick up Father 's things . - I thought you were in Montreux . - I 've been back a month . You were with your father when ... Was he acting strange ? Did he seem nervous ? Not that I noticed . Why ? Because he ... I think he had made an important discovery . He couldn 't tell me . He was a bit preoccupied , no more . You know , if you were to visit me ... I 'd like that , really . Tell me ... Did your dad see much of Günther Lause ? Your uncle , Günther Lause . Never heard of him . You don 't remember your uncle ? I remember him very well . His name was Jakob , Jakob Meixner . He died four years ago . Eva ? Can I ... Can I be of any help ? I 'll manage . Father left me a bit of money , and the house . I apologize , Fred . I misjudged you . I thought you were interested only in taking Father 's job . I should 've known better . I 'd like some cake . Choose what you want at the counter . You 're under arrest . Come with me . Jeez , Franz , you scared me . That one . And two whiskeys . What 's up , Stiller ? Here ... Here 's a riddle I came across , a rebus . Imagine a drawing of a Greek warrior holding a spear looking to his right , and taking a step . With a turtle going the same way . First ... does that ring a bell ? Second ... ever seen such a drawing ? Me ? What 's this all about ? Vollmer left me that drawing . Does it mean anything to you ? Bizarre , if you ask me . Bizarre , sure . - Does it remind you of anything ? - Maybe . What ? Zeno . Zeno 's paradox . Achilles and the tortoise . Achilles tries to overtake the tortoise , but cannot . By the time he reaches where it was , the turtle has moved ahead . What could the paradox mean to our work ? I 'm only the psychologist for our creations . But ... as I recall , the paradox is meant to show that movement is an illusion . What 's the link to our work ? Vollmer was acting very strange before he died . Cheesecake ? Who ordered the cheesecake ? Maybe for a reason . What did he say ? Did you order cheesecake ? No ... I mean , yes . I think I ordered it , thanks . How was he strange ? I played chess with him three days before he died . He wasn 't himself , he was rambling on about philosophy . He had made a shattering discovery . What ? He wouldn 't say . It was a secret . Something like that . Why are you so interested in it , Fred ? I don 't think Vollmer 's death was an accident . What do you mean ? I know about Vollmer and Siskins ' disagreements on the applications of the simulation model . I said no such thing . OK , fine . By the way , I can imagine what Vollmer 's shattering discovery was . I bet it had to do with his attitude towards the identity units we 'd programmed in his computer . You remember how he called them " my children " . He was only joking . You can 't spend years feeding data into a computer that allows for the simulation of every aspect of human behavior without asking yourself if it might lead to the creation of something resembling human consciousness . Lause spoke of a " shattering discovery " . Lause ? Who 's he ? Stop . If I hadn 't believed him , I 'd never have told the cops . Lause ? Cops ? What do you mean ? Lause ! Günther Lause ! Chief of security at Cybernetics and Futurology ! Our Institute ! Just take it easy . Stiller , do you see that man ? That 's Hans Edelkern . He 's been IKZ 's chief of security for five years . You remember now ? Stiller ! Got a light ? No , I mean it , for my cigarette . Understand ? I 'm not trying to ... Pick me up ? Too bad . Anyway , I don 't smoke . Thanks . Sorry . Don 't mention it . CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Gloria ? Do you have a pen ? Then take this down . The chairman , United Steel Inc . Dear Mr. Hartmann , I accept your invitation with pleasure . In view of the situation , I would request you treat my visit as primarily a personal one . I 'm sure you will understand if I insist on the utmost confidentiality . Yours truly , Herbert Siskins . Please come in , my dear Siskins . A lovely couple . Rupp , Daily News . A quick question : Is your new computer solely for state use ? Please , I have no comment . Certainly not here . Ask at the IKZ press office . Yeah , yeah . One thing : Does a certain company have access to data obtained from the computer ? A suggestion , Mr ... . ? Rupp . Why not write about how our simulation model is more than a computer ? I 'll suggest it to my editor . It 's a new generation of computer technology . Who benefits ? Everyone , if it 's up to me . May I see your ID , please ? Regulations , you know . I know . Thank you , Mr. Stiller . How can I help you ? For personnel files , you need special clearance . No , just the staff directory . Which letter ? Let 's try L. Alright , L ... L what ? Ask it , " Who is Günther Lause ? " WHO IS GÜNTHER LAUSE ? Günther Lause is unknown . Have a look . Okay . Edelkern . Ask it about Edelkern . What 's it say ? The truth , naturally : " Hans Edelkern is chief of security at IKZ . " Tell me , Mrs ... ? Meier . Know anything special about Hans Edelkern , anything at all ? Mr. Edelkern ? I don 't think so . Ask him yourself . Hi , Fred . Were there complaints about me ? Tell me the truth . - No , that 's not it . - Good . I was afraid ... I mean it . That 's alright , Fred . You don 't have to explain . I 'm sure you have your reasons . Say , why don 't you visit us again ? Laura still talks about our last dinner . Says you 're the most charming man around . Really , am I ? - According to Laura . - Well , then ... You see . Just give us a call . We 'd be thrilled , honestly . I 've never met a Laura in my whole life . Anything else I can do ? No , thanks . You 're welcome . I 'm ... I 'm here about Lause . Who 's Lause ? Forget it , Fritz . Something wrong ? Morning , Maja . Good morning . I 'm a gift . Siskins thought you 'd be pleased . Of course . Of course I 'm pleased . A sight to behold . Isn 't that what they say ? Yes , they do . Where 's Maja ? She 's sick . Probably will be for some time . By the way , Siskins was very sorry to lose me . I 'm deeply honored . - A cup of coffee ? - No thanks . I 'm delighted to work with you . The pleasure 's all mine . Get me the police , Inspector Lehner . Yes , Mr. Stiller . Inspector Lehner , please . Hello , Inspector . I wanted to ask if you found out anything about Lause . Who is this ? At the Cybernetics Institute . It 's about the Lause case , Günther Lause . Sorry , I 've never heard of a Lause . My God , you must remember ! Siskins ' party , a man disappeared . I notified the police . Slowly , Mr. Stiller , I don 't know of any Lause case . Siskins wants you in his office at 2 : 30 . Thanks , Miss Fromm . How are you feeling ? No idea . Not good . What 's the doctor say ? I had all the tests ... blood urine , everything . But they don 't know . Chronic exhaustion . And you ... How are you ? Siskins asked me to a meeting at 2 : 30 . Really ? - Who 's with you now ? - Where ? At work . A woman named Gloria Fromm . 42-26-39 ? 39 1 / 2 . From all that sitting . You should know . I 'll be going . Get well soon . Thanks . Fred ? I 'm still fond of you . Have a seat , Dr. Stiller . Care for a drink ? - A coffee ? - No , thanks . Really . Alright then , let 's begin . Would you ... ? As you may know I sit on the government - appointed commission Perspective 2000 as an expert on steel . Also in your capacity as chairman of United Steel Inc . Of course , naturally . And in this respect we 're somewhat preoccupied especially given certain recent trends in freight and transportation systems that would have major repercussions in the 80s and 90s on demand for steel . Do you have a background in business ? Hardly . Well , if I may briefly explain ... In our sector , investments are not only long-term , they 're also ... Very costly . Let Mr. Hartmann finish , Stiller . No , no , you can put it that way . Quite right . Costly . In other words , an investment to the tune of several hundred million if made today , would take , say , 20 years to be amortized . - If your analyses were correct . - If they were correct , yes . Naturally we don 't make wild guesses . We rely on a whole slew of scientific analytical tools : economic and market analyses trend forecasts , input-output relations ... to name a few . But you yourself know the limitations of the prognostic capacity of conventional computer technology and how much larger the margin of error is of such computers compared to your simulation model . Why are you telling me all this ? - I don 't understand . - He does . Dr. Stiller ... We 're not talking about opening a hot-dog stand but a decision of major importance to the national economy for which Mr. ? artmann , as a member of the Perspective 2000 Committee ... Then let the committee request it . Can you imagine the bureaucracy that entails ? Besides , the software wasn 't designed to access such variables . It would jeopardize the entire program and set us back two months . I 'll look like a fool . From a technical ... Thank you , Stiller . I 'm not asking . You 'll call up the data from the simulation model for the demand for steel for the next 20 years and have it on my desk by ... by the 23rd . I don 't know . You can 't just let some conglomerate ... Please let me decide what I can or cannot do , Stiller . Then you don 't need me . For God 's sake , Siskins ... I thought you 'd have settled this internally , at least . We have , my dear Hartmann , we have . You see , Stiller is a scientist . And in every scientist resides a bit of an idealist . But ... I 'll deal with the little idealist in Stiller . - ? ello , Stiller . - Hello , Hahn . Want to check the psychograms of the new units ? No , we 've reviewed them . Feeling better ? Yes , it just came over me yesterday . I should apologize for my behavior . Forget it . Really , I 'm sorry . Excuse me , but ... I need to go to the computer room . We 're up to precisely 9700 identity units . The equivalent of a small town . By the way ... I 'd like a hook-up . For you ? To sample village life . Fine with me , anytime . Oh , have a look . She 's in the mind of a millionaire 's wife . Yes , he 's here . Fine . Fine , I 'll tell him . The police are here to see you . The police ? Come with me . Hello , Dr. Stiller . You honor me , but this is Stiller . Excuse me , I 'm sorry . Hello , Dr. Stiller . I was hoping to speak to you in private . Is that really necessary ? I 'd say so , yes . OK , I 'll clear out . I 'll be at the computer . See you . Please come in . Yes ? We have questions , Mr. Stiller . Questions for you . Questions about the Vollmer case . You were his assistant ? You know full well . Yes , of course . Purely routine . Part of the job . Once learned you never forget it . Let me be frank , Mr. Stiller . It 's possible that Vollmer 's death was not an accident . You were away ? I told you , at my cabin in the mountains . What do you mean , you told me ? Nothing . Just that I was at my cabin . Can anyone corroborate that ? No . Vollmer was my best friend . You 're not doing too badly as technical director at IKZ . No , not too badly . I can reach you here , if I need you ? If you need me . Good-bye , Mr. Stiller . He was from Homicide . If anyone makes trouble , I 'm here . The police aren 't giving up , that 's good . Lause hinted that Vollmer 's death might not have been an accident . Who 's Lause ? The Lause who vanished without a trace at Siskins ' party . Did someone vanish without a trace at Siskins ' party ? Probably one of Siskins' harmless jokes . No doubt , Gloria , no doubt . A simple hook-up to an identity unit . Is that alright ? I chose 4388 for you , a truck driver . Enjoy the ride . OK , step on it . Here we go . Be good , and stay out of trouble . Floor it . Lousy weather we gave them . Strange , why 's there no traffic ? I don 't get it . Maybe it 's Sunday here . I forgot to ask . Kid , if I hit you , it won 't even cause a short circuit . What 's Walfang done now ? Hey , what 's that ? You were lucky , young man . Just a slight shock . We nearly saw the last of you . How 's it possible ? Search me . I haven 't checked the box yet , but ... But ... ? Say it , you have a hunch . Something exploded . It can only have been sabotage . lmpossible , with our security . If it exploded , it must be sabotage . A computer doesn 't just explode ! Sabotage is quite impossible . IKZ is under our control . Obviously not . A technical error , perhaps . How long will repairs take ? I nearly died , and that 's all you say ? You mustn 't get excited , you need rest . Yeah , yeah , OK . Good-bye , then . Thanks . Don 't mention it . Just doing my job . I want a thorough investigation . Check security measures , Edelkern . If necessary , step them up . Understand ? Naturally , Mr. Siskins . Of course . Mr. Stiller , I think you should go home and rest . Seriously , how long will repairs take ? Two or three days , no longer . OK , then ... That 's alright . Eva ? You startled me . Something wrong ? No . I was thinking of my father . Shall we go for a drive ? Just like that . You know , I need a change of air . Some of Father 's files are still on his desk . Check if there 's anything useful to you . I 'll get ready . Was anything removed after your father died ? Pardon ? I asked if anything was removed after your father 's death . Questioning me ? Come on , let 's go . Have you seen his drawing since then ? What drawing ? Achilles and the tortoise . I 've never seen it ... Achilles and the tortoise . I 'm going to try to find out how your father really died . Do you think ... ? Maybe . I don 't want anything to happen to you . What 's wrong ? Nothing . I don 't feel well . I haven 't felt well for a while . I get dizzy , see things . Probably , or possibly , I 'm simply overworked . Want me to drive ? I 'll just wait here a bit , then drive you home . One , two , three , four ... Come in . Fourteen , fifteen . - Hi , Fritz . - Hi , Fred . What 's that ? - For my circulation . - Your circulation ? I 've been having dizzy spells . Better watch it . Your puppets are dancing . I contacted 0001 again . Einstein ? That system failure has him worried . He 's being difficult . You know , I think that was Vollmer 's only major mistake . What ? The Einstein contact unit . It wouldn 't have worked without him . We tried everything . We needed a unit we could contact directly . Problems were inevitable . Why ? No one can stand knowing they 're artificial . Obviously . But if they suffer psychological disorders it shows how successful we 've been . Depends how you see it . Einstein reported an attempted suicide . Unbelievable . Who ? 7326 , Christopher Nobody . I 'll take him out . He 'll screw up the system . It 's inhuman of us , isn 't it ? But we have no choice . OK , delete him , this ... Right . Christopher Nobody . See you later . Zeno . Zeno 's paradox ! This is no coincidence . That must be what Vollmer 's drawing meant . Send me down to see Nobody . Nobody no longer exists , he 's in heaven . - Don 't joke . - I deprogrammed him . He 's gone . Shit ! Why ? - He must know something ... - Knew ... Knew something I need . Hardly likely , Fred . I programmed him myself . He was an ordinary unit . Why ? Nothing , Fritz , nothing . Just an idea . Let me speak to Einstein , he may know . Give me a projection link . OK , I 'll call you . - Where do I meet Einstein ? - In a hotel lobby . You only have 5 minutes . You 've kept me waiting . Hello , Einstein . Is something wrong ? Not often I meet someone from above . Right now I 'm just a bundle of electronic circuits , too . A projection , if you like . Shall we sit down ? I only have a few minutes , it 's not really worth it . It 's about Christopher Nobody . You spoke to him . Why did he try to kill himself ? A whiskey . He was on the verge of a breakdown . Why ? He knew . What did he know ? Somehow he 'd found out what he was . You don 't just find that out . Did you say something ? You know my circuits prohibit it . Time 's running out . Stiller has to be back in 1 20 seconds . In 30 seconds we 'll signal him . PHONE CALL FOR MR. STILLER My time 's up . Good-bye , Einstein . Come on , show me . Come on , show me . Come on , show me . I can 't bear it . Please , take me with you . You know that 's absurd . I 'll be back . Let me talk in peace . We 'll meet at 8 , Gerda . In the corner restaurant . What 's the idea , young man ? Where are your manners ? The impertinence ! A light ? Thanks . Everything OK ? Everything 's OK . Except ... I saw Günther Lause . Sorry , who ? Come with me . I want to do a test . Got a minute ? Sure . OK , I 'm looking for an identity unit . Use the list . No , let 's try a different method . I 'll describe him . Age ? 55 . Male . Single . Engineering degree . Psychological traits ? He 's good-natured . But stingy . Drinks quite a bit . Two minutes . Eva , it 's Fred . Too many . Anything else ? Heavy smoker , gold medallist in sports . Collects old watches . That should do it . Sorry , but ... No , I 'm running a test . Listen ... Could you pick me up ? I want to see you . See you at six . I 've got five . - That OK ? - I hope so . Their names ? Teiler , Strunz , Kittel Erdhofer , Lause . Lause 's first name ? Günther . Günther Lause . Didn 't you just ... ? Yes . What number ? 7683 . Programmer ? Vollmer ! That 's fine . Thanks a lot . Strange . daily News ! Mystery Surrounding Super-Computer ! For your own sake , forget everything you 've seen . Or your life 's not worth a dime . daily News ! Mystery Surrounding Super-Computer ! Problems ? Could say that . Is it about Zeno again ? Or this Lause ? Yes , him too . You know about the sabotage during my hook-up . But that a cop who 'd interrogated me once forgot , and interrogated me again ... that you don 't know . Or that the other night everything , the streets , lights ... disappeared for a few seconds ... that you don 't know . Nor can you imagine my dizzy spells and depression . I see . A street vanished and then reappeared ? Ice or water ? Nothing , thanks . I 've thought a lot about you , Stiller . I believe ... with your new responsibility for the simulation model and the unusual stress of your job you 're overworked , psychologically unstable . Think about it ... Every day you reign like God over a miniature world you helped to create and which you mistake more and more for a real world . You can add and delete people at will . This leads to feelings of guilt , depression and fear . You need to relax , forget it all . I have to make a call . What should I do ? You 've taken the first step : You recognize the cause , realize what 's happening , are aware of the problem . If you keep working on yourself , you 'll get better and your mental disturbances will go away . You should take a vacation . Forget it , especially now . I don 't want Simulacron working exclusively for Hartmann . I guess I 'll be going . Try to have a little fun now and then . And stop brooding . It 's not good for you . Believe me . I 'll try . Getting in ? Quite a coincidence , isn 't it ? It 's no coincidence . Dr. Hahn phoned me . He thought I could take your mind off things . It was fine with me . Me , too . Now I 'm feeling better . But I won 't be manipulated ! Manipulated by whom ? By Siskins . What do you mean ? I won 't be intimidated ! I can be just as pigheaded as Vollmer was . Vollmer wouldn 't let private interests take over his computer . And I won 't , either . Let Siskins do what he likes . Isn 't Siskins a danger to you ? No , because he needs me . Let 's dance . Morning , Fred . Morning , Miss Fromm . Thank you . Any mail ? Need an aspirin ? Important calls ? But Siskins wants to see you urgently . Miss Fromm ? Last night I said some pretty crazy things . Forget them . Were they all just crazy things ? So , what 's up ? I need your help . We have to do something . The media are getting impatient . One question , just to be sure : Could you convincingly explain our computer to a layman if all of society depended on it ? I have my convictions , and I can present them convincingly . That 's exactly what I expected you to say . Send them in . My colleague , Dr. Stiller , and I have a statement about the simulation model . Afterwards , we 'll offer refreshments . A misunderstanding has led to the publication of a report in the press that was misleading for the public . We wish to take the opportunity to dispel this misunderstanding . Dr. Stiller developed the simulation model together with Professor Vollmer . Dr. Stiller will say a few words about the new computer system . Strictly speaking , it isn 't a computer in the conventional sense but rather an electronic simulation system with tremendous storage capacity . As Professor Henri Vollmer put it with this system we achieved the qualitative jump to an autonomous computer . We 've created an artificial miniature world out of circuits , switches , electronic impulses and reflexes . When fully functional , it will lead a life of its own according to our rules , and with its own dynamics . Concretely , Dr. Stiller , what does the thing do ? Naturally Dr. Stiller thinks in scientific terms . If you 'd prefer a practical point of view ... I 'm at your disposal . Go on , Dr. Stiller . We 'd like to hear from you . I 'll try . You have to imagine the inside of our simulation model - we call it Simulacron - as a reproduction in miniature of our society . At the moment we have slightly over 9000 so-called identity units each of which has the faculties of perception , thought memory , imagination and so forth of a real human being . With Simulacron , we have in a word , a tiny universe identical to our own . Into this universe we can introduce certain impulses which ... - I 'm coming back to your question - impulses which lead to highly specific reactions . Reactions ... that precisely replicate human reactions . 20 years in the future . This means we can use Simulacron to avoid the mistakes we 'd make in that period . For example ... We can , to be extremely concrete use Simulacron to learn consumer habits 20 years from now ... how housing needs will evolve which transportation modes will become obsolete and which ones will be in use . Then you could also calculate if in 20 years we 'll need more steel or plastics . Yes , of course . In time manufacturers will have access to this data to avoid socially unproductive investments . What do you mean , " in time " ? As you are aware , our research project is state-initiated and sponsored . We do not define its mandate . Our sole mission is to carry out government policy . There are questions about your relationship to United Steel . There are always questions . That 's why you do research ... to find answers . Here , in our Institute , we seek to devote our energies to designing a better new , more humane and equitable world to meet the hopes and dreams of Mr. Stiller and us all . Now , a snack . What 's your true relationship to Hartmann ? Mr. Hartmann is a friend . A good friend . In private , Mr. Rupp , only in private . Hahn 's advice from the other day ... I think it helped . At least I know what 's wrong with me . I 'm sure you 'll be better soon . About the other night , I 'm truly sorry . I was out of it . Hahn called it " paranoia " . He 's probably right . I 'll be so happy when everything 's OK . Yes , and ... now with all the coverage in the papers , the TV and so on ... I just hope he 's painted himself into a corner . And you ? I hope you 're right . Please excuse me . Of course . See you sometime . Say something ! She 's not there . Could I have a light ? Now she 's disappeared , like Lause . Lause disappeared too , and everyone 's forgotten him . Except me ... He 's in my head and he refuses to come out . My Eva ... my darling little Eva . They 'll forget you too . But in my head , she 'll stay there . I mean ... my head 's a funny head . There are things in it that don 't go in any other head . Good morning , Mr. Stiller . Good morning , Miss Fromm . Aspirin ? One second . I tried to reach you all last night . Me ? Siskins wants you . Where were you ? Were you with Eva Vollmer ? You should go see Siskins right away . It 's important . - It 's Stiller . - Send him in . Morning , Stiller . Aren 't you a sight ! A night on the town , I bet . Have a seat . What 's up ? I wanted to introduce a new addition to your staff . I believe you know him . A top-notch fellow . He sent me his résumé and I didn 't want to lose him . That will be him . Come in . Mark Holm . Hello . Hello , Mark . Mr. Holm can join your team immediately . Where 'd you work before ? The Trau Institute , but ... Isn 't that a subsidiary of United Steel ? It is , Fred . Thanks , I was just curious . 161266 . My God , Eva ! Where were you ? I searched the entire house for you ! Hold on . Thank you . - So where were you ? - At home , of course . I fell asleep on the couch . You just didn 't see me . - I searched every ... - It doesn 't matter . I wanted to apologize for running away . I love you . I 'm happy . I 've thought it over , I 'm not worried anymore . I need you , Eva . Yes . Ciao . I 've been looking for you . How 's it going ? - A cigarette ? - God no ! I hate it . Mark Holm 's been nosing around . I 'm going to hook-up with Einstein . I want to know what 's going on with him . Like to come ? No , not today . See you later . Fritz , what 's wrong ? Nothing , Mr. Stiller , it 's nothing . You 're not Fritz Walfang . You 're Einstein . My God , what is this ? Let me go , please ! Don 't send me back . It 's my only chance . I want to be a human being . And I will . This is the first step . I 'll make the next one , too . Into the real world . What do you mean ? This is the real world . Still want your beer ? That 's what you think . But the truth is this world , which you take for reality , is only a simulation model of the real world . Fred Stiller , the big computer boss ... You 're nothing but a mass of electrical circuits . The identity unit Fred Stiller . You 're a number , like everyone here . A number in a research laboratory . Admittedly , in a highly advanced one . Professor Vollmer knew it . That 's why he had to die . And now you know . It can 't be , Einstein . Tell me it 's not true .

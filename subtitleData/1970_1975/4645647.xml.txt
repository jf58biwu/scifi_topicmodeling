 Night , Mr Croxley ! Been working late , have you ? Just finishing the wages accounts for tomorrow . That 's right . We wouldn 't want our pay transfers to be late , would we ? - Hello , darling . - Hello , darling . Why did you come ? I thought I 'd meet you . Aren 't you pleased ? Yes . It would have been better as a surprise . I 'm not going home . Oh , I forgot . The doctor . - I told you this morning . - You can drop me off . I 'll take a taxi home . - I have been to see ... - She 'll be better tomorrow . - Who ? - Your mother . You saw her today . God , this is awful . John , please try not to do that . Tell me how . It isn 't easy . You 're letting it get on top of you . What do you expect ? It isn 't exactly normal , is it ? The doctor said it would pass . And if it doesn 't ? Have you thought about that ? Don 't , John . It can 't stay like this . That would be too much . It 'll be all right . Bye . Oh , by the way , I forgot to tell you . - Stella . - I 'm sorry . Shut up , can 't you ? That stupid remark , you 're always using it . What can I say ? As soon as I tell you about anything ... - You just don 't think . - I 'm tired of it , John . You never used to be like this . The doctor 's got to do something . I don 't know how long I can stand it . What is it , Mr Croxley ? Now , won 't you relax and tell me all about it ? Ah . That 's better . Now , let us see if we can go back to the start of your condition . What do you want , Doctor , a show ? A few party tricks ? I really don 't think that that will be necessary , Mr Croxley . You know ... Sometimes I wonder if you really want to be helped . Most of the time , your answers to my questions are complete and direct , but somewhere there is a mental block , a refusal to come to terms with certain details . I have to go ! There you are , you see . It 's exactly as if I had touched a nerve ending . Won 't you relax , Mr Croxley ? I mean , really open your mind to me . There 's no point . I know it now . You can 't help me ! I shouldn 't have let my wife talk me into coming here . It 's early days yet . Now come back and see me when you feel a little more responsive . My secretary has pencilled in ... Oh , no . I can 't make Thursday . What did you say ? I thought you said Thursday . No , Mr Croxley . I was about to . But you have anticipated my words . There 's no point in going on . I shan 't come again . That seems to be a great pity . I feel that we were about to make some progress . However , you know where you can contact me . If you should change your mind , don 't hesitate to call . Are you all right ? Yes . It 's my wife . She 's going to have a visitor . Sighting confirmed . Course varying 8 to 10 degrees . - Get Moonbase . - Right . Hello , Gay . How long has it been banking and weaving like this ? 'It started 2 minutes , 20 seconds ago , sir . 'Before course and speed were constant . ' What were the readings ? 'Course 037-164 , 'speed SOL 1,6 . ' We 've never had a flight pattern like this before . 'Course still varying . 'Speed now 0,85 and reducing . ' Thank you . How long before Commander Straker comes on duty ? - What 's the panic ? - A UFO . Its approach is much slower than usual and it 's varying course constantly . Yes , but maintaining an overall flight path . I agree with you , Alec , this zigzagging is unusual . It 's as if it were trying to avoid something . Or find something . We can 't take any chances . Sound a red alert for all ground stations . SHADO Control to all stations : we have a red alert . Repeat , condition is red . Interceptors , immediate launch . 'Immediate launch . ' Stand by to set missile Control computer . Right . Missile timing : 1475 . Missile launch : 10 seconds . Positive . Contact lost . Moonbase to SHADO Control . We hit it , Commander . Well done , Lieutenant . It certainly made a new approach . I wonder what it was trying to do . We 'll never know , I 'm glad to say . - Cigar ? - Thank you . 'Moonbase to SHADO Control . ' - What is it , Lieutenant ? - ' I have another contact , sir . ' A second UFO ? No , sir . The same one . The same one ? But you reported a positive detonation . I know , sir . The scanners showed negative . But it 's back . What 's the position now , Lieutenant ? I 'm sorry , sir , it 's through Moonbase defences , heading for earth . Thank you . I can 't understand how they missed . That UFO was a sitting target . Maybe that 's what we were supposed to think . Yes , Alec . Force the Interceptors to release their missiles , avoid them , then it gets a clear run past our Moonbase defences . - Where is it now ? - Range : 7 million . Trajectory termination ? It 's changing course more violently than before . The nearest we can get is Europe . It could be damaged . Lieutenant Ellis reported a strike . Speed increasing : 1,4 ... 1,8 ... 2,4 . That does it . We 'll never get near it at that speed . Let 's get a closer ETT . Is the rate of descent constant ? More or less . There 's still a slight variation . Should be possible to work out a broad target area ? I 'll try , but our readings are less than adequate computer data . Do your best . Looks like it 's going to hit . What is it up to ? I 'll tell you what I think . I think that UFO is under manual control . First the flight variation was used to disrupt our computer programs , but now I think the alien is fighting to regain control . That makes sense , if it 's damaged . Yes . The next few minutes will be very interesting . Trajectory termination : areas 17 to 23 . Too close for comfort . Sound a red alert . Sir ... Course : 017-422 . Lieutenant ? ETT , area 17 . Map reference 405 , green . Alert the mobiles . Mobile 2 to Control , pass your instructions . 'This is red alert . Proceed to map reference 405 , green . - ' Stand by . ' - Roger , Control . Mobile 2 moving to ETT now , sir . It 's weaving off line again . SHADO Control to Mobile 2 , this is Commander Straker . - ' Get that area sealed off , Foster . ' - Yes , sir . I want a detailed survey . If there is a specific target , I want to know . - ' Stella . ' - Oh , John . - ' I 'm on my way home . ' - What did the doctor say ? - He wants to help . - ' That 's wonderful ! ' - I 'm not going back . - But John , I ... - ' Has your visitor arrived yet ? ' - Visitor ? 'John ... ' - ' I thought we could ... ' - Stella ! I have to ring off , I ... 'I have some thinking to do . ' Mobile 2 to Control . According to our map , there 's just a derelict farm and a couple of houses within a 5 mile radius of the ETT . It 's wooded , common land . What could be of interest there ? It 's out of control . The alien 's being forced to crash land . No , somehow I don 't think so . What 's it after ? What could it want in the middle of a wilderness of trees and bracken ? UFO speed decreasing . 12,000 knots . Range 1,000 miles . Course maintained . No deviation . It 's back under control and slowing down enough for a landing . When 's the estimated termination ? 5 minutes . Colonel , Foster won 't have time to evacuate . Speed : 7,500 knots . Decreasing . Range : 600 miles . The roadblock should be in position now . The whole area 's sealed off . 3 minutes to termination . Course maintained , speed reducing . Come on , friend , we 're waiting . It 'll be a perfect landing and we 'll be there . All cars in position . 'Right . Make sure no one gets through the roadblock . ' Roger . We 'll keep channel 3 open . I 'm sorry , sir . This area 's been sealed off . Military manoeuvres . - Military manoeuvres . - Yes , sir . You live ... Yes , I live a couple of miles over there . - I 'm afraid you 'll have ... - Yes , I know . It won 't be long now . 1 minute . Course maintained , speed ... Speed increasing . - Check it . - No error , sir , coming down faster . - Get Colonel Foster . - Sir . Mobile 2 . Go ahead , Control . The UFO 's increased speed . Crash velocity . It 'll be too late to correct . - ' Understand ? ' - Yes , sir . And Colonel Foster , if there 's a survivor , I want him . 'Right . ' Mobile to Control , have audio on UFO . Cloud cover preventing visual . 'Roger , Mobile . - ' It 'll be over you in 30 seconds . ' - Roger . It 's decreasing speed . Switching . Course altered : 2 degrees . - Have you got visual contact ? - ' No , sir . Tracking on audio yet . ' You all right , sir ? Get there as fast as you can , Colonel . Yes , sir . Mobile 2 to Control . It 's crashed right into a house . All right , Colonel . Do what you can . I don 't understand it , Alec . Under control ... and out of control . Crash-landing velocity , then safe-landing velocity . Now it hits a house . - Quite a mess . - Let 's go over the facts , Alec . Right from the start , that UFO was on an unusual flight pattern . We can only guess it was a method to outmanoeuvre the Interceptors . Yes , but let 's say it came in damaged . And , unable to control his ship , the alien tried to land , failed and hit that house . No , I don 't buy that , Alec . For a while it was out of control , yes . But just before impact it seemed to be fine . Then it looped that line of trees , smashed into an isolated house . Sheer coincidence . The house happened to be in the way . You could be right . But there 's enough doubt in my mind to make me want to look at the place . What happened to the pilot ? There was just enough evidence to establish he was an alien . And the UFO was completely destroyed ? The largest piece measured six inches . We found it embedded in Foster 's mobile . What 's the news on his condition ? It 's too early to say . He 's lost a lot of blood . At least he was luckier than the co-driver . What about the woman ? She couldn 't have known a thing about it . It must have been instantaneous . What do we know about her ? Ordinary woman . Married . No children . - Nothing to connect her with UFOs ? - Nothing that we know of . That 's her husband out there now . Suppose I better talk to him , Alec . Sure . - I 'm sorry . - You killed her . That experimental aircraft crashed into my house . How did you know that ? I was at the checkpoint when word came through . I 'm afraid there 's not much more I can tell you . I know . The details are classified . - If there is anything ... - Don 't you think you 've done enough ? My wife ... is dead . Look , you 've had a pretty bad shock . Have you ... No . They were all Stella 's relatives . They don 't mean so much to me now . - How 's he taking it ? - Hard to tell . He seemed to know exactly what I was going to say . Yeah , I guess it 's pretty difficult to find a new way of telling a guy you 're sorry . Let 's get out of here , Alec . Hi , Alec . Is that the time ? It 's time you went home . You 've been here a full 18 hours . I have to go through these reports . Not that they tell us a great deal . We combed the ruin and everything for a mile around . We lifted security yesterday . I understand Croxley was having psychiatric treatment . He also left his job . Not surprising after what he 's been through . I think we can close the book on the incident . Not quite , Alec . Paul Foster 's still in the hospital . Yes , I spoke to him yesterday . Doctors are very pleased with his progress . The wonders of medical science . - He wants to speak to you . - Me ? - He 's worried about something . - What ? He wouldn 't tell me . You called me all the way out here just to tell me that ? I thought you ought to know . Surely it 's a security matter . - What did he look like ? - It 's difficult to say . - It 's just an impression . - Come on , Paul . Next you 'll be telling me you hear strange noises at night . Look , every time I look up , he 's there , looking at me and there 's a sort of nausea feeling that comes over me . I 'll get you out of here . You 're OK to be moved to our medical centre . You 'll be closer to home . You don 't believe me , do you ? I 'll tell you what I think , Paul . I think you 've been lying in that bed too long . I also think if you 're well enough to worry , you 're well enough to go back to work . I 'll arrange for your discharge . - Good morning , Miss Ealand . - Good morning , sir . Somebody wanted to make sure that got here . It 's been in the material analyser . Just paper . With all those stamps , I would have expected a small atom bomb at least . It 's probably a film script . It 's addressed to you . - Do you want to read it ? - Ingenuity should not go unrewarded . Whoever sent it certainly knows how to draw attention to their work . Maybe they can write too . I 'll pass it on to the script department . Fine . By the way , have our medics cleared Foster yet ? Yes , sir . He 's waiting . With Freeman . - How long 's it been this quiet ? - Since you went into hospital . That was a month ago . There 've been no sightings since then ? Just two . The Interceptors took care of them . We managed to scratch along without you , Paul . Hello , Paul . - Feeling better ? - Yes , sir . Good , good . In my office ? You too , Alec . Are you fit for duty , Paul ? Yes , sir . Schroeder checked me out an hour ago . Good , good . No more little men watching you ? In the medical centre , security 's tighter than a drum anyway . Oh , I see . And you 're little friend couldn 't get in , eh ? Don 't worry , Paul . Go home and rest . Report for briefing in the morning . Yes , sir . Oh , Alec ! I want you to go over to the Zeta tracker station . The lieutenant in command has come up with a new grid link-up . - There might be something in it . - I can go right away . - Fine . - See you later . By the way , what 's that ? I assume this is a film script . Why don 't you open it and find out ? Get on to the Zeta tracking station . The commander over there , Lieutenant Grant , tell him to expect Colonel Freeman later today . - ' Anything else , sir ? ' - No , no calls . - I 'm out for the rest of the day . - Yes , sir . - I 'll keep channel 4 open . - Right , sir . 'Miss Ealand , has Alec left the building ? ' - No , sir . He 's with me now . - ' Have him come back down here . ' - Yes , sir . - I 'm on my way . Something wrong ? I 'll say there is . About as wrong as you can get . - What is it ? - Read it , Alec . Just read it . The SHADO Organisation . Colonel Alec Freeman , Moonbase , Skydiver , everything . It 's all there , Alec . Every last detail . - That 's impossible . How could ... - How should I know ? A security leak , coincidence , lucky guess . What does it matter ? It 's a complete dossier on SHADO . Its operatives , installations , equipment . - I don 't get it . Who wrote it ? - The name 's on the front : John Croxley . The man whose house was hit by a UFO ? Yes . Now , you tell me , Alec . How did he get that information ? The whole thing 's ridiculous . We checked him out and his wife . - Mr. and Mrs. Average . - Yeah . When I told him about his wife , there was ... something about him . He was different . Wait a minute . Foster 's little man in the hospital . That could be Croxley , too . - We 'd better pick him up . - No . Not yet , Alec . If it was him , I want to know more about him . He was visiting a psychiatrist . Maybe he knows something . Right . We 'll start there . And you say Croxley stopped coming to see you , Doctor ? Yes , just before his wife was killed . The same day , in fact . What was his problem ? You realise , I hope , that I do not normally divulge such details about my patients , but with your authorisation , it was a somewhat unusual condition . ESP . Extrasensory perception ? It 's a subject about which we still know very little but most of us have experienced it at some time or another . You yourself have probably been in the situation of sensing what is going to happen . Yes , and it usually means trouble . It affects different people in different ways . Some adjust quickly and make good use of their powers . I believe there have been a number of successful theatrical acts based on the condition . And Croxley ? He is not one of the lucky ones . It was driving him to mental illness . His powers of perception are so pronounced , he can hold a conversation with someone without that person uttering a single word . - A mind-reader ? - Not quite . Telepathy , perhaps . He can anticipate . He can , how shall I say , feel the future . And it bothers him . The point of mental breakdown when simple , everyday phrases take on a new and terrible meaning . Most of it is clear now , Doctor . Thank you very much . Croxley phoned here for you earlier today . And ? For some ununderstanding reason , he wants you and Mr Freeman to meet him at the ruin of his house at ten tonight . And how did he know we 'd be here ? ESP ? We 're early . It 's only 9 : 30 . Yes , I always like to look over a convention hall before a conference . Or a battleground before a battle . You know it 's madness coming without security ? We have no choice . Listen , Alec , we have to assume Croxley can anticipate our moves . The script . He wrote it by reading Paul Foster 's thought patterns . - Or someone told him . - No ! Listen , I believe that doctor is right . Croxley has a super-sensory power . If we try to go against his wishes or trap him - he 'll know about it . - I hope you 're wrong . So do I. I know it 's late , but this is not easy to live with . Listen , Paul , you went through a pretty rough experience . - It takes time . - But that was physical ! Paul , you nearly lost your life in that house . Your mind is simply trying to adjust to the shock it received when you were injured there . - Maybe you 're right . - I 'm sure of it . Look , if it bothers you that much , there 's only one answer . Go back to the house . Overcome your anxiety . Face the problem . OK , Dr. I 'll go home and get some rest . Good night , Paul . See you at final medical checks tomorrow . Croxley ! Where are you ? You know , Ed ... I think I 'm developing ESP . I 've got a feeling Croxley 's here already . You 're right , Colonel . Croxley ! The answer to your question is no . Why should I give you my gun ? You would both be dead before your hands were on the butts . You see , I do know what you 're thinking . You use a shoulder holster , Commander . Please . The lamp . You prefer the right hip , I believe , Colonel . Slowly . You have a more ... devious thought pattern . I want to see you clearly , before I kill you . It 's fitting that you should die here , Straker . - We made it easy for you . - Yes . I must say , you have particularly logical mental processes . How long have you had this ESP , Croxley ? All my life . It got stronger about a year ago . But I remember I used to play tricks at school , predicting the future . And UFOs ? What do you know about them ? Shut up ! You did it , Straker . You 've been messing with things you don 't understand . - And you caused my wife 's death . - No , Croxley ! Don 't you see ? Use your power . Use your ESP . A UFO destroyed your house , not me . It was part of a carefully laid plan . The aliens , Croxley . They 've taken over your mind . They killed your wife . They 're using you . Can 't you see why ? They 're using you to kill us . Croxley , for God sake ! Mother . You 're thinking about your mother . Stop it ! Stop it . It 's 4 minutes to 12 . - You die at midnight . - Croxley . I 'm going home . I must see the doctor . The doctor must help me . Help me , Doctor ! Come through that door and I 'll blow your head off ! Croxley , listen ... You say you want someone to help you . Our planet is dying . Our national resources are exhausted ! We must come to earth . We must come to earth to survive ! Mother ? Stella . What are you doing ? Don 't try anything . Hold it there ! 2 minutes . Hello , Billy . We 'll be late for school . I know what you 've got for lunch : cheese and pickle sandwiches . No one told me . No , no one told me . No , don 't hit me . No ... Give me the gun . You fool ! Do you think I 'm going to let you get away with it ? We mean no harm to peoples of earth . Why do you attack us ? We 're fighting for existence . You must understand ! No . There 's no need for words . It is time . He knew . What did you think , Alec ? When you saw Foster appear behind Croxley . Shoot , for God 's sake , before he ... - He could read our thoughts . - Yes . I 'll always believe that in the last few seconds , Croxley regained control of his own mind . Well , here 's to fate and fear . - Strange toast . - Not really . What brought Paul Foster to that house ? And Croxley . Fate had him marked from the moment he was born . How much of his power did he gain from the aliens ? - You mean his ESP ? - We can only guess , Alec . And how many other Croxleys are there in the world ? - Your toast was fate and fear . - Yes . It 's fear of the unknown which helps us to keep alert , Alec . When and if the answers do come , it will be fear that helps us recognise them .

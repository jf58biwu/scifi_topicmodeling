 [ theme music plays ] [ groaning , gasping ] [ electronic ringing , bleeping ] [ gun clicks ] How long ? [ Camber ] Ten seconds . [ thud , clattering ] Quiet . Sorry , leader . In his right hand pocket . Three small stones and a fir cone . Check . Three one five ? [ Ira ] Four seven two . Blue stations ? Sunrise . All right , we 'll go . [ distant humming ] You ready ? What 's that noise ? Machinery in the valley . You all right ? I can 't remember what we 're doing here . [ Brinson ] Don 't worry . Nobody can . [ groans ] [ engine revs ] [ yelps and crashes to the floor ] [ man ] Secure , secure ! Take a look at him . Follow my lead ! [ Camber ] Tunnel one , clear . [ Stock ] Tunnel two , clear . [ clattering ] [ Sanders ] Tunnel three , clear . [ Brinson ] High degree security . [ man cries ] [ Camber ] Position secure . [ Brinson ] Stand down . Low degree vigilance . Stock . Leader ? Get your lights working . - How is he ? - In pain . Fulman ? Fulman ? [ strained ] I can 't move . What 's wrong ? My foot , I think I wrenched it when I ejected . - What 's he talking about ? - Ejected ? Yes , I know when I hit the ground I couldn 't stand properly . All right . Just take it easy . - How 's he doing ? - He is fine . What does he mean ejected ? You didn 't come by plane . I know . ln essence , your subliminal briefing will be in two layers . SB 1 , at the top of the unconscious if I may use the phrase , will contain details of the operation that you 're going to carry out . SB 2 , however , [ over broadcast ] will be conditioned at a deeper level and will consist primarily of your cover story , should the operation be blown or aborted . You may ask why this has to be fed into your unconscious . Well , the answer is very simple . Just as we have made great strides with subliminal briefing , so too has the enemy progressed with subliminal interrogation . ln these circumstances , any story consciously contrived and presented , would stand no earthly chance of convincing the enemy . He must think it crashed , that 's why he keeps talking of ejecting . Of course , it crashed . That 's why we 're here , isn 't it ? Who are you anyway ? Open your mouth . Open your mouth . The blocking capsule . It 's gone . What are you doing ? It 's my foot . Fractured . It will be obvious that we cannot hope to reach SB 2 by means of cue words . Because in the event of discovery , say , or an attack , who would relay them to you ? No , in this case we have recourse to direct-action drugs . A capsule containing a minute dose of CDP will be cemented behind your teeth . And in the event of any trouble , you will break it simply by biting into it . And if we 're incapable of biting ? Oh , a sudden jolt or blow on the head from behind all have just the same effect , that of dislodging the drug and opening the door to SB 2 . The wonders of science . Instant cover story . Yes , as you say . So that 's what 's happened . He 's gone straight into the cover story . He must have broken the capsule in the fall . What will happen ? Will we go on ? Of course . What are you talking about ? Go on with what ? We were supposed to give ourselves up if the plane crashed . Fulman , do you remember me ? Yes , you 're Brinson , the leader . That 's right . I lead . Sanders , Stock , get Fulman down there immediately . What is this place anyway ? Don 't ask me . Are we supposed to blow it ? Your guess is as good as mine . Get your blanket . You don 't care about anything , do you ? Only doing what I 'm told . What 's the matter with his ankle ? Is it broken ? I don 't think so , must have gotten a nasty wrench though . That must have happened in the fall . Or when he ejected from the crashing plane . But that didn 't happen , did it ? Did it ? He thinks it did . Well , I don 't believe it . Don 't you ? I 'll tell you something . Deep down in there you do . [ Camber ] Sanders , come and take over here . You don 't know it yet , but you do . Coming . I must go now . But the main surge chamber is through there . Yes . That is to say , beyond that wall it 's just water ? - Some of the time , yes . - And in here ? - What ? - Water ? Oh , yes , when the main chamber overflows . - Comforting . - Ha . Is that what those watertight doors are for ? Yes , when the water in there rises above a certain mark , then those doors close automatically . Later , the overflow comes in from up there and disappears by raising this wall . As you said , comforting . Do we get a warning ? Oh , yes , bells ring . We take to our heels ? But you need not worry about that . It 's never been used before . How long have we got ? Three hours . Not much . I must go now , I 'm on shift soon . You work here ? Yes , in the main power chamber . Remember to leave it in time . But what if we should need you ? Why should we do that ? Something may go wrong . There is a way to contact me , you 've been told . But it 's dangerous . For you ? For you as well . Don 't follow me now , there are guards everywhere . - Ira ? - Yes . - Where are we ? - Where ? What country ? Does it matter ? What 's wrong ? I think we ought to abort the operation . Abort ? You give me your reason . We 're shorthanded . We 've all been programme-briefed to do a different job . How are we going to manage without Fulman ? The best we can . Then we don 't stand a chance . Your nerves going already ? Leader , listen . [ rumbling ] What the hell is it ? It 's all right , it 's only water , it can 't harm us . We ought to get out . Get out ? Oh , no . This place gives me the creeps . [ beeping ] A hydro-electric plant . Eight hundred metres . Where are you going ? What are you doing ? [ beeping ] We 'll blow it . We 'll blow it good and proper . I 'm looking forward to it . Three hours , we have to work fast , though . [ Camber ] Where 's the leader ? He went out there . [ Sanders ] The point is , where do we detonate ? There is no one there . [ Camber ] Were you expecting somebody ? Yes . Yeah , I suppose , I came to . I was standing out there in the passage , no one there . Well , they must be late . [ chuckles ] [ Camber ] When do we start , leader ? Can 't we get on with this ? - We haven 't got much time . - What 's wrong with you , Fulman ? You , that 's what 's wrong , listening to voices in your heads . Of course , you can 't hear them , can you ? [ Fulman ] You 're damn right , I can 't . The point is , can you ? [ Camber ] Do you think he 's imagining it ? Those people you went out to meet . They probably don 't even exist . Look , you know we were told to give ourselves up . Why are you disobeying orders ? Leader , your visitors . [ Denman over broadcast ] By overlaying your initial personality with one or two or even more sets of patterned behaviour , we 've succeeded in greatly increasing your efficiency as fighting units . Rumour talks of our cramming other people into your skulls . This is simply not so . Patterns of behaviour are not people . By programming you to behave in a certain way in certain circumstances , we 're not changing you , we 're adding to you . Believe me , if we wanted to achieve a quite different set of standards in the operation , we would have to add quite different people . - Three seven three ? - Blue stations . Sunrise . Well ? I have no more . I have . in his back pocket , three small stones and a fir cone . Three stones and a fir cone . Put there after you took them off the guide . Didn 't know I had them . I gave them to you on the way here . Yes , you were programmed to . It seems to me you 've put an awful lot of reliance on Stock 's unconscious . Ah , but if subliminal briefing has taught us one thing , it 's that the unconscious is far more reliable than the conscious . What would you have done if the programming hadn 't worked ? Oh , my dear fellow . I would have killed you . Hine . Doctor . - Hydro-physics . - Brinson . Leader . Strike Syndicate . This is my second in command , Camber . Oh , that 's my assistant . Lydia Hoggart . She is a specialist in thermionic demolition . Hmm , I can believe that . So you 're going to show us where to put the charge ? Yes , we 'll do our best . We have one quite good suggestion already . You 've been here long ? Only two hours more than you . [ Brinson ] You 've been working very hard . It 's our job to be ready for you . What is this place exactly ? Hydro-electric plant . This is a throttled reserved surge tank with inclined secondary shaft , lined with steel and concrete . Diameter ten metres , height 59 metres , area 57 square metres . Upper expansion , 24.5 by 13 by 10 . Now he knows . I 've been here before . [ door closes ] Yeah ? When I came looking for you . Ah , we were probably next door . It 's a store room of sorts . No guards ? No , not here . It 's lucky . That 's probably why Ira brought us here . You want to see this . [ rattling ] Here , it 's incomplete as yet , I 'm afraid . Camber , take a look at this . [ Hine ] All right , now , we 're- - We 're lying up here . This tunnel here . On one side , we have the reserve surge chamber . And on the other side the main tank . Now on this side , we have the two storerooms and then our greatest find so far , the lift shaft . [ Brinson ] That 's how we get to the blowing area ? Well , we hope so . We haven 't had a chance to check it yet . And where do we blow ? Well , if our calculations are correct , here on the pipeline . There is a geological fissure that will greatly increase the damage . [ chuckles ] Practically shift the mountain . How far down is that ? Eight hundred metres . As control predicted . Right , collect Sanders and our gear . [ Fulman ] Stocky ? Stocky ! [ Stocky ] What ? Can you come down here a moment ? Why ? I need my cigarettes . Where are they ? [ Fulman ] With my gear , over there . Can 't you reach ? No . Come on , Stocky boy . I 'd do it for you . It 'll only take you a second . What 's going on ? What are you doing ? You heard me . What 's going on ? They 're planting the charges . Bloody fools . - You 've all gone mad . - No . You know they 're disobeying orders . What do you mean no ? You know I 'm right . Look , we 're making a perfectly ordinary routine flight in a Strike 75 . By navigational error we crossed the frontier . Shortly afterwards , our port turbo burst into flame . We ejected and landed on the mountain . You were just ahead of me . You had difficulty finding the switch . You must remember . No . Then what do you think happened ? I don 't know . You don 't know ? There was a hut . We were sleeping . Then we were here . Christ , you 're far gone . Look , Fulman , I must get back to the landing . I 'm in the hands of a lot of lunatics . I 'm right , you know . The release switch was near your right foot . You remember that , don 't you ? Shut up . Going down . [ elevator whirring ] What about guards ? What ? - Guards . - One hundred . Yes . Yes , we saw some . Nearby ? We better ask Lydia , she saw them . Two hundred . On the second level . Down here ? I thought you hadn 't been down here before . Yeah , not below the second level . Three hundred metres . Unlined shaft , basalt surrounded . Formation three ppp . on the Grafton scale . - Check . - Were they heavily armed ? - Yes . - Four hundred . [ Hine ] But then the second level does appear to be the main communication way with the power chamber at the foot of the mountain . Let 's hope we never have to use it . Five hundred . We 're stopping . What ? It can 't be . Five hundred metres , there are three more levels yet . [ Camber ] We 're still stopping . [ whirring ceases ] Correction . We 've stopped . [ Sanders ] Five four zero metres . [ Camber ] Continuing basalt . - [ Lydia ] Check - Unlined . - Check - Graded clay . Formation two ppp on the Grafton scale . Check . [ Sanders ] What now ? Can you work out how close we are - to the pipeline from here ? - Just give me a few moments . [ Sanders ] We could try the door . What door ? [ Brinson ] If you ask me , it 's a dead end . [ Fulman ] We took off from Exmoor at 22 : 00 . We flew Tours , Bern , Ljubljana , Sarajevo , Limnos , Konya , cruising at mach 0.98 at 10,000 metres . Over Konya , Camber reported overheating in the port turbo-fan . We had crossed the frontier in error , and Brinson was trying to correct us , when I noticed flames coming from the port turbo-pod . [ Fulman ] Brinson ordered you to send a mayday message to base , and we ejected . How can you say you don 't remember ? Did I send the message ? Of course . That 's your job . Radio Operator in the Air Force . Then what am I doing in the Army ? [ Stock ] There is only one way to find out . No ! Don 't listen to that thing . You 've nearly found the truth for yourself . Trust me . Please , Stocky , I know what happened . That thing 's telling you wrong ! Turn it off ! [ beeping ] What ? Turn it off . You bastard . You 've been feeding me a lie . We were never in an air-crash . We came to blow up this place . But how did we get here ? Ask yourself that ! I remember now , by sea ! [ gurgling , strained ] No ! [ struggling , groaning [ beeping ] [ panting ] The pipeline 's angle of inclination is 69 degrees , 2.6 metres in diameter for 616 metres . But how far off ? At its nearest point , 313 metres . He 's right . We can 't get through this way . [ Hine ] We 'll just have to find some other place to blow it . [ Brinson ] The power chamber . - That can 't be done . - Why not ? It 's too risky . Risky ? Go and take fresh soundings . No time , two and a half hours to detonation . [ sighs ] How do you propose to get to the power chamber ? The guide , Ira , she can show us . No . Then give me an alternative . [ gasping , panicking ] [ Sanders ] Was he trying to get out ? [ Stock ] I don 't know . He had my gun , you see . Well , you had your knife . Yes . What happened then ? Then it broke ? Well ... Oh , I went for him with my hands . Yeah ? He says I was trying to tear his throat out . Who says ? I don 't know because the man was talking at the time . Oh , and it was the man who was telling you to kill him ? But ... [ chuckles nervously ] ... there 's nobody there , is there ? I mean , we talk about this man in our heads . But there 's only me in there . ln there , isn 't there ? Yes . [ Stock ] Wow , that 's what I don 't like . You see , because I 've never been for anyone with my hands before . And Fulman , I mean , he 's a mate of ours . Yeah , but , I mean , he 's dangerous , like he is . All the same , it 's not as though he 's lying because he believes one thing ... and we believe another . You know , I 've got this horrible feeling they don 't belong to me anymore . [ chuckling ] [ Camber ] But we 're not at war with them , are we ? What ? These people . I don 't know . But we haven 't heard we are , have we ? It may not be conventional war . Doesn 't that make a difference ? Not to me . We 've been given our orders . And that 's enough for you ? Oh , isn 't it for you ? You 're not interested in why we 're doing this ? No . You 've just been briefed to blow up a hydro-electric plant in somebody else 's country . Briefed , that 's a very euphemistic way of putting it . We were programmed to do it . We have no alternative . I wonder . What do you mean ? We could refuse to listen to the radio . But you can 't do that . I would like to try . But why ? What made you think like this ? I don 't know . I think I 'm just getting fed up with being pushed around in my own body . No , I won 't countenance it . You won 't ? As far as I know I 'm still in charge here . You ? Since when ? Oh , since the commencement of the operation . That 's the first time I heard of that . Are you sure ? Or have you just forgotten ? Doesn 't say much for subliminal briefing if you can just forget the identity of commander . No , no , you could have chosen to forget . Why ? Oh , I don 't know , ambition , certain independence of thought , envy even . What , of you ? No , no , of my position vis-a-vis the operation . You consider yourself a bit of a rebel , I think . I 've had moments . Yes , but don 't be too certain . You may just have been programmed to think that . This whole attitude may be the result of your briefing . I doubt that . Please yourself . Mr. Brinson may I just give you a word of warning ? You and your men seem to be in danger of forgetting the first principle - of subliminal briefing . - And that is ? To forego all claims to your own identity . And after all , what is identity , except the result of a certain pattern of behaviour ? And you 've been inculcated with more than one . You mean , Brinson as I know must cease to exist ? Exactly . Well , there 's one way to find out if you 're right or not . What are you going to do ? Ira told me I 've been programmed how to contact her . Let 's see if I remember . [ shrill bleeping ] [ whimpering ] What is it ? The water hammer . [ distant humming ] When the power house has to produce less power , it decelerates violently , causing a backrush of water into the surge chamber . [ prolonged high-pitched tone ] And what about that ? [ tone continues ] [ screams ] Cover your ears ! [ Fulman screaming ] [ tone continues , almost unbearable ] [ beeping ] [ high-pitched tone ceases ] [ buzzing ] We need you , now . - No . - Why not ? Too risky . - Okay , if this operation- - - It 's no good . You 've met your match . You should know , you met yours . You have an alternative ? That part of the operation is yours . I was only told to guide you . Very well then . The responsibility is all mine . We go for the power chamber . Camber ? Prepare the demolition packs . - What have you brought ? - Nuclear twin dogs . Well ? I think we 've got trouble out here . Right , I 'll come . How do you propose to reach power chamber ? That 's your problem . [ stomping ] The red light , the red light . Cut all switches . The port fan is on fire . Oh , where are we ? Oh , God , will we eject ? - I 've never done it before . - [ Camber ] What is it ? Where the hell are we- - [ Sanders ] He was freaked out by the noise we just heard . I 'm afraid . [ Camber ] But it shouldn 't have that effect . It was only a noise . It was more than that , an oscillation affecting balance what do we know of the blocking capsule- - [ Fulman , whimpering ] Stocky ... [ Camber ] It should last for 24 hours , that 's what we were told . And after that ? [ Camber ] The personality should revert to normal . [ Brinson ] Subliminal briefing ? - [ Camber ] All gone . - [ Brinson ] Everything ? [ Camber ] Yes . A sane man living in a mad world . He 'll be quickly out of touch with his surroundings . He 's not far off that now . [ Fulman whimpering ] And us ? Are we ? Leader , does that mean he 'll be mad ? We don 't know . [ Stock ] But the capsule shouldn 't do that , should it ? I mean , they wouldn 't want us to go mad . That 's war , Stock . [ Camber ] Is it ? We don 't even know where we are . [ Brinson ] Does that matter ? [ Camber ] And who are these people ? What have they done to us ? Why should we blow up their hydroelectric plant ? - [ Brinson ] Because we 've been ordered to . - And is that the end of it ? Mr. Camber , you are second in command of this strike operation and till it is completed , we will continue with it . But why , when it doesn 't make sense ? Because we 've been programmed to . Well , we 're not under programming now . How do you know ? Because I can talk like this . We have a choice . ln my mouth , I 've got the same blocking capsule as Fulman had , we 've all got it . If we like , we can bite on it and withdraw from the operation in the same way as he has or else- - Yes ? We can choose not to refer to the radio . Oh , can we ? Do you really think it 's that easy , Mr. Camber ? Do you really think you 're going to get through this operation without having to refresh your briefing ? - Why not ? - Anyway I 'd like to try it . [ Sanders ] I think that could be dangerous . I mean , it might be dangerous half of us listening to the radio and the other half not . No , I think that 's not what you meant . All right , I think he 's wasting his time . I don 't think they 'd ever free us from the programming , why should they ? To leave us some initiative . The planners can 't foresee everything . Do you believe that ? Do you mean that even now I 'm not me ? Not Dave Camber of No. 1 Strike Force ? - That 's Hine 's theory . - Well , it 's not mine . I know what I 'm capable of . I know my weaknesses and I know my strong points . I 'm in touch with my reality and I can recognise it . [ Sanders ] You don 't normally shout like that . I think we 're trapped in this thing and must go on . We are automatons . I believe the planners foresaw everything , even this conversation . And the danger you spoke of ? The danger is that even the planners are fallible . [ Fulman panting ] Well ? There is a way through there . Level two ? Yes . That 's where we blow it . The place is crawling with technicians and guards . [ Hine ] Whom will you take ? Ira and Sanders . Nobody else ? No . [ Camber ] As long as he doesn 't start screaming . He should sleep . Are you glad you 're not going ? With Brinson ? I don 't know . I think you are . I think you 've lost faith in this operation . Or have you just been programmed to think that ? And what about you ? Your faith ? Do you want to see this place go up ? Yes , I want to see it blown to hell , every stick and stone of it ! And I 'd like to see him die underneath it all . Who , Brinson ? He is so sure of himself . There 's only one of him . Don 't be too certain . [ Brinson ] Stand to . - We 're leaving . - I 'm ready . [ Camber ] Permission to accompany you , Leader ? Permission to accompany me ? - Yes . - Why ? I don 't honestly know . I felt impelled to say it . And I feel just as impelled to turn you down . If that was your briefing , tell it to try again . Perhaps you ought to take him . No , but I am taking Hine . Hine ? Why ? There may be something for him to do in the power chamber . Besides he 'll be useful , carrying some of the heavier gear . But you 've got younger men for that , your men . Strange , my briefing didn 't seem to tell me that . Well , good luck . [ Camber ] And to you . If we 're not back in 90 minutes , make a break for it . You 've got your blocking capsule if necessary . Some choice . Mad in a sane world or sane in a mad one . No , as the man said , we have no choice . [ whirring ] [ chuckles lightly ] Ah , yes , yes , I feel very good , very good , very happy , rather hungry . All right ? Now remember what I said . Do not get separated in the tunnel whatever happens . Well . And if you 're challenged , let me do the talking . I probably wouldn 't understand a word they 're saying anyway . Where are we ? - Where are we ? - Yeah . Near Kiraz . Where the hell is that ? Kurdistan . Well , I 'll be damned . [ Camber ] Go down to Dr. Hoggart for a while . She 's making some food . I 'm not hungry , I 'm feeling sick . You 're feeling empty . Will they be all right , do you think ? [ beeping ] They 've left the lift . From now on , it 's all up to their programming . [ loud rumbling ] [ Stock ] I don 't really remember my mother because she- - Well , she died when I was only a little baby . And they came along and they wanted to put us into one of those , erm , large blocks for motherless families . But my dad wouldn 't have it , he said institutions are never the same , that 's what he said . No , they 're never the same . Well , did you like dogs ? Well , do you know , they wouldn 't let us have our dogs in one of those places . And I mean , can you imagine living in a large block for motherless families , without your dog ? It 's ridiculous . How many did you have ? Seven . [ giggles ] [ machinery whirring ] [ Ira attracts guard 's attention ] [ thunderous explosion ] It can 't be them . [ beeping ] [ gasping , sighing ] Do you think they ... they could still be building this place ? Look . [ loud whirring ] It 's the turbine room . Five horizontal Samsons . They 're about two years ' old . Russian modifications but American heat boosters . They 'll make a lovely bang . What did you say ? I said , they 'll make a lovely bang . Right , leave the packs here , we 're clearing out . What ? What the devil are you talking about ? What 's the use of that ? They 'll do no sort of damage here . They 'll do enough ! Now move . [ whirring ] I demand an explanation ! I insist- - [ Hine ] After all your efforts to get control of the operation , - you can 't just throw it away . - I risked my life for you ! What about Ira ? She 's waiting to show us where to put the charges . She 'll have to take her chance . Now move ! I don 't know what 's happening . I only know I 've been through this before . It 's nearly time . They should be here at any moment . It 's 20 minutes since they signalled to say they 're returning . What do you think went wrong ? I don 't know any more than you do . Get on to the landing and keep quiet . Why not use the radio and find out what you ought to do ? No . Then I may have to . Then take it into the corner with you . I never want to hear the damn thing again . But they 'll find a way of making you listen . Oh , no , they won 't . I 've still got some independence left . [ Fulman whimpering ] Lydia , look after Fulman . What are you going to do ? Stand by to open the door for him . Do you want to try the radio ? Then we 'll leave the thing together . I don 't think I was programmed to do that . [ alarm bell rings ] [ explosion ] Camber , the doors ! [ bleeping ] They 're here ! Don 't let them in , they 'll only be drowned ! [ alarm continues ] - It 's Ira ! - Ira ? Brinson , help me ! [ Ira screams ] [ machine gun fire ] If it comes through , we can go up the ladder . [ explosions in distance ] [ Camber ] I 'm sorry about Ira . Request permission to listen to radio briefing . Refused . Request again . [ electronic bleeping ] [ smashing ] [ silence ] What now ? What do you hope to do now ? [ Brinson ] Work this thing out as a human , not as a robot . It 's too late . You 've betrayed us already , you bastard . [ Ira over radio ] Brinson , can you hear me ? Ira ? Where are you ? They 've got me outside . [ frantic ] What 's happening ? [ Ira ] They have you surrounded . You have to surrender . Well ? The radio fuse , is it beamed in ? Of course . I 'll show you if I 've betrayed you . Stand by to blow the charge . No , you 'll blow us up , too . Does that matter ? Yes ! I want to give myself up ! There must be another way . No , it can 't be helped . [ loud whirring ] Leader , look . Sanders , blow the charge . Bastard . The ammunition , like the charges , was fake I 'm afraid . I 'll count the operation out now . Three , two , one . The exercise is over . Exercise ? Yes , that 's right . Where are we ? ln Wales , your training area is just across the valley . But this place ? You 've been here many , many times before . But , of course , your programming wouldn 't let you remember . We use this for all your tests . You 'd better get Fulman under deep therapy . I think we may have overdone it a bit this time . [ Brinson ] It was all arranged ? Programmed ? Yes , everything . Every question , every doubt . Even that kiss , everything . But why ? To test your programming under stress . You were very good . I 'm delighted with your progress . [ Denham ] Your rebellion . Excellent . You were meant to do it . Meant ? Ah , Dr. Spencer ? The radios are too fallible . For the next operation , let 's try the receivers implanted . Probably in the neck . Can I help you , Captain ? He recognised me . An echo image only , we can soon erase it . After all , think of the number of times already we 've cleared you off his memory and then re-recorded you . The resilience of the human brain is amazing . I 'd still rather have a robot . But think of the relative cost . And what about replacements ? This way , when Brinson is no longer serviceable , we simply go out and find another Brinson , and another , and another . [ whirring ] After all , there are millions of him outside . [ explosion ]

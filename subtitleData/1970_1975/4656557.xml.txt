 The accused will stand . I want to make my position clear . The verdict in this case has been taken by the four jury officers , but I would like to establish , as a matter of record , that I am in agreement with them . After due deliberation , they have found Colonel Foster guilty of the charge as stated . Under Article 183 , the sentence is specific . The execution was fixed for 1200 hours , the 19th of next month . Any appeal must be lodged within 14 days . - Has Colonel Freeman left ? - Yes , sir , a couple of hours ago . - Shall I contact him ? - No , I 'll call him at home . Freeman . - ' Alec ? ' - Oh , don 't you ever sleep ? - Hope I didn 't wake you up . - ' Oh , sure . ' Listen , Alec , there 's a few things I want to check . First of all ... - Hold it . - What is it ? - What 's wrong ? - Don 't say anything . I 've got an " E " alarm . Are you all right ? Ed , are you all right ? 'Can you hear me ? ' Yes , I 'm fine , Alec . It 's a bugging device . Somebody 's out to get us , Alec . I 've got a pretty good idea who it is . - Mr Straker . - Thank you , we 'll go through . It 's all right , just show us where we sharpen our knives . I 'm sorry , sir . Don 't worry , Miss Scott . Stopping runaway trains is not part of your job . Straker , this is a most unpleasant surprise . - Yes , I 'm sure . - You know Jackson , of course . Of course . The eyes and ears of the world . Commander . Colonel Freeman . I 'd shake hands but you know I can 't bear to touch anything slippery . Now we 've dispensed with the pleasantries , I presume this is not just a social call ? Alec . Yours , I believe . Yes . Standard Mark IV bugging device . Range about 3 miles . Planted in my car . Why ? Two reasons : one to test your security ... And the real reason ? 2 days ago we had to squash a press report . It concerned a Skydiver 's rendezvous with a supply ship . It named the exact position and time . We had to go right to the top to get a supression notice . Yes , it would have been unfortunate for Skydiver to have surfaced and been greeted by a boatload of reporters and photographers . Is this some kind of sick joke , Henderson ? You have got a major security breach . You 'd better believe me . We 've checked . The information was never circulated . It 's specific to SHADO HQ under the studio . To put it bluntly , someone you know , work with every day , is a security hazard . Just give us the details . We 'll find out who it is . If you don 't , we will . It 's been very nice dealing with you , Mr Foster . - Let 's hope it works out . - Don 't worry , it will . I wouldn 't have let Diana sign the contract if she didn 't have a great future . One day , your studio 's going to thank me . This is just the start of a long , friendly relationship . The contract is subject to the director 's approval . Of course . I 'm sure we can come to some arrangement , Mr Foster . We can help each other ... if you know what I mean . Henderson was right . We 've got a problem on our hands . It 's a pretty frightening experience , knowing that somebody you 've known for years ... Has sunk just about as low as you can get . But who is it ? The coded message to Skydiver . The one that was leaked . Authorised and sent by Colonel Foster . Hi ! - How 's it going ? - Oh , great . There 's more to making movies than people think . - I 'm learning more every day . - Yes , that happens to most of us . - I want to talk to you . - Sure . I mean now ! Get rid of the crew . OK , boys , take an early lunch ! Leave it running . I want to see the other shots . Are you certain ? Right . Right , I 'll check it out . Yes , I 'll tell him . Close the door . You transmitted this 3 days ago . Yeah , but this is a ... - Hadn 't we better go to your office ? - Worried about security ? Maybe I feel just as secure right here . Did you transmit that message ? Well , yes . I believe I outrank you , Foster . Yes . Yes what ? ! - Yes , sir . - That 's better . Let 's keep it that way . - Look , what 's all this about ? - Just answer my questions . Who else knew about the Skydiver transmission ? - I mentioned it to Alec Freeman . - Exact position , details , time ? No , sir . - Did you mention it to anyone else ? - No ! Sir . Then how is it that this information which you say you told no one got into the hands of a newspaper ? - A newspaper ? - Yes . Giving the exact time and position of Skydiver 's rendezvous with the supply ship . I just don 't understand . Neither do I. - Straker . - ' I 've spoken to Henderson . ' There 's been another security leak : a routine flight from Moonbase . Who planned and authorised it ? 'Foster . ' Thank you , Alec . - I don 't get it . - How about an explanation ? Explanation ? ! Explain what ? - What do you think I 've done ? - I 'm not thinking anything . I 'm interested in facts . I 'm sorry , I just don 't know how I can help you . This whole thing 's ridiculous . Ridiculous ? Maybe you 'll think a military court is ridiculous . A military court ? When I tell Henderson the position , the outcome is obvious . And you 'd better consider this : SHADO is run as a military organisation . We 're at war . You realise the penalty for espionage . Three minutes to nine . Right . Guards . I convene this court martial by the authority invested in me under Article 183 of our charter . I must remind you that as of now , everyone in this room is under oath to speak the truth . Prosecuting officer may proceed . The accused , Colonel Paul Foster , is indicted under Section 8 of SHADO security regulations . I intend to show that he and he alone is responsible for , and therefore guilty of , the worst crime that can be perpetrated against our organisation . Espionage . The defence forgoes his right to speak at this time . Very well . Prosecuting officer will proceed . My first witness ... Lieutenant Ford . You are Lieutenant Keith Ford and a senior operative in SHADO Control . Yes , sir . Do you recognise the apparatus on the table beside you ? Yes , sir . It 's a standard code and transmit device . - Like the one used in SHADO Control ? - Yes . Will you tell us how it works ? The primary circuits are a series of electro-scanners , in series ... Lieutenant . We 'd be grateful if you 'd keep it as simple as possible . Yes , sir . The information is inserted here ... I see . In what form is this information ? Handwritten , on a standard input docket . - Like this ? - Yes . But you say the message or whatever is handwritten , it seems an antiquated method in this electronic age . It 's one of the best security checks we have . This device scans the card and compares it with standard samples . It will only accept genuine authorised input . So , for example , if I wrote a message for transmission ? It would be scanned and rejected , as would a forgery . I see . Whose handwriting is the coder programmed to accept ? Commander Straker 's , Colonel Freeman 's and Colonel Foster 's . And Colonel Foster 's . I see . The information is then coded and transmitted automatically . Yes , sir . Thank you , Lieutenant . Lieutenant , what happens to the input card ? It 's destroyed inside the coder . - But a record is kept of the input ? - Yes , in the coder 's memory bank . So if you , for example , wanted to , you could check the content of a transmission ? And so could anyone else in the control room ? - Yes . Anyone . - Thank you . Just how could you check the content of the transmission ? You select the relevant number and the information is printed out . - On another card similar to this ? - Yes , sir . But ... Isn 't it printed out in code as it was transmitted ? And isn 't it necessary to use a computer run to decode it ? When was the last computer run of this kind ? - About two 2 ago . - 2 weeks ago . And the transmissions concerned in the security leak were both sent within the last 5 days . That 's all , Lieutenant . Will Captain Waterman come forward , please ? Captain Lew Waterman , at present commanding officer , Skydiver . I 've just one question , Captain . Did you know the contents of the orders concerning the supply ship rendezvous transmitted to your submarine by Colonel Foster ? No . - Could you explain why , Captain ? - Until we receive confirmation , the message remains encoded in our computer memory . Is this a standard procedure for security reasons ? Yes . Neither you nor any of your crew could have leaked the information ? No . Would you mind speaking up , Captain ? - No . - Thank you . No questions . Quiet ! - Are you sure about this ? - Certain , I 've seen it myself . - It 's an open set . - Well , that 's just great . Set up the reverse . Keep it fairly low . - Where will you be ? - I 'm going to see Straker . He is head of the studio . Straker , Commander-in-Chief , SHADO Operations . Commander Straker , is Colonel Foster a friend of yours ? He 's an officer , serving under my command . Is he also a friend ? Not in the sense you mean . This comrade , is he guilty of espionage , a traitor , a spy ? ! In your opinion , of course ? My opinion as a man or as Colonel Foster 's commanding officer ? Why not give us the benefit of both answers , Commander ? Very well . As a man , my opinions are private and no concern of this hearing . As Colonel Foster 's superior officer , I 'm interested in facts , not guesses . No more questions . Colonel Foster is a comparatively new member of SHADO ? Yes . - And you authorised his acceptance ? - Yes , that 's correct . On what did you base your decision ? On the basis of the physical , psychiatric and computer tests , on his past record as an air force pilot , a civilian pilot and on my judgment . - He has security clearance ? - Naturally . Is this a copy of the security report on Colonel Foster ? Yes , it is . Commander , would you read out , aloud please , the last paragraph ? " Colonel Foster is considered to be an excellent security risk and we recommend class A clearance . " Thank you , Commander . Commander . You will see that I was one of the examining officers on that report . Yes . Your signature is here . Well ? It only goes to show that we can all make mistakes . Don 't you agree ? Thank you , Commander . I think this may be an appropriate time to adjourn . We 'll resume at 1400 hours . I need some air . Excuse me , sir . Carl Mason wanted to see you . He said it 's very urgent . Not now , Miss Ealand . Straker ! The defending officer may proceed . So far , the facts to have emerged from this hearing are that Colonel Foster was in possession of the said classified material . But there has been no proof that he passed on that information to any outside persons . I therefore do not intend to take up the time of the court with character references for the accused . His record speaks for itself . I call Colonel Foster . Foster , Paul J. , 804 . Colonel , are you guilty of the charges as stated ? Not guilty . Have you ever passed on classified information to any unauthorised person or persons ? - Never . - Thank you . Colonel Foster , would you say that you have a nervous disposition ? - You 're the psychiatrist . - Please answer my question . Normally , no . I 'm not a nervous person . Under extreme stress you stay reasonably calm ? Reasonably . It 's part of your profession , isn 't it , and part of your training , to remain calm in abnormal conditions ? Yes . Colonel Foster , are you nervous now ? Where 's all this getting us ? Please answer my question . Are you nervous now ? - Why should I be ? - Yes or no . - Answer my question . - No . You do surprise me . You stand accused of giving classified information to the press , endangering the security of SHADO , and the lives , the lives of everyone in it ! I object ! My client is being deliberately baited . Overruled . This is not a civil court of law . We 're after the facts . Continue . Colonel Foster , did you or did you not violate Section A , Paragraph 5 - of the SHADO security regulations ? - I did not . Then how do you account for the fact that the press got hold of this information ? I don 't know . I suggest you ask the press . And I suggest , Colonel Foster , that you 're lying ! I did not give classified information to any newspaper . All right , Colonel Foster . But ... I have one last question . Here 's a Photostat of your bank account . $ 10,000 was paid in on the 10th , by an unnamed subscriber . Could you explain that , Foster ? I can 't . It 's the first I 've heard of it . - Very convenient . - What are you implying ? Implying ? I am stating that the money was payment for espionage , the going price for a traitor , the rewards of a spy ! I am stating that you sold SHADO secrets to the press for the sum of $ 10,000 ! I know nothing of how that money got there . It 's a plant ! - Someone 's trying to frame me ! - Nervous now , Foster ? This is ridiculous ! He 's twisting the facts ! I protest ! My client is being deliberately baited ! Order ! I want order ! It 's a lie from start to finish and he knows it ! All right , Foster . Where did that cheque come from ? I tell you I don 't know . I 'm going to ask you just once more . Where did that money come from ? I tell you , I don 't know . All right . Alec , how can we find out about it ? A Swiss numbered account ? You tell me . Sir ... As my commanding officer , do you think I 'm guilty ? Whatever you say can 't affect the decision now . I 'd just like to know . All the evidence in that court martial says yes . But if you want a gut reaction ... No . Colonel Freeman . Right . They 're coming back in . They have found Colonel Foster guilty of the charge as stated . Under Article 183 , the sentence is specific . The execution was fixed for 1200 hours , the 19th of next month . Any appeal must be lodged within 14 days . This court martial is closed . It 's incredible . There wasn 't one piece of tangible evidence . Foster was found guilty through a series of airtight negatives . Information was leaked to the press . Foster was the only one who knew that information . He told no one . His word . And the coder transmitter is security proof . There must be some other explanation . Well , it appears to be military . No . No , I can 't give you the source , I just happened on it by chance . Yes . Yes , I 'll certainly do that . And the ... usual arrangement ? Right . Is there anything you want , Colonel ? - No , thanks . - Could be a long night . Shall I ask the doctor to get you something to help you sleep ? No , thanks . I 'll be fine . - Sleep well , Mr Straker ? - As a matter of fact , no . Well , that 's too bad . Because I didn 't sleep at all . It 's Carl Mason , isn 't it ? Well ! Recognition at last from the big white chief ! You 'll have to excuse me . I 've been trying to talk to you for 3 days . Everybody has problems . Some more important than others . - Take your hand off me . - Oh , no . I 've telephoned you a dozen times , I 've practically slept here . - Now listen to me ! - Mason , I 'm warning you ... You say you got troubles ? Here 's another . There 's a security leak . - Security leak ? - I 'm making a picture here . You may recall . The whole thing hinges on a pulsed light system , new design . I hear a rival company are building a replica . - Industrial espionage . - Right . I 'm giving you just 12 hours to kick Paul Foster out of this studio . What 's Foster got to do with it ? He 's the one guy I discussed this system with . - Where ? - Does it make any difference ? - Where did you discuss it ? - In his apartment . It 's a pretty long shot . It 's a pretty hairy coincidence . - Anything ? - Nothing . Foster 's not a fool . He would have run the standard check every week . - What did Henderson have to say ? - He wasn 't available . I don 't know why I bothered to call him . He wouldn 't be interested unless we come up with something concrete . - You 'd better reassemble that . - Why bother ? Foster won 't need it . Well ... Not much wrong with my appetite . - What time 's Webb arriving ? - 2 : 30 . He 's a good defending officer . He 'll make the appeal stick . Yeah . Sure . What about some more coffee ? I was almost sure . - There 's nothing here . Let 's go . - Wait a minute , Alec . Now , when Foster was working ... he 'd sit here . And when Mason was here , say they 'd driven over from the studio . Now , what would Foster do ? - Environmental therapy . - Let 's check it again . Positive ! OK , Alec . Let 's take this place apart . Get a group over here . Here 's another one . Very clever setup . 2 audio transmitters and 3 miniaturised cameras . All activated by the display lights . We found this on some waste ground about a mile away . - Tape recorder . - With a built-in radio receiver . When this starts transmitting , it receives and records the data . Then the contact comes along and picks up a tape . - Let 's find out where this is made . - Yes , sir . Who runs this place ? I do . Who are you ? I believe this is one of your gadgets . Maybe . Maybe not . Now look , funny man ... Miss ... Get lost . Now listen . This is private property ! There are 2 ways you can play this , Singleton . One is the easy way . Joe . What do you want ? The name and address of the client who bought that Peeping Tom . Hello , Colonel . How are they treating you ? Great . I 've drafted the appeal . It needs your signature . Yes . Valuable document . Rather fragile , but valuable . You 're a psychiatrist , Jackson . Does Commander Straker have an artistic temperament ? No . I don 't think so . Then why would he have a display like this behind his desk ? I 've often thought about it . Maybe it soothes his nerves . What would you say is the strongest instinct in man ? Love ? Hate ? Self-preservation ? Guards ! The target 's Colonel Foster , 804 ! Alert groups 2 and 3 ! I want a pick-up on Miss Jane Grant . Address ... 124 , Eastern Avenue . You got that ? Right . At the studio . Oh , and , er , put me through to General Henderson , please . Priority A. This I 'm going to enjoy . Straker . You may have new evidence , but I 've got something for you . Foster escaped 20 minutes ago . Groups 2 and 3 were alerted . What ? But you can 't do that . 'Foster knows the complete setup . ' He was found guilty of espionage . I 'm not risking the organisation for one man . My orders are to shoot on sight . - But his apartment was bugged . - ' Was it ? ' Or was it his way of passing the information ? It 's gonna take positive proof of innocence to convince me . We need an affidavit from that Miss Grant , and fast . - Is Miss Grant here ? - Yes , sir , she 's in your office . Thank you , Ford . I assume you have a very good explanation as to why I 've been brought here . - You are an industrial spy . - It all sounds so sordid . You had an apartment bugged . It belonged to Paul Foster . - Did I ? - The electronics were supplied by a man named Singleton . He 's told us everything . Then I suggest you call the police . You know as well as I do , industrial espionage is not indictable . Then I suggest you have me driven home . - This is an acoustic gun . - I have heard of them . Oh , excuse the pun ! - I 'm a desperate man , Miss Grant . - Armed with a toy gun ? If I place it against your ear , and fire ... the sound will pierce your eardrum . I 'm also told that the brain suffers varying degrees of damage . Even if I believed that , I don 't believe that you 're a desperate man . Believe it . Unless you sign a confession ... somebody is going to die . Just sign here . A signed affidavit . Get Henderson . It 's too late . He just called . Foster 's been shot . - I 'd like to see him , Miss Scott . - I 'll see if he 's in . - I have someone to see you , sir . - ' Send Straker right in . ' - Please go in . - Thank you . Straker . Must be my year . This is your second visit . I 'd like you to read this , when you find time between making up wisecracks . It includes a statement which absolutely clears Paul Foster . - Statement ? - From an industrial spy . A Miss Grant . She was after information at the studio . Our stuff was incidental . Jackson ... You were wrong , Jackson . Paul Foster was guilty of one thing . He worked nights at home . He wrote orders to Moonbase and Skydiver while a couple of cameras in the wall were taking pictures . You can prove this ? Does it matter ? I only hope it keeps you awake nights , thinking about it . Just a moment ! You think I 'm a pig-headed , cretinous lout , don 't you , Straker ? Foster was shot with an anaesthetic bullet . Jackson 's idea . Don 't fall over yourself with gratitude " Just a moment ! " " You think I 'm a pig-headed cretinous lout , don 't ... " " ... think I 'm a pig-headed cretinous lout , don 't you ? " " ... I 'm a pig-headed cretinous lout ... " " ... I 'm a pig-headed cretinous lout ... " I like it . I like it . Very nice of you to ask us down , Mr Foster . Is it ? I just wanted to give you this . You did pay $ 10,000 into my account , didn 't you ? Yes , but no one can tell where it came from . You understand ? Sure . When you came for the screen test , I didn 't know what you meant by " we can help each other " . But now I do understand , only too well . - Get yourself a new agent , kid . - Com on , don 't be like that . You don 't know how much that cheque nearly cost me . So get out of here while you can still walk . Foster ! Where the devil have you been ? Sunning yourself on some beach ? - Wait a minute . - No excuses . This is a studio . It has one function : to make motion pictures , all right ? Let 's go .

[ plane whirring ] [ intense heartbeat and heavy breathing ] Who are you ? What do you want ? Let me by ! I only live over there . My father will be along in a minute . You 'd better listen . That 's the truth . He always comes to meet me . No , don 't please ! Please don 't hurt me ! Stop it ! No , don 't please . Please don 't ... [ music plays again ] Please , stop it ! Don 't ... Please ... Please , don 't ! [ church bell ringing , camera shutter clicks ] [ camera shutter clicks ] Di ! Oh , come on , Eric , please ! [ engine revs ] [ Eric ] Welcome to your new home , Mrs. Carver . [ car door slams outside ] Fool ! Put me down . Do you want to ruin your image ? - What image ? - Eric Carver , swinging photographer of the contemporary scene revealed as old fashioned romantic . My God , you 're right ! If that got out I could be finished ! I shan 't tell anyone , promise . - In that case , give us a kiss . - Put me down . More . More ! Hadn 't you better bring the cases in ? Yes , I suppose I had . Doesn 't it look marvellous ? All fresh and new and yet somehow it still hasn 't changed . It feels the same to me . Welcoming ! Darling , we 're going to be so happy here , aren 't we ? We 'd better be . It 's cost a fortune . I 'll get the things . Surprise , surprise ! They turned the electricity on . I 'm going to grow masses of really exotic things . A simply enormous rubber plant . - Orchids perhaps . - Of course , that 's not to say - we 've got any water or gas . - And an orange from the pip . We don 't need gas . We 're going to be all electric . Are you sure you want to move in now ? Yes , darling , I do . So very much . Besides you 're doing that photo feature on the conversion . Simpler if you 're on the spot . Whatever it is about this house , it 's really got you , hasn 't it ? Yes , I can 't explain it . It 's just that ... Well , I know I belong here . It is as though the house has been here for years ... just waiting for me . A house that you want . So right ! Did I tell you I found a nice little old man , who specialises in restoring Victorian furniture ? I 've asked him to do these up for us . Just think , darling , these chairs and that gorgeous bed belonged to the very first people to own this house . That should appeal to the secret romantic in you . And if not , Victoriana is very trendy , eh ? This place is special . Everything is going to be perfect here . Everything ! [ Diana ] I must say they 've done a marvellous job on this bathroom . Stop fussing , woman , and come to bed . Won 't be a minute . There I 'm ready . Here I come . Ta dum ! Like it ? - Very much . - Brand new , to celebrate . It 's so light . I can hardly tell I 've got anything on at all . It is nice , isn 't it ? It 's beautiful . And you 're beautiful . So come to bed before you get pneumonia . I must say good night first . Good night , house . Good night , world ! Diana , come away from that window . You 'll start a riot . Who 's there to see me ? There 's nothing there but the garden . Come to bed . I don 't think I 've ever seen you as happy as this before . That 's because I 've never been so happy before . I really do approve of that nightdress . No , Eric , don 't spoil it , please ! I don 't want to . I can 't ! I 'm sorry ! Just that I thought well ... with moving in here and you being- - Well , I don 't ! Oh , I 'm sorry . I can 't , not yet . I know it must be awful for you , but you 've known all along how I feel . I never tried to hide it from you , did I ? No , never . It 's just that sometimes you seem- - That 's what I was so worried about our getting married ... Kept putting it off . It didn 't seem fair . And I was right , wasn 't I ? - I do love you . - I know . I 'm sorry , my darling . Often I wonder how you- - It doesn 't matter . It 's not important . Just so long as we 're together . I 'm a very patient fella . Go on , get some sleep . Good night . [ birds chirping ] [ Diana ] But , darling , I 've got to get us some breakfast ! [ Eric ] Later ! - Where are we going ? - Just around the garden . [ Diana laughing ] Keep going , and another one . Very good . [ Diana laughing ] Stop . [ Eric ] Come on . All right . [ screams ] Darling , get them off me ! [ clicking ] What are you doing ? You know how I hate webs ! Oh , no , help me ! Oh , horrible ! Darling , stop it ! Stop taking them , help me ! [ buzzing ] [ woman 's voice over intercom ] Your wife is here , Mr. Carver . Fine . Fine . And you don 't know who he is ? Of course not ! I swear he wasn 't there when I took the photograph . Well , he obviously was there , wasn 't he ? We just didn 't see him . Darling , I 've been taking photographs for a long time . I do know what I frame up in the viewfinder . He 's only in the potting shed ones . Could it be some kind of double exposure ? Hardly , it was a new roll . And besides if I had accidentally loaded up with exposed film , the super-imposition would 've run right through . I mean , there 's no mysterious figure on the other 30-odd shots I took , just on these last ones . Well , then that settles it . He was there . He must 've been there . But how come we didn 't see him ? You were far too busy concentrating on your beautiful wife . So was he by the look of it . And you didn 't see him either ? I 'd have said something at the time , wouldn 't I ? Yes , I suppose so . What 's he doing ? And who the hell is he ? He 's not known to us , Mr. Carver . Not that he has to be local , of course . - When did this happen ? - Last week . What do you suppose he was up to , Inspector ? A peeping tom or some drop out perhaps . Have you seen him again since you took these pictures ? - No . I didn 't really see him then . Hmm ? It doesn 't matter . I just don 't want him hanging around . I don 't think you need worry . He probably moved on . But I 'll have a word with the Panda patrol and the beat man , to keep their eyes open . Thanks , Inspector . Is it all right if I hang on to one of these ? Yes , of course . I hear you 've done great things to the old Hubbard place . - We 've made a few changes . - It 's about time . It 's a pity to see a big house like that standing empty . - Is it all finished now ? - Yes , all finished . We 've even got the electricians out and the furniture in . Good . Then , you 've got the place to yourselves at last , eh ? I hope so . [ bell chiming ] Di ? Are you in there , Di ? Diana ? [ rattling ] [ owl hooting faintly ] Di ? [ frog croaking ] Diana ! [ owl hooting ] [ frog croaking ] Diana ! For God 's sake , Diana . It 's two o 'clock in the morning . What the hell are you doing ? Hey , it 's all right , love . It 's all right . Come on , come back to bed . [ creaking ] [ shutter clicking ] [ bell chiming ] [ chiming continues ] [ rustling , scraping ] [ crash ] Darling , what happened ? Are you all right ? [ Diana ] Thank God you weren 't hurt , darling ! Amen . [ Diana ] That statue must have been loose or something . You 'd better check the other one . We don 't want that happening again . No , we don 't ! Were you out there on the balcony when it happened ? No , I woke up and you weren 't anywhere around , and I was coming out to look for you when I heard the crash . Oh , you could 've been killed , do you know that ? That thought had crossed my mind . Maybe you ought not to go into the office today . Why ? Well , after a nasty experience like that . - Maybe you ought to rest . - Too much work , love . How about you ? How are you feeling ? Me ? I 'm feeling fine now . It was just the shock of seeing how close that thing came to hitting you . No , I wasn 't thinking about that , I was thinking about last night . Last night ? Oh , that stupid sleepwalking act of mine . I 'd forgotten all about that . I 'm sorry , darling . You must 've been worried silly . I was . Have you ever done anything like that before ? Not as far as I know . It was a strange thing to do , wasn 't it ? All I can remember is waking up out there in the garden , and you bringing me back to bed . And you 're sure you are all right now ? Never felt better . Poor you though . First me sleepwalking and then that statue falling . - It makes me feel guilty . - Why ? You can 't help sleepwalking . And you didn 't push that statue , did you ? Eric ! What an awful thing to say ! It 's all right , it 's a joke . Still , if you had done it , it would 've been a nicely ironic way of finishing me off . What do you mean ? That pile of rubbish down there was supposed to be Clytemnestra . She murdered her husband . Transfer this call to the accountant , please , love . He 's dealing with it . Hello , Mac . How 's things in the lab ? Extractor fan broke down again . Damn thing ! I phoned the engineers . They 're sending someone around . Not that it will make any difference . You 've got something for me ? Aye , I 've run off some of the stuff you took down at your house . You know , the second batch , with the rooms all done up and furnished . Fine , just stick them on the desk , will you ? I 'll have a look at them in a moment . Cigarette ? - How did they come up ? - They 're good . Yeah , certainly original . That 's a very nice place you 've got down there . I can 't say I find the model very appealing though . Do you mind ! You 're talking about the woman I love . I didn 't mean , Mrs. Carver . I meant the other one , the man . Now he 's in the house . [ French music plays through record player ] [ doorbell rings ] [ music stops ] - Mr. Carver ? - Yes . My name 's Phillimore . [ Phillimore ] You contacted the National Psychical Research Association , I believe . [ Eric ] Oh , yes of course , do come in . Dr. Phillimore ? That 's right . I do field work , for the National Association from time to time . And as I happen to live locally , they asked me to call . - I see . Can I take your coat ? - Thank you . Sorry . - You 're a doctor of medicine ? - No , I 'm a psychiatrist . I see you are surprised , Mr. Carver . But haunted houses and troubled minds , aren 't all that dissimilar . You could say that most of those people who come to my consulting rooms are plagued with ghosts of one kind or another . Oh , what a delightful home you have . Thank you . I 'll call my wife . She 's upstairs . I think it might be a good idea if you and I had a chat first . Just the two of us . All right . I 've got the photographs in the sitting room . So , it 's purely a photographic spirit ? Yes . Is that unusual ? Well , there have been many photographs of alleged psychic manifestations . Almost without exception , they were proved to be fakes . Do you think I faked those ? Well , you could 've done . But for what reason ? - Exactly ! - Publicity ? Sensation seeking ? To frighten your wife for some reason ? What do you mean , some sort of persecution ? Well , if that 's the case , it 's not working . I 'm the one who is scared . Not her . That 's interesting . Cigarette ? Oh , don 't tempt me . Oh , dear ! Do you really believe in ghosts ? Oh , I certainly believe in the irrational . I live with it every day . If I didn 't , I 'd have to dismiss your pictures as a hoax . Yes , but ghosts ? Mr. Carver , why should we attribute all phenomena we label as supernatural to the dead ? If we know anything for certain about the human mind , it 's that it 's capable of some very strange things . Like conjuring up a figure that can 't be seen , - but comes out on photographs ? - Perhaps even that . I see , so it 's all in the mind . We 're imagining it or pretending that he 's not visible - when we take the- - - I didn 't say that , Mr. Carver . Your visitor might well come from beyond the grave . At the moment , we just don 't know . How do we start ? Well , what about a stroll around your garden ? So you 've been married for more than three months , but you 've never made love to your wife . Why 's that ? Diana was assaulted when she was 15 by some maniac . - He raped her . - I see . So , by association , the sexual act is repellent to her . I knew the way she felt before we got married . - Does it bother you ? - Sometimes . The doctors say she 'll get over it . But meanwhile she rejects you . On the odd occasions I forget , which isn 't often . Did they catch the man who raped her ? Yes . Not his first offence apparently . That 's where our friend first showed up . The potting shed . Oh , it 's getting chilly . Shall we go in ? And , if it 's not an imposition , perhaps Mrs. Carver would show me over the house . - It really is delightful . - Thank you , Doctor . I must say I agree with you but then I am biased . Yes , your husband told me you feel an extra special ... - affinity with this house . - Oh , I do . I felt it from the first moment we came here . As if it had been waiting for you , for a long , long time , your husband says . - Does that sound silly to you ? - Not at all . And this strange business with the photographs , I gather that doesn 't worry you . No , not in the least . It 's Eric who is worried . - You 're not afraid ? - No , quite the opposite . I find it all very exciting . Right . Thank you . Well , that 's very nice . It 's French , late 18th century , I believe . It was my father 's . It 's so big there was really nowhere else we could put it . [ Phillimore laughs ] Well , thank you both for the guided tour , and for putting up with all my questions . It 's been most interesting . What 's your next move then , doctor ? I was rather hoping you 'd ask me to stay for the evening . Of course . I can 't offer you a very fancy meal , I 'm afraid . Oh , anything , Mrs. Carver . Please , I 'm not fussy . And then later on we 'll see if we can 't get a peep at your admirer . - Admirer ? - Really , Doctor . Well , it 's certainly not you he 's ogling . Well , if you 'll excuse me , I 'll go and see what we 've got in the deep freeze . Shall we have a drink ? Yes , that sounds like a very good idea . And then perhaps you 'll help me bring in some equipment I have in the car . So , you think there is something here ? Oh yes , Mr. Carver , there 's no doubt about it . There 's a very ... very , strong influence at work here . But exactly what 's causing it , well , that I can 't tell . Not yet anyway . Good , good , good . How 's it going ? Fine . Is Mrs. Carver all right ? Yes , she 's all right . She 's gone to bed . You know you still haven 't told me what you 've got in mind . Well , it 's quite simple . Your visitor only appears on photographs . So now there 's at least one camera , with electronic flash in every principal room . If he 's present at any time tonight , we shall get him on film . Yes , but we can 't be everywhere at once . Besides we can 't see him , how do we know when to shoot . Oh , we won 't have to . He 'll do it for us . Just about the one common fact with all psychic phenomena is that when they occur , they always create a sudden , localised fall in temperature , so that the air immediately around them is considerably colder , than that in the rest of the room . They 're called cold spots . ln there is an ultra-sensitive thermostatic switch , set to contact at only five degrees below normal room temperature . If a cold spot passed across the face of this unit , the camera will operate automatically . Very clever . Let 's hope it works . Well , it will work . Assuming anything happens to trigger it of course . [ laughs nervously ] But if it does , then the flash gun will serve a double purpose , because as each one fires we 'll know exactly where the cold spot is . And we 'll be able to pinpoint its movements . - Are you afraid ? - Yes , a little . There 's no need to be . Not if you do exactly as I tell you . I 'll try to remember that . [ Eric ] Is there anything I can do to help ? - No , everything is ready . - What now ? Well , we make ourselves as ... comfortable as possible , Mr. Carver . And we wait . What time is it ? Twenty five past three . I don 't think anything 's going to happen . Perhaps not . - More coffee ? - Good idea . Are you bored ? I was all tensed up . A bit of an anti-climax . Been a waste of time , hasn 't it ? No . If nothing happens it will prove something . Do you hear that , ghost ? You 'd better to your stuff or the doctor here will think that I rigged the whole thing just as a corny stunt . That 's what you 're beginning to think , isn 't it ? I 've already told you ... What is it ? What can you see ? Nothing , but it 's here . Somewhere close by . Don 't you feel it ? - No , I can 't feel anything . - Then take my word for it . There 's a psychic presence and it 's getting stronger every second . Stay exactly where you are , Mr. Carver . He 's on the stairs . He 's stopped moving . He 's somewhere between those two cameras . What 's he waiting for ? I said stay where you are ! Diana , go back . He 's on the stairs . Diana ! Let go , will you ! Let go . Diana ! [ footsteps on stairs ] Carver , the mirror ! Look out ! [ clattering , crashing , shattering ] It 's all right , Mr. Carver . It 's all right now . He 's not here anymore . [ bell chiming ] - How is she ? - Tired . She 's staying in bed for a while . But otherwise she 's as right as rain . She insists she doesn 't remember a thing about last night . And what about you ? That was a very nasty experience . - You sure you 're all right ? - Me ? Yes , I 'm okay . Just the same I 'd take it easy over the rest of the weekend , if I were you . Yes , I will . What 's your next move ? Research . I must find out much more about this house and its history . I hit it ! Darling , I hit it . That 's great . Let 's try it again . And this time , see if you can hit the gold . Okay , fire ! Hold your fire until I 'm ready . [ bell chiming ] Whenever you like . [ clicking ] Great picture but wrong target ! Di , don 't do that , your finger might slip . Di , don 't do that ! It 's dangerous . [ clicks ] That 's his third attempt to kill you . - Third ? - What about the statue ? That was Diana . If it was , she was under his influence , like this time . You mean , he was merely using her , as an instrument ? She 's certainly the key to all this . How ? Quite apart from the fact that she 's emotionally disturbed by it all , she 's also ... quite obviously psychic . She 's a medium . Although I doubt if she is aware of that , of course . You mean , Diana could 've conjured up this man - from out of nowhere ? - No , no , no . He was there from the beginning . As a psychic , your wife would have been immediately aware of that . And whatever sensation she got from his presence she liked it . That accounts for the great attraction the house had for her . - The significant thing is- - - What ? He also found her presence ... attractive . ln her , he found the channel to change from a dormant influence into an active one . - She knew this was happening ? - Oh , not consciously , I think . Can she see him ? Perhaps , it 's possible . But probably not on the conscious level . You found out something , haven 't you ? You know who he is . His name was Hobbs . Thomas Hobbs . He was a gardener to a Mr. and Mrs. George Maybury , who were the original owners of the house . I got the lead from old copies of the local paper , but I wasn 't certain until yesterday . Then I found this in the British Museum . I had it photostatted . It 's a penny broadsheet . They used to sell them in the streets whenever there was an event of great public interest . They were very popular . Particularly at hangings . Hobbs was hanged ? On the 8th of April , 1862 . Well , I must say you 've done a marvellous job of research . Mr. Carver , I want to give you a couple of pieces of advice . Number one ... You and your wife are obviously in danger in that house . My suggestion is that you go home , pack a few things , and get the hell out of the place for a while . - Right . - Right , number two ... I 'd think it 's essential that , Mrs. Carver undergo a course of psychotherapy . I 'd like to treat her myself , of course . But if you 'd rather have somebody else , I shall quite understand . But the sooner she starts the sooner we may lay this ghost of Thomas Hobbs . Are you suggesting she 's unbalanced in some way ? - Is that it ? Mad , in fact ? - No , no , far from it . But we must remember her past . The sexual assault when she was 15 , subsequent need for treatment . You think that 's related ? Maybe . Maybe not . But I don 't want to give you a lot of ... psychiatric mumbo-jumbo about that . To add from what I 've seen and what you 've told me , I 'd say that as far as sex is concerned , you 've been ... how shall I put it ? You 've been too considerate with your wife . - I see . - Do you ? I hope so , I hope you do . Well , now go home and get packed . And call me tomorrow , eh ? - Yes , I will . - Fine . What crime was Hobbs hanged for ? He murdered Mr. and Mrs. Maybury . And before he strangled Mrs. Maybury , he raped her . Eric this is ridiculous . You 're making a fool of yourself . I 've told you , we 're getting out of here , now , tonight . And I said I wasn 't going . So , please put my things back in the drawer . You don 't seem to understand , Diana . We 're in danger in this place . - Both of us . - I like it here . Look , Phillimore 's found out what that thing is . His name was Hobbs . He murdered two people in this house . ln this very room for all I know . So we 're getting out . I 'm not ! You run away , if you 're afraid . But I 'm staying . For God 's sake , Diana , don 't argue . Help me pack . - No , I told you . I 'm not going . - All right , I admit it . I 'm afraid , I 'm running away . Whatever you say . But you 're coming with me . If you think I 'm going to leave you with that obscenity you brought into the house . - I brought into the house ? - Don 't pretend , not any more . I know all about you . I know you 're psychic . Phillimore told me . The moment he met you he knew . - He came in answer to me ? - Yes , of course . Don 't you see ? It had to be you . Maybe you couldn 't help it , maybe you didn 't know what you were doing . But you brought the ghost of that ugly , murdering rapist into our home . I don 't think he 's ugly . You can see him . The other night , out there on the stairs ... You saw him then , didn 't you ? He 's right , you are ill . Diana , you don 't seem to understand , what that creature is doing to you . He 's tried to murder me three times , twice through you . Now you get the rest of the things you 'll need . I 'll finish packing . Make me , Eric . Make me leave . Go on ... Feel the softness of those things you 're holding . They 're mine . They are me . You want to go with you , then don 't ask me . Make me ! That 's what you want , isn 't it ? You enjoyed it the first time and you 've been wanting it to happen ever since . [ bags clattering ] I can 't . I can 't . I am not an animal . I can 't . I can 't ... No , you can 't , can you , Eric ? You never could . [ giggling ] Stop it ! Stop it ! Oh , poor Eric . Is that the best you can do ? You bitch ! You twisted bitch ! [ Diana giggling ] [ car engine starts up outside ] [ car revs and speeds off ] [ slams ] Please don 't hurt me . My father will be along in a minute . No , don 't ! Please , don 't ! No !

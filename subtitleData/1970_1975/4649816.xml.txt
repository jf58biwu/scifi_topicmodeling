Yes , sir . Moonbase , orders from Commander Straker . Suspend Interceptors ... 'UFO closing . Range 11 million miles . - ' Nine million miles . ' - Interceptors coming into range . Sir , do we intercept ? 'Range closing . Seven million miles . ' Sir , do we intercept ? No . - Negative . - Negative ? That 's what I said . '5 milliaon miles . ' SHADO Control to Moonbase . Interception negative . 'Repeat , interception negative . Interceptors to return to Moonbase . ' This is Moonbase Control to Interceptors . 'Return to base . ' 'UFO passing outer defences . 'UFO maintaining course . 'Confirm speed : 4.7,4 . ' UFO signal now negative , sir , presumably landed . - Map reference . - 119-120 . 119-120 . That 's somewhere there . I want the whole area cordoned off . - Alert Mobiles 1 , 2 and 3 . - Yes , sir . Colonel Foster , I think you 'd better get out there with them . - Yes , sir . - Alert Mobiles 1 , 2 and 3 . 'Transporter 2 , proceed to area 119-128 . 'Transporter 3 , proceed to area 119-132 . ' It 's not much further now . You did a good job , Liz . Cass , I can 't ... Go and get it . Roger . This is Commander Straker to all Mobile operatives . You are to locate UFO designated 9051F . Termination area approximately 119-120 . - Colonel Foster ? - Sir ? - ' You cover blue area X-7 . ' - OK . - Hello , Alec . - So you let one through . - That 's right . - Why don 't we do the job properly ? - What do you mean ? - Ask the aliens round for drinks . Let 's go into the office . We 're fighting a series of losing battles here , Alec . Why ? Because we don 't really know who or what we 're fighting . I 've waited months for a chance like this , Alec . A UFO right on our own doorstep . That 's why I let this one through . And those Mobiles are on their way to bring it in : intact . Before any deterioration sets in . Meanwhile , there 's a potential killer or killers at large . Yes , I know . It 's a risk . But the area has a low population density . It 's mostly virgin forest . The danger factor must be very slight . Mobile 1 to SHADO Control . 1 to Control . Go ahead , Mobile 1 . 'Have covered search area blue X-7 P , Q and R . ' - UFO negative . - ' Roger , Mobile 1 . ' Proceed to link with Mobile 3 at location 118-109 . SHADO Mobiles 2 and 3 are due to report now , sir . Areas X-8 and 9 are practically covered . - And Mobile 1 ? - He 's slower , with the densest area . Every inch of that forest must be searched . Somewhere in there , there 's a UFO . And we 're going to find it intact . Quiet , quiet . Come on , boy . Move . Go on . What the ... ? Go back . Quiet ! Go ahead . Quiet ! Quiet , you fool ! Look out . Sultan ! Sultan ! Sultan ? Hey , that 's a good boy . Come on . Come on . Come on , come on . What 's the matter with you , eh ? That 's a good boy . Sultan ! Mobile 1 to SHADO Control . 1 to Control . - Go ahead , 1 . - ' Have located UFO . 'Position blue area 119-113 . ' This is Straker . Advise on condition . 'It 's a total wreck . ' - Is there any sign of life , Colonel ? - Investigating now , sir . - Nervous ? - How long have you been there ? Come on , pull yourself together . Let 's go over it once again . Take it from 11 o 'clock . From 11 o 'clock . At 11 o 'clock we finish supper . Then I do the washing up . - There 's something else . - What do you mean ? What do you do before doing the washing up ? I call up Midge Clayton . I tell her that I 'm ringing her from the cottage . I ask her over for lunch tomorrow . Then ... Why ? Why do you invite her over for lunch ? I 'm nervous about being here on my own . Then I tell her two things . Firstly , that Jack can 't be with me because he has to go north on a business trip . Secondly , that I 'm going to go to bed and take a sleeping pill . Dispatch analysis teams to the area . Yes , sir . SHADO Control to ADP unit . Proceed to blue area 119-113 . - Just one thing puzzles me . - You should be so lucky . How come that UFO is a wreck ? It hasn 't been in the atmosphere long enough to deteriorate . Maybe it was the difficulty of the landing area . Could be a thousand reasons . Mobile 1 has reported a body inside the wreck of the UFO . - An alien ? - They can 't tell , it 's very charred . They 'll call back as soon they have more information . Then at 11.30 , I check the front door to see that it isn 't locked from the inside , so that Jack can get in . - And then I go to bed . - You don 't go to bed ! There 's something else . Oh , yes , I change the bulb by the front door ... - for a dud one . - Right . Go on . Then I go to bed and I put out the light . No , no , I read for 5 minutes . But I find I can 't concentrate , so I turn out the light , and wait for Jack . And when he comes ? I hear the gate creak . So I get up and I come in here . So ... So I take the gun . You take the gun , then what ? - Then what ? - I stand at the bedroom door with the gun pointing towards the front door . Go on . Then when Jack opens the front door ... You take aim and you fire , right ? - I can 't ! I can 't , Cass , I can 't ! - It 's perfectly simple . You 're all alone here , someone breaks in , you take aim and you fire . - Aren 't you forgetting one thing ? - What 's that ? I 'll be here , right beside you . Oh , Cass , stay here . Stay here ! Mobile 1 to SHADO Control . 1 to Control . Go ahead , 1 . 'The body inside the UFO is definitely not an alien . ' Mobile 1 , this is Straker . Explain yourself . The body was charred , but there were no hermetic seals around the neck . We 're searching the area on foot . The alien must be in the forest . It 's time . Go on . Answer it . Hello ? 'Hello , darling . Just ringing through to say I 'm on my way . ' Fine . That 's fine . - Well , it worked . - ' What do you mean ? ' Your little idea . 'No calls , no interruptions for our weekend together . 'The office think I 'm at that conference . 'Even Miss Kettle won 't know where I am . - ' Hello ? You there ? ' - Yes . - ' Yes , I 'm here . ' - Good . - I 've got a little present for you . - You have ? 'Don 't you want to know what it is ? ' Yes , of course I do , Jack . What is it ? 'Burlington Arcade ? ' Oh , yes . Yes , I remember , the pendant . - The blue pendant . - ' You don 't sound very pleased . ' I can easily get something else if you 'd rather . No . No , I 'm sorry , Jack . I 'm sorry . That was very thoughtful of you . You all right ? Yes , I 'm all right . I 've just got a slight headache , that 's all . - ' Why don 't you go to bed , then ? ' - No , I 'll be fine . You go to bed . I 'll arrive about 12 , I 'll try not to disturb you . - ' All right . ' - Bye , then . Goodbye , Jack . - You heard . - Yes . You heard how he was talking . I don 't think I can do it , Cass . I can 't go through with it . Do you know how long we 've known each other ? Ten months ? A year ? It 's exactly one year and one month ago I first came into your house . I noticed how he spoke to you then , I 've heard him a million times since . - Well ? - Every time he talks to you , - it 's in that way . - Cass ... Words . What 's he ever given you but words ? You 've said so yourself over and over again . He 's clothed you , fed you , bought you ... Blue area to SHADO Control , blue area to SHADO Control . We found a couple of things , sir . First , a piece of torn fabric from an alien spacesuit . 'There 's also signs of a struggle . ' Yes , what else ? We 've found a dog with collar number 995587 . Listen , Colonel , we have details here of a missing person in the blue area . A game warden , name of Mitchell . That dog collar information checks . It 's my guess it 's Mitchell 's body you found in the debris . Try using the dog to locate the alien , he may pick up the scent . Yes , sir . Come on . Come on , boy . OK , follow me . - What 's that ? - The lights ! - Cass ! - The lights ! He 's come an hour early ! - What are we going to do ? - Don 't worry . - We 're ready for him . - Cass , we can 't ! The lights ! I can 't ! I can 't do it , Cass . Look , I 'm here , right beside you . He 's stopped . He 's coming round to the front , Cass . He 's at the door . For God 's sake , I ... Oh , God ! Now ! What 's the matter , Cass ? What are you doing ? I 'm trying to think ! How are we going to explain it ? - Who is he ? - Shut up ! You 're not leaving me here ? ! But you know I must . Our only chance is to go through with the plan ! - But how can we ? - We must ! I don 't know any more than you do ! You shot an intruder , understand ? Do you understand ? ! I must go . Give me 3 minutes , that 's all , then phone the police . Cass ! Cass ! Wait with me ! Wait ! Wait ! Just until I call ! - 3 minutes . - Please , Cass , please ! Cass ! Cass ... - Would you get your coat , Mrs Newton ? - Why are you here ? Who are you ? Are you the police ? How do you know my name ? Please . Ah , Mrs Newton , Mr Fowler . We 've been expecting you . This way , please . Would you care to sit down ? Freeman , Alec . 'Voice-print identification positive . 97 , Freeman , Alec E . ' If you 'll just follow me , please . - Look , what is going on here ? - Please , Mr Fowler . - You 've had a harrowing experience . - Right . - You 're entitled to an explanation . - Right again . Mr Straker will explain why you 're here . For now , make yourselves comfortable . I 'm sure you 'll find everything you need . What are you doing ? Just be very careful what you say . Where are we ? We 're under some kind of film studio . - I don 't understand . - Neither do I. We must get our stories straight . Liz ? Liz ? Who are you ? More to the point , who are you ? The rest of the story is exactly the same . - Who are these people ? - I don 't know . The one that brought us here said something about a man called Straker . Isn 't he a film producer or something ? I apologise for having you brought here . - Mr Fowler , Mrs Newton . - Now , listen here . And I 've had you brought here for a discussion . Now if you 'll both please sit down . Was your wife expecting you ? - Naturally . - Are you certain ? But of course ! I phoned her on the way down here . - Why do you ask ? - Do you recognise these ? Photographs of this room . - Did you take them ? - No . - Know who did ? - I 've never seen them before . Do you keep a gun here , Mr Newton ? - Yes . - Who knew about it ? - My wife . - Anyone else ? I 'm not sure . Don 't think so . Look , what is this all about ? I 'm sorry , you 'll have to bear with me . I suggest you return to London . I 'll arrange for your wife to join you there as soon as possible . Unidentified flying objects ? Aliens from another planet ? A world defence organisation ? It 's incredible . Then the lives of everyone can be in terrible danger all the time . Very great danger . That 's the reason for all the security . The general public must never know . One thing I don 't understand is : if your organisation is so secret , why did you bring us here ? To help you forget the whole thing . Forget ? Yes , you see , SHADO have developed an amnesia drug , for obvious reasons . We administer it to people who 've had contact with aliens . - Or indeed , with our organisation . - An amnesia drug ? Yes . It 's perfectly harmless . All it will do is erase all memory of the past 12 hours . It 's tasteless . Would you care for some more coffee ? What 's wrong ? Paul has come up with a very interesting theory . Tell him . Mrs Newton and Fowler said they shot an intruder - as he forced open the door . - Plausible . Yes , if they weren 't expecting the husband . The husband ? He came back to the cottage 40 minutes ago . - Is our security angle covered ? - We 've taken care of . But don 't you see what it means ? They planned a cold-blooded murder . They had it all worked out . But unfortunately for them , an alien arrived instead of her husband . It all fits . Morally , they 're guilty . Well , the amnesia drug was administered a few minutes ago . - They won 't remember a thing . - We can 't let them go free . I suppose you think I should hand them over to the public prosecutor . He 'd sure have a great case . What would he go for ? The attempted murder of a husband or the killing of an alien ? We can 't produce that body , there 's no concrete evidence against them , and the accused would both have genuine , total amnesia . So there 's nothing we can do about . - We 're not in the morality business . - What about the husband ? They wanted to kill him once , they 're bound to try again . Well , in the line of duty , we 've stumbled onto a triangle . SHADO 's involvement made it a square . All we 're doing is erasing the past 12 hours . So , it 's back to the triangle . Colonel Foster , get back to that UFO . Get all the information you can . Right . Alec , get the medical team to work on that alien . On my way . How are Mrs Newton and Mr Fowler ? 'They 're receding , sir . ' Well , get them out of here . - ' But sir , I don 't think ... ' - Yes , get them out of here !

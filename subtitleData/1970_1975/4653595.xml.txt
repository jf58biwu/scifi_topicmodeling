 'Parameter 3 OK . Strength 4 . 'Parameter 4 OK . Strength 5 ... ' - This the one on the blink ? - Yes . Keeps coming and going . ' ... until you have rectified this , use Parameter 5 as a stand-by . ' Right , thank you , Moonbase . Over and out . " Priority to Straker , SHADO . " " General McWhirter looks forward to meeting you ... " Commander , what 's wrong ? Stop him ! Get after him ! Get me studio security . Commander Straker ! Well , where did you come from ? Nobody 's to come through that door . Nobody . Understand ? Oh , Mr Straker ... What the ... ? ! Open the door ! Let us through ! Miss Ealand ! OK , Fred . Away you go . Stop that hovercraft ! Mr Straker , was there anything ? Can I help you at all ? Action ! What 's going on ? What the ... ? ! Will you please be quiet ? We 're shooting . Right , everyone . Settle down . Going again . It all happened so quick , I never saw him . There he is ! Come on ! Commander ! Commander ! Stop that thing . This way ! Come on ! Ed ! - Said anything at all ? - No , sir . He 's stayed like this . He 's in shock . Physical and mental . - Brought on by what ? - Hard to say , but whatever it was , his mind 's had to walk away from it . - Anything you can do for him ? - There is something , yes , but I don 't like to use it except in an emergency . When SHADO 's most vital man becomes homicidal , it is an emergency . He came bursting out but he didn 't come in . What do you mean ? This is the entrance to SHADO , isn 't it ? Yes , sir . But he left to meet Colonel Lake and didn 't come back . - No , sir . He didn 't come this way . - You 're certain ? He couldn 't have got past without us seeing . No , sir . Mr Straker hasn 't been in . We always log him in and out and he hasn 't been anywhere near . - It doesn 't make sense . - I 'm sorry , I ... I just don 't seem to be able to remember a thing . You can 't remember coming back with Commander Straker ? I can recall leaving the airport in Commander Straker 's car but ... after that nothing , I 'm afraid . Yes , it was a severe blow to the base of the neck . Don 't I know it . It caused a specific amnesia , covering a period of about 2 hours . It 's not uncommon . How long until her memory comes back ? Hours ? Days ? Well , it might never come back . - Yeah ? - ' Medical Centre , sir . ' He 's regaining consciousness . Do you see it ... ? See it ... ? - Yes , that 's right . - Right . Straker 's beginning to break through . We 'd better get over there . Paul . He couldn 't have done it . Ed 's not a killer . Kill ! Kill ... Get us ... They 're going to get us ! - How dangerous is this drug ? - I told you , it 's risky . It could open his mind or destroy it . Kill ... Get us ... Time ... They murdered time ! Time ... They murdered time . It could open his mind or destroy it . I want you to go back 5 hours . 5 hours . Where are you ? I was in my car . Go on . I 'd been to the airport ... to pick up Colonel Lake . I wanted to brief you before you talked to General Henderson . Well , I knew it wasn 't for my big blue eyes . Coming back from the moon can be disorientating . Even moon speeds have some effect on time . I see , sir . Never knew that , sir - What 's that ? - What ? - Thought I saw something . - Dark roads are disorientating , too . There is something up there , 15 degrees west ... There . See ? - It 's Venus . - Wrong direction . - Space shot ? - None scheduled . - Could be Russian . - We have their schedule , too . - Space debris . - No , wrong pattern . If it 's a weather balloon , it 's drifting against the wind . It 's a UFO . Straker to SHADO Control . UFO in Earth 's atmosphere . Do you read me ? Do you read me ? - Check the radio link . - How could it get past Moonbase ? I don 't know . The radio 's receiving and transmitting at full strength . That 's absurd . Why doesn 't Control answer ? It 's not this end ? If they can knock out communications , why not destroy the base ? They may have done just that . - How long ? - About another ten minutes . - It 's coming this way . - Harness ! It 's going overhead . Freeze . Outside it was night but here ... What 's happened ? I don 't know . Look at that . Why doesn 't it fall ? I don 't believe it . We must be dreaming . It 's unreal . What 's happening ? Night into day ... Everything stopped , arrested ... It 's like a clock that suddenly ... Come on . It 's like a nightmare ... A grotesque nightmare . Give me that piece of wood . Commander ! Come on . Let 's get back to the car . If these worksheets are right , this has just happened . But why daylight ? It 's been dark outside for two hours . I don 't know . There must be logic in it somewhere . Come on , let 's get down to Control . Miss Ealand ? Why haven 't Moonbase reacted ? They must know something 's wrong . - They could 've had Skydiver here . - What will you do ? Call General Henderson for help . That thing 's still up there . If it comes down before we can get assistance ... There must be someone we can contact . It 's no use . If we could just understand the principle they 've used . There 's no pulse . - Body temperature 's normal . - Yet they 're fixed like ... statues . It 's almost as though they 'd been frozen in time . That 's it . Whatever they were doing was fossilized when the force struck . Yet the lift from your office was working . Yes , I know . Doesn 't fit the pattern . This isn 't frozen . - They have one thing in common . - They weren 't in motion . Yes , they weren 't moving in time . That 's why the elevator works . If we can find a monitor that wasn 't switched on ... No , they were all switched on . There 's got to be an answer . We just have to think it through . I don 't ... seem to be able to think any more . God , I feel so tired . I feel as though I could sleep for a week . Yes , I know . It must be shock catching up with us . Wait a minute . Let me see your watch . Our watches must have stopped ... the minute we got to the studio . Just like the clock . Beginning ... to get to us . Yes ... I can feel it . Medical Centre ... The only way ... they could get past Moonbase ... travel so fast ... cheat time . Sound barrier ... Heat barrier ... Light barrier ... Time barrier ! They can control it ... but only for so long ... until the field force ... they built up ... on the way here ... begins to wear off . Like the waves of pressure you see in front of an aeroplane . That 's why ... they haven 't landed yet . They 're still ... in a different continuum . Yes . They obviously have to shed the field force before they can operate here . But how are they reaching us ? I don 't know . Maybe we 'll find out back in the Control Room . Are you OK ? Fine . Come on , let 's go . - What is that stuff ? - X50 . Speeds 10 times up heart , muscles , brain , coordination . They used it in high-G test flights , then banned it . Too dangerous . - Why ? - It burned people out . We 'd be moving so fast , we 'd just be a blur . The room is lead-lined , Colonel . Built to resist any known force field . - Commander ! - What is it ? Down the corridor . I saw something move . 'All right , Straker . 'Come and get me , big man ! ' Transistor microphone . Somewhere over there to the right . 'You 've got to get me , Straker . 'I 'm the only one who can help you . 'I 'm the only one who can put it right . ' He 's behind that wall . You stay here . Now , cover me . 'No , it 's not that easy , big man . 'Things always come easy for you , don 't they , Straker ? 'Not this time . Not me . ' He 's around the corner , by the covered way to J and K block . Over here . Now , stay behind that wall . - Where 'd he go ? - He 's on one of the sound stages . 'You 've heard of silent films , haven 't you , Mr Big ? 'Well , this is the new bag . 'Non-moving movies . 'Kind of restful , isn 't it ? 'Yes , this is the place , Mr Big . 'Yes , sir , I is here if you can but find me . ' Take the other exit ! We 'll cut him off . Where 'd he go ? 'You don 't look so big now , Commander . 'Don 't you know me yet ? 'I 'm Turner , Radar Operator , Class 1 . 'I know you , Commander . 'The big man . In charge of the world . ' 'Big Deal Straker . 'The guy the girls admire . 'Well , I 'm the big deal now . 'They promised me , and you 're nothing , Straker . You 're ... 'Wrong again , Straker . ' He got a good start . Go for the tyres . # Hiders , seekers # Finders , keepers # Where are you going to find me ? Where are you going to find me ? # 'You 're it , Straker . You are tag . 'They 're coming soon , Straker . 'As soon as they 've brought their power down . 'They 'll be here soon . 'And you 're not going to spoil it . 'They 're marvellous , Straker . 'They 're brilliant ! 'They do things we can 't even conceive . ' 'Have you any idea what they 've done here , Straker ? 'They 've taken a millionth of a second of our time and frozen it . 'This is taking place in a millionth of a second , Straker . 'That 's why Moonbase doesn 't know anything 's wrong . 'Compared to them , we 're midgets , Straker . All of us . 'You 're no match for me , big man . 'You 're not on my level . ' 'Don 't you understand , Straker ? 'Hasn 't it soaked into that blond skull of yours yet ? 'I 'm outside of time , Straker . 'I am outside of time ! ' What 's he mean " outside of time " ? Well , time has stopped in here , we know that , but the aliens have given him immunity in return for his help . He 's independent of time ? He can move however he pleases ? - Yes . - That 's why we can 't pin him down . How are we going to find him ? Well , we 've gotta try . Trying is all we 've got . Let 's go . They may be years ahead of us but we 've one thing they haven 't . Bloody-mindedness . It built this planet . 'Oh , well done , big man ! 'You 've found where I am . 'Come on , then . 'I 'm waiting for you . 'And your lovely lady . ' 'It 's all right , Straker . I don 't intend to kill you . 'You see , in the new order , I am going to be boss . 'I think you might be rather useful for making the tea . 'I 'm going to be boss , Straker . 'They promised me that in return for my help . ' You can 't handle it . 'I can handle it . ' No , you 're small-time . You haven 't got the horsepower . 'I 've got more than I need to fix you . ' No , come on . It takes guts and brains to be the boss . 'Listen , you primitive idiot . 'How do you think they 're transmitting their power ? 'I fixed a piece of equipment in the Control Room , 'so it could act as an aerial , a piece of SHADO equipment , Straker . ' I don 't believe you . What piece of equipment ? 'You must think I 'm as stupid as you are . ' I didn 't say anything about not killing you . 'It 's not that easy , Straker . ' Look . Slowing down ... Drugs ... Hypodermic ... Used too much energy ... - What will another shot do to you ? - Doesn 't matter ... Quick ... The Molly . It 's our last chance . Shouldn 't I have another shot ? - It was dangerous , wasn 't it ? - I made my choice long ago . Take that key . Put it in there . Hang on to this . You 've kept very quiet about this . It 's that old bloody-mindedness . - Can you hold on ? - Shall I get another one of these ? No . There 's no point . We won 't get a second chance . We miss with this first one , they 'll fry us . - What 's their range ? - We have to wait till they 're close . Turner , don 't be a fool ! Give me that key ! They don 't need you now ! Turner , listen to me ! Big man ! I think I 'll just play that back . I think I 'll just play that back . It 's a shame . I can do it all again , but I can 't change anything . That should slow you up , big man ! You 're too late , Straker . Give me the key , Turner . Come and get it , Commander . You 're out of your league , Straker . The nearer they come , the more power they transmit to me . I can play time like a trumpet now . You primitive idiot . You can only see me where I 've just been , or where I 'm going to be , not where I am . Unless I want you to . You 're licked , Straker . Commander , what 's wrong ? Stop him ! It 's all right , Commander . Now , try ... try and rest . - Incredible . - Yes but there are more things . - But how ? - I 'm not sure but in some way , they were able to expand a moment in time . Commander Straker experienced such an extended moment .

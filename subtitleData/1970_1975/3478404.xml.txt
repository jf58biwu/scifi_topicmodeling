I didn 'tsay " human , " Mr. Governor . I said " inhuman . " " Lousyinhuman bastards . " And bythe blessed st . Francis , who loved all animals , i meantit . I run a circus , and ... - we knowthat . - From 20 years back . From the year , se単orArmando , when the two talking apes arrived and conceived a baby whose survival could have threatened the future ofthe entire human race . Mr. Governor , it 's myunderstanding the babywas shotdead . Orso itwas believed . However , eversince this morning i 'm beginning to wonder iftheyshotthe rightbaby . They could have switched theirbaby with one from a zoo . Orperhaps a circus . Surelyyou can 'tbe serious . Hoskyns , the cassette , please . This is a recording ofthe recommendations made to the then president ofthe United states bythe chairman of the presidential committee . We believethat thetalking apes , Cornelius and Zira , havecome from the future . We believetheirspokentestimony that some 2,000 years hence , theirdescendants will have all but exterminated the human race . The female ape is now pregnant withchild . Thecommissiontherefore recommends that the apechild 's birth should be prevented , and that both the male and the female should be rendered incapable ofbegetting another . But , Mr. Governor , every zoo , public and private , was searched bythe police , and every circus , including my own . Where a small chimpanzee was found . The only chimpanzee everto be born in a circus , and legally certified to have been born a month before the talking apes arrived on earth . - Where is he now ? - I wish i knew . - I 've searched everywhere . - Se単orArmando ! Letme remind you ofthe seriousness of ourproblem . Now , yourcircus travels mainlyin the provinces ? Yes , sir . Undoubtedly , you are unaware ofthe rising tide ofdisobedience and outrightdefiance among the servantapes in ourcities . Mr. Governor , many ofthe reported offenses have been proved minor . Thatape who was killed while trying to escape from the citylastnight , would you call his offense minor ? No , i would not . He physically assaulted his own master . Butonly afterwhatmust have been severe provocation . The ape 's bodywas covered with bruises from a beating . Which he no doubtrichly deserved . Howmanymore outthere are justlike thatape , all burning with resentment , all waiting foran ape with enough intelligence , with enoughwill to lead them ? Waiting foran ape who can think , who can talk . Se単orArmando , hasyourape evertalked orshown anysigns ofbeing articulate ? Neverin my presence oranyone else 's . You can question my circus hands .

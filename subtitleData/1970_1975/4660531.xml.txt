' Roger , Houston . Out . - It 's still with us . - Yeah . Yes , that 's right . I want a complete press , radio and TV clampdown on any information relating to the signal being monitored by the GSP4 . Well , I can 't make it any clearer for you . You tell them anything you want . That 's your problem . - How far , Paul ? - 12 , and still closing . If it gets closer , the Interceptors won 't be able to attack . UFO reducing speed .

It 'll follow the space probe ... right back to earth . Very good ! - Come on ! - Come on ! Come on ! Good boy . - What kept you ? - You cheated . I did not . Idiot ! 'Sky 1 to SHADO Control . Have searched area . 'No sign of UFO . It 's thickly wooded . Visibility limited . ' Tell Sky 1 to re-dock with Skydiver . Get the mobiles there ASAP . It can 't have lifted off again . Ground radar would have picked it up . It 's out there somewhere . How long will it take the Mobiles to get there ? 2 or 3 hours . You better get moving . Shut up ! Pa says you 're taking him to Berlin next month . He 's always there when I 'm in an international event . Who 's that ? Shut up ! Maybe it 's a party of Sioux . You know , Indians . - I think I know who it is . - Look out for the arrows ! Wait for me , Custer ! Russ ! Let 's get out of here . Russ ! Russ ! What the devil 's got into you ? I 've told him about trespassing on our land . I thought I 'd told you , Culley , but you don 't get the message . Russ ! If ever I see you or that mongrel on this estate again ... Get moving . Come on ! White man , him strong . 'Mobile 1 to Control . Area 12 , negative . ' Roger , 1 . Continue search in Area 14 . Search leader to SHADO control . Still no visual evidence of UFO . You should come home more , Anne . It 's the only time we get a decent meal . She can 't tear herself away from the bright lights . You should get someone in . What about a kinky Swedish au pair ? - We did . - A Swedish au pair ? - Was her name Olga ? - Mrs Harris from the village . Tried it for a couple of weeks . I thought it would be all right . She was a good cook , but in the end it didn 't work out . If you lost your cool like today , I 'm not surprised . - What have you been up to , Russ ? - I ran into our favourite hippy . - Where were the others ? - I don 't know . I quite liked him . He was different . If I had my way , I 'd lock the whole bunch up . There 's no harm in them . - Can I have some more coffee ? - You wait and see . Why don 't you get the fuzz to move them on . - Fuzz ? - The police . They 've tried but they always come back . This one is vicious . If the police don 't do anything , I will . Let 's go . Come on ! 'Mobile 3 to Control . Completed search of Area 24 . - ' Negative . ' - Roger . Continue in Area 25 . - Yes ? - Colonel Foster , sir . - Hello , Paul ! How 's it going ? - ' No luck , sir .

' Come on , dog . Let 's go . Stay . Oh , shut up . No ! No , boy ! Come on . What ? Come on . What is it ? It 's all right . What is it ? It 's all right . It 's all right . There 's nothing here . It 's just your own stable . What ? There 's nothing . It 's all right , boy . I wish you wouldn 't do that ! - What the hell are you doing ? - I heard Bluey , so I came down . - What 's the matter with him ? - He 's sweating up . There 's nobody out there . I don 't know what frightened him . Well , he seems all right now . How long are you staying , Anne ? - Who knows ? - No , seriously . - Maybe a few more days . - It 's good to have you home . You 're too kind . - How about a swim ? - And what about costumes ? - I meant in ze nude . - You make some stupid suggestions . All right , then . Go as you are ! Come on . Come here , Bluey . Come on . Good boy . What on earth 's the matter with him ? He 's sweating again . Russ , listen . - I can 't hear anything . - That 's just it . There 's nothing . Not even a bird . Come on . You 're enough to scare anything away . We 've completed the search . Nothing . 'No trace at all ? Burned vegetation ? Broken trees ? Tracks ? ' Negative , and no response from the instruments . - I 'm convinced it 's not here . - ' All right . - ' We 'll move on . ' - In which direction ? 'We 'll have to widen the search area . Branch out east and west - ' from the original flight path . ' - Right . Come on , boy ! Good boy , Bluey . Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Pa ? - Pa ! - Yeah ? Where 's Russ ? - Out practising . - But his horse is here ! Come on . Russ ? Russ ! Russ ? Russ ! Pa ? Over here ! You stay here . Russ ! Russ ? Paul , SHADO Intelligence have received a missing person report . - ' I want you to look into it . ' - What are the details ? Russell Stone . The international showjumper . He lives close to the search area . A place called Stone Dean Farm . - And the authorities ? - Taken care of . Now get over there right away . I think I understand the situation . Is there anything else you can tell me ? - No , I don 't think so . - Miss Stone ? No , I 'm sorry . I 'd like to take a look around . Of course . I appreciate your coming so quickly . - I 'll drive you . - Thanks . There is something else . In the wood I found a dog . It was horribly mutilated . Whatever did that ... I understand . How big is the estate ? - About 200 acres . - Are there any roads ? No , but plenty of tracks . We can drive around , if you like . About here is where we found his hat . Right . Let 's go . Hold it . What 's over there ? Just a shack . Some hippies were living there . Let 's take a look . - They seem to have moved out . - They 'll probably be back . We ran into one of them yesterday . Russ chased him around . Tried to scare him off . His dog . Scruffy-looking thing . Can your brother swim ? Like a fish . Listen . - There 's nothing . - Like before . - Before ? - With Russ , earlier . And his horse was frightened . It was sweating . I want you to do something for me . Go back to the house and wait for me . Go on . Take the truck . I 'll walk back . OK , then . What happened ? What happened ? Over there ... Culley . 'How long to get the Mobiles into position ? ' - About 10 minutes . - ' Let 's hope your theory 's right . ' The UFO 's been here 2 days . It would have started to disintegrate . - Mobile 1 ? - ' We 're in position , ready to fire . ' - Mobile 2 ? - ' In position and ready . ' Roger . Set detonation for 10 sec . Mobile 1 , fire ! Mobile 2 ... fire ! Mobiles stand by for rapid fire . All Mobiles ... fire ! Mobile 3 get the skin team ready . There 's something in the water . - We 'll move it out . - That could be dangerous . Any movement could blow this place to pieces . - You mean defuse it here ? - I don 't know , Paul . I 'm not saying that it is an explosive device but we must treat it as one . Lieutenant , sound a red alert . Clear all non-essential personnel from the complex . This is a red alert . This is an internal emergency . All personnel on B roster to evacuate area . - Could be a long wait . - There 's an old miners ' saying the nearer you are to an explosion , the better your chances are . It can 't be much longer . - What about the other wreckage ? - Most of it disintegrated . - And this didn 't . - No . It must be something special . Straker . 'Radiation tests are through , sir . ' We 'll be right there . Listen to this , Commander . OK . We 're picking it up on the audio sensor from somewhere in the centre . Well , what do you make of it ? It 's regular . Mechanical . We 've pinpointed the mechanism here . If we cut an exploratory hole here , we can get an X-ray and see what makes it tick . Once we start cutting , sir , anything can happen . All right . Let 's get on with it . Right . Temperature low . Radiation negative . - Any readings ? - No , sir . Still no reaction . - Any readings ? - No , sir . Still no reaction . It 's through . I 'm going to remove the cut-out . It 's stopped . All right . Let 's get moving . Now we 'll find out what we 're up against , sir . There 's no possible doubt ? No , sir . It is a human heart . - Russell Stone . - It must be . They slowed his metabolism and pulse by lowering body temperature . All packed up , ready for shipment . The doctors think they could get him out alive , but they 'd like someone he knows to be around . - I 'll take care of it . - Yes . Come on . It 's all right . Miss Stone , this is Commander Straker . It 's Anne , isn 't it ? Yes . But I 'm so confused . All this . Where am I ? Yes , if you try not to think about that for the moment . - We 've found your brother . - Russ ! - Is he all right ? - We hope he will be . Russ ! Russ . Russ . Russ . Russ . - The amnesia drug 's ready . - All right . It 'll help you to forget . Good boy , Bluey . Come on , boy ! Very good ! He 's coming on , he 's coming on . - Come on ! - Oh , dear .

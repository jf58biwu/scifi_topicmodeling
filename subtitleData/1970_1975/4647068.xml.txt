 Radio SHADO Control . No survivors . Some evidence of UFO . It must be that UFO that came in a month ago under a radar blind spot . If it stayed underwater , it would escape deterioration in the earth 's atmosphere . Maybe they slipped in an underwater craft in component sections . Possibly . They seem to have perfected life maintenance in a liquid environment . What do we do next ? A detailed search of the entire area . - I 'll go myself . - In Skydiver ? - What else ? - Wouldn 't you rather I took over ? Oh , that . Well , the dictionary defines it as a morbid dread of confined spaces . - Skydiver 's not that small . - And you 're not always morbid . Exactly . - Get me Skydiver 's positional chart . - ' Yes , sir . ' It 's in the south Atlantic area . About 400 miles south of St Helena . Is there a rendezvous point where we could exchange the sub crews ? There are dozens of small atolls in the area . Mostly uninhabited . Good . I want to be aboard with the best available crew as soon as possible . Switch to sea skim . Pull ahead boats . Right . I 'm needed below , sir . My cabin is at your disposal . Thank you , Captain . Maintain sea skim until we reach search area . Yes , sir . D 'you think we 'll find anything ? Well , it 's hard to say . The more I think about it , the more the theory stands up . We know they 've taken people from houses in broad daylight . - So it would be easier mid-ocean . - Right . It 's a big place to play cat and mouse . Yes . We 'll have to make sure our claws are well sharpened . - How do you mean ? - We 're trying to find them . Let 's hope the aliens don 't think that we 're the mouse . Approaching B-17 , sir . - Right . Plot a search plan . - Yes , sir . - Lieutenant . - Sir . I want a constant radar sweep and sonar sounding . Yes , sir . - Straker . - We 're making the first sweep , then we 'll go under for a submerged circuit . Carry on , Captain . Let 's make the most of the fresh air . - Starting vector search . - Course ? 019 veering to 023 . Decreasing sweep on 14 degrees port . Right . Maintain the watch , Colonel . I 'm going below . Right . Have you ever used this ? I asked if you had ever used the escape hatch , Lieutenant . Yes , sir . Our navigator is the one you want to talk to about those . Never mind . Just familiarising myself with the ship . Yes , sir . - How 's it going , Nina ? - Fine , sir . - What is it ? - Large shoal of fish . - Sonar is our best bet . - You 're the expert . - It 's a tight ship , Captain . - Thank you , sir . Sonar echo increasing . What do you make of it , Lieutenant ? Metallic object . Moving quite fast . - 60 knots . - How far ? 2,000 yards increasing . Get below , Colonel . I 'm taking her down . Dive ! Dive ! Dive ! - What is it ? - An underwater craft , sir . Moving ahead of us . Altering course . Veering to starboard . - 8 degrees . - 8 degrees starboard . 8 degrees starboard , sir . Switch on underwater cameras . Visibility poor , sir . Rock formations . We 've lost it . - Anything ? - These rocks don 't help . - Lieutenant Chin ! - Main systems still operating . - Surface ! - Load tanks 1 and 2 . One and two . - Looks bad . - Let 's get him down below . Easy ! Malfunction on 1 . Keep trying those tanks . - Hold it ! - Shut down ballast . That was the starboard turbo . - I 'm getting a new signal . - Coming to finish the job . It 's heading away . Toward the surface . - Can we launch Sky 1 ? - We can try . All right , Paul . Alien craft airborne . Pull it up , Paul . - It 's no good . - What 's its attitude ? 10 degrees . It 's enough . Launch Sky 1 . - Liftoff . - Roger . Sky 1 airborne , sir . Sky 1 to Control . Target destroyed . Sky 1 to Control . Come in , Skydiver . Contact lost , sir . We 're going down . Turbines non-functional . - Shut down the reactor . - Yes , sir . Prepare to switch to emergency power . We 're still going down ! Emergency power ! Crash positions . Sky 1 to SHADO Control . Over-flying last known position . Still no radio contact . Wreckage apparent . Re-docking negative . 'Roger , Sky 1 . Proceed to nearest SHADO base . - ' Starting sub-smash procedure . ' - Roger . - Dye and marker buoy released , sir . - Good . What about the power ? We 're not getting a warning alarm from the reactor , so the radiation shield must be OK . That 's something . At least we 're not gonna die from radiation exposure . Right , by now , Sky 1 will have reported our position , so a rescue team will be on its way . We all know the standing orders regarding the sub-smash . We follow them , we 'll be all right . Let 's get to it . Colonel Foster , - the air systems and electrics . - Sir . - Lieutenant Lewis . - Sir . Check the ballast tanks and the escape hatches . - Yes , sir . - Lieutenant Barry , see our communications are . Yes , sir . - How are you feeling , Chin ? - I 'll be all right , sir . Good . Are you up to going to stern with me and checking the turbines ? - Yes , sir . - Good . We may get this old tub off the shelf before the rescue team gets here . Yes , sir . Albatross 25 to SHADO Control . We have positive area location on Skydiver beacon . - Homing on signal now . - ' Roger , Albatross . ' Another 50 minutes . What do you think ? No way of telling , sir . Sub-smashes are always difficult . I 'd better check things out in the cabin . - Hello , sir . - Sir . We 'll be there in less than 50 min . What are their chances ? Hard to say . By the time we get there it could be on the surface , waiting for us . That 's not likely , is it ? The wreckage . Until we get there , sir , it 's anyone 's guess . Nearly through here , Commander . How are things at stern ? Not good . One turbine completely blown , and there 's damage to the reactor cooling plant . That means we can forget the main power supply . How long will the emergency storage batteries last , Chin ? 8 hours , and we can 't recharge without the reactor . How about the air supply , Paul ? It 's impossible to be accurate but ... I estimate there 's enough air for eight hours . About the same as the batteries . How are our communications , Lieutenant ? Main radio knocked out , sonar and radar working . The hydrophone on the marker buoy is active but the power is weak . Lieutenant Lewis ! I hope you 've got some good news on those escape hatches . Only number 3 is operational , sir , and that 's got trouble . It 's working , but the systems check indicates damage . And there 's something wrong with the pumps . It 'll take over 90 minutes to empty that hatch . One escape hatch in commission , and that 's only usable every 90 minutes . - What about the missile tubes ? - No , no go , Commander . The ship 's angle rules them out . The rock ledge is blocking the exits . So it looks like number 3 . See if you can fix those pumps . - And double-check on those hatches . - Yes , sir . Paul , I 'll be in the Captain 's cabin . Can you get any more speed out of this thing ? Not without blowing our engines to pieces . You know Commander Straker pretty well , don 't you ? Yes . Pretty well . Well , Paul ? We 've checked it again , sir . Looks pretty bad . Well , we 'll have to start making for the surface . We 've got to phase this carefully . We 're working with very little air and practically no time . I 'm worried about the outer door on 3 . There 's indication of severe damage . - What about the pumps ? - Still no improvement . With the reactor off , the power 's very low . What do we tell the crew ? Forget it . They 've figured it out for themselves already . Don 't worry , Nina . We 'll get out all right . You 've been in this situation before , haven 't you ? Yeah . It was a big boat . Full crew , 69 men trapped on the bottom , but we all got out , and we will this time , too . All right . Let 's go over the situation . There 's only one regular escape hatch still working , but its pumps are damaged , as well as its outside door . But there is another emergency escape route : through the crash-dive flood tube . Once its covers are blown , it can 't be drained unless Skydiver surfaces . So that means that we can only use it once . That tube is pretty narrow , sir . It 's some crawl . I know that , Lieutenant , but it means two of us will get out immediately . That will leave three of us down here . But if it takes 90 minutes to empty the hatch each time , we can all be out of here in four and a half hours . Are there any questions ? You said four and a half hours , but the air can last ... You 're forgetting , Lieutenant , the fewer people there are down here , the longer the air will last . Have you decided on an order of escape , sir ? Yes , I have . Lieutenant Barry , you will use the crash-dive tube . Yes , sir . - Lewis . - Sir . You have first try the escape hatch . - But , sir ... - That 's an order ! Lieutenant Chin will follow you and then Colonel Foster . All right , let 's get to it . - Now , Nina . - Sir . The crash-dive tube is the safest way out . But it won 't be easy . When we throw the control and the water comes in , - it 'll hit you like a sledgehammer . - Yes , sir . I know . I used it once during training . - Good . It 'll only last for a second . - I 'll manage . The sooner you get out , the more air there 'll be for the rest of us . There 's no chance of our surface vessel - getting to the area ahead of us ? - Forget it . We 're on our own . There 's only a slight swell . We 'll be able to handle it . - All set . - Good . Synchronise watches . 15 : 50 . - Check . - Check . We 'll blow the hatch in 5 minutes , Lieutenant . Good luck . Thank you , sir . See you topside . - Right , Lewis ? - Yes , sir . - I hope you make it . - We will , Lieutenant . Flood three . - Hatch flooded , sir . - Check . Negative . Must be jammed . It 's open . He 's made it . Nina should be in position now . Prepare to detonate in ... 20 seconds . 10 seconds . Detonate . They should be up by now . Help me . Help me . Straker ! We 're all of us going to get out OK , aren 't we , sir ? Sure , Chin . - How 's the head ? - I 'll be fine - when I get up to the surface . - Sure . Sure . Just hang on , Chin . The rescue team will be here in no time . Yes , sir . What are his chances ? He won 't last 10 minutes in the water without help . Try and rest , Chin . We 'll be out in one hour . - Straker . - ' Ed , it 's me . ' Alec . Thank God . - ' We 've got Lewis . ' - What did you say ? I said , we 've got Lewis . He 's quite safe . He 's explained the situation . Ed , just hang on ! - Alec , have you got Nina ? - ' Nina ? No . ' She went out right after Lewis . Don 't worry , don 't worry . We 'll find her . Look , Ed . You 've got to conserve your air supply . Just rest and stay as quiet as possible . The divers are coming now . - ' They 'll get you up . ' - Alec . Alec ! Power 's failing . I 'll check the escape pumps . They 're slowing down . Help me . Straker ... Someone ! He 's burning up . It 's all right . Relax , Lieutenant . Stop him , Paul ! Paul , get that equipment ! Lieutenant Chin ! Lieutenant Chin ! Lieutenant Chin . Get him , Paul ! Get him ! Hold him ! Hold him ! He 's out of it . Straker ... Help me . Poor guy . Death 's never worried me before . - Right now I 'm scared . - You 're getting older . How do you mean ? The older you get the more precious life becomes . You become aware of what life is . - It 's time , sir . - All right . - Commander ... - Get moving ! - But , sir . - Colonel Foster , get off this boat . - Commander ... - You 're breathing my oxygen . In you go . - How does it look ? - She 's jammed fast , sir . The only way of moving her is by heavy lifting gear . We 'd need a salvage vessel for that . Can we get an air supply down there ? Negative . I was hoping to use the escape hatch but it 's still flooded . The pumps must have packed up completely . It 's hopeless . You 'll have to go down there again . - And get me a suit , will you ? - Sir ! - What you gonna do ? - I don 't know . But we 're gonna get him out of there somehow . Help me . Someone ... help me . Help me . Johnny ! Johnny ! Mary . Mary ! I never want to see you again . The cover ... - The cover , it didn 't ... - It 's OK . It 's OK . - We 're sending them down now . - ' Right . 'And send down some more lights . ' Right . 'Air pressure ... 'falling . 'Oxygen count ... 'down to 15.1 . 'Emergency power ... 'failing . 'Commend ... Captain and crew . 'Note for Dr Schroeder . 'Subject : myself . 'Pulse rate 105 ... 'claustrophobia : negative . ' Don 't think the book ... If it had to be anyone ... I 'm glad you 're here . I mean , I 'm glad ... it 's you . 'Therefore , we commit ourselves 'to the deep , 'Returned to corruption . 'waiting for the day of resurrection , 'when the sea shall give up her dead . ' I don 't believe it ! - So that 's the way it happened . - You just blew us out of the water ? What else could we do ? It was Holden 's idea . The divers got in through the missile tubes . That 's the way it happened . I 'm afraid the visitors will have to leave now . I 'm sorry , sir . No smoking . - Well , back to the salt mines . - Bye . Oh , thanks for the cigars , Alec . Well , Nina , we were pretty close down there . Yes . If there was anything I said , which , well ... Or didn 't say ? That 's what life 's all about , I guess . The things we never say . Well , they 're kicking me out of here . I 'd better go and pack my toothbrush . - You 'll be back on Moonbase soon . - Yes , sir . - Take it easy , Nina . - Bye .

 Come , come . - Are you authorized to dress him like that ? - Oh , yes , sir . - A circus ape , huh ? - The only one to have been trained as a bareback rider in the entire history ofthe circus . - Circuses are past history . - Not while I live and breathe . - All right , Señor Armando . Go ahead . - Thank you . Come , come . Come , come . - Did I do all right ? - Yes , yes , yes . But try to walk a little more like a primitive chimpanzee . Your arms should move up and down from the shoulder ... like so . Yes , that 's better . After 20 years , you 've picked up evolved habits from me . That could be dangerous . Even fatal . - Armando , I don 't understand . - Listen to me , Caesar . There can be only one talking chimpanzee on Earth . The child ofthe two talking apes , Cornelius and Zira , who came to us years ago out ofthe future and were murdered for fear that one distant day apes might dominate the human race . Yeah , but outside ofyou , nobody even knows I exist . And we must keep it that way , for the fear remains . The mere fact ofyour existence would be regarded as a great threat to mankind . Come . Come . Attention , this is the watch commander . Disperse apes gathering in the mall . Repeat : disperse apes gathering in the mall .

You go ! - But you said humans treated apes like pets . - They did , in the beginning . They 've made slaves ofthem ! They all died within a few months , eight years ago . Every dog and cat in the world . It was like a plague . The disease that killed them was a virus brought back from space by an astronaut . - Didn 't the disease affect humans ? - We were immune . And so , it was discovered , were simians , even the smallest ones . That 's how it began . Humans wanting little household pets to replace the ones they had lost . Then , when people realized how quick they were to learn , how easy to train , the pets became larger , and larger , until now ... lt 's monstrous . Now you understand why I 've kept you away . Yes , Lisa . A Young Queen Falls for Mrs Riley . No ! Lisa . Yes ? Could you possibly be so kind as to display it in your window ? - When I have the time . - Thank you . The labor demonstration on the South Plaza will be terminatedin ten minutes . Repeat : the labor demonstration on the South Plaza will be terminatedin ten minutes . Thank you , Frank . Funny .

I 'll have someone to comb you out in a minute . I wanna be combed out now . I have a luncheon . - Thursday , then . - Thursday . I ... I forgot the waiter and I 'm all out of raisins . - Take mine . - Thank you . You 're overtipping . No ! No ! No ! And I told them to condition him to fire . Attention .

Failure to comply with this order can result in a one-yearsuspension ofyourright to bargain collectively . - What 's his job ? - He 's a messenger . For the governor , so get ! No ! No ! No ! - Stop that at once ! All ofyou ! - Yes , sir , Mr MacDonald . We were just ... I saw what you were doing . Now sedate the animal and get him out of here . - Who the hell 's that ? - The governor 's number-one assistant . - He love apes or something ? - Don 't it figure ? Hold him . Lousy human bastards ! Who said that ? I did . He 's a performing ape for my circus . - A talking ape ? - No ! No , no . - No , that 's impossible. lt was I who spoke . - lt didn 't sound like your voice . Yell " Lousy human bastards . " - That 's not what I said . - That 's what I heard . Now , look , mister , you yell " Lousy human bastards . " - Lousy human bastards . - We said yell ! Lousy human bastards ! - Yeah , yeah . Could be . - l don 't think so . - lt 's right . The ape spoke . - Yeah ! No ! No , they 're mistaken . I admit my behavior was inexcusable and I am deeply sorry . I think we better take him to headquarters for interrogation . Guard ! Move him on . - Armando , forgive me . - Oh , no , no . You only said aloud what I was thinking . I 'm sorry. I was so angry . I might have bluffed it through if you hadn 't run away . Now they suspect you of understanding all that was said . - Armando , let 's go back to the circus . - No , no , no . - Oh , no , please . - No , that 's the first place they 'll look . Here 's what we 'll do. I 'll go to the police . - Oh , no , no ! - lt 's the only way ! I 'll say that ... that I couldn 't find you . That ... you 've run away before . - That big cities frighten you . - But , Armando , where would I go ? You wait right here ! If this works , I 'll be back by nightfall . - But what ifthey don 't let you go ? - Oh , they will . They will . But just in case , if I am not back by then ... Now , these steps go down to a tunnel that leads to the harbor . Cargoes of apes are frequently unloaded at night . - You must try to infiltrate one ofthem . - But , Armando ... Apes imported from overseas arrive naked , so you 'll have to get rid ofthese clothes . - Well , I don 't want to . - We must have an alternate plan ! Right now , the only safe hiding place for you is among your own kind . I shouldn 't be long . Why would you say " human " ? " Human . " That 's a very odd thing for another human being to say . I didn 't say " human , " Mr Governor . I said " inhuman . " Lousy inhuman bastards . And by the blessed St Francis , who loved all animals , I meant it . - You see , I run a circus ... - We know that . - From 20 years back . - Since the talking apes arrived on Earth and conceived a baby whose survival could have threatened the future ofthe human race . Mr Governor , I understand the baby was shot dead with its parents . Or so it was believed , Mr MacDonald . However , since this morning , I 'm beginning to wonder ifthey shot the right baby . The apes could have switched their baby with one from the zoo . - Or perhaps a circus . - Surely , Mr Governor , you can 't be serious ! Hoskyns , the cassette , please . These are the recommendations made to the then president ofthe United States by the chairman of the Presidential Committee . And we believe that the male andfemale talking apes , Cornelius andZira , have come to us out ofthe future . We believe theirspoken testimony , that some 2,000 years hence , their descendants willhave allbut exterminated the human race from Earth . And we know that the female ape is nowpregnant with child . The commission therefore recommends that the birth ofthe female ape 's unborn childshouldbe prevented and thatboth the male and the female should be rendered incapable ofbegetting another . But , Mr Governor , every zoo , public and private , was searched by the police , and every circus , including my own . - But a small chimpanzee was found . - The only one ever to be born in a circus , and legally certified to have been born a month - a month - before the talking apes arrived on earth . - Where is he now ? - l wish I knew. I 've searched everywhere . Señor Armando ! Let me remind you ... of the seriousness of our problem . Now . - Your circus travels mainly in the provinces ? - Yes , sir . Then , undoubtedly , you are unaware of the rising tide of disobedience , the outright defiance , among the servant apes in our cities . Mr Governor , on investigation , many of the offenses have been proved minor . The ape killed while trying to escape from the city last night , - would you call his offense minor ? - No , sir , I would not . He physically assaulted his own master . But only after what must have been severe provocation . The ape 's body was covered with welts and bruises inflicted by a beating . Which he no doubt richly deserved . How many more ofthem out there are just like that ape ? All burningwith resentment . Or waiting . Waiting for an ape with enough intelligence , with enough will , to lead them . Waiting for an ape who can think . Who can talk . Señor Armando , has your ape ever talked or shown any signs of being articulate in your presence ? Never in my presence , or anyone else 's . You can question my circus hands . We intend to . Meanwhile , you will remain in custody . Shipment 507 , I for Indonesia , ex-Borneo , now arriving atgate number two . Shipment 509 , A for Africa , ex-French Cameroons , now arriving at number four gate . After fingerprinting , shipment 507 , I for Indonesia , ex-Borneo , will proceed direct to conditioning cage 90 . After fingerprinting , shipment 507 , I for Indonesia , ex-Borneo , will proceed direct to conditioning cage 90 . Immigration personnel are reminded that , until further notice , police have requested one additional copy of all chimpanzee fingerprints for their files . Repeat : immigration personnel are reminded that until further notice , police have requested one additional copy of all chimpanzee fingerprints for their files . Do ! Next ! No ! No ! No ! - They 're a bit uppity. I haven 't fed them yet . - Come on ! Switch off . Switch on . Have you seen this ape before ? Isn 't it ... Cornelius ? I thought you didn 't know him ? B-But you told me yourself . T-The talking ape that was murdered ... - Executed . - Executed . - Would you say there 's a resemblance ? - Oh , no . Look very carefully . - Like father , like son , eh ? - No . No ! You 'd do well to cooperate with us . l-l ... Could I ... Could I please have a glass ofwater ? Do . No ! Do . No ! No ! No ! No ! Do . Attention . Training Control . Four females have arrived for insemination - three gorillas and one chimpanzee . Please selectfoursuperiormales - three gorillas , one chimpanzee - andsend them to the breeding anneximmediately . 254 process for auction . Yes , ma 'am , for immediate sale . One male gorilla , age seven . Fully conditioned bedmaker , grade A. Yes , yes . You will be credited after auction . So you 're a member of Breck 's party . Now I understand how you got those big contracts . He 's good for this country . Good for all of us . - You really think he 's gonna make it ? - l don 't know of anyone who could stop him . Bring up lot eight ! Lot eight ! One male chimpanzee ! In early prime and perfect physical condition . Take a good look at this specimen . This has to be the buy ofthe afternoon . Early prime . Perfect physical condition . Under observation , he appeared so familiar , obedient , docile and intelligent with humans that conditioning was not considered necessary . But it certainly can be provided on request . We 're gonna start the bidding on this specimen at $ 800 . All right , ladies and gentlemen , what am I bid on this superb specimen ? Bidding starts at 800 . 800 . What am I bid for this superb specimen ? 800 . 800 . - 850 ! - 850 over here . Do I hear nine ? - 900 ! - l hear nine over there ! Nine over there ! - 950 . - 950 over there on the end . - 1,000 . - 1,000 from the gentleman on the end . $ 1,000 . - 1100 ! - 1100 over here . - 1150 . - 1150 in the back row . - 1200 - $ 1200 from this gentleman . Going to this gentleman . Going ! Going ... - Buy him . - 1500 ! 1500 from Mr MacDonald ! For His Excellency , Governor Breck . Going ! Going ! Gone ! Come . It 's very good , Morgan , but simplify the wording in that last paragraph . Sir , we 've received a disappointing report on the automated sanitation plan . - You have a meeting with Curfew Control . - Cancel it , Miss Greer . These figures , did you double-check them ? - Yes , sir . - Triple-check them ! - Come . - Hold all calls , Miss Greer . Here 's the iq profile on all apes tested within the last four weeks. lt 's risen by 32 / 3 points . Uh-huh ! Show Mr MacDonald . He thinks I 'm imagining things . I assembled that . You summarized the wrong part . So their output has increased about the same percentage , which I thought the governor might regard as good news . It 's all right . We 'll go over that later . No . Watch . Do . No , no , no . Clean . Clean . It seems the little fella 's not so bright after all . No . But brightness has never been encouraged amongst slaves . Oh , don 't be so touchy , Mr MacDonald . All of us were slaves once , in one sense ofthe word or another . If you feel the ape 's unsatisfactory , we can have him reconditioned . - That isn 't necessary . - You 're quite right , Mr MacDonald . But not for any of your bleeding-heart reasons . Reconditioning . That 's all any ofyou ever think of , isn 't it ? Don 't you realize , ifwe were to take every ape who disobeyed an order and sent him back for reconditioning , Ape Management would become overcrowded . - lt 's the only thing that has any effect . - Just makes them worse . Some ofthem couldn 't be worse. I 've been having a comprehensive list compiled . - Mr Governor . - Yes , what is it you want ? - lt 's your meeting with the Defense Council . - l 'll be along in a moment . - Defense Council ? - l 'll tell you about it later . - ls this related to the list you mentioned ? - You 'll be given full details , Mr MacDonald . Meanwhile , we 're going to set a good example and recondition this fella ourselves . - We haven 't named him yet , have we ? - No , Mr Breck . I 'm going to revive a charming tradition established in her lifetime by my dear wife , and let you name yourself . " Caesar . " A king . Yes ? They 're waiting for you in the council chamber . I don 't think we 'll ever make a bartender out of Caesar . Have him detailed to the Command Post . No ! Attention . There is a report of unescortedapes in the Plaza. investigate . - Can I help you , Mr MacDonald ? - This ape 's assigned to the Command Post . - What 's his name , sir ? - Caesar . Start him off in the files . Low-priority traffic . Yes , sir . Do ! Lisa . Lisa ! Ah ! Señor Armando ! - This way , señor . This way . - Sit down , sit down . We have good news for you . - Good news ? - Yes . You 're to be released . Inspector Hoskyns and I believe that your ape is not the child ofthe talking chimpanzees . - You found him ? - Not yet , but he 'll turn up sooner or later . I 'm sorry for the inconvenience we had to cause you . Do forgive us , but it was unavoidable . Oh , yes . Yes . Then I 'm ... I 'm free to go ? Oh , as soon as you sign this sworn declaration . - What does it say ? - Only what you 've been telling us all along . The circus ape is incapable of human speech and , to the best ofyour knowledge , he 's never uttered a word . Certainly . Excellent . Now we 'll check this with the authenticator , then you 'll be free to go . The ... authenticator ? It 's just a formality . Sit back down , please. lt 'll just take a moment . What does the authenticator do ? Makes people tell the truth . It 's quite painless . For example , you said you first heard the name Cornelius in this office . Was that true ? - No . - Now , there ! You see ? That 's not a bad black mark against you . You probably heard it somewhere else before . Now . About your statement , sworn statement , that the circus ape is incapable of speech . - No. I won 't submit to this . - You will , Señor Armando ! I have done nothing wrong ! You are treating me like a criminal ! Sit back , please . No ! No , no . - Guard ! - No ! No ! - l knew that circus owner was lying . - They insist he fell to his death accidentally . While trying to escape ! He knew he 'd been exposed . Attention . Attention . Last night , severalsecurityforces apprehended andplacedin custody a number ofservantapes from widely scattered households throughout the city , who hadgathered clandestinely in the unusedbuilding on the outskirts ofthe East Sector . Property owners are firmly warned that theybearsole responsibility for the behavior and whereabouts oftheirservantapes . Frank ! Frank . No ! " One dozen steaks , New York cut , for Mrs Van Thal . " Add one gallon of ... No . Two gallons of kerosene . Mr Governor . The latest ape-disobedience figures . There 's been a marked increase in property damage . Couldn 't all be carelessness , Mr MacDonald ! Arrange for distribution ofthe Achilles list . Copies to each police precinct . Details are to be left to the individual commanders , but I want every ape on that list delivered to the reconditioning center by 0600 tomorrow morning . I 'm sorry , 309 . The cages are full . We cannot accommodate any new intakes until afterTuesday 's auction . " Collect one repaired Colt 45 . " And ... 100 rounds ammunition . The Achilles list , Mr MacDonald , referring to our Achilles heel , contains the name of every ape who , over the past year , has been overtly disobedient . The charge against them is nonsense . It will do for my purposes . They constitute the hard core of our problem and I 'm going to crush them once and for all ! Sir , you will only further aggravate the problem . This action is folly , and I wish to protest it in the strongest possible terms . Very well , Mr MacDonald . Your protest has been duly noted . From now on , you have but one assignment : to find that talking ape . - What is this ? A red alert ? - Sort of . Ape Management computer 's come up with an intriguing error . Shipment 507 , I for Indonesia , comprised three orangutans and one chimpanzee . - So ? - There are no chimpanzees in Borneo . Yes , sir . State Security Chief Inspector Kolp on line three . Yes , Inspector . Give me the Indonesia file for last month . That 's 507 , ex-Borneo . Right , Inspector . Let me check . 507 , ex-Borneo . Yes , sir . That chimpanzee was sold to Governor Breck . Good God ! Just as I first thought . We 've had him under our noses all the time ! Sir , I 'm willing to have the ape executed immediately on your verbal orders alone . - You 'll have it in writing . - Thank you , sir . - Get Mr MacDonald at the Command Post . - However , suppose he can speak but won 't ? I don 't understand . The chief inspector means there 'd still be a doubt . If the chimpanzee keeps his mouth shut , the case stays open . We 'd like to close the file . You shall. I promise you . Reconditioning applications have to be made out in triplicate . MacDonald speaking . Yes , sir . You want me to turn Caesar over to Inspector Kolp ? is he on your Achilles list ? Mr MacDonald , do not question an order . No , sir , I 'm not questioning the order. lt 's just that ... Well , I sent him out on an errand . He should be back momentarily . Yes , sir. I 'll do just as you say . Come . - No , this goes to Traffic Control ! - Take it easy . They can 't read . Not yet , they can 't . Do . Mr MacDonald , are you near a phone ? Mr MacDonald , itis imperative that you get to a phone ! Come in , Mr MacDonald ! Do you hear me ? Get to a phone and come in ! Now , come in ! - Yes , Mr Governor . - Kolp is on his way down with the police . - ls Caesarbackyet ? - Not yet , sir. I 'll keep a look out . Notify me the moment he 's handed over to them . Yes , sir . I wish ... I wish there was some way we could communicate , so you 'd understand that I ... I understand , Mr MacDonald . Yes , I ... I 'm the one they 're looking for . I never believed it . I ... I thought you were a myth . Well , I 'm not . But I will tell you something that is . The beliefthat human beings are kind ... - No , Caesar . There are some ... - A handful , perhaps , but not most ofthem . They won 't learn to be kind until we force them to . We can 't do that until we are free . How do you propose to gain this freedom ? By the only means left to us . - Revolution . - But ... it 's doomed to failure ! Perhaps ... this time . - And the next . - Maybe . - But you 'll keep trying . - You , above everyone else , should understand . We cannot be free until we have power . How else can we achieve it ? Go . Ah , Mr MacDonald , I have an order from the governor to take Caesar into custody . I know. I 've been looking for him . - He 's not in the Command Post ? - No . Issue an order to round up all unaccompanied apes . I still don 't see why he made a run for it . It 's really quite simple , Mr MacDonald . The ape has intelligence . He knew thathis friendArmando was dead . He assumed the man first betrayed him under torture . But we don 't do that ... to humans . Now . Talk ! Talk ! Talk ! Talk ! Talk ! Have ... Ha ... Have pity . That 's incredible ! Well , there 's your proof ! We 're convinced , Mr Governor . It 's fantastic . Absolutely fantastic . Have him say something else . You heard the governor . Answer ! - We could persuade him . - No . He 's not responsible for what he is . Still , seeing him there , it 's like looking at some deadly bacillus and ... knowing you 've got it bottled up at last . - ls that all , sir ? - Not quite . I have an authorization here from the governor to have this beast destroyed . I 'll notify the vet to inject him . - He is wired for electrocution , isn 't he ? - Oh , yes . Well , then , electrocute him . Now . - He 's dead . - Good . - Good work , Inspector . - What happened to Mr MacDonald ? I 'm afraid his sensibility ... Ah , there you are ! - ls it over ? - Yes , it 's over . Shall we go back to work ? Lisa . All keepers andhandlers , attention . Attention ! All keepers and handlers . There is $ 50,000 worth of apes in jeopardy . Get them out of here ... alive ! Yes . Commander , I understand the situation . Assemble as large a force as you can and follow them . Mobilize all security forces , police , militia and reserve defense units . See that every entrance into the city is cordoned off . Will control methods include tear gas and sedation darts ? There will be but one control method : shoot to kill . A smallgroup ofapes , scheduled forintensive reconditioning , have escapedfrom Ape Management . Until they 've been rounded up by the police , all citizens are requested to remain indoors . A furtherannouncement willbe made as soon as recapture is effected . And , Iguess , here itis . Ape Managementis in the hands ofthe apes . Many officials are either dead orheldhostage . The main band ofrioting apes are at this verymomentmarching on the city . It 's been established that the ape mob is under the command ofa supernormally intelligent chimpanzee who has ... acquired the power ofspeech . That idiot ! Get out a retraction immediately ! Announce that the talking ape has been put to death ! .. the child ofthe two talking chimpanzees , Cornelius andZira , who came to us from outer space 20 years ago . As such , he constitutes a threat to the future ofthe whole human race . Governor Breck hasjustissued this order to all civilians : go to yourhomes . Stay in yourhome andlockyour doors . Above all , do notpanic . Repeat : go to yourhomes . Stay in yourhomes andlockyour doors . The situation can be kept under control provided our defense forces are given complete freedom ofmovement . No ! Go back ! No ! No ! Go home ! Back ! Ready . Aim . Fire ! Ready . Aim . Fire ! Yes . Yes . Understood . Riot Control say the apes have broken through the cordon . Advance units are approaching the Plaza . Order units four and six into action immediately . Riot Control . No ! No ! They 've reached the Plaza . - Good God ! They 're armed ! - And organized . - No ! Home ! - Don 't plead with them , you idiot ! Ready ! No ! Home ! Home ! Home ! Aim ! Fire ! What 's the trouble down there ? Like wild animals , they 're smelling blood . My God ! There 's more ! - They 're inside the building . - Alert all security posts ! - Right , sir . - No ! No ! The circuits are dead . Take a message . To Riot Control , urgent . Command Post under attack ! Repeat : Command Post under attack ! It won 't work , sir . No ! But how ? How ? They don 't have the intelligence to use such tools ! Shoot them ! Shoot them all ! This is the Communication Center . We have no defense . If we lose this battle , that 's the end ofthe world as we know it ! We will have proved ourselves inferior . Weak ! And all the groveling cowards left alive when the battle is over will be the weakest of all ! This will be the end of human civilization and the world will belong to a planet of apes ! No ! No , go . Go ! Caesar ! Your servant . Your creature . Your animal ! But I saw you die . The king is dead . Long live the king ! Tell me , Breck , before you die , how do we differ from the dogs and cats you and your kind used to love ? Why did you turn us from pets into slaves ? Because your kind were once our ancestors . Man was born ofthe ape . And there 's still an ape curled up inside of every man . The beast that must be whipped into submission . The savage that has to be shackled in chains . You are that beast , Caesar . You taint us . You poison our guts ! When ... When we hate you , we 're ... we 're hating the dark side of ourselves . Take him . Go ! Caesar ! Caesar . This is not how it was to be . In your view or mine ? Violence prolongs hate . Hate prolongs violence . - By what rightare you spilling blood ? - The slave 's right to punish his persecutors . Caesar. I , a descendant of slaves , am asking you to show humanity . But I was not born human . I know . The child ofthe evolved apes . Whose children shall rule the Earth . For better or for worse ? Do you think it could be worse ? Do youthink this riot will win freedom for all your kind ? - By tomorrow ... - By tomorrow , it will be too late . A tiny , mindless insect like the emperor moth can communicate with another - over a distance of 80 miles . - An emperor ape might do slightly better ? Slightly ? What you have seen here today , apes on the five continents will be imitating tomorrow . With knives against guns ? With kerosene cans against flame-throwers ? Where there is fire , there is smoke . And , in that smoke , from this day forward , my people will crouch and conspire and plot and plan for the inevitable day of man 's downfall . The day when he finally and self-destructively turns his weapons against his own kind . The day ofthe writing in the sky , when your cities lie buried under radioactive rubble . When the sea is a dead sea and the land is a wasteland out ofwhich Iwill lead my people from their captivity . And we shall build our own cities in which there will be no place for humans , except to serve our ends . And we shall found our own armies , our own religion , our own dynasty ! And that day is upon you ... now ! But now ... Now we will put away our hatred . Now we will put down our weapons . We have passed through the Night ofthe Fires . And those who were our masters are now our servants . And we , who are not human , can afford to be humane . Destiny is the will of God . And , if it is man 's destiny to be dominated , it is God 's will that he be dominated with compassion and understanding . So , cast out your vengeance . Tonight , we have seen the birth ofthe Planet ofthe Apes ! Visiontext Subtitles : Julie Clayton

 - Dr Stranges , welcome to London . - Thank you very much . As the President of the National Investigations Committee on UFOs , could I ask you , what is an unidentified flying object ? Yes , an unidentified flying object is any object whose behaviour violates every known law of aerodynamics . Politicians are loath to commit themselves on the subject . Have any leading statesmen given their opinions about UFOs ? Congressman Gerald Ford stated time and time again that he would prefer open congressional hearings rather than hearings behind closed doors . But as a matter of point , the late Robert Kennedy made a statement that not only does he believe in UFOs , but he also believes that they come from other planets . I see . Could I ask you , has any military expert , for example , ever commented on United States or international involvement with UFOs ? In New York City at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel , the late General Douglas MacArthur made an outstanding statement that almost tumbled the foundations of the very press . He stated , and I quote : " War on earth is fast becoming obsolete . " It will be replaced by war between planets . " It would do good for every nation on earth to unite together " to form a common front against possible attack " by people from other planets . ' Fine . Yeah . - I 'm so sorry . - My pleasure . - Beautiful . - Very . - And out with the boss . - You know her ? I do , but she doesn 't know me . You remember the Dalotek Affair 6x months ago ? The Dalotek affair ? I remember . 'The Dalotek affair ... The Dalotek affair ... 'The Dalotek affair ... ' - Sir ? The survey . - Thank you . - Is there anything else ? - No , that 's all . Sighting at 0135-242 . Second sighting at 0140-242 . Third sighting at 0145-242 . Trajectory termination ? Preliminary readings indicate Moonbase area . Red alert . Interceptors to be on stand-by . Attention all defence systems , this is a maximum security alert . Attention all defence systems . I say again , this is a maximum security alert . Condition red . 3 UFOs sighted . ETT area 1-40 , 60 miles from Moonbase . There 's nothing for them there . Are you quite sure ? 'We 've checked it . We seem to be faced with a UFO attack 'in force on an area of bare lava rock . ' Don 't try to figure them , Foster . Launch your Interceptors . Interceptors immediate launch . Check trajectory . Same coordinates . Maintaining course . 'Switch to on-board computer . ' Roger . The UFOs have changed course . Hold for further instructions . No possible error ? - They veered off . - Where are they heading ? According to the readings , back the way they came . Interceptors , return to base . - Did we scare them off ? - ' It 'd be the first time . ' - What happened ? - Anybody 's guess . 'Guess ? ! Millions of dollars ' worth of equipment and you have to guess ? ' Sometimes , yes . They didn 't make a billion-mile space journey for nothing . - No , sir . - ' We need answers , Colonel . ' Is it a decoy that 's failed , or a red herring that 's already succeeded ? It 's your job to find out ! I have a sighting . It 's travelling too slowly for a UFO . - Meteorite ? - Looks like it . Definitely a meteorite . With an ETT in area 017-213 . - Get me Commander Straker . - Yes , sir . - ' Straker . ' - We 're tracking a meteorite . - ' A what ? ' - A meteorite . 'You videoed to tell me that ? ' Its ETT is almost directly on top of the Dalotek installation . Can you contact them ? - ' There 's the radio link . ' - Warn them . Roger . 'One more thing , Colonel . 'If you have to bring any of them to the base , use the amnesia procedure . ' Right . Contact the Dalotek unit . - How long to impact ? - Approximately 3 minutes . 'This is Moonbase calling Dalotek unit . Come in , Dalotek . 'Moonbase calling Dalotek unit . Come in , Dalotek . ' The recorders are all in circuit . We 'll gather all the sub-strata material we can . - Scanner 's OK . - Good . Get down ! Let 's take a look . I 've told Foster to keep Moonbase on green alert for the next few days . Thanks . Maybe they were after the Dalotek installation . Don 't talk to me about Dalotek . I 've been avoiding their president . - What have you got against them ? - They shouldn 't be allowed up there . A private corporation has no business on the moon . Besides , all the valuable mineral deposits were taken away long ago . No , Dalotek is just wasting time and money . - That 's their problem . - Now it 's our problem , Alec . Statistically , that was a 50,000 to 1 shot . Yeah , a meteorite that size would be . If we 've finished this session , we 'd better go and check the base . A piece of debris could have punctured the outside pressure skin . Straker . 'You 're a difficult man to contact , Commander . ' - It 's in the nature of the job . - ' More security re-routings . 'My name is Blake . ' The president of the Dalotek Corporation . 'I simply wanted to establish contact , Commander . ' 'Thank you for your help in preparing our moon project . ' Let 's get one thing straight , Mr Blake . Your moon project was approved despite my overwhelming objections . If there 's any trouble , I shall demand its immediate withdrawal . My team will be on the moon for 10 days . What can happen in that time ? 'My command has a complex and hazardous mission . 'The presence of civilians could jeopardise our security operations 'as well as normal procedures . ' My team will use limited radio frequencies . They 'll take every precaution to avoid your installations . They 've been thoroughly briefed . Then they 'll be briefed again , Mr Blake . 'Whatever you wish , Commander . 'There 'll be little contact with your base . Unless ... ' - What ? - ' In an emergency , you agreed ... ' To render all possible assistance . Yes . Pressure normal on one . Pressure normal on two . 'Come in , Dalotek . Our friendly neighbours , the military . - Dalotek Survey Base . - ' Colonel Foster for you . ' This is Colonel Foster . We monitored a meteorite in your area . We saw it land . Quite large , approximately 900 kilos . Fell 200 yards from our installations . That agrees with our coordinates . Have you checked pressure for puncture ? Yes , Colonel . Thanks for calling . Out . - ' Any damage ? ' - No . Everything 's under control . 'Good . Will you finish on schedule ? ' Yes , I think so . Provided those meteorites leave us alone . 'Right . That 's all . 'I talked to Commander Straker about that military installation . 'It 's my impression that he 's looking for trouble . Don 't give him any . ' Don 't worry . We 're keeping out of their way . Playing by the book . 'Fine . ' You have those Dalotek people on your back door for the next ten days . We 've had no trouble . 'Just make sure they 're following the agreed procedure . 'Don 't make it too easy for them . ' What 's going on ? Loss of signal . Run equipment check . Breakdown in Moonbase video link . 'Come in , SHADO Control . Switch in the emergency link . Emergency link negative , sir . I can assure you , Colonel , solar activity is minimal . You 're sure ? - What else can it be ? - A fault in the equipment . The checks say no . Run a new test series . The solar wind has disrupted communications more than once . - It 's not responsible this time . - Just run the test . - Anything promising ? - No , not yet . - Give me 7 . - 7 it is . 9 . 9 . - Infrared . - Infrared . Feed out . Thank you . The corona would be symmetrical if there were an increase - in the number of sunspots . - Exactly . No unusual solar activity . But it all fitted . Have you considered the possibility of outside interference ? - Go on . - Just an idea . Dalotek . They 're operating on limited frequencies . They could be violating the agreement . - Is there a way to check ? - Just one . Well , that completes this run . What is it ? Trouble ? Why else should we receive a visit from the military ? We 're operating well within the prescribed frequencies , Colonel . - We 'll check that , Miss Carson . - We 're open to check at any time . But to switch off the geo-scanner means a write-off for all our work . There 'd have to be adequate reason for so drastic a step . More than adequate reason , Mr Tanner . Our base radio lost total contact with earth half an hour ago . - Maybe increased solar activity . - The solar wind ? The coronagraph check shows negative . How about a simple radio fault ? Do you check your fuses , Colonel ? We 've checked everything . Now you want to check us . Can you think of a more logical step ? Run another communication check on Moonbase , Alec . You ordered a continuous check 30 minutes ago . Yes , yes . Why don 't you get some sleep ? I will . But not until that video link is back . Well , you 've examined the frequency settings , Colonel . I think they prove that we 've followed the agreement to the letter . You haven 't intentionally been operating unlimited frequencies , but you could have used them inadvertently . Miss Carson is in charge of the geo-scanner . She 's very experienced . I can imagine . Colonel , exactly how many radio failures have you had ? - One so far . - That doesn 't seem too serious . For a military organisation , it could be catastrophic . You 're convinced that we 're to blame ? It seemed the logical conclusion . I 'm glad we 've been able to change your mind . So am I. Except now it means I 'm back at square one . You 'll have to excuse me , Colonel . I have the seismic meters to service . I 'll leave you with Miss Carson . If you have any question , ask her . Au revoir , Colonel . - Miss Carson , I ... - Jane . Up here , formality 's a little superfluous . Paul . All right . Paul . I have the impression you 're not 100 % certain we 're not the source of your difficulties . I can see I 'm right . And I suppose next time there 's a radio blackout , we 're going to get the blame . No , but I shall want to make a check on the use of the scanner . With radio failure , how can you ? We 're 50 kilometres away . We 'll install a land line between here and Moonbase . Then we 'll always have a direct link . And ? Only the geo-scanner is powerful enough to disrupt communications . If there 's another blackout and it isn 't transmitting ... - We 're in the clear ? - Yes . But you 'll have to take our word for it that we 're not transmitting . I 'll take your word for it . I don 't think we 're to blame , Paul . I 've been very careful . So have Mark and Phil . We 'll install the land line immediately . I 'll wait for your first call . I must go . - Have you seen all you want ? - Yeah , I 've seen about everything . Are you satisfied ? Very . SHADO Control to Moonbase . Do you read me ? - SHADO Control to Moonbase ... - ' Reading you . ' 'Strength 5 , voice and vision . ' Immediate for Commander Straker . - Moonbase contact re-established . - Yes , sir . Stand by for video circuit tests . Land line installation complete , sir . Right . Dalotek Base , how 's reception ? Well , our own private line . I 'm flattered . Tell me , Jane , what do you do on your evenings off ? I know this marvellous little Italian restaurant not 200 miles from here . How about dinner ? - Do they have fettuccine ? - ' Beautiful fettuccine . ' And a fat , Italian Mama , who does all her own cooking ? You 've been there . I 'll reserve a corner table . - We 'll sit and look at the stars . - Our only problem will be ... How the devil do we eat fettuccine through a quarter-inch space visor ? Listen , I 've got a moon ship coming soon , so I 'll ... I 'll have to be going . - Do we have it on positive track ? - Yes , sir . Control to Lunar Module . Switch to computer control for landing . Roger . - Landing is go . - ' Thank you , Control . On computer ... ' - Do we still have them ? - I 'm losing them . Radio malfunction . Control to Module . Switch to manual . Control to Mo ... This is Lunar Module . I have lost you . Maintaining computer control for landing . Switch to manual . We have radio blackout . This is Lunar Module . I repeat , Lunar Module . I have lost you . Maintaining control for computer landing . Complete computer shut-down . This is Lunar Module . This is Lunar Module . This is Lunar Module , switching back to manual control . He must have switched to manual , but I think it 's too late . Get a rescue team out there . Dalotek Base . Yes , Paul . But everything was turned off except the geo-scanner and that wasn 't transmitting . I see . - What 's wrong ? - Colonel Foster 's coming over . There 's been an accident at Military Base . Moon ship . The radio blacked out and all the crew were killed . I say you 're responsible . I understand how you feel , Colonel , but you 're wrong . I made the mistake of believing that last time . - What do you intend to do about it ? - End your operation . - You can 't mean that . - You don 't have the authority . I do mean it . And I do have the authority . - But the project 's almost completed . - I have no alternative . I 'm sorry . - Remove the circuits . - Don 't touch the equipment ! Phil . I can 't allow this . Those circuits are irreplaceable . Exactly . I 'd like to speak to your commanding officer . There isn 't time , and it wouldn 't matter anyway . The circuits come out . Put them in the Moon Mobile . You haven 't heard the last of this . Maybe . But we 've heard the last of that . - So what do we do now ? - What can we do ? Carry on as best we can until we receive instructions from Blake . In the meantime we can collect our equipment from the surface . Fine . Phil , you take the area we worked on yesterday . Jane , you go with him . I 'll do the section by the new crater . OK ? - What is it ? - I 'm not sure that matters . The point is , did we damage it with our blasting ? - Or was it damaged by the meteorite ? - How did it get into the crater ? - Foster installed it . - When ? The crater 's only been there a few days . This is getting us nowhere . We 've got to decide what to do about it . We go outside and take a closer look . Good idea . The commander took the decision on the spot . I support that decision . 'The Astrophysical Commission may disagree after talking to me . ' That 's your prerogative , Mr Blake . Meanwhile , Dalotek does what it 's told . 'You 'll be hearing from me . ' 'Sighting , 4028 . 'Confirm speed 0-SOL 8 . ' I 've got it . Red alert . Interceptors immediate launch . - We 've picked up a UFO . - Give me the trajectory coordinates . 'Blake ... 'Video link ... ' Another blackout . Try and re-set . - Anything ? - Nothing . - What the blazes is going on ? - We 've lost them again , sir . - And the emergency link ? - We 've tried it . - Keep trying . - Sir . SHADO Control to Moonbase , do you read me ? Nothing , sir . Reed , we must get that tracker working . I 'll do my best . If I can find the source of the trouble . 'UFO maintaining course . Interceptors ... ' 'Range , 20 million miles . 'Awaiting missing timing and attack ... ' 'UFO maintaining ... ' Lieutenant Ford . Will you come into the office ? That library material we were running through the other day . - Is it still set up ? - Yes , sir . Good . There 's something in the back of my mind about one of those interviews you did back in 1969 . Something that won 't quite click into place . Which one was it , sir ? I think it was the one with Dr Stranges . Yes . There 's nothing in that one about radio blackouts , I can assure you , sir . Maybe . But there 's something . Re-run it . Run the interview with Dr Stranges . Channel it into Commander Straker 's office . 'Yes , sir . ' - ' Dr Stranges , welcome to London . ' - ' Thank you very much . ' 'In this year of 1969 , man has just landed on the moon 'and we 're bursting with new knowledge about space . 'But we have so very little on unidentified flying objects . 'As the President of ... ' I remember all this . Let 's see the second half . Wind on . 'What is the position of the United Nations regarding UFOs ? ' 'The United Nations , as a physical body , 'has never gone on record as a body , as far as UFOs are concerned . 'However , I spoke at the U.N. Outer Space Affairs Committee ... ' D 'you want to go on , sir ? Yes , let it run . ' ... told the press , " We have a two-fold problem facing the world today . " " Number one is the Vietnam crisis and number two , unidentified flying objects . " Maybe it was my interview with Dr Bressinger from MIT . No . There 's just a word , a phrase . ' ... they 're so involved in other things 'they haven 't seen the seriousness of the problem of UFOs . 'Although it 's a fact that every nation ... ' Let 's go back . - Where are they ? - They must be working outside . Dalotek . Another radio failure . Yes . Both our bases are in imminent danger . Get me Tanner . Colonel Foster . Hello , Colonel . We were just about to call you . You know that installation of yours in that new crater ? What installation ? Crater 236 ? If there 's an installation there , Tanner , it doesn 't belong to us . - Estimated range ? - Approximately 2,0 . 5 minutes from the last known trajectory termination . Estimated target proximity of Moon Mobile ? 1 minute 50 . 'Out of historical interest , how long have UFOs been sighted and recorded ? ' 'UFO history goes back to ... ' I don 't think there 's anything , sir . We checked this material carefully . It was just a hunch . 'The Romans called them ... ' - Hold it ! - ' ... fiery disks and the Greeks ... ' Stop the tape . - Run back a few feet . - Go back ten feet . 'The Egyptians called them sky bolts or sky balls , 'fireballs . - ' The Romans ... ' - Fireballs . ' ... fiery disks ... ' What 's another word for fireballs , Lieutenant ? - Thunderbolt ? - Or ? Meteorite ! Crater 236 . - Still no radio contact ? - No . ETA crater 236 , 1 minute 5 . 'Range , 10 million miles . ' The position is becoming only too clear , Lieutenant . Just as we hear that Moonbase is under attack from a UFO , radio contact is lost . Something is jamming the signal . I believe the cause is some sort of alien device in crater 236 . If it was sent in using an orbit , it would make us think it was a meteorite . 'Range 5 million miles . Bearing positive . ' Do we go on without confirmation ? Our orders are to destroy the installation . But the Dalotek base is pretty close by . We assume Colonel Foster 's thought of that . Tanner ? 90 seconds . 'I 'm confirming we 're going to detonate in crater 236 . 'Be prepared for an explosive decompression . Good luck . ' All right . Get your helmets on . - I say Foster 's up to something . - We 've got no choice . Come on . Interceptor leader to Moonbase . Come in , Moonbase . 'The Interceptors are in position , 'awaiting timing and attack data . ' Predict Interceptors will be in range in about 40 seconds . If they haven 't altered course . - Estimated proximity of Moon Mobile ? - They should be on target now , sir . They better be . OK . Range on target . Range on target . It 's coming through . Trajectory 80-3-9 , 20-7-4 . Base to Interceptors , switch to computer link for course correction and missile firing sequence . Straker . 'We 've re-established contact with Moonbase , sir . ' Right . Colonel Foster , what 's the position ? 'There was an alien device near the Dalotek base . ' Yes , we assumed as much . 'We have the UFO on positive track . 'The Interceptors are going in to attack . ' Missile launch , minus 8,5 . 'Well done , Captain . Return to base . ' How are the Dalotek personnel ? 'They were shaken , but they 're fine now . 'The Moon Mobile is bringing them back . ' Right . You 'll have to use the amnesia procedure . 'I 'll take care of it . Out . ' All this . I see now why Commander Straker was so reluctant to have us up here . I 'd like to say , Colonel , that your position , everything you 've told me , it 's a safe secret with me . Have the amnesia shots been laid on for the Dalotek team ? We 'll administer them just before take-off , Colonel . I think I 'll get some rest . See you later . - Hello , Paul ! - Hi ! I wondered why they brought two coffee cups . - How do you feel ? - Fine . - Can I get you anything ? - No . - Paul , I wanted to apologise . - For what ? All the trouble we caused you , losing that Lunar Module . Come and sit down . - It wasn 't your fault . - There 's nothing we could have done ? It would have happened anyway . It was inevitable . We never did eat that fettuccine . We will . But when you 've forgotten about this . Forgotten ? The amnesia shots . But there 's nothing to worry about . Thank you . The Dalotek team stayed on for a couple more days . - You and Jane must have got close . - Why don 't you ask her ? Very funny . How does that old song go ? " Love 's more beautiful the second time around , just as wonderful with both feet on the ground . " Excuse me . Excuse me . I don 't think you know me , but my name 's Foster . Paul Foster . Now , I would say you are some kind of geologist . May I sit down ? Why , yes . How did you know I was a geologist ?

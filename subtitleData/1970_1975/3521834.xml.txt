 - What 's this ? - Controller 2957 's office . I thought we might find out what 's happened to Simon . - lf we 're caught . - We won 't be . You only decided to come because you were worried about 2957 . That 's not true. I let you come because you were in a state about Simon . I 've still the Community to think about . I can 't wander around like this . Look ! - They 're prisoners in those chairs . - Looks like it . I thought I might as well bring it along myself . Very well . You can release them for a little now . Now , let 's see what we 've got here . I told the chef to take it seriously . - lf we could find it ... - lt shouldn 't be too hard . I 'm afraid there 's some worrying news . There 's been a measurable change in the nitrogen content of the air . - Oh , no . - lt 's true . Readings taken an hour ago . Try and get some sound on the picture . Hang on . - You 've had confirmation from Europe ? - Yes. lt varies in places . But there 's a general consensus . - lt may be a temporary phenomenon . - lt better be . A shift in the nitrogen balance could have serious consequences for us all . Stop . Don 't move . No one 's advanced a viable theory yet . Argh ! - Argh ! - Come on ! Well , and who have we here ? Simon , wait a minute . That light , Alpha 16 . I told you. I heard that clones have a built-in weakness . With these ones , it 's sensitivity to bright light . What 's this place ? It 's part of the old building . Before the Ministry 's redesign . How did you know about it ? I saw Traynor here when he edited the tapes. I noticed how he got in and out . - This will be useful . Come on . - Simon , I can 't go . - Why not ? - You heard Alpha 16 . The change in the nitrogen content of the air. I 'm needed . Alpha Four is after your blood . There 's still me to explain . Take your chances . But I know what I 'd do in your position . Oh , for goodness ' sake , come on . That 's right . The girl from the jungle . Simon 's friend . - No ! - Don 't let 's waste time . - And the other young lady ? - She 's nothing to do with me . We met by accident . She was going to Birmingham . - Don 't be ridiculous . - Liverpool , then . - Oh , Liverpool 's not there any more . - Perhaps she 'd speak for herself . What makes you think I 'd have anything to say ... to a Technocrat ? Technocrat ? You don 't approve of the aims of the Ministry of Forward Development ? - l didn 't say that . - You oppose the Master Plan . - l didn 't say that either . - Like 2957 . - What ? - You know Controller 2957 . - A little. I met him ... once . - ln the jungle . - No . - Designation ? I 'm called Beth . - Well , well , without social registration . - Yes . A Misfit . So , Beth , what are you doing here , please ? You 'll speak in the end , even to a Technocrat . ( Groans ) - Wake up . - ( Groans ) Oh ! Oh ! The truth is you 're under the protection of Controller 2957 . - No . - You 've come for help . He supports your illegal life . - That isn 't true . - l 'll say . - What ? - He 's too selfish even to ... I mean ... Splendid . 17 , I think we might move along to the computer room . Just as you say , Four . If you please , this way . - 16 ! - The alarm . - What happened ? - 2957 and the boy escaped . ( Alarm bleeps ) It 's so difficult to move . Even to breathe . What was the sense in coming here anyway ? There 's nowhere else to go now . Only Beth . Anyway , there 's Liz . Oh , yes , there 's Liz and Beth . Why did you get so involved with her ? It 's made endless complications . It 's no good turning on me . You took up where l left off . Anyway , I like Liz . She 's ... Well , she 's ... Oh , I don 't know . If you hadn 't had that stupid test , we wouldn 't be in this mess . You mean we 'd be with the Misfits chipping away at stone ? And what 's wrong with that ? Nothing , I suppose . Nothing . It was such a bright future , Simon , for all of us . I was certain that the rational application of science could make a better world . But it hasn 't . Poor Beth. I haven 't been very kind to Beth , I 'm afraid . But then I 've never been very kind to anyone , really . Not even to poor old Traynor . Poor old Traynor ? Oh , yes . He hadn 't done that much wrong when I denounced him . Well , it was all part of the struggle for power . Just as Alpha Four had to strike out at me , so I had to bring Traynor down when I got the chance . You see , you changed more than you imagined when you took up a post in the Ministry of Forward Development . From a bright-eyed innocent into a ... Well , who can tell ? But you changed . ( Bleeping ) - Well , 17 ? - Operational , Four . Just checking phase circuits . Ah , our two Misfits . Thank you , 16 . That 'll be all . To all intents and purposes , this is just a chair . - Yes . - But it possesses other properties . These terminals , for instance , they link up to nerve passages in the brain . These clamps regulate pulse rates and control blood pressure . - l see . - A remarkable chair for its purpose . Tell me , about this misfit Community of yours ... I don 't believe I know any such Community . I simply want to know its location . - Perhaps the computer ... - What choice have you got ? You 'll never get back. I can turn you over to the authorities and you 'll go to jail . - But if you 'll help me ... - Yes , Alpha Four ? What then ? I may be able to hold things up for a while , a month perhaps , two even . - Ow ! - Leave her alone ! - Do you know what that chair 's for ? - No ! - lt 's a mind reconstructor . - l don 't understand . It 's used for clones who haven 't turned out true to type . They 're reduced to Deltas as a result . Readjusted to a lower scale of intelligence . Deltas don 't have much perception . Deltas never appreciate the finer things of life . Do we have to go to all that trouble in your case ? Or shall we just settle where the Community is and leave it at that ? - ( White noise ) - What 's the matter ? We must keep a constant watch on the jungle . ( Sighs ) I 'll have to open it up . Can you make it rain , too , Mr Technocrat , sir ? When our water barrel 's finally dry , can you fill it up again ? Hunters ? Controller 2957 . - Hello , Paul . - Simon , you 're back ! There 's hardly any water and we don 't know how to get more . - Did you see Beth and Liz ? - Aren 't they here ? - Haven 't been all evening . - Where did they go ? I 'm not sure. I thought they were going up to the conurbation . Something to do with you and Simon . ( 2957 ) To do with me and Simon ? In what way ? ( Simon ) Perhaps they 've been caught . ( 2957 ) Why go there ? It 's dangerous . They must have heard we were in trouble . - And gone to help us ? - Maybe . - But that 's idiotic ... Argh ! - Traynor . Charles Traynor . Once your superior , more lately your victim . - What are you doing here ? - Beth says he 's a friend now . - Traynor ? - ( Traynor ) This man betrays his friends . You want to be sold out , then trust him . You want to be deprived of your status . He 's been betrayed himself . - They 're denouncing me . - You ? - Yes . - You surprise me . - Stop ! - The trouble you 're in I created for you . As you probably realise . In revenge for what you did to me . - ( Vera ) Look ! - Look at the stars . They 're all bigger . Closer . The stars will drop from the firmament and the moon will turn to blood . The end ... and the beginning . ( Alpha Four ) Very well . This is your last chance . I want to know where your misfit Community is . There isn 't any Community . I don 't know what you mean . You must be very fond of Controller 2957 to defend him . Controller 2957 has nothing to do with it . I hardly know the man. I 'm anxious bec ... - Yes ? - Nothing . Other traitors . Others without social registration . It 's really foolish of you to resist for so long . - Will you speak now ? - No . Stand up , then . - Stand up ? - Yes . Move to one side . Liz , you take her place . - You can 't do that . - l beg your pardon ? It 's nothing to do with the younger girl . Why do you have to make it such a personal issue ? Do I have to remind you of our separate gradings ? - No . - There 's nothing irregular . - l can force her to surrender information . - l know that . Conduct Liz to the reconstructor and secure her . - That won 't be necessary . - Beth , you 've got to . - l can 't let anything happen to you . - But I don 't think anything can . - ( Alpha Four ) What do you mean ? - Could I speak to Beth alone ? No . You must think we 're very simple . Don 't think you can trick your way out of things . The barrier , Beth . People from the other side can 't come to any harm . That 's enough . Do you tell me what I want to know or do I put Liz on the reconstructor ? You put me on the reconstructor . Just as you wish . 17 . It 's a painless process , I 'm glad to say . We 've no desire to hurt anyone . Only the aftermath may prove difficult to bear . Beth . So we 're about to reduce you to Delta status of intelligence . First we apply an electronic block . This closes down memory functions so reconstitution becomes possible . 17 . - No , wait , I ... - Yes , Beth ? I 'll be all right , Beth . Truly . ( Bleeping ) No pain ? No . No , I 'm just ... That 's enough . Very good . Now , then , what 's your name ? My name is ... Liz . Very good . And why are you here ? I 'm ... I 'm not sure any more . Wait a minute . I can 't seem to ... Beth . Excellent . So we can proceed to stage two . This breaks down the power of imagination so you 're not able to associate as you used to . 17 . That 's enough. I 'll speak now . Why , Beth ? You shouldn 't . It 's all an illusion . I 'm sorry. I can 't take that chance . We 'll show him where the Community is . Why ? If you can hold out , so can I . Show him , dear . It 's a rather difficult location to describe , isn 't it ? We 'll just have to ... lead him there ? ( 2957 and Simon chatting , indistinct ) Oh , it 's crazy. lt 's so close . ( 2957 ) We must be ready for the testing . The end ... and the beginning . I just hope we 've got the right voltage . - What 's that ? - lt 's our secret weapon . - OK for a test ? - Stand by . - Simon , it works . - We 've done it . Make sure everything 's OK . Tighten it up . Science . Science creates and science destroys . The end is now ! The end is the beginning for those who serve science . I still don 't understand why this man is permitted to stay here . Isn 't he a proved traitor ? Beth will make up her mind about me when she gets back . I tried to apologise for what I 've done to you . - Perhaps it wasn 't as bad as it seemed . - Meaning ? You were as wrong as I was . So who have I harmed ? Haven 't I done both of us a good turn ? Our job now is to work together to help Beth . But she doesn 't serve science . Will she understand the new beginning ? The issue is still between the light and the darkness . - Just as it always was . - ( Vera ) Look ! ( 2957 ) Beth . ( Simon ) Alpha Four . Which way ? The northwesterly route is the quickest as the crow flies , but we 're not crows . And direct access means crossing the plain . - You don 't mean ... - Yes . The wide-open spaces . - Stop this . - The sun 's relentless rays . Where ? What are you talking about ? If we take the quickest route , we have to cross a bare patch of ground . So we 're looking for a cooler route . - lt is awfully hot . - All right . The question is do we bear west , turn sharp right and move northwesterly ? Or do we bear east , turn sharp left and then into a circle of north-northeast , so we eventually face north northwest ? Listen , if you don 't stop this game ... - Yes ? - ... I 'll take you to the conurbation . - You know the way ? - Keep them covered . Any more of this and we 'll dispose of you and never mind the Misfits . Tell you what , let 's split the difference and go northeast . Oh , that northeast . Beth , wait for me ! Don 't lose patience . We can play this game as long as they can . Beth must be leading them round in circles . - You know , I 've been thinking . - Oh ? What about ? Everything . The falling stars , for one thing . Stars don 't drop from the firmament . They look as if they 've moved closer because of the climactic conditions . That business of the falling nitrogen content of the air . - Beth 's video screen not working . - ( Twig snaps ) Yes . Video screen . Weak signal getting weaker . The most unusual climactic conditions . Why 's everything going wrong ? The mist over the southern Atlantic . - You pumped too much water . - Simon , I didn 't . The Master Plan was quite specific . 1 , 200 million gallons per day . You could get arrested for saying things like that . There must be a mistake . There 's a difference of 300 million gallons . It 's Traynor . He left instructions for 1 , 500 . Wait , what 's that ? - What ? - Over there , where the trees end . It looks like caves . We 've been here before . You 're leading us in circles . Listen to me . - No , don 't hurt her . - Be quiet ! You 're going to lead me to your Community . - So you can destroy them ? - Would you rather I destroyed you ? - Then you won 't find the Community . - l 've taken enough of this . Delta 32 . ( Breathes heavily ) Simon ? Simon , are you here ? - The Community , where is it ? - She 'll never tell you ! - Argh ! - ( 2957 ) Quickly , Beth . Don 't stop before they come round ! - But where did Vera go ? - Why worry about things like that ? The new world soon , boy . The new world . She should be here . We 've got to stick together . If they don 't rescue Beth from the hunters ... . - ( Chattering ) - Beth . - How the devil did you manage it ? - The lamp , it stopped the clones . - Stopped them ? - Didn 't you know ? Clones have a built-in weakness . These have a sensitivity to bright light . - ls that so ? - Yes . And how did you discover such a remarkable fact ? I just worked it out . Always so clever , Simon . ( Groans ) ( Vera ) Simon ? Simon , where are you ? Simon ? Simon , it 's me , Vera . ( Screams ) ( Beth ) Caves ? You say you found some caves ? ( 2957 ) Yes . They 're on the western edge of the jungle . They 're deep and cool and there 's water . - Water ? - Just a trickle , but we could work on it . The Community could hole up there for months . We might be able to start fungus cultures , produce food . We ? You keep saying we . Well , yes , Beth . Yes . You see , well , I 've always been truthful to you , haven 't I ? Yes. I think so . Though it was always your kind of truth . Then will you believe me now ? No matter what Traynor says , I 'm not a traitor . I 've come here in all sincerity because I can no longer believe in the Master Plan . It has misled us all , except you here in the Community . I thought it would save the world . That the trees and flowers and a few Misfits didn 't matter , but they do . The Plan would destroy them . We must save the Community before it 's too late . But before you wouldn 't help at all . That 's when I still believed in the Plan , Liz . But now I see it 's all been a great error . What was meant to save the world has destroyed it . Oh ! ( Screaming ) - Vera ! - Simon ! I was looking for you and they found me and made me bring them here . The light ! - What did you do that for ? - Nothing must stand in the way , Simon . The Master Plan is supreme . Alpha Four , you certainly took your time getting here . Traynor , once your controller in chief . I am resuming command .

 - OK ? - All clear . - Launch stations . - Launch stations ! Good luck , Colonel . Liftoff minus 10 . Sky 1 to Skydiver Control , airborne . 'Roger , Sky 1 . ' Replacement Sky 1 approaching rendezvous . 'Roger , Sky 1 . Have begun docking procedure . You 've got a great crew there , Captain . It 's been a privilege working with you . 'We 've enjoyed your company , sir . Have a good furlough . ' Don 't worry , I really plan to let my hair down . # Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner # But he knew it couldn 't last # Jojo left his home in Tucson , Arizona # For some California grass # Get back # Get back ... # Paul ! - Excuse , me just a minute . - OK . - I 'm glad you could make it ! - Hi , Sylvia . - A bit late for introductions . - I 've got some catching up to do . Let 's start with a drink . - What do you like ? - Scotch . Good night , Sylvia . Good night , Paul . - Good night . - I 'll walk you to the door . Fix yourself a drink . Good night , Sylvia . Thanks for the lovely party . Is this what you 're looking for ? It 's a great party . Looks like it . What 's the time ? 4 : 30 . D 'you know , I 've got to be up around 07 : 00 tomorrow . You poor little thing . 4 : 30 ... 5 : 30 ... 6 : 30 ... Do you know what you need ? An alarm clock . - Here 's your coffee , Keith . - That 's just what I needed . Good morning , sir . 'Moonbase to Control : sighting . 'Area red 042-184 . ' - ' How does it look , Lieutenant ? ' - Awaiting confirmation . Hi ! Hello ! Franklin . Joe Franklin . Missile technician . Don 't tell me , it 's ... Ford ? Fraser ? Foster ? Paul Foster . Glad to meet you , Colonel . I knew it had to begin with F. These poops are going through the entire alphabet . Everything from Aaron to Zazinsky . Yeah , I hear everybody in SHADO has to go through it . Right . 'Colonel Paul Foster , report to room 17 on the first floor . ' I think you 're first in line , sir . You 're FO , I 'm FR . See you in the fun palace . 'UFO 428 . Speed : 1,5 million miles per second . 'Bearing : positive . Course : 017-234 red . ' Confirmed . UFO on positive track . Red alert . Interceptors , immediate launch . Interceptors , immediate launch . Moonbase to Control , we have a positive sighting . - Estimate trajectory termination . - Yes , sir . Have you ever contracted scarlet fever , mumps , measles , chickenpox ? - Yes . - Yes ? - I had measles . - How old were you ? 4 . Or was it 5 ? Getting plenty of sleep , Colonel ? Oh , yes . Most of the time . After 2 weeks here you 'll feel on top of the world . It could be better , Foster . Keep it up , Rowan . We 'll soon get rid of that , won 't we , Franklin ? Course ? 017 , 348 , 101 . - Speed ? - SOL 0,5 , reducing . Program computers for missile firing sequence . '1837 , 024 . ' Program complete . Missile firing : 18,4 . - Great place . - A giggle a nanosecond . I can 't wait to leave . Some workout . Yeah . And this is only the first day . Come on , gentlemen , one of you into the bath . That 's just what I could do with . And I 'm first : O before R. Right . You reckon you 're ready for this ? It 's a sauna bath . Moonbase for you , sir . Go ahead , Lieutenant . 'We have the UFO termination fix . 'Southern England , grid reference 4706 . ' Yes , ground radar gave us the same information , Lieutenant . 'How badly was it damaged ? ' Interceptors scored a probable hit but the UFO maintained its course . Lieutenant , maintain Moonbase on full red alert . If that UFO breaks cover I want it destroyed . - Keep me informed . - ' Roger and out . ' - Are the mobiles moving in ? - Yes , sir . Nothing of significance here , Alec . The research centre is 15 miles away . Aliens wouldn 't travel a billion miles to visit a health farm , - even if it is run by SHADO . - Didn 't Foster check in there ? - Colonel Foster . - Yes . - Get me Dr Fraser at that centre . - Yes , sir . Radio contact negative , sir . - Well , keep trying . - Yes , sir . - Get over there , Alec . Fast . - Right . We 've just landed . I couldn 't see any activity . Alec , the men from the mobiles have the place surrounded . 'Hold them back , I 'll move in with the helicopter crew . Out . ' Let 's go . You wait here . Come with me . You wait there ! - Are you certain ? - ' We 've searched the centre . 'Everyone 's dead and there 's no trace of Foster . ' There 's only one answer , Alec . He 's been taken ... by the aliens . Steer 128 , maintain present speed . 128 it is , sir . 'Control to Skydiver : I have Commander Straker for you . ' - Waterman here , sir . - ' Captain Waterman , 'I have some news ... It concerns Colonel Foster . 'I 'm afraid we must assume that he is in the hands of the aliens . - ' Did you read me , Captain ? ' - Yes . Sir , what happened ? 'The research centre was attacked . Colonel Foster is officially missing . 'That UFO is still in the area . Maintain Sky One on full red alert , - ' ready for an interception . ' - Yes , sir . How can a thing like this happen ? We work on the assumption that Colonel Foster is alive . OK ? This is supposed to be an operational alert . Let 's get to it . Maximum speed ! Seal all water locks ! Control to Skydiver , remain on standby for emergency launch . Well ? What are his chances ? - Oh , come on , Alec ... - Just tell me what you have in mind . When that UFO lifts off the ground radar should find it . - And ? - We destroy it . Knowing that Paul Foster is almost certainly aboard ? That 's right . You just better hope I 'm never in a position to press the button on you . How do you know he 's even still alive , Alec ? ! Look , Paul Foster 's a highly trained , dedicated , courageous officer . But he knows the entire SHADO setup . Yes , he 's trained to resist interrogation , but what gentle means of persuasion will they use to chack him ? No , Alec , if we destry that UFO Paul Foster loses his life , quick and clean . If we don 't get it , God knows what will happen to him . 'Commander , we have a radar trace . ' Do we have a fix ? Computer triangulates reference 124-048 . Speed ? - 800 knots , accelerating . - That must be it . Where is Skydiver ? - Here , sir . - Compute . Roger . Looks like we could intercept around here . Where 's that readout ? It looks good . - Signal Sky 1 : immediate launch . - Yes , sir . Launch stations . Check boosters 1 , 2 , 3 ! Clear 1 ! '1 and 2 clear . ' Liftoff stations . Liftoff minus 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 . Sky 1 to Control : airborne . We have you on positive track , Sky 1 . Set onboard computer for interception course . Check the UFO 's airspeed . Yes , sir . - 1,500 knots . - What 's its rate of climb ? 10,4 mpm . Maybe it 's more damaged than we thought . Let 's hope so . I have it on radar . Range , 29 miles , closing . He must get it . It 's a sitting duck ! Have visual contact . Setting missile firing sequence . " You 've got great crew there , Captain . " " It 's been a privilege working with you . " Missile launch : minus 10 seconds . 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 ... zero . How the blazes did he miss it ? ! Get me Lieutenant Ellis ! Excellent visibility . Positive radar tracking . Positive infrared homing signal . If I thought that Captain Waterman ... Had any emotion for a man he 's been serving with for 2 months ? Moonbase for you , sir . Lieutenant Ellis , what are the chances of interception by Moonbase ? 'None al all , sir . UFO 's leaving earth on an antilunar trajectory . ' Beyond your range . Well , keep tracking it and report any change . 'Roger and out . ' - Prepare to receive Cap . Waterman . - Yes , sir . Open bulkhead . Range , 26 million , receding . Lieutenant ? It can 't be . Check it , and tell Control . How long is this going to take ? Is it or isn 't it ? It 's complex , sir . Times , courses , trajectories , the interplay of G-forces . 'Result sequence : trajectory 042-326 cyclic . 'Lunar G variable : 7 / 5,4 . 'Computer predicted power loss : 70 % . 'Orbit fading : 0,4 GRT . 'Predict impact lunar grid reference : B-182 . ' Moonbase to Control : positive . Thank you , Lieutenant . So the UFO 's headed for the moon . Yes , it hasn 't the power to escape the lunar G-force . It must have been damaged . You were asking about Foster 's chances of survival . They 've improved . They must be down to a million to one . UFO still maintaining its trajectory . 'Good . As long as it 's heading for the moon , do nothing . 'But if it manages to develop enough power to escape , destroy it . ' The astronauts can be spaceborne in seconds . - ' Keep me informed , Lieutenant . ' - Roger and out . Do we have a closer fix on where it 's gonna land ? Yes , grid reference 182-084 . That 's about 40 kilometres . I 'm going out there . - Tell Moon Mobile 1 to stand by . - Yes , Lieutenant . We 'll be there in 8 minutes . - Keep me informed of its progress . - ' Yes , Lieutenant . ' - We 're in position . - ' Confirmed . Two minutes to impact . ' 60 seconds . '50 . ' 40 . '30 . '20 . ' There it is . - It 's gonna crash . - ' Ten , nine , 'eight , seven , 'six , five , 'four , three , 'two , one ... ' - Would you ask Jackson to come in ? - ' Yes , sir . ' Well , what 's the situation ? I 've just spoken with Moonbase , it 's very difficult . Colonel Foster 's general physical condition is satisfactory , considering what he 's just been through . But he 's in an alien spacesuit , he 's breathing liquid . We can transfer him to normal breathing . Come on , you 've done it before . Yes , with aliens , Alec . And none have survived more than a few hours . It 's an extremely hazardous operation . We 've by no means perfected the technique . There 's another difficulty . Here at SHADO headquarters we 've every facility . On Moonbase the equipment is naturally more crude . Well , I 'll be monitoring the operation by videolink . If you 'll excuse me . You 'll have to help me with the helmet . Listen , Alec , Paul Foster 's in top physical shape . He 's an expert skin-diver , used to underwater pressure . You think that background may help ? Well , I 'm no doctor , but it must be an advantage . You could be right : strong lungs , good respiratory system . Sure . He 'll pull through . Come on . We 're all set here , sir . 'Right . Now , listen carefully . 'As I see it , 'the main problem will be panic when the helmet is removed . 'Colonel Foster has been breathing liquid for some hours now . ' Drugs will have been used to help his lungs adapt . When we attempt to reverse to normal , the physical experience will be similar to drowning . 'Unless this moment is carefully controlled , 'he could go into convulsions and possibly choke . ' Let the Colonel know the situation . If you can hear me , nod your head . We 're going to remove your helmet . Try and maintain your rhythm of breathing . Whatever happens , don 't panic . Do you understand ? What is that ? 2 cc of Petracol . It should help , I hope . - ' Is the resuscitator ready ? ' - Yes , sir . 'All right , Lieutenant , begin . ' Take hold of him . Now . 'Hold him , he could rupture his lungs ! ' Hold him down ! Stop him struggling ! Relax . Breathe deeply . That 's it . Nice and relaxed . How 's the breathing now ? Better . Just take it easy . How do you feel ? Fine . - What happened ? - You passed out for a few minutes . - A few minutes ? - Here , drink this . Colonel , have you been burning the candle at both ends recently ? There was a party last night . A sauna can be helpful , but there 's one rule : never take one if you 're feeling under the weather . I should 've told you . All right , Colonel , you 're in good shape . You 'll be in even better shape when you leave here . Tomorrow we 'll get down to some real work . Good luck . # Beautiful dreamer , wake unto me # # Starlight and dewdrops ... # # Beautiful dreamer , wake unto me # # Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee # - Who 's the voice ? - In the dreambox . Dreambox ? That 's Colonel Foster . He had a lulu in there yesterday . Come on , Franklin ! If all else fails I 'll remove that blubber surgically . # Gone are the cares of life 's busy throng # # Beautiful dreamer , come wake unto me

 Million Dollar Duck Albert Dooley , the student voted most likely to succeed of the class of 1959 . You lovely big success , Albert . Daddy ? Daddy ! Excuse me . Yeah , what is it , son ? Here 's a puppy Eddie said he 'd give me . - He 's a cute one . - For only 50 dollars . Fifty dollars ? He has his own pedigree . That price he oughta have his own car . I already picked out a name for him ... Charlie . Good , hah ? Yeah , that 's fine , but that 's ... I mean , 50 dollars , you know , it 's ... Well , there are licences and vets and shots and ... Think of all the food ! I 'd share my food with him . No , Jimmy . Small boys need all the nourishment they can get . You 're not a small boy . You could share your food . Maybe next year , okay , Jim ? I 'll get a job . Rent my room , I 'll sleep in the garage with Charlie . Please , daddy . I 'm sorry , Jim . I thought you and I were pals . We are pals , pal , but ... Where am I gonna get 50 bucks ? I can 't even pay these bills . Here , Eddie . Take him . Bye , Charlie . Jimmy ! Pal ? Cinnamon . A bit of cinnamon . Where 's the cinnamon ? I just ... Now , it 's cinnamon . Mustard . Mustard . Curry powder . And , Garlic . Garlic ? There must be a simpler way to make apple sauce . - Katie ! - Yes , dear ? That was Herman and the Purple Cows . We have to have another talk about economising . First guess what I 'm cooking . Three guesses . - Later , okay ? - Try , plum pudding . - Plum pudding . - Wrong . Try apple sauce . Katie , we have to economise . That 's what I 'm doing . I 'm making home-made apple sauce with apples off our tree . - That 's fine . - Taste it . Tell me if you think it 's too ... .. too ingredient . That 's good . It 's really ... It 's really good . You think you should 've peeled the apples first ? Oh , no , see , that 's where all your vitamins are . And the seeds too ? Albert , you should know . You 're the scientist . Katie ... Now , there must be someplace ... that we can cut down . - This bill from the dress shop ... - I know where we can cut down . - Where ? - Your lunch money . What ? Albert , it makes no sense spending money , when you have a wife who could pack you a nice lunch . Darling , that 's too much bother for you to go to every morning . - To get up ... - Oh , pooh . What is a wife for ? It 's just a part of our marriage vows . To love and obey , till death do us in . Thank you , darling . Don 't tip your lunch . The apple sauce is on top . Bye , sweetie . Daddy , Eddie says this is my last chance . - Your last chance for what , pal ? - For Charlie . - Who ? - The puppy . Don 't bother your father with that now . He 's got little enough on his mind as it is . Mr. Hooper next door , he has a dog . He can afford to feed it . It 's a big one . Mr. Hooper works for the US Treasury , and they have our money . He could afford a giraffe . - Finley ! - Giraffe ! Bye , pal . Oh , dear ! I wish this fool professor made enough money so I could investigate him . Mornin ' , Fred . - Why not drop a bomb on us , Arvin ? - It 'd be quicker . Don 't blame us . It was you old cats who invented the internal combustion engine . Peace . You 're a lawyer . Do something about those Wadlow boys . - Something legal , preferably . - Did you say legal or lethal ? Either way , I 'll take the case . I 'll take any case . - I need some rent money . - You too ? Sometimes I wish I 'd been born rich instead of brilliant . Mornin ' . Morning , group . Velma . Are you awake and ready ? Arnold , wake up . You two behave yourselves today . Clyde . You ready for a big day ? Very good . Mr. Duck . Are you gonna shape up today ? For me ? Please ? Good . If you flunk any more of those tests , you 're gonna be a gone goose . Another dropout performance like yesterday , you 'll have Dr. Gottlieb climbing the walls . He takes a dim view of any duck ... that doesn 't know a yellow button from a red one . Be quiet . What 's the matter ? Good . You 're eating the apple sauce . You like it ? I knew you were weird , but that 's ridiculous . You must have got your share too ? - I 'll get you a bicarb of soda . - Dooley ! - Professor Dooley . - Dr. Gottlieb . - What are you doing ? - I 'm ready . You realise how far back you 're putting the schedule ? - I 'm sorry . - What 's the matter with the chimp ? He 's nervous . - Nervous ? - About the tests . Well , get on with it . - No duck ! - What ? - No duck . - But the schedule calls ... - Revise it . - Sir , I feel if we test him ... Do you know what the data is on the learning potential test for that ... - Minus eleven . - It might be a slow learner . - Slow ? - Yes , sir . This duck could shed new light on the rates of learning for various animals . All right . But it 's his last chance ! Thank you , sir . Last ! I understand . You hear that ? You gotta shape up ... You got apple sauce all over your face . Come here . Took him ten seconds last time . Let 's see if he 'll do better . Excellent . Well , Mr. Pig , what are you gonna show us today ? Beautiful ! Superb . No , Dooley . That duck couldn 't begin to handle these tests . Over here . This is the simplest device we 've got . The duck had 49 hours of practice on this one , so it 's time we see results . Okay , duck , go for the yellow button , the centre . He 's got it . Get that stupid duck out of here ! Wait a minute . Just one more time . Just one more time . For what ? He 's useless , completely unresponsive . All right , fella , once more . Yellow button , centre . You don 't give up . - There he goes for the red button again . - No , he 's got it now . At least he 's reacting . All right , get that misfit out of here . Dr. Gottlieb , you have to admit that 's an interesting reaction . This duck is a fascinating creature . What have we got here ? Gamma rays on what ? Testing some new high-resistant silicone oils . - Phenyl type ? - Yeah . What is the integrated threshold neutron flux ? - What do you mean by that ? - What ? Well , you said , Quack . I didn 't say quack . Holy cow ! Professor . Is this one of your creatures ? - Yes , how did she get in there ? - You tell me . You almost had fried duck . Well ... is she okay ? Sure , no harm . Just got a little jolt . But would you please keep your friends out of our department ? Yeah , okay . Boy , you really blew it today . Only thing to do now is find you a home for retired dropouts . A duck ? Yeah , that 's what it is . A duck . But I want a puppy . I don 't want a dumb old duck . I didn 't bring it home for a pet . Then why 'd you bring it ? It was that or let the janitor 's wife fricassee it . - It was a washout at the lab . - Wouldn 't a puppy be as cheap to feed ? - We 're not gonna keep it . - He really had his heart set on a puppy . Katie , now , we 've been through all of that . I 'm just trying to find a home for this poor , stupid duck . Maybe that farmer would take it , the one that sells us those vegetables I can 't afford . - You mean Mr. Gilby ? - Yeah , I guess so . You 're mixed up . Mr. Gilby is the bakery truck man . - Mr. Purdham is the vegetable man . - Well , Purdham . Okay . Give it to him . It 'll have a good home on his farm . - Probably eat better than we do . - Hey , daddy ! I think he likes me . Watch how he follows me . Come on . How would you like a real great name ? You like that ? Maybe I can teach him some tricks . Him ? Good luck . Albert ! I was just thinking . Good for you . Yeah , instead of giving that duck to Mr. Purdham , maybe Jimmy could trade it in on a puppy . - We settled all that . - I know . But it wouldn 't cost you anything , and it might help ... Never mind . I shouldn 't even mention it . - Mention what ? - Oh , nothing . I 'm sure you 'll solve it . OK , Katie solve what ? The generation gap you 're creating between Jimmy over this puppy . Katie . Come on , Katie . Honey , you know Jimmy and I have a very good , close relationship . Of course you do , Albert . That 's why I didn 't even mention it . Daddy , daddy ! Help ! Help ! Daddy , help ! - He 's gonna kill Charlie ! - What ? Get outta here ! - Leave that duck alone . - Get out of my yard ! - That 's our duck . - Well , get him out of my pool . Get your hands off my skimmer ! - Charlie ! - Jimmy , be careful . I got you now , you duck-billed intruder ! Get your hands off of my skimmer . Attaboy , Charlie ! Get that bird off my slide ! - Stop that dog ! - Go , Charlie ! Bite him in the tail feathers . Don 't let him get away from you . Come here , duck . If that dog lays a tooth on that duck ... Take your skimmer ... - Hooper , let go ! - You 're gonna drown him ! Come here , duck ! I 'll report you to the SPCIA . Call your dog , Hooper ! Get this duck out of the pool . He 's contaminating it . Get your dirty shoes out of my pool ! Why , you hit my husband ! Come here , Jimmy . Take the duck . Hurry . Now hold on . - Climb up the stairs . - Come on ! Albert , hurry . - Come on ! - Go on ! Hurry before the dog gets out . Oh , sic ' em ! Go ! Give ' em a good one . Go get ' em , Duke . Finley ! What are you doing in there with your clothes on ? Can 't leave you alone for a minute . Look , daddy . Charlie laid an egg ! Why , Charlie , you 're a mama ! Twins ! Four eggs . Isn 't that something ? I don 't see how she laid any eggs with that beast barking at her . It was that beast that caused her to do it . Now , Albert , they hardly know each other . No , I mean ... I know what you mean . Don 't discuss it in front of our S-O-N . We learned that stuff in school anyway . No . It 's a conditioned reflex , you see ? When the dog barks , the duck lays an egg . I do not know why . It happened once at the lab . That 's not the way my mother explained it to me . Anyway , the important thing is ... the money we 're gonna save growing our eggs . We 're not eating those eggs . I mean , this duck , it 's strange . No , it 's an aberration , a biological mutation . It is ? That 's a chemically mixed-up duck . It 's even been radiated and ... We 're not eating those eggs . Good . Then we 'll hatch ' em . Is that all right ? Hatching them ? No . They probably wouldn 't hatch anyway . Only thing to do is bury ' em , which I 'll do after Jimmy goes to sleep . Albert ? - What the devil are you doing ? - Nothing . Digging a hole at midnight in your pyjamas is nothing ? You know , I 'm digging . - For what ? - Night crawlers . They certainly lay big eggs . Go to bed . You 're a nut . - Dooley ? - Yes , Dr. Gottlieb . - You wanted to see me ? - Yes , a research problem . Come on . Sit down . - Well ? - Dr. Gottlieb , is it possible ... In science , anything is possible . Yes , but could radiation alter the molecular structure of a ... substance ... from organic to inorganic ? So we 're a radiobiologist now , are we , Dooley ? Just a minute . Yeah . Try these for starters . - Actually , all I wanted to know ... - The answer is yes . - But what substance ? - Like an egg . - What kind of an egg ? - Doesn 't ... Chicken , turkey , duck . - Please don 't mention duck to me . - Sorry . Anyway , your experiment has been done . In 1903 . It was a young medical student at the Royal Viennese Hospital . His name was Schultz or Schmaltz . Here . Schwartz . In searching for a chemical background for radiogenic inflammation from radium , Gottwald Schwartz exposed an egg to becquerel rays . Both the organic and inorganic molecules suffered a change . Yes , yes . There was no change in the white of the egg , No . but there was conspicuous change in the yolk . The yolk ! That 's it ! I mean , that 's ... quite interesting . Didn 't ... change it into any kind of ... metal , did it ? Metal ? What do you want , Dooley , gold ? Well , you said anything was possible . Possible , yes . But ... making a golden egg ? That 's for Aesop 's Fables , isn 't it ? But gold has been made synthetically , hasn 't it ? Yes , with nuclear bombardment , but we know what that costs , don 't we ? - It doesn 't pay . - No . Excuse me . Dr. Gottlieb . I 'll be right there . Excuse me . I have to go recheck the IQ of the chimp . Hundred and forty . Higher than mine . We 've run quite a few tests on that metal of yours . - Yes , and ... - Darndest thing we ever ran across . - But is it ... - You won 't believe this report . - Well , it 's wild . - Then it 's not ... Look here , Dooley . The metal contains traces of D-galacturonic acid . Now , isn 't that wild ? You know what that is . That 's pectin . Pectin ? Pectin that 's been hydrolysed under intense heat . Pectin comes from apple peelings . Apple sauce . No , it 's true . And look , it also has a trace of garlic in it . I don 't wanna hear any more . As long as it 's not gold . What do you mean , is not gold . It 's practically pure gold . What ? But it has some of the weirdest impurities in it . There is one element we can 't identify , not related to any of the 103 basic known chemical elements . Mr. Dooley , you didn 't get hold of a moon rock , did you ? Moon rock ? Me ? No . I 've never even been out of California . - Where 'd you dig up this gold ? - Dig ? I didn 't dig . - A placer deposit ? - Yes , it was deposited , you might say . - Thank you very much . - Wait a second . - You want your report ? You paid for it . - Yes . The report . Thank you very much . So this is an assayer 's report . So what ? That 's why I need a lawyer , to help me incorporate . Incorporate what ? Fred , that sample is the yolk of a duck egg . Come on . I know how incredible this must sound to your legal mind , but in 1903 a Viennese scientist ... You ever read Aesop 's Fables , the one about the goose ? Should you be driving in your condition ? I 'm telling you , Fred , that fable may be scientifically feasible . - Pull over , Albert . I 'll drive . - Okay , sceptic . I 'm gonna show you one of those gold eggs actually being laid . Watch out ! You crazy , ding-a-ling driver , Orlo ! I 'm not even in the car . That 's Arvin . Bigot ! Now , you just lie there and relax , Finley . Forget all about that nasty , old treasury office . Thank you , dear . You 're a good person . Come on , Fred . I 'll get the duck , make Hooper 's dog bark at it , and you 'll see . Would you please go upstairs and talk to Jimmy ? Not now . I 've got news . Our financial worries are over . Jimmy 's broken-hearted because I was ... . You 're not listening . We 're gonna be rich beyond our wildest dreams . Oh , I always knew you 'd make good , even when Papa kept saying , Don 't marry that no-good , lazy ... It 's nothing I did . It 's Charlie . Remember those eggs I was gonna bury ? Brace yourself . They 're gold . Well , don 't look that way . I 'm not kidding you . - It 's true . - Albert , I believe you . - What 's the matter ? - I gave the duck to Mr. Purdham . You told me to ! I was sorry I did . Jimmy 's been crying . Where does Purdham live ? - I 'm not sure . - Think ! I 'm trying . - Where does Purdham live ? - Try the cookie jar . - The cookie jar . - Where I keep my addresses . Oh ! We 've gotta find that duck ... before anything happens to it . Chicken chow mein . But I ... Purdham ! Oak Road . Come on ! Get in the car , Fred ! Daddy , wait ! Well , look , I guess I could ... give you five dollars for it . Well , I ... I know I never turn down a good deal . You 'll find the duck in the pen back of the barn yonder . Thanks . Hello , Mr. Purdham . Oh , no ! There 's gotta be a million of ' em ! Charlie . Where are you ? This duck doesn 't respond to normal things , like its name . - You know what we need ? - A good psychiatrist . No . We need something it does respond to . Start barking , Fred ! It 's our only chance . Bark ! Wait a minute . What am I doing ? A sane adult with a law degree crawling around a barnyard , barking at fowls , trying to find a duck who lays solid gold ... Solid gold eggs ! I 'll never see Charlie again . Come on . We 're not gonna give up till we 're licked . We 'll find him . Charlie ? Where are you goin ' ? They 're gettin ' away from us ! Come on , Fred ! Get out ! Get back there . Go back , ducks . - They 're in the pond . - Head ' em off ! Back , you ducks ! Get back , ducks . Get them out of the water . Shove them back onto the shore . Here . What 's goin ' on ? You said only one duck . But something happened to the gate . Get these critters back in the pen . Get back ! Charlie ! Charlie ! Oh , Charlie ! Daddy , daddy ! I found Charlie ! Hey , wait . Come back ! Help me . - I knew I 'd find her . - You sure it 's her , son ? I know it is . It 's Charlie . There 's one way to find out . Hold her on the ground , Fred . Maybe only Hooper 's dog can do it . No reflection on you , dear . Why , Albert , you don 't sound like Hooper 's dog at all . He goes more like ... I think she 's got it . Pitch . It might be a matter of pitch . Come on . Dear , Charlie . What do you think now , sceptic ? Baby ... you 're lookin at a believer . Figuring its weight in troy ounces , at the pegged gold price , that 's over 900 bucks a yolk . - That 's right . - And if she laid four eggs in ... - How long did you say ? - About ten minutes . That would be over 20,000 dollars an hour . And if she worked a six-hour day , give or take a couple of coffee breaks ... corn breaks ... Al , baby , we 're talkin ' about a 100,000 dollars-a-day business ! That 's right . If I can find the formula to keep her producing . Oh , you 'll do it . You 'll do it . The big problem is : How do we legally protect our fortune ? Our fortune ? What do you mean , our fortune ? Look , Al , sweetheart , I 'm only trying to save you money . By making me a partner , you 'll save paying me exorbitant lawyer 's fees . I 'll have to devote full-time , incorporating a duck and not have the Internal Revenuers on our neck . - I got your clothes all nice and dry for you . - Oh , fine . How did you manage to do this , Katie ? - It was no trouble , really . - Thanks . Anyway , the thing to do is to sit tight until I figure things out . And don 't tell anybody about this , especially ... - Hooper ? - Right . We don 't want that government stool pigeon snooping around . The first thing I 'm gonna do is get rid of that junk I 'm driving . I saw the most fantastic yellow sports car . Hold it ! Don 't spend any of that money yet . - What ? - No changes in your living standards . - You mean , not pay our bills ? - Bills , fine . We can 't raise suspicions until we get this legally protected . Now ... Let 's try and get some sleep . Or ... do you think we oughta get the duck and bark out a few more thou ? The duck 's asleep with Jimmy , and I don 't want Jimmy disturbed . And , Fred ... don 't forget to bring my robe back . - That 's not part of the deal . - Okay ... partner . Albert , do you think now we can afford to reshingle our house ? Reshingle our house ? We could reshingle the Pentagon . We could buy the Pentagon . Well , what would we do with it ? I 'm only trying to give you an idea of our potential . We have what other men have only dreamed of . It 's kinda scary , isn 't it ? You bet it is . Albert , how rich will we be ? So rich that we could not possibly spend it all . - We could try . - Wait a minute . - I just want to help all I can . - That 's fine . Don 't get carried away . We must keep our sense of values . Aesop 's Fable warns us against avarice . - Against who ? - Greed , greed . Fellow in the fable , he let greed destroy him . We 're gonna play it cool , keep our feet on the ground . Albert . What ? Let 's take our cool feet and go to bed . OK , honey . Cute . You oughta close the window . He might catch cold . Good idea . Now what ? Some sense of values . What do you mean ? Boy , he sure was right . - Who was ? - You know . I do ? Aesop ! Jimmy , your lunch . Be sure and take good care of Charlie while I 'm gone . Don 't worry , I will . Now , run along . And don 't let Mr. Hooper 's dog get him either . Jimmy , hurry up . You 're gonna be late for school . Yes . Who ? The bank . Hi . Bad cheques ? Well , you printed them . How could a big bank like you have insufficient funds and stay in business ? No , no Mrs. Dooley . Not us , you . We 've explained that you cannot write cheques for more money than you have . You can be arrested for that . No , please don 't do that . Please don 't call Mr. Dooley . I can get the money . But could you hold on the phone a minute ? Mr. Meaker , I ... I guess you 'll just have to call my husband about that ... Wait . I 'll be right down . And what is this ? I 'm overdrawn , and that 's to un-overdraw me . Yes , you are overdrawn . But what is this thing ? Thing ? That 's gold , worth over 900 troy ounce dollars . And that 's my deposit slip for it . - You recognise that , don 't you ? - One moment , please . - Next , please . - This way , please . What kind of a bank is this anyway ? Sit down . Mrs. Dooley , we can hardly take a trinket for a deposit . Trinket ? Haven 't you bankers ever heard of gold ? Mrs. Dooley , even if that were gold bullion , there 's nothing I can ... Bullion ? Processed gold as distinguished from raw gold . The only thing we can do with this is turn it over to the Federal Reserve . That wouldn 't do very much for your account , would it ? I should say not . I 'll just take it to another bank . They 'll have to do the same thing . The only possible place you can take that is to a refinery . Refinery ? - Hi . - Hi , honey . Where 'd you get the hat ? What hat ? Oh , now , Albert , it was on sale . If you wrote a check for that hat , we 're overdrawn again . No , we 're not . I deposited over 900 dollars today . - Where did you get 900 dollars ? - From the refinery . You haven 't been in the eggs ? No , not those . Charlie laid one for me . Well , why did you take it to the refinery ? The bank told me to . The bank ? You took it to the ... Well , did you tell the newspapers too ? Well , no , Albert , just the bank . They said if I didn 't cover my bad cheques , I was gonna be arrested . - Would you rather I got arrested ? - No . Some husband . He wants his wife in jail . Didn 't you hear Fred say not to tell anybody and not to spend the money ? But what 's the use of having it ? Hi , partners . - Don 't tell him what I did . - What did she do ? Sold an egg to a refinery . - Good - What ? That 's all we can do . We don 't have a licence to handle gold . - Then get us a license . - Oh , sure . Can you see going to the US Treasury Department and saying , I 'd like a gold licence for my duckie who lays gold eggs ? I understand what you mean . Couldn 't Hooper get it ? He works for the US Treasury . He 'd confiscate our duck so fast , it 'd singe its feathers off . - Get all the gold off the premises . - Why ? Federal gold regulations . You could get ten years for hoarding . Read this . We 'll have to think up a good story to tell the refineries . Why ? You try to peddle gold duck eggs , they 'll lock you up in the nut farm . Well , I did it , and they didn 't lock me up . Yes , but you 're ... Wait a minute . You didn 't tell them where the gold came from , did you ? Well , he asked me . Now the whole world will be after that duck . - What did he say when you told him ? - He just laughed . Laughed ? He just ... laughed ? Do you hear that , Albert ? He just laughed ! Don 't you see ? She solved our whole problem . She can tell them the truth , they 'll never believe it . They won 't lock her up , no matter how nutty it sounds . - Listen , sweet hard ... - No , Fred . I 'm not so sure I want my wife ... - What is that , Fred ? A new suit ? - Ah ! Listen , sweetheart . Here 's a list of refineries . Don 't sell too many eggs at one time . Fred , what have you ... You got a new briefcase too . It 's nothing , Al baby . Keep moving around refineries , otherwise it might look suspicious . Got it . Could I buy some new clothes to wear for this ? Oh , no . No , no , no . We mustn 't spend the money . - Mrs. Dooley ? - Yes . This is exceptionally high-grade ore . - Our cashier is making a cheque for you . - Thank you . These nuggets are very interesting . - Identical size and shape . - Yes , I noticed that . I was curious as how they got that way . Would you believe a duck laid them ? A duck laid ' em ? - What kind of duck was that ? - A white one . A white one . A little white duck . - Thank you very much . - Thank you . Mrs. Dooley , listen . About these nuggets ... I really have to dash . Bye-bye . - We don 't have your address . - That 's all right . I have it . Treasury Department ? This is Carter down at Alco . I got something really odd here . You might want to check it out . Beauty . What 's the price of that car ? 7,995 dollars . - It 's not even a dozen eggs . - I beg your pardon ? Nothing . You wouldn 't happen to have a layaway plan ? - Hardly . - I didn 't think so . Well , I can 't buy it now , but , I 'll be back . According to the phone calls ... that have been pouring into this US Treasury Department office , this map represents certain refineries that have been receiving these ... odd gold nuggets . And we don 't know who the gang is , but , undoubtedly , it 's an underworld operation . Why would they be spreading those nuggets around all those various refineries ? You figure it 's Mafia-controlled , Chief ? - Probably something worse . - Worse ? Gentlemen , they may have learned how to make gold . Well , that 's not very probable . That can only be done by atomic bombardment , and the cost is prohibitive . I know that , Hooper . The point I 'm trying to make is they 've found a way to make gold cheap enough to put on the market . Our top chemists can 't even identify some of the elements , and there are traces of such bizarre impurities as ... apple pectin . Apples in gold ? Don 't laugh Hooper . Remember what happened to good old , ordinary bread mould , don 't you ? Penicillin . But Mr. Morgan here of the Federal Reserve Bank ... has something further to say to us on the subject . Gentlemen , this ... this thing just cannot happen . I mean , money , money is the greatest ... What we 've got to do is to ... We have got to ferret out ... and stop this nefarious gang of ... Well , I , I hesitate to think ... what would happen if this were to get out of this room ! Excuse me . Rutledge here . Yes , he is . Just a second . Morg , for you . President of the New York Stock Exchange . He says urgent . Take it on one . Hello , Bob What rumour ? Synthetic gold ? Where 'd you ... Where 'd you hear that ? Your barber ? Oh , no , Bob No , absolutely nothing to that . Nothing to it at all . Well , we have had a little flap about gold around here , but , everything is absolutely under control . So you tell the Wall Street to relax . Right , Bob . Right , Bob . Bye Bob . Good heavens . How would his barber ... Rutledge here . You again . Take it on two . Hello ? Yes , this is he . The state department ? Hello , Rodge . Oh , no , Rodge . That 's just a rumour . Rumour or not , Ed , this could play hard with our foreign monetary agreements . Believe me , Rodge , we are on top of this thing . No , sirree , not a single foreign country ... will hear anything about it . Get me the US ambassador . How dare they meddle with their gold . It 's all ours . America is producing instant gold . It is a plot . If those bloody Americans are fabricating the stuff , we 're done in . Please get formula . If Americans make it for 10 dollar an ounce , we make it 8.95 . The White House ? Yes , sir . Yes , sir . Oh , you don 't ... Yes , sir . I fully realise that you have enough trouble without this . Yes , sir . I understand , sir . Quite ... Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . Gentlemen , I think your duty is quite clear . - Rutledge - Ya ? It 's in your hands . What leads do you have on this gang , chief ? Leads . So far the only lead we have is the name of the bag man . Bag woman . Known under various aliases , such as K.W. Dooley , Katie Klaus Dooley , Mrs. Albert Dooley , Frances Abigail Dooley . What was after Albert Dooley ? Why , that 's my neighbour . - Your neighbour ? - Well , it 's not my fault . I was there first . They moved in , and I ... and Albert Dooley . I knew there was something about that professor . Really , now . A man of your age . I was doing undercover work . Yes , I can see that . Hi , neighbour ! How 's it going there , friend ? Fine , fine . Having a little vacation . I thought I 'd spend it ... fixing up the house . Have fun . Hooper suspects something . Did you tell him anything ? You forgot to kiss me . - Answer me . Did you ? - I haven 't even talked to him . - Well , how about Jimmy ? - I talked to him . He 's our son , remember ? - I know that . - Why are you suspicious of Hooper ? He 's being friendly . That 's proof enough . Fred ? - How about that car ? - How about that ? Beauty , isn 't she ? - Albert ... - Wait a minute . What happened " no change in living standards " ? Not only will my new idea save us a bundle ... - That 's the car I had my eye on . - Good taste . And old Freddy boy is gonna see you get a stable full of ' em . Why can 't we have a car like that ? Katie , Katie , Katie . Is that all you can think about , material possessions ? Here I am , slaving my head to the bone while you ... Albert ! How about that for a company name ? - Dooley 's Wrought Iron Sauna Baths ? - Yeah . - What does that have to do with gold ? - Nothing . It 's a sure loser , a great tax write-off . I can tell you we got bigger problems than that . - You mean some new ones ? - Hooper 's suspicious . - Hooper ? - Yeah . He spoke to me . Besides Hooper , I cannot identify the radioactive element in our gold . If I can 't do that , I don 't know what its half-life is . - And if I don 't know what its half-life is ... - What is this half-life ? The rate of disintegration of a radioactive substance . In other words , it could run out . Run out ? You mean our duck could stop laying gold eggs ? Exactly . You mean that duck could be washed up right now ? - It 's possible . - Well , get it , Al . Get it and check ! Katie ! Katie , bring the duck ! You don 't have to shout . I have 20-20 hearing . - Where 's Charlie ? - Out . What do you mean , out ? Jimmy took him for a ride with the car 's Wadlow boys . The Wadlow boys ? Not that ! The way those maniacs drive , there goes our Charlie ! Come on , Fred . You guys said you 'd take me and Charlie for a ride . Take it easy men . We will . Can 't you just put the battery ... Go help him . If you 're gonna hang around here , you gotta shape up , okay ? Hey , get that duck off there ! He 'll fry ! Hey , Arvin , look . He likes it . Man , he 's outta sight . Jimmy , you wanna sell him ? We 'll give you two bucks for him . No , sir . He 's my friend . I got an idea . - What do you think you 're doing ? - Don 't do that , daddy ! - We 're havin ' fun ! - The fun 's over , son . But they 're going to take me and Charlie for a ride . Oh , no ! No , no , no , they 're not taking this duck in that deathtrap . Hold on , Mr. Dooley . Doesn 't that duck belong to Jimmy ? Yeah ! You 're violating his civil rights ! It 's not a civil rights case . It 's ... property rights . Hitlers ! Albert , Jimmy 's upstairs crying . What did you do to him ? I didn 't do anything to him . I was just protecting the duck . We can 't take any more chances like that . - We have to take it away from Jimmmy altogether . - I think you are right . You can 't do that . Jimmy loves that duck . It 's his pal , now you 've turned against him . What do you mean , turned against him ? This is academic if Charlie can 't produce any more . Come on , Al . Finley ! Serves you right . Masher ! Jimmy ! Hi , Jimmy ! Getting big , aren 't ya ? Come here . I got something to show you . I 'm not supposed to go into your yard . That 's all right . I 've got a present for you . Come on . That 's for me ? If you want it . My little nephew outgrew it . Boy , oh boy ! Say , this is a nice duck you 've got here . I 'll bet she lays a lot of nice eggs . Yeah , lots of them . You know something ? I 've never seen a real duck egg . Do you suppose I could get her to lay one for me ? I don 't know . My dad can . He barks at her . He does ? He ba ... At the ... Barks at the ... Why don 't I try that ? Come here and hold her and I 'll try it . Here we go . Anything happen back there ? No . - Come home now , Jimmy . - But look at the bike Mr. Hooper ... Right now , Jimmy . And bring Charlie . Hurry . And you , Mr. Hooper , stealing your neighbour 's eggs . Aren 't you ashamed ? That 's right . Albert , he knows ! Well , no , he didn 't get the egg , but ... I can 't keep the duck locked up all the time . It 's only human , you know . Yes . All right . Crisis , Fred . Hooper 's hip . I 'll meet you at the house as quick as I can sneak away from here . Dooley ? Dooley ? Dooley ! What he has is , this little duck . - Did you say duck ? - Yes . Duck . I got it . Evidently some kind of a new gangland code word . Oh , no , just plain duck . You know , quack , quack . And this duck lays gold eggs . It 's true . I mean , I saw it happen . They bark at it . - Bark at it ? - Yeah , like a dog . They bark just like ... And that causes the duck to lay these gold eggs . They . - Why , I did it myself . - You ? You laid a gold egg , Hooper ? Oh , yeah . It wasn 't easy , but ... No ! I didn 't ... I barked at it . The duck , it laid the gold egg . Yes , well . Certainly very interesting , Hooper . Look , why don 't you stop by my office sometime tomorrow ... and you and me have a little chat ? But , Chief , wait a minute . I know it sounds ... You confiscate the duck , and I 'll prove it . How long you been with the department now ? - It was after Prohibition . - Chief . There may be something to this . I checked with a Dr. Gottlieb at the university lab , and he said something about Dooley trying to make gold out of eggs . I thought he was putting me on . But now , after Hooper tell 's us ... Aren 't those nuggets all about the same size as an egg yolk ? So ... Stop that ! It 's all some fairy-tale talk ... Sure , but look at the facts . Hello , Hooper , here . Yes , Mr. Morgan . No , we haven 't struck yet , but it 's a duck . - Lays gold eggs . Duck . - Let me have that . Hi , Morg . Rutledge here . Thank you . Same to you . Yes , there does seem to be a certain degree of duck involvement . We don 't know just ex ... Oh , no , duck . D-U ... Yeah . Oh , not a word . Not a word 's gotten out . A duck ? Try to trade them for it . Offer them all their gold . Sell all our mines and buy up every duck from here to Cape Town . Get the blueprint of a US duck . Make same thing . Plastic , half-price . Just let me say this about that . Get that duck ! Do you understand ? - Get that duck ! - Bye-bye . All right , men . We 're moving in . Here 's the strategy . - Katie , where 's Charlie ? - Upstairs with Jimmy . Good . Where 's the egg ? That 's what we want . We got to get rid of the duck . You got any more of these ? We gotta get rid of ' em . Albert . What are you doing ? - I handle the eggs . - I 'm trying to help . I know and I 'm telling you I 'm the egg man ! - Finley , where are you going ? - Not now , Eunice , please . - Let go of my egg . - lt 's my egg , too , Albert . This is enough ! Albert , go upstairs and get the duck . Now , wait just a minute , Katie . I will decide what I am going to do ! I 'm going upstairs and get the duck . Hello there , neighbour . I thought you 'd like to meet my colleagues at the treasury department . - This is Mr. Rutledge , Smith ... - It 's a pleasure . I hope you can come back when I 'm not so busy . Mr. Dooley ... Being treasury men doesn 't mean you can barge in without a search warrant . Right here . There you are . Dooley , Mr. Rutledge wants to see your duck . What duck ? - Come on now , Dooley . - You mean my little boy 's pet ? Mr. Dooley , we have an eyewitness ... who will attest to the fact that you have a duck that lays ... gold eggs . Gold eggs ? Why 'd you do a dumb thing like that for ? 41,000 dollars worth of eggs , and not one cent of income tax has been declared . This duck of yours could be the most single valuable asset in the United States today . That duck is a natural resource . Like Hoover Dam . That duck is entitled to the protection of the US Government . You have no proof that my client 's duck lays gold eggs . I understand that the duck will produce on command . That 's right . I 've done it myself . You bark at it . I 'll get the duck . Now , wait a minute . You have your rights . - I 'd like to confer with my client . - You got thirty seconds . Are you outta your mind ? I 'll bark in the wrong pitch , and she won 't produce . - She won 't cross us up ? - No way . - I 'll get the duck . - I think I 'd better . He might not give it to you . He 's not crazy about you all this days . - Beckert , don 't let her out of your sight . - No . I am not going upstairs with some strange man . It 's okay . - He 's gone . - The duck ? - No , Jimmy . - Went out the window with the duck . - They 're both gone ? - Dooley , you tricked us . - Shut up ! - Don 't just everybody stand there . - You please , go out and find him . - I 'll handle this . Beckert , Smith , Forbes , outside . Deploy , cover the area . Hooper , stick with me . Katie 's right . We have to find that duck . Not the duck , Fred , my son ! Mrs. Hooper . Did you see the Dooley kid come out of his house ? - With a duck ? - I sure did . He got a bicycle out of our garage and took off . - Which way did he go ? - That way . Hey , Forbes ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Eunice , why don 't you watch what you 're doing ? Poor Jimmy . If we 'd never gotten that darn duck . Honey , we 'll find him . There 's the bike . Come on . Chief , look ! Turn around and let 's go ! There , Chief . Search that truck . Get up . Not in there . - What are you bums doin ' in my truck ? - Sorry , sir . This is US official United States Government business . We know you got a duck here somewhere . Duck ? I know . This is Candid Camera , right ? Where is it ? Hooper , check that garbage can . Okay , Mac . Move . Let 's check the rest of the alley . There 's no sign of him here . - There they are . Follow them ! - Wait for us ! Come on , boy . Charlie ! Charlie ! - What are you doing ? - Charlie ! Stop it ! Come here ! The guy in the truck swerved to miss the duck . It 's Jimmy . What could I do ? What are you , some kind of a nut ? - Come on . Come on . - Don 't let ' em get Charlie . - Who 's after him ? - Everybody , even the government . The government ? Come on , Arvin . Hurry . - All right . Cool it . - Come on , Charlie . You 're mine . There they are ! The Wadlows have ' em . Never mind that ! Get up here . Move that car outta the way ! I said , move it ! Watch out ! Wait . They 're always ready . We need ' em . - Get in . - Should we leave a note for somebody ? Get in , get in , get in ! Albert ! Jump on ! Stop this thing . He 's gonna be killed up there . - Try and lower him . - How do you work this crazy thing ? Hey , Fred ! Turn right at the next corner ! Hey , Fred , watch it ! That was a red light . Look what they 're chasing us with . I sure gotta hand it to your old man , Jimmy . He 's something else . For crying out loud , Fred , take it easy ! Hang on , Albert ! Fred , Fred ! What are you trying to do , kill me ? Trek . Stop truck , you 're gonna decaptivate him ! - What are you trying to pull now , Dooley ? - What do you think , Hooper ? I 'm waiting for a streetcar ! Go , Forbes . After ' em . Here we go . Get around that fool truck , and we got ' em . Come on . Pass ' em . Your dad 's cool , but he is a show-off . Hold it ! You gotta have a ticket ! Swing on back to that garage , Forbes . We got ' em now . You can 't make a U-turn here , stupid ! Thank you . Move along , folks . Break it up . It 's official United States Government business . No wonder you got everything loused up ! Fred , the boys are in the parking garage . Wait a minute , you can 't bring this thing in here . - My son is in here . - I don 't care who 's in here . Get this outta here ! Will you please take my money ? I 'm in a hurry . - This mother 's child ... - Will you get this thing out ! Over there . Come on . Run ! Move it ! Over you go Jimmy . Arvin , a ladder . Here . Jimmy ! Over you go . - Jimmy , where are you ? - Be brave , pal . Attaboy . Easy does it , boy . There you go , Jimmy . Help ! Hang on , Jimmy we 'll get ya . We 'll find something ... Jimmy . Don 't move . Don 't move , son . - Jimmy . - Go away , daddy ! - Jimmy , give me your hand . - You just want Charlie . Jimmy , put your hand in mine . Go away , daddy . Daddy ! Daddy , help ! Help ! Oh , Jimmy . Oh , my son . Get it , Hooper . Daddy , don 't let ' em take Charlie . Don 't let ' em . Sorry , son . There 's nothing I can do about that now . Charlie , Charlie ! I 'm sorry , sonny . We got to put Charlie under protective custody for his own good . Jimmy , let 's go home . I 'll explain it all to you later . - So long , gentlemen . - No . You 're not going home . You 're coming with us . You 're under arrest . Arrest ? Suspicion of violation of federal gold regulations . - He didn 't mean to . - Ah , sorry . Come on , Dooley . At least you 're lucky , old boy . Lucky ? My son disowned me . I 've lost a fortune . And I 've just been arrested . But you 've got a darned good lawyer to handle your case . Thanks you , Fred . What 's that duck really worth ? Sorry , gentlemen ! You can 't get in the trial . We handle riot cases , rapes and spies , but a rich duck ? Mr. Hooper , did you actually witness the duck lay a golden egg ? Yes , sir . - Did you make it perform this feat ? - I did , indeed . - Would you demonstrate it for us , sir ? - I 'd be happy to . It 's the wrong pitch , isn 't it ? - Your Honour , he 's not doing it right . - Albert , sit down . I 'd like to get this out in the open . If that duck can lay gold eggs , then we should establish that . If we 've done wrong , I accept the consequences . - You 're outta your mind . - If we lose the duck , so be it . It 's just that now I know that there are things ... a darn sight more valuable to me . Excuse me . One more time , Charlie . There 's the evidence , Your Honour . Break that open and look inside of that . You 're gonna get it now . It 's run out . Finished . Case dismissed . Lack of evidence . But , Your Honour , the defendant has 40,000 dollars in various banks . Well , good for him . Since when are we against the accumulation of a few dollars as a result of individual initiative ? This country was built on enterprise and ingenuity . Let 's don 't lose that . Only bad thing is the professor won 't be able to keep the money after he pays his income tax on it . You know , for a worthless creature , you sure have caused a lot of trouble . - Here you are . - Thank you , Your Honour but , you 're wrong about this duck being worthless . It has great value . It was just that I was confused about what that value was . Really ? - Forever ? - Really forever , pal . One word of caution , son . If it ever lays another gold egg , bury it ... quick .

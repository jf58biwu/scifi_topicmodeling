 We have two meadow people and three of ours . Just so they 're young and healthy . They are . They will serve you well in the mines . - Bring them forward . - Lorko . Good . Arma . - Fine . - Clim . I 'm sorry . My men 'll hunt him down . It will be good sport . Don 't bother to bring him back . Where is his replacement ? We will draw lots at once to find one of our people to take Clim 's place . I think I can hear the sound of running water . There used to be this running brook . It was right behind the house I lived in , in Central City . You better can it , little chimp , you 're gonna be crying in a minute . I know , but I can 't help it sometimes . I 'm with you , Galen . Pete , if you 've developed a vaccine against memories , give me a shot of it . Of course , I 've got a patented cure . If you lose one home you try to find another one , preferably among friendly natives who are about ... so tall , and round in the right places . - Round natives ? - Galen , you 're such a square . Hey ! - Think they 're looking for us ? - No . If they were , they 'd look around more . What do you say we get out of here before they start looking around more . If I didn 't know you better , I 'd think you were afraid . I am . It 's what keeps me alive . - Really ? - Oh , yeah . Stick with me . You got a lot to learn about the value of creative cowardice . Creative cowardice , huh ? Quiet . These are my friends . Well , whoever you are , I thank you . - I was sure I 'd be caught . - Why were they chasing you ? I don 't know for sure . The patrol comes to our village collects the grain tax and then leaves . And sometimes they chase a human for sport . We couldn 't find him . You 're slow and lazy ! I 'm sorry . - Is that the new one ? - Yes . He 's better than the one that ran . Strong . He 'll do good work . If the other was so weak , how did he get away ? ! Can 't you control your humans ? ! What kind of a leader are you ? I have provided you with five workers twice each summer month . That fulfills my duty to you . Next time , I want all five tied ready and waiting ! Yes , sir . Move out ! - Find Clim . - Yes , Father . Do you think it 's safe for you to go back ? Yes . By now the gorillas are gone , and Borak , my village , is over that hill . - We 'll split with you at the road . - No , you must come with me . Everyone should know how you saved me . I think it 's best if we keep on moving . You will be honored guests . There 'll be a day of feasting . - I would like some fresh fruit . - Anything you want . I 'd like a broiled Maine lobster with melted butter and a cold beer . I don 't know what that is , but if I can get it , it 's yours . - What is it , Galen ? - Hide ! Come on ! He said hide ! It 's all right . - Your people ? - Yes . Miro ! Here ! It 's Clim . I brought friends with me . I could go for a celebration . For all I know , this could be the Fourth of July . Don 't be frightened . He can tell you . I 'm not gonna hurt you . He 's telling the truth . Just take the two humans . - Stop ! What 's with you ? - You must not touch these humans . They are my servants , and under my protection . - Take them . - You must not disobey me . - You are free to go if you wish . - They go with me . - No ! - Humans must obey apes ! Yes , sir . Within the law . Tie Clim . Why ? ! I brought two humans in my place . Isn 't the village better off ? Brun is waiting for you at the temple . I brought two humans ! That should make things all right ! Take him away . We tried to help him ! We 've done nothing to hurt you ! - Why are you doing this ? - It is the law . My orders are that you release these two humans immediately . My orders are from Brun , Master of Borak . - An ape ? - A human . Maybe you better talk to this Brun , Galen , sir . Where is this man you call the Master of Borak ? At the temple . This way , sir . Take them to the village . No ! Who is the human they call Master of Borak ? He is my father . Brun . - Tell him I want to talk to him . - Until Clim has been punished he can speak only to the gods . Mercy ! I ask for mercy ! No ! We come before you as our fathers and their fathers have done . The most sacred of our laws has been broken . Human sacrifice . One of our people , Clim , son of Porto was chosen by lot to serve the apes . He ran from his duty . Another was taken in his place at a time when he need not have gone . For this , Clim is responsible . The laws of humans must be upheld . For breaking that law , Clim 's punishment is in your hands . He 's dead . Nothing . No one touched him . The gods . Miro , where are my servants ? In the woods just outside the village . Thank you . Galen . - Did you see the head man ? - No . - I didn 't have a chance . - Why not ? There was a ceremony . It had to do with that man . The one running from the gorillas . What happened to him ? He 's dead . - He 's dead ? How ? - I don 't know . Brun , the head man , took him to a shrine prayed over him , and he just died . Men don 't die by getting prayed over . What else did they do ? Nothing . They wheeled him in on a cart alive . He was struggling , and then Brun prayed and he died . I watched . He wasn 't even touched . You 've got to believe me , because I saw it with my own eyes . The power of suggestion can kill , but only if you believe in it . - In our time , there was voodoo . - Mumbo jumbo doesn 't kill men . I can think of a few things that do . Like gorillas . You wouldn 't talk like that if you saw it . Forget it . Concentrate on convincing the head man we 're your property . And you 'd like it to leave with you , undamaged and intact . It isn 't going to be easy . And there 's something very special about Brun . It isn 't just that mask he wears . He 's ... Well , look if chimpanzees were ever afraid and if humans were what they were afraid of , I can tell you that is a human to fear . Well , give it a try . I 'll do my best . Char , please open the cage . I think we get room service . My name is Talia . Hello , Talia . Say , we could sure use an ally . You remember what Pocahontas did for John Smith ? Yeah . Give it a shot . Watch . Hello , Talia , I 'm Burke . Pete Burke . Where I come from , mothers used to warn their daughters about me but you 've really raised caution to new heights . I could give you a demonstration right now , but I 'm a little tied up . You gonna be the one who brings our food every day ? Yes , I am . - Like tonight , maybe ? - Yes . There 's gonna be a full moon tonight . Yes , there is . What does a full moon and a soft breeze maybe a dozen long-stemmed red roses do for you ? Talia . Talia . Boy , you sure didn 't make history , John Smith . Talia ... What 's the matter ? Talia , only one man was captured . It 's all right . There 's time . They hunted as far as the hills . It was as if the meadow people had disappeared into the earth . The next time 'll be better , I 'm sure . Talia , I should have gone myself . Then there would be more than one . No ! No ! I find it hard to believe . You , a human , telling me , an ape , that you will not accept my orders . I could have you shot . Aren 't you afraid that I might have you killed ? - No . - Why not ? My being afraid won 't stop you from doing anything you wish so there 's nothing to gain from fear . That is insolence . That is perfect justification for me to have you shot . That is , if I needed any justification . Look , I do not believe in punishing humans unnecessarily but obviously we cannot condone disobedience . I will obey you in all areas where it is permitted . Oh , you will ? And who decides the areas ? I 'll tell you who does . I do . And you are going to release my servants to me immediately . - I 'm sorry , sir . - By what right do you hold them ? The apes gave us that right . Any alien human in our territory may be captured and delivered in place of our own to work in the mines . It is law . Well , I 've never heard of that law . That is a ridiculous law . I believe that ... I think you made that up ! I think you are lying ! A long , long time ago , the apes raided for slaves and men fought back . Many were killed on both sides . Finally , there was a meeting arranged . The apes wisely allowed us to give them five slaves from among any healthy humans . I refuse to recognize that law . You may seek an exception from the ape commander . None has ever been given . Would you like a guide to take you to the garrison ? Perhaps later . Look , if you must give these humans to the apes why do you waste them ? At that ceremony , that man you killed ... I did not kill him . He was punished by the gods . I don 't think I like your gods . You have no need to . You are not a human . Fortunately . I shall remain here until I decide what I shall do about your insolence . I have arranged for you to have your own hut . You will be treated as an honored guest . No . No . No ! I don 't know what 's gonna happen , but I got a feeling I 'm not gonna like it . By resisting , you only hurt yourself . Take him to the fields . - Will you go without fighting ? - Go where ? You 're to be made ready for the apes . Not me , buddy . Ain 't no way . It 'll do you no good to resist . Listen , Miro , your only hope is to fight against the gorillas , not with them . Let us out , we 'll fight alongside you . Cut us loose , and we 'll take the first crack at them . You can join in . You are not being given to the gorillas for several days . - Then where are you taking us ? - To cut logs . You must be made strong . The gorillas will not accept the weak . That 's like asking a turkey to sharpen the ax before Thanksgiving . - Take them . - Hey , wait . Call them off . We 'll work . Thank you , Talia . Talia . - I 'm leaving on the hunt . - So soon ? I 'll be back in a few days . I 'll come back with two , three , four , even five . Talia , I 've never failed on a hunt . I won 't fail now . Believe me . I believe you . I love you . I love you , Talia . Miro 's going out to hunt humans , isn 't he ? - Yes . The meadow people . - Too bad they don 't have antlers . He could have one stuffed for his wall . Talia , do you realize that makes you no better than the apes ? Both of you hunt humans and then make them into slaves . That 's not true . We don 't take slaves for ourselves . But it 's still slaves . Can 't you see that 's wrong ? You don 't understand . The men taken by the gorillas to run the mines don 't live longer than a few months . The women might last longer , because they just cook and serve but they die early too . That 's why we take the meadow people , so we don 't have to go . Galen . - Nicely done . - What took you so long ? Thank you . Oh , no . Guard . You asked to see me ? The gorillas will destroy this village when they find out you 've imprisoned an ape . You were freeing the slaves . I 'll tell them that and they know I don 't lie . They 'll never accept the word of a human over that of an ape . I think they will when they learn you risked your life to save two humans . No matter what I did apes cannot be imprisoned by humans . It 's unnatural ! It 's unnatural for you to be so concerned about your servants . I 'm sorry , but you 'll have to remain under guard until the gorillas come . - Good morning . - Hello , Talia . Does your hand hurt ? Yes , it does . Does that surprise you a lot ? Come on . Back off , Pete , it 's not her fault . Yeah , okay . Hey , Talia , you scratch everything I said , all right ? We 're still friends , aren 't we ? I mean , you forgive me if we don 't shake hands . Only one . I should 've sent someone who could hunt better than me . Don 't be angry with yourself . No one is better at hunting . After the first night , Talia , I didn 't sleep . Every day , every night , I hunted . It must have been something I did wrong . No , please , no ! I prayed for a good hunt . Well , you should have prayed for a son who wasn 't a failure . I know he did the best he could . Tie him to the back of the cage ! - Miro ! - Is it bad ? It 's deep . Come to the temple . I will pray . He could die if you don 't stop that bleeding fast . - Do you know how ? - We pray . That won 't save his life . - Can you help him ? - Yes . - Come , Miro . - Pray all you want . He 'll still bleed to death . Listen to him , Brun . We know men often die from bleeding . - No . - Brun ? Please . Please ? Get me a strip of cloth or leather and a stick . Do as he says and he 's got a chance . Keep on arguing and he 's a goner . Brun , please . Turn them loose . All right , bring him over here . A strip of leather . The bleeding has stopped . - I was afraid you would do this . - Afraid ? We don 't expect a round of applause , but the man is saving his life . A long time ago , men learned that a tight cord could stop the bleeding in an arm or a leg . Better to bleed . In a day , the arm could grow big , the fever would come . Men would die crying out in pain . That 's true . That would happen . But if you loosen the cord from time to time very carefully eventually the bleeding will stop without any swelling or fever . I will pray that you are right . All right , let 's sit him down . Take it easy . It 'll be an hour or so before a clot forms . Now move your fingers . - How does it feel ? - Good . - Is he all right ? - Well , he 'll be weak for a while . But he 'll be fine . Thanks to the miracle of ancient medicine . - Thanks to you . - And the gods . My father prayed . Let 's see how the gods do the next time on their own . Be careful . The gods are very powerful . They proved that by what happened to Clim . Oh , him . Mr. Grateful . Haven 't any other men tried to avoid being taken as slaves ? Yes , a few . Like Clim , they are caught and taken to the temple where they are punished by the gods . Only the leader can walk into the temple and live . - Someday , Miro will be leader . - No , I won 't . Brun will take his son into the temple but Miro will not be struck dead , as you or I would . He will protect Miro while he teaches him the magic known only to the leader . Someone else . Not me . You see , the leader must have a wife . I won 't have one . - Yes . In time . - I 'm telling you no , Talia . I 'll have no other woman but you . Not ever . When the gorillas come , they 'll take you two and the meadow people . That 's four . This month I was chosen . I am the fifth . Because I failed . Feeling sorry for yourself won 't help her very much . There 's nothing I can do . What would you do if one of the meadow people grabbed Talia and ran off ? I would stop him . I would kill him ! But a human does not fight apes . The apes won 't treat her better than they are . If you 'd stand up to them , why not the apes ? They 're wrong . They don 't understand . - She 's right . You don 't understand ! - All right , now listen to me . Men have had to fight for what 's important to them since ... For longer than you can imagine . They 've been able to make a decent life for themselves by burying their differences , by banding together . A human cannot fight apes ! The gods made the apes rulers of men ! - Talia , come ! - Miro . You didn 't listen to a word I said ! You are trying to put lies into my mind . You are telling me to question everything that has ever been ! What was meant to be by gods and apes ! You can 't reach these people . They just roll over and play dead . Father . Father . Miro . What is it ? What 's wrong ? How soon before the gorillas come ? Today ? Tomorrow ? Tomorrow . I wanna go in Talia 's place . - Miro , you know the law . - Village law . Made by us , not by the apes . Everyone chosen to go has a wife or a brother or a father who would change places if they could . I wanna go for Talia . I don 't ask anyone to suffer for me ! I would suffer for you . No matter what you or I feel , it cannot be . You 'd tear down the law . - There would be no order . - You can change the law ! - What reason would I give ? - Any ! None ! In time you will change . I want Talia ! You teach your secrets to someone else ! In time you will change . - Is that a new law ? - A very old one . A son will honor his father . I did honor my father . I never stopped loving my son . Then grant my request . I cannot . - Good morning , Ort . - Good morning , Miro . You 're relieved . I will take over until Lurt comes . Yes , Miro . The gorillas come tomorrow . If I set you free will you take Talia with you ? Sure . - Wait . And Galen . - The ape ? Or it 's no deal . Well ? All right . Say nothing to Talia . She 'll think I 'm going with you . - Why not take her yourself ? - It 's not your concern . - Okay , okay . - Let 's go . Follow me . - Tag . - Yes , Miro . I 'd like to talk to you . The gorillas are coming tomorrow , so , what I want you to do is to ... - I don 't think you should do this . - I know this is the right thing . - I know it is . - Lf you say so . - As long as we 're together . - Yes . All set ? Which way ? Follow this path . Once you pass the stream , you should be safe . - Okay , good . - You will go through the foothills . - Talia will show you the trail . - No , Miro . You 're coming with us . - Miro , I won 't go without you ! - Lf you love me , you 'll go . - Take her . Hurry ! - Miro ! Miro ! Miro , the slaves are gone . The chimpanzee too . - Call out the hunters . - I have . They 're waiting for you . I will take them and block the paths . The paths are already blocked . We 're closing in . - Don 't worry , they can 't escape . - Good . Follow me . You promise no noise , no trying to run ? - Can they block every way out ? - Yes . And then they 'll find us . Now , listen to me . Miro will be in bigger trouble if they find us . You must know someplace we can hide . Our men are great hunters . They know every path and every trail . Wait a minute . Didn 't you say that nobody would ever go into the temple ? Except for Brun , anyone would be killed by the gods . - We 'll take our chances . - Do you think we should ? Yes , Galen . Do you know how to find it ? Yes , but I would rather we found another place . - We have no other choice . - Well , all right . Talia , I know you 're afraid of the temple , but trust me nothing will happen to you . I promise . - I will go into the temple with you . - Good girl . I want to die . Beautiful . Talia . Come on , Talia ! Look , I 'll ... Watch and see . Look , it 's all right , see ? Honest , it 's all right . Come on ! Alan . Alan ! Stay here ! It 's gas , bubbling up behind the altar . I don 't know what kind , but it 's deadly . I smelled something . I didn 't know what it was . It was faint but bitter . I am sorry . He will die . - Pete ? Pete ? ! - Oh , man . I 'm floating . - Five thousand feet and holding . - All right . Take deep breaths , pal . What hit me ? Some kind of poison gas . How did Brun live ? He was standing right where Pete was standing . - The gods protect the leader . - Yeah , right . Man , that stuff hit me like a club . Now what ? That temple looks like it 's built into the mountain . There might be a way out back . What good will that do ? There 's still the gas . The temple 's the only answer . Either we go in there or else we flag down some gorilla and ask him to come and get us . Hey , remember your chemistry ? It might work , Pete . What are you doing ? Some gases are absorbed by crushed charcoal . See , we wrap this crushed charcoal into a wet cloth , and it acts as sort of a filter . Really ? You mean we can breathe through that ? - Well , we 'll find out in a few minutes . - Here you go . Yeah , provided we 're not asphyxiated . All right . Now , hold these over your nose and mouth . Tight . - And breathe through them . - You ready ? Everybody ready ? All right . Come on ! No ! No . I think it 's all right . I don 't smell the gas in here . Well , lookie here . Hey , how about this ? An old gas mask . This is what they worship . One time , someone must 've discovered that this could keep a man alive around that gas . It must 've seemed like some kind of magic to them . - Their god wears a gas mask . - Their god is a gas mask . Brun must hold his breath till he gets to here . Unless he knows another way in . What 's that light up ahead ? Fresh air ! - From the tunnel ? - Yeah . What 's in here ? Oh , for ... There 's that same smell . It 's coming from there . It 's the same stuff from the temple . The gas is being drawn up through here . Yeah , and then collected in these bottles . This is a do-it-yourself kit for making poison gas bombs . What are gas bombs ? - Talia , what are these jugs used for ? - I have never seen them before . What are gas bombs ? They 're an efficient gadget . Instead of killing one at a time , you can wipe out a whole batch . You defy the gods ! Wait ! Hold it ! If we defy the gods , how come we are still alive ? Only the wearer of this mask can walk in the temple and not be punished . - Therefore , you will be punished ! - This isn 't your god-given mask . Now , watch . How can ... ? How can you ... ? - You are only men . - That 's right . Just like you . But how can you walk in the temple with only that and live ? - Just as you can with your mask . - My mask ? It came from the gods ! No . It was made by men when they destroyed other men with gas like this . - You 're lying ! - No . He is not lying . - He knows about such things . - What do you plan to do with these ? When I get enough , I will go to the ape village . My mask will protect me , but they will be killed ! You can 't use this gas . You can 't control it . You 'll start with the apes , but you can wipe out the whole planet . All our lives we have obeyed , begged and crawled and gave up those we loved , because the apes were strong . Now the gods have made me strong . I will free my people ! Not this way . You can 't win freedom by destroying the world ! I will teach them to make masks like yours . We will fight the apes again . The gas will kill them , but the masks will save our lives . Man , this poison gas of yours is just the beginning . Sooner or later the apes will find their own gas and make their own masks . Listen to me . Please , listen . We 've been there . We 've been all through poison gas and germ warfare and atomic bombs . When you use them , nobody wins . Do you side with the apes ? That 's not the point . Fight to stop slavery , all slavery , but not this way . We will kill only apes , and we won 't stop only in this valley . You mean you want to kill all apes with this gas ? As long as it won 't kill my people , nothing else matters . - Galen ! - He won 't kill my people either . You picked a classic way to settle an argument . Think he 'll be fonder of apes when he comes to ? Well , I am not going to wait to find out . Get out ! Through that back tunnel . This stuff could blow ! Bombs may be efficient , but I do not like them ! Where am I ? What happened ? - You 'll be all right , Brun . - Wait ! No , they can 't be destroyed ! They can 't be destroyed ! - Galen , no ! - He 's not gonna get those bombs . - What about Talia ? - Will you hand her over to the apes ? No , even though that 's what my father would have wished . No , not wished . Your father might have thought it was the only way but he hated slavery . You can be proud of him . I am not my father . I make my own way . - Which way is that ? - I would rather not say in front of him . I won 't repeat anything I hear . My word is as good as yours . Yes , and all apes are not the same either . I plan to meet with the meadow people . Only by banding together and burying our differences can we make a new life for ourselves . A decent life . - You were listening . - We 'll lend a hand , Miro . No , this is our fight . I don 't know if we 'll win but with the help of the meadow people and those beyond the hills we can keep fighting . Men must fight where they have their roots so this isn 't your fight , just as it isn 't his . I 'm not sure it isn 't . I don 't like fighting , but I do like you . Thank you . - Good luck to you . - Goodbye . Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH ]

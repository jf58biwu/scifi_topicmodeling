I PROGRAMMED THE C.L.C. FOR TWO HOURS TONIGHT . THERE 'S NO TELLING WHEN HE 'LL BE AVAILABLE AGAIN . WE 'LL HAVE TO MOVE HIM ... IF HE COMES UP SUCCESSFULLY , OTHERWISE , WE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO DISPOSE OF HIM THE USUAL WAY . PLEASE STATE REGISTRATION CODE . CHECK . WHERE WAS THE SUBJECT FOUND ? WE CAME ACROSS IT THE LAST DAY OF OUR FIELD TRIP INTO THE WOODS A WEEK AGO . THE CAPSULE WAS PERFECTLY INTACT . IS THERE A DATE ON THE CAPSULE ? OH , YES . THE SUBJECT WAS FROZEN IN 1973 , WHICH MEANS HE 'S BEEN UNDER FOR 200 YEARS . [ Machines Beeping ] - BLOOD PRESSURE . - 140 OVER 50 . - ENCEPHALO-ACTIVITY ? - JUST UNDER NORMAL . GENERAL LIFE FUNCTIONS ... ACCEPTABLE . HE SHOULD BE COMING OUT OF IT ANY MOMENT . DO WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON HIM ? JUST THE USUAL DATA CARD INSIDE THE CAPSULE AND THE PERSONAL ARTIFACTS HERE . HMM . THE SUBJECT WAS 35 YEARS OLD AT TIME OF INITIAL CRYOGENIC EMERGENT . HIS NAME ... MILES MONROE . UNDER OCCUPATION IT SAYS HE WAS PART OWNER ... OF THE HAPPY CARROT HEALTH FOOD RESTAURANT ON BLEECKER STREET , WHEREVER THAT WAS . ALSO A CLARINET PLAYER WITH SOMETHING CALLED THE RAGTIME RASCALS . WAS HIS EMERGENT VOLUNTARY ? HMM . ACCORDING TO THIS , " SUBJECT ENTERED HOSPITAL FOR ROUTINE EXPLORATION OF MINOR PEPTIC ULCER ... AND COMPLICATIONS SET IN . " THE PATIENT NEVER REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS . HE WAS ADMITTED FOR CRYOGENIC EMERGENT BY HIS COUSIN , A MRS. JOAN NEEDLEBAUM . THE PHYSICAL DAMAGE WAS REPAIRED . YEAH . TOTALLY . ROUTINE . WE 'RE GETTING AN INITIAL MOTOR RESPONSE OVER HERE . THIS IS THE CRITICAL STAGE NOW . IF HIS CONSCIOUSNESS ISN 'T HANDLED CAREFULLY , THERE COULD BE DAMAGING TRAUMA . REMEMBER , WE 'RE DEALING WITH AN INVOLUNTARY SUBJECT WHO EXPECTS TO BE WAKING UP ... IN ST . VINCENT 'S HOSPITAL IN GREENWICH VILLAGE IN 1973 . SWALLOW REFLEX IS ALMOST THERE . [ Mutters ] WE 'VE GOT TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE . HE 'S NOT READY .

ANY REASON WHY ANYONE ELSE WOULD BE CONSUMING POWER ? NO , IT 'S JUST DR. ORVA , DR. MONROE AND MYSELF . WE DEFINITELY DID REGISTER A POWER INCREASE HERE . UH , DON 'T MIND DR. MONROE . HE , HE , HE- - OH . HE 'S NOT OVER THE EFFECTS OF A NEW RAY WE 'VE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH . UH , WHAT 'S THIS ? OH , THAT . UH- - I THINK YOU TWO BETTER COME ALONG WITH US . BUT WHY ?

CAN 'T YOU SEE WHAT A DIFFICULT- - I THINK THE EXPERIMENT IS GETTING A LITTLE OUT OF HAND . IF WE HADN 'T HAD THIS INTERRUPTION , WE 'D HAVE HAD IT UNDER CONTROL SOME TIME AGO . ARE YOU SURE YOU HAVE AUTHORIZATION FOR YOUR EXPERIMENT ? WELL , HE 'S FULLY RECOVERED , EXCEPT FOR A FEW MINOR KINKS . HAS HE ASKED FOR ANYTHING SPECIAL ? YES , THIS MORNING FOR BREAKFAST . HE REQUESTED SOMETHING CALLED WHEAT GERM , ORGANIC HONEY AND TIGER 'S MILK . [ Laughs ] OH , YES . THOSE WERE THE CHARMED SUBSTANCES ... THAT SOME YEARS AGO WERE FELT TO CONTAIN LIFE-PRESERVING PROPERTIES . YOU MEAN THERE WAS NO DEEP FAT ? NO STEAK OR CREAM PIES OR HOT FUDGE ? THOSE WERE THOUGHT TO BE UNHEALTHY , PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE NOW KNOW TO BE TRUE . INCREDIBLE . WELL , HE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE HE IS ... AND WHAT 'S GOING ON . I THINK IT 'S TIME TO TELL HIM . I CAN 'T BELIEVE THIS ! MY DOCTOR SAID I 'D BE UP AND ON MY FEET IN FIVE DAYS . HE WAS OFF BY 199 YEARS . I KNOW IT 'S HARD , MILES , BUT TRY TO THINK OF THIS EXPERIENCE AS A MIRACLE OF SCIENCE . A MIRACLE OF SCIENCE IS GOING TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A MINOR OPERATION , I COME OUT THE NEXT DAY , MY RENT ISN 'T 2,000 MONTHS OVERDUE . THAT 'S A MIRACLE OF SCIENCE . THIS IS WHAT I CALL A COSMIC SCREWING . AND THEN WHERE AM I ANYHOW ? WHAT HAPPENED TO EVERYBODY ? WHERE ARE ALL MY FRIENDS ? YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE YOU KNEW IN THE PAST HAS BEEN DEAD NEARLY 200 YEARS . BUT THEY ALL ATE ORGANIC RICE . YOU ARE NOW IN THE YEAR 2173 . NOW THIS IS THE CENTRAL PARALLEL OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION . THIS DISTRICT IS WHAT YOU 'D PROBABLY CALL THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES . THAT WAS BEFORE IT WAS DESTROYED BY THE WAR . - WAR ? - YES . ACCORDING TO HISTORY , OVER 100 YEARS AGO , A MAN NAMED ALBERT SHANKER GOT A HOLD OF A NUCLEAR WARHEAD . YOU WILL REMAIN IN HIDING HERE FOR TWO WEEKS WHILE WE RUN A BATTERY OF TESTS ON YOU . THEN , WHEN WE THINK YOU 'VE FULLY RECOVERED YOUR STRENGTH , WE 'LL DISCUSS THE PLAN- - I STILL CAN 'T BELIEVE THIS . WHAT DO YOU MEAN , " HIDING " ? WHO AM I HIDING FROM ? WHAT DID SHE MEAN , " HIDING " ? WELL , YOU MIGHT AS WELL KNOW , MILES , THAT REVIVING YOU AS WE DID WAS IN STRICT OPPOSITION TO GOVERNMENT POLICY . WHAT WE 'VE DONE IS HIGHLY ILLEGAL , MILES , AND IF WE GET CAUGHT , WE 'LL BE DESTROYED , ALONG WITH YOU . WHAT DO YOU MEAN , " DESTROYED " ? WHAT DO YOU MEAN , " DESTROYED " ? YOUR BRAIN WILL BE ELECTRONICALLY SIMPLIFIED . MY BRAIN ? THAT 'S MY SECOND FAVORITE ORGAN . RESISTERS TO MIND REPROGRAMMING WILL BE EXTERMINATED , FOR THE GOOD OF THE STATE . WHAT KIND OF GOVERNMENT YOU GUYS GOT HERE ? THIS IS WORSE THAN CALIFORNIA . THERE IS A GROWING UNDERGROUND , MILES . AND SOME DAY THE REVOLUTION WILL COME WHEN WE CAN OVERTHROW OUR GREAT LEADER . LOOK , YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING . I WANNA GO BACK TO SLEEP . IF I DON 'T GET AT LEAST 600 YEARS , I 'M GROUCHY ALL DAY . WE 'RE TAKING HIM ALONG TOO FAST . HE 'S STILL EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE . I CAN 'T BELIEVE THIS . I GO INTO THE HOSPITAL FOR A LOUSY ULCER OPERATION . I LAY IN A BIRD 'S-EYE WRAPPER 200 YEARS , I WAKE UP , SUDDENLY I 'M ON THE TEN MOST WANTED LIST . HE 'S RANTING . WE 'D BETTER TRANQUILIZE HIM . I KNEW IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE . I PARKED RIGHT NEAR THE HOSPITAL . HERE . YOU SMOKE THIS , AND BE SURE YOU GET THE SMOKE DEEP DOWN INTO YOUR LUNGS . I DON 'T SMOKE . IT 'S TOBACCO . IT 'S ONE OF THE HEALTHIEST THINGS FOR YOUR BODY . NOW GO AHEAD . YOU NEED ALL THE STRENGTH YOU CAN GET . YOU KNOW , I BOUGHT POLAROID AT SEVEN . IT 'S PROBABLY UP MILLIONS BY NOW . NOW WE HAVE CERTAIN ARTIFACTS HERE ... WHICH WE DATE FROM 1950 TO 2000 . WE 'D LIKE ANY INFORMATION YOU CAN GIVE US ON THEM . VERY LITTLE EXISTS . FOR INSTANCE .

BUT NOW AIRES DAY IS HERE . I REALIZE THAT WHAT I 'M ABOUT TO SAY WILL COME AS A GREAT SHOCK . HOWEVER , I 'M COUNTING ON YOU TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY . TEN MONTHS AGO , OUR LEADER SUFFERED A HORRIBLE ACCIDENT ... WHEN A BOMB , PLANTED IN HIS HOME BY MEMBERS OF THE UNDERGROUND , EXPLODED . NATURALLY , IT WAS KEPT QUIET . BUT SINCE THEN , WE HAVE VIRTUALLY BEEN A LEADERLESS SOCIETY . UNFORTUNATELY , PREPARATIONS FOR A SUCCESSOR ... HAVE NEVER BEEN ADEQUATELY CLEAR . IN SHORT , WE HAVE BEEN IN THE THROES OF A MAJOR CRISIS . AS FOR OUR LEADER , THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT RUSHED TO THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT IMMEDIATELY , BUT ALL THAT REMAINED OF HIM WAS THIS . THIS IS OUR LEADER 'S NOSE . USING GREAT PRESENCE OF MIND , WE RUSHED THE NOSE TO OUR CLOSEST DELTA LABORATORY WHICH IS HERE ... WHERE , THROUGH MASSIVE BIOCHEMICAL EFFORT , IT HAS BEEN KEPT ALIVE FOR NEARLY A YEAR . OUR DREAM HAS BEEN THAT BY CLONING , WE WOULD REDUPLICATE THE ENTIRE LEADER AGAIN . CLONING , FOR THOSE OF YOU UNFAMILIAR WITH BIOLOGY , IS A PROCESS BY WHICH USING ONE SINGLE CELL , A DUPLICATE OF THE PERSON IT CAME FROM COULD BE FORMED . TILL NOW WE 'VE ONLY HAD LIMITED EXPERIMENTAL SUCCESS . BUT ALL EFFORTS HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO CLONING OVER THE PAST TEN MONTHS . AND NOW WE FEEL CONFIDENT WE CAN REPRODUCE OUR LEADER ... IN PERFECT TACT FROM HIS NOSE . GENTLEMEN , WITH GOD 'S HELP , IN A COUPLE OF HOURS , WE WILL HAVE OUR LEADER BACK . AND WE WILL THEN COORDINATE AIRES PHASE TWO ... WHICH WILL EXTERMINATE ALL DISSIDENT FACTIONS ON SIGNAL ... FROM OUR REBORN LEADER . MILES , IT 'S A NOSE . YES , I KNOW . I WAS RIGHT HERE . WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ? RADIO ERNO IMMEDIATELY . NOW IS THE TIME TO STRIKE . THE LEADER IS SUFFERING FROM A TERRIFIC HANDICAP . HE HAS NO HEAD OR BODY . WE 'RE NOT FULLY PREPARED . IT DOESN 'T MATTER . THEY 'RE IN A STATE OF CHAOS .

WE GO TO THE FLOOR BELOW , CUT A HOLE IN THE CEILING ... [ Repeating ] BIG ENOUGH TO SLIDE THROUGH , COME UP UNDER THE NOSE AND HIDE IT UNDER MY COAT . IT 'S A STUPID PLAN . THERE 'S NO CHANCE . WHAT 'S WRONG ? BECAUSE IT 'S TOO SUBTLE . WE HAVE NO TIME FOR THAT . WE 'RE DRESSED LIKE DOCTORS . WE GO INTO THE OPERATING ROOM . YOU CREATE A DIVERSION , AND I 'LL STEAL THE NOSE . GREAT ! OOH .

I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A ... VERY DIFFICULT CRONING JOB . OH , YES . CLONING , YOU IDIOT , NOT CRONING . CLONING ! - WE 'RE READY TO PROCEED . - UH- - HMM . AFTER LOOKING AT THE NOSE , I GET THE FEELING THAT WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO PERHAPS IS POSTPONE THE CLONING . EXCUSE ME , DOCTOR , BUT THAT WOULD BE A TRAGIC MISTAKE . SEE , I THINK WHAT THE COMPUTER IS FAILING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ... IS WHAT I CALL THE PINOCCHIO FACTOR , WHICH STATES THAT THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE PROBOSCIS ... IS EQUAL TO THE SUM OF THE SINUSES ... OVER SEVEN . WELL , WHAT IS YOUR OPINION , DOCTOR ? SHOULD WE PROCEED WITH THE CLONING OR SHOULD WE POSTPONE ? AH , INDEED . I , UH- - ONE MOMENT . A MOMENT . A MEDICAL MOMENT . YES .

WHAT YOU HAVE HERE- - I DIAGNOSED THE ENTIRE SITUATION , AND I THINK WHAT WE 'VE GOT , WHAT WE 'RE DEALING WITH BASICALLY IS A NOSE . I THINK WE 'RE ALL IN AGGREANCE ON THAT . I HAVE THE LITTLE BEGGAR RIGHT HERE . AND WHAT YOU WANT BASICALLY IS A WHOLE ENTIRE PERSON ... CONNECTED TO THAT NOSE , RIGHT ? OTHERWISE , YOU 'D GET YOUR MONEY BACK . NOW , DID YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE ROOM FOR A MOUSTACHE , 'CAUSE THERE 'S A NICE AREA IN THERE WHICH IT 'LL- - IT 'S , UM- - WHAT- - IT 'S CLEVER . SHE 'S CLEVER . WHAT THE DOCTOR IS DOING HERE- - WE 'RE PLACING DOWN THE GARMENTS , 'CAUSE WE 'RE GONNA CLONE . WE 'RE GONNA MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO CLONE THE PATIENT DIRECTLY INTO HIS SUIT . AND THAT WAY , HE 'LL BE COMPLETELY DRESSED AT THE END OF THE OPERATION . IT 'S A FIRST IN CLONING , AND THEN WE COULD ALL JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE . WE DON 'T HAVE TO HANG AROUND THE CLOTHING ROOM WHILE HE SUITS UP . I THINK IT 'S TIME TO CHECK THE CELL STRUCTURE . SUGGEST IT 'S- - CHECKING THE CELL STRUCTURE . CHECKING THE CELL STRUCTURE !

WITH ONE OF THE GREATEST MINDS YOU 'VE EVER SEEN . YEAH , AND HIS ISN 'T SO BAD EITHER . YEAH . DON 'T COME NEAR US . ALL RIGHT . GET OUT OF HERE NOW . HE 'S BLUFFING . HE WOULDN 'T SHOOT THE NOSE . BLUFFING , AM I ? OKAY , CLOWNS , YOU ASKED FOR IT . MILES , I CAN 'T BELIEVE IT . I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT WE ACTUALLY DID IT . AN EYE FOR AN EYE , A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH AND A NOSE FOR A NOSE .

BUT , MILES , MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN DON 'T LAST . THAT WAS PROVEN BY SCIENCE . YOU SEE , THERE 'S A CHEMICAL IN OUR BODIES ... THAT MAKES IT ALL SO THAT WE ALL GET ON EACH OTHER 'S NERVES SOONER OR LATER . HEY , THAT 'S SCIENCE . I DON 'T BELIEVE IN SCIENCE . YOU KNOW , SCIENCE IS AN INTELLECTUAL DEAD END . YOU KNOW , IT 'S A LOT OF GUYS IN TWEED SUITS CUTTING UP FROGS ... ON FOUNDATION GRANTS AND- - OH , I SEE . YOU DON 'T BELIEVE IN SCIENCE .

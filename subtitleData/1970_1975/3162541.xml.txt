 Alan ! Pete ! Alan ! That ... Look ! What 's the matter ? That 's a flying reptile . - A what ? - A flying reptile ! I think it sees us . - I don 't believe it . - Well , what do you know . - Are you frightened ? - Of what ? Seeing a man fly ? A man ? Humans can 't fly . Yeah . It 's some sort of a homemade glider contraption . Get down . Let 's get out of here . We better get there first . A flying human ? They 'll kill him . Come on . Pete ! Galen ! I found him . Over here . - You hurt ? - No . - There . - Now , better . Well , you see , that gust of wind ... That gust of wind on that side ... I should put my weight on that side . It 's not that simple . Your design 's wrong . Sure , sure , I can correct . You see , if I ... No , never mind . You wouldn 't understand . Alan ! Those troopers spotted him . Come on . All right , this way . He got away . But we have the thing that flies . - Yeah , well , it 's very impressive . - You see , it will work . Leuric , you got your glider in the air , but it 's a wonder you weren 't killed . You have a superstitious fear of flying . I 've got a lot of fears , but that 's not one of them . You 'll kill yourself . - Now , how do you know ? - Believe me , they know . It 's impossible . No one has ever flown . I 'm the first . How could they know anything about it ? Leuric , listen , what you 've invented is a kind of a glider . A remarkable achievement , but it 's a dead end . Where do you go with it ? - Up into the sky . - For what ? Put that same thought and energy into something that can be useful . Yeah , invent a new kind of plow or something . I will fly . I will do what no human be ... Trying to steal my idea so you can take the credit . We 're not trying to steal it . We 're trying to help you . Listen , Leuric , if we worked on your glider taught you safety techniques , got you soaring like an eagle we 'd only be setting you up as a target . Some gorilla would see you , and pow ! I don 't care . I have to get on with my work . How long do you think it will be before they find you ? They already know that a human has tried to fly . They are not going to stop until they find that human . I won 't stop my work . Look , if you have to continue this project could you do it farther from town , where you won 't be spotted ? There is a place the apes avoid because of superstition ... No , it would take too much time to move my tools and materials . - It doesn 't matter . We 'll move you . - Yeah . Right . Now , let 's move this junk to wherever . You 're very good to me . I 'll show you . Several trips will be necessary . - Is this something to do with flying ? - No , I found it on the beach . A strange rock appeared after lightning struck . Sand must have melted , a hunk of glass formed . I 'll polish it , show you what you can do with it . If you don 't mind , Leuric . You expect us to believe a human flew ? - My troopers saw it . - Something even apes cannot do ? Dolman , I expect you to believe Konag . My garrison commanders are not in the habit of coming here to address the council for the purpose of lying . This is very interesting . But it 's no more than a toy . Is there any objection to having this human found , killed and any other such toys destroyed ? - No objection . Zaius , if I might have permission to speak ? I 'm just a female scientist with none of your wisdom in dealing with humans . But I merely wonder if this idea even though stumbled upon by a human , might not serve us . Ridiculous . How could a human idea serve us ? I don 't know . But it 's new and unexplored and what could be lost in further examination ? Yes , yes , go on . It 's not widely known , but there is reason to believe that our ancestors knew how to fly . What ? There are references , vague but strongly suggestive in books from the old days before the world was almost destroyed . Perhaps this human learned from some book he found . If he has such a book , it is punishable by death . He could infect the other humans . But in any case why bother with something which is just a worthless toy ? I 'm sure you 're absolutely right , Urko . And yet , I wonder , if flying were worthless would our ancestors have engaged in it ? How much more ? Galen and Leuric should be bringing the last of it . How you doing ? This is a round stone . It 's useless . - There you go . - A little innovation . I think I 'm gonna stay here , work on this . I can 't wait to see Galen 's face when he looks through a magnifying glass . Alan , Pete , they captured Leuric . I watched from my hiding place . There was nothing I could do . They took him away . - Why didn 't they just kill him ? - The only thing I can think of is they want to make a spectacle of him . How ? Public execution . Bring my baggage . Commander Konag , congratulations on capturing the human . Where is he ? He 's in a cell . Handled roughly , but he can answer your questions . I 'm sure he 'll be much more cooperative thanks to your handling . - What 's all this ? - Some things for use with the human and the others for my personal comforts , since I 'll be staying a while . The council gave you permission to deal with the human for a short while . And how long is a short while , Konag ? Three days ? Five ? Seven ? Nine ? We have no guest facilities ! This is a troop garrison ! I don 't mind the inconvenience . This will be perfectly adequate . - And , Philip , put those there . - Yes , madam . - These are my quarters ! - And it 's so generous of you , Konag . I shall be sure and tell Urko and the council how helpful you 've been . Now , I shall require a room and I 'm sure you can manage two or three sturdy tables . Beyond that , you just won 't even know that I 'm here . Thank you so much . My servant will carry your effects out . I 'll question the human shortly . Trooper . I 'm Carsia . You were told to expect me ? Take me to the human , Leuric . What 's that ? He 's being punished . He doesn 't show respect . Next time , eat what 's given you without complaining . - Stand up ! Stand up ! - You 're worse than these lower animals . Nothing 's worse than strength and authority without intelligence . Get out of here . I 'm so sorry . - Apes are not sorry for humans . - I 'm different from some apes . And I think you 're different from most humans . That 's why I 'm here . When this man has rested and had his hurts attended to , bring him to me . I needn 't warn you against a repetition of the brutality I just witnessed . - Gee , that 's a nice carriage . - Yeah . - You drive it ? - Yeah . - All the way from Central City ? - I drive Carsia a lot further than this . She 's a very important ape . - And you get to ride it , huh ? - Yeah . Gosh , you 're lucky . You know , if I was an ape that was as important as Carsia ... Is that her name ? - I 'd never come to this village . Nothing ever happens here . - Something happened . - What ? I don 't know . Carsia wouldn 't come all this way to talk to a human unless something important was going on . Oh , yeah . Why did you tell that guard not to beat me ? There 's nothing which can be accomplished by beatings which cannot be achieved in a more civilized manner . What do you want ? I won 't be questioned by a human for whom I 've requested decent treatment . I 'm sorry . That 's the first reasonable thing you 've said . - And I appreciate what you did . - I want to help you , Leuric . I 'm a scientist . I 'm interested in truth and knowledge . I am told that you know the secret of flying . Is this true ? Yes . Can you prove to me that a human , or an ape , could fly ? I can prove to you that I can fly . - How ? - By flying . - So you say . - No , I have flown . Well , almost . If they hadn 't taken my tools and materials from me . If I get out of here , if they don 't kill me , I will fly . All right , I will try again . A flying reptile was reported as being seen near here , or so I was told . I don 't know anything about flying reptiles ... You 're not interested . And you 're wasting my time ! You must have a superior . Where is he ? Konag is inspecting the outposts . He 'll be back tonight . There must be somebody else . There has got to be somebody besides you . - She 's busy . - She ? - In a garrison ? - Visiting from Central City . From civilization . I shall wait . Here . Wait outside . Is there anything else you need ? What else is there to need ? I 'm not familiar with tools . Some of these were developed by our ancestors . We 've since lost the knack of using them . Perhaps because we have humans to do our labors . I 'm sure you 'll know how to use them . This does seem an awkward device for driving a nail . It has another use . Very good . You 're clever with your hands . Just be equally clever with your head and design a device which will take you high into the sky . How much longer do I have to wait for this female ? Hello , I 'm Carsia . Hello , indeed . I 'm Protus . I am on an archeological expedition , and ... What are you doing in this forsaken place ? I 'm on an expedition of another sort . How may I help you ? You already have , by reviving my confidence in the fact that I am not the only ape on this planet with interests other than sleeping and eating . I myself have not found the company very stimulating . Do come in . So I have been trying to track down this rumor about this flying reptile . I 'm glad you did , but it wasn 't a reptile . I know , the guard told me . A flying human , I mean , that is much more of a curiosity . Well , we 'll know in a few days whether or not the human can fly . I would love to see such a thing . Well , stay . I 'd be delighted to have you present at the demonstration . You are kind . Well , I 'm not quite sure that 's the right word for me . - Charming . - Thank you . Well , I 'm not asking for compliments , although I do like to hear them . - Won 't you please sit down ? - Thank you very much . You don 't think that you 're kind ? I 'm just really not sure . I think I have other qualities . They 're more important . Such as ... ? Well , I think I 'd be more interesting if you found out for yourself . Well , I intend to try . But I very much doubt that I 'll find you 're unkind . That is hard to believe . Well , I suppose I could take credit for saving the life of a human who says he could fly . He 's promised to give us a demonstration in five days . If he fails , well ... Well , I hope he succeeds . I mean , just so I can see a human fly . I 'm eager too . That 's why I decided he should live . Galen , can 't Carsia help Leuric even if his flight is a failure ? Well , I can only go on what she 's told me . She 's very sympathetic . I know she 'd want to protect him . Yes , she 's that kind of ape . Getting a little hung up there on her , Galen ? If you mean what I think you mean I think you are jumping to premature conclusions . Which may be correct . What are we gonna do about Leuric ? - See that he flies . - A functional glider . We 're gonna have to make it for him . I 'm not sure we know enough to make a functional glider out of that junk . How you coming ? - Okay , Galen , we 're ready for it . - Be right there . Be careful with this . - I tell you , it is very hot . - Set it there . Okay . Now , keep it taut . Hold it as tight as we can . That 's amazing . Boiled tree sap and corn flour . That 's the best we could do . It 's called " glue . " - Galen , hold that a second , will you ? - I can 't . - Why not ? - My fingers are stuck together . Well , what do you think ? Yeah , I think it could fly , with luck . I do hope so . It 's very exciting . If you think the prospect of flying is exciting , wait till you take off . I will . You know , I can hardly ... Wait a minute . You mean , I take off ? Thank you very much . This all has been fascinating . - Galen . - Now , you wait a minute . If you tied me to that thing screaming and kicking I would find some way to keep my feet on the ground . It 's gotta be tested before we try to get it into Leuric . Yes , and I intend to watch one of you test it . And I shall applaud enthusiastically if you are successful . What would happen if an ape looked up and saw a human flying ? Well , he would shoot the human down . Right . When you 're hanging up there on a glider there aren 't a lot of places to hide . - Right . If an ape saw another ape flying , he 'd get shook up , but he wouldn 't shoot . But he 's not going to get shook up , because he won 't see an ape flying . - Galen , you 've got to do it . - It 's you or it 's , " Alas , poor Leuric . " Look , save your breath . Now , it is out of the question . I refuse . I absolutely put my foot down . Now , use your foot to kick off , right ? Now , brace yourself like I showed you . You ready ? - No way . - Good . Let 's go . - Easy , Galen . Let the wind do it . - You let the wind blow it ! He likes it . Well , Protus , what do you think ? It is marvelous . It 's absolutely marvelous . It is hard to believe that one can actually fly . How thrilling that would be . I 'll be the first to know when I fly tomorrow . Tomorrow ? But that 's two days earlier than Carsia said . Leuric 's been working enormously hard . He 's ready before we expected . - How nice . - Come , Protus . I 've had a new book sent from Central City . I 'm sure you 'll be interested . Carsia , I 'll be with you in one minute . I do want to take one last look at this marvelous bird . Very well . " Protus " ? Never you mind about that . Your glider will not fly . - It will . - It won 't . But we have built a glider that will fly . Now , it is being disassembled , and it 's being smuggled to you . This will fly , and I will fly it . You will break every bone in your stupid head . Now , you must stall for two days . See , we can 't get it delivered and reassembled in less time . You just want time to steal my idea so you can be the first to fly . - Protus ? - Coming . - Everything all right , Leuric ? Everything is fine . I 'll fly tomorrow . This is hopeless . It 's absolutely hopeless . I mean , even if we could get it into shape by the morning we couldn 't deliver it and assemble it in time . We 're going about this the wrong way . The first order of business shouldn 't be to deliver a glider that will fly . The first thing we gotta do is to stop a glider that won 't fly . - Are you ready , Leuric ? - All ready to move it to the cliff . I am afraid that Leuric is somewhat single-minded of purpose . It 's a characteristic of humans . I was trying to tell him yesterday that there are other areas of interest in science . See ? What is that ? This , which is a natural substance , is an unnatural device . Look . I call it an " expander . " Look , come here . Come here . See here , it 's a fly . Well , that 's fascinating , Protus . Leuric , come on , it 's your turn . See that ? This , it 'll expand almost anything . Look . See here . Look . See that ? Look . There 's something over there I want to show you and ask you about . I want your advice about it . It 's right at the end of that table . Over there . Right there . Look at this closely . See here ? A well-made joint , you 'd say ? But can you be sure ? How many mechanical failures have been caused by poorly fitting joints ? Weakened by small flaws that could have been exposed by my expander . Could help . I take a certain conceited pleasure in the way your mind works , Protus . Conceited ? It is uniquely , penetratingly , the mind of a chimpanzee . Don 't be modest . After all , are gorillas or orangutans capable of subtle ideas ? Now , you know , I had never thought of a gorilla as being subtle . No , they hold high authority because of brute force since they lack intelligence . Help ! Help ! Fire ! - What do you think caused it ? - It 's gone . Destroyed . Oh , pity . Your expander may have uses you never thought of , Protus . Now , that is amazing . Carsia , I cannot take credit for this . No . You will be known as the ape who made fire with an expander . Thank you . - My flight . - Oh , no , no . Merely delayed . You 'll have all the materials you need , and you may start again . I feel responsible for this . Let me make amends . I have these two servants ... They 're rascals , both of them but they are very , very clever with their hands . I will send for them , and they will bring all the materials they can provide to put this thing back together again . You two , what do you want ? - We 're the servants of Protus , sir . - Yes . More foolishness for that human to make into wings ? Yes , sir . - All right , take it in . - Thank you , sir . You know , Protus , I like doing things for you . Thank you . - Interesting ? - Very . Very . Galen burned the ... Galen burned the wings , didn 't he ? Deliberately ? Leuric , what do you want , an engraved apology ? We only ruined your glider because you would have broken your neck . - It would have flown . - This one 'll fly , and you 'll be flying it . All you have to do is assemble the pieces . I don 't believe it . Do you hear this guy ? Alan , what are we doing here ? Spinning our wheels . We should have left you up that tree . We could have let the troopers pick you up when you crashed . You were clever . You wanted to find out what I knew about flight first . Right , we risked our necks just so we could take lessons from Wobbling Willie and his wonderful , wiggling wings . Let 's go . Now , wait a minute . Wait . You 're ... You 're really trying to help me ? You really want me to fly ? That 's right . All right , I believe you . I don 't know why you 're helping me I don 't know why Carsia is , but I don 't care . As long as I get up there just once , I don 't care what happens after that . Well , that is very , very flattering . Oh , no , not flattery . It 's the truth . Every word . I am delighted to believe that chimpanzees are superior to other apes , seeing I 'm a chimp . I don 't know , however that agreement would be coming so easily from , let 's say a gorilla . Of course not . They haven 't the intelligence to recognize the obvious . I suppose patting oneself on the back could be considered a harmless and good form of exercise . I wanted you to read that book . I wanted you to know how we feel . We ? Who is the head of the council ? Zaius , of course . An orangutan . And who is commander of all the security forces ? Urko . A gorilla . Can you name me one chimp who occupies a position of top authority ? Just what are you hinting at ? - What do you want ? - I advised Urko of the delay in the flight test . - I expected you would . This is Konag , the garrison commander , Protus . Urko believes the human won 't fly . I know Urko 's views . He 's authorized me to execute the human if the test is delayed beyond tomorrow . And you ! You might want to arrange to have your things taken out by then . A gorilla in a position to give orders to you , to me to chimps who are far above him in intelligence . He gives orders to chimps , but he shoots humans . What about Leuric ? The test has been postponed until tomorrow . There 'll be no problems . Come in . The guard told us to report to you when we were through , sir ? A precaution . Of course . Well , are you through ? Yes . Is everything prepared for the flight ? - Yes . - Very good . Very well , you may go . Sir , I wondered if we could speak to you for a minute , please ? I am busy . What is it ? Well , there 's ... There 's something I 'm trying to remember we wanted to talk to you about , sir . Your servants don 't seem very bright , Protus . They 're not . Go . You can come back later if you can remember what it is you wanted . I just remembered what it was , sir , that we wanted to talk to you about . The last load we brought in , it wrecked the ... cart , sir . We want to show you . You permit them to bother you with nonsense like this ? No . Go ! Come on . Go at once ! Yes , sir . I 'll teach them some manners . I 'll be back in a minute . Now , what 's the matter ? What do you think is in that box in your girlfriend 's room ? - What box ? - The green one . The one that says " Fragmentation Cosmoline Pack . " I wondered , but I didn 't want to pry . Yeah . Fragmentation bombs . Lovely mama bombs with lots of baby bombs inside so when they blow , they blow all over the place . They were customarily dropped from airplanes . Right . Now , the question arises , what is that cute little chimp you 've been romancing in there doing with a case of instant death ? Well , now they 'll mind their manners . Now , tell me ... Thank you . - What were we talking about ? We were saying the chimps , who are the most intelligent and the best-equipped , are not in control of the government and the council . Yes . Yes , that 's what we ... By the way , I 've been meaning to ask you ... What is this ? The answer to some of the questions I 've been asking . For instance , why would I waste the time saving the life of a human ? Leuric means nothing to me . But if he can teach us to fly ... I don 't understand . The council chambers are guarded when the council is in session . No one can approach . The same is true of Urko 's headquarters . Now , Protus , think . If Urko , his troops and the council were eliminated who would control the world ? There are bombs in this box . To eliminate ? With Leuric 's wings , we can swoop down out of the night sky in the dark . Unseen , unheard . That is why I 'm determined to keep him alive until he can teach us to fly . Do you see , Protus ? Oh , yes . Absolutely . It 's perfectly clear . - What are you doing ? - Getting you out . Why ? No ! - Carsia is using you ! - I don 't care ! Get away ! She 'll blow up everything if she gets her hands on a glider ! There 's no time . The guards are coming . Pete ! Take care of the guard , I 'll bring him . Get away ! You can 't ... Get away ! Come on ! Now ! Go ! Come on ! Come on , come on ! There 's no chance . Let 's go ! You chose a human in preference to me ? In preference to what you 're planning . Take him away ! The test is canceled . The flight will proceed as scheduled . I 've arranged for the execution of Leuric and that renegade ape in the morning . I shall look forward to witnessing Protus ' execution after the test flight . Leuric will be shot too . There 'll be no test . A dead man can 't operate those wings . One of your troopers will take the human 's place . Risk the life of a gorilla in a pointless experiment ? Absolutely not ! - It 's all my fault . - Of course it is . Some humans are much more human than other humans , but you ... You are the most human . - I 'm sorry . - A lot of good that does . - How does that feel ? - Well , it 's numb . You know , even if I get out of here , I won 't be able to fly . It 's almost impossible ... Here we are , facing a firing squad , and all you can do is ... I don 't care what happens to the human but I want that flying device returned safely . Lf , in fact , it can fly . If you 're worried about them flying off with it ... Move out ! Lobar , bring the human here . Look . You have an open area marked off by my troopers . If you fly out of it , you 'll be shot down . - Well , now ... - Are you trying to signal ? No , of course he isn 't . The poor man is half frightened to death . - He doesn 't know how to tell you . - Tell me what ? He can 't fly with one hand . Look . Is this true ? - The test is canceled . - No , I insist the flight go on . And I still refuse to risk the life of an ape ! Well , it 's no good looking at me . You couldn 't force me onto that thing . If I am going to be killed I demand a decent , proper execution . Wait a minute ... Oh , no , no , no , no . Now you , you wait a minute . It is out of the question . It is absolutely ridiculous . Even if I were willing , I tell you , I don 't know how to fly . Will the wings support both you and him ? - Yes , they might . - But , no . Well , Konag , it seems we have solved two problems . I want to see if those wings can carry extra weight and you want to spare any of your troopers the risk of flying . But I protest ! And if they fall into the sea , they 'll drown . It 'll be no loss . You will fly . The human will ride along with you to show you how to guide the wings . Oh , Carsia . I knew you were cruel but I didn 't know how cruel . - Bring the wings ! More fun than the no-hitter I pitched in high school . Ready ? I am going to fly ! They 're flying . I knew it would work . I don 't know if I can control it . The wind is so strong . I made it happen , what nobody ever did before . You also may be killed the way no one 's ever been killed before . Here we go ! - Where are they going ? - Flying out to sea . Fire ! Shoot them down , both of them . Wait . You may not have to waste your bullets . Hold your fire . They 're dead . And so is the secret of flight . I wasn 't sure you 'd make it . I wish we hadn 't . It flew like a bird . I knew it would . I could have stayed up forever . Please , get me to the shore . Quick . No , we can 't . We 'd be spotted in a minute , shot on sight . I can 't . I 'd rather be shot . All right , everybody , let 's go . Keep your heads down . Try not to splash too much . Please , somebody shoot me . What 's wrong with him ? Ancient human disease . Seasickness . Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH ]

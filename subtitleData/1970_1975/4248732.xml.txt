 FRANCE INCORPORATED Chemical Museum France Inc . Foundation Tuesday , February 22 , 2222 I 'll leave you . You lived at the end of the last century ? Yes . The 70 's . We found a wonderful word : Aggressivity . Aggressivity within the reach of everyone . All out aggressivity . But nobody tried to get out of it ? We 'd say " escape " rather than " get out of it . " And I was the first one concerned , you can be sure . For those people ... violence ... we could sometimes deflect it , to consume it . I saw you ... I saw you throw her out . Yes ... It 's great . The excess . The spectacle . Everyone watching everyone . It 's the revolution . In the end , those people were pioneers . They blazed a trail for the great reconciliation . And you ? What were you doing during this time ? By then I 'd managed to eliminate all competition , so every distribution channel in France passed through me . New Order - Not Dead It 's cool . The car is there , everything seems calm . Hold on just a second ! I 'd like to make sure no one forgot anything . Heroin : 45 kg , 98 % pure . Origin : Josef Sedira refinery two doors : in front and behind . Pipeline : Marseilles , Argentina , Paraguay , Colombia , Bolivia , Panama Mexico and California . - Alright , go ahead . - Ciao . Police ! Hands in the air ! You 're trapped ! It 's a mistake ! It 's not my car ! I got the wrong car ! Bastards ! - Crap ! - Idiot ! This can 't be real ! This can 't be real ! This is when things started to get strange . It started by a disagreement within the board of directors . One of the most powerful of Europe . Thanks to collusion by a few members , they secretly financed drug traffic . No . Impossible . If the Americans move in to control everything here on site , nothing can guarantee our independence . I refuse . But how can you refuse an exclusive client ? Exclusive ? What do you mean by " exclusive " ? Excuse me . Interference ... Radio France Inter . Since when are they exclusive ? Nothing 's official yet , it 's a reciprocal commercial treaty . They set us up ! A play to buy us back ! You 're exaggerating . It 's only to limit risks . You know what the Americans want ! It 's clear what 's behind this all . " Behind all this . " You spoke of risks of accidents ... what accidents ? Gentlemen , there 's no need for drama , I propose we delay the discussion until a later meeting . Hey , I didn 't get an answer . You 'll have an answer , rest assured . I was living on the fly , The idea of owning a real home always caused me to panic . What did you do with your money ? - I financed some orpanages . - Oh ? Well ... Listen ! We don 't all just deal drugs for the money . It can also be a calling . ULYSSES Good evening . So ? I 'm very worried . The Americans are becoming more invasive . Now it 's certain they want to buy it all back . Buy what back ? 10 or so different corporations . What does that have to do with us ? Coincidentally , these same companies cover our financing . Don 't get excited . I 'm not getting excited . I control the heroin imports in France . I could cut them off at any time . They represent 80 % of our clientele . Exactly . They won 't resist a prolonged famine . Yes . Anyhow , we 'll need new capital as quickly as possible , and that 's not practical right now . Ha , that 's your problem . A few days later , a man they call the Brazilian contacted me . He was the Americans' right-hand man in France . He would usually give me their orders . Let us do our job and it 'll go fine . There 's the exception that proves the rule . What 's it to you , asshole ? Walking backwards can be learned . And kneeling with a gun to your head , want us to teach you ? No . Good . He 's coming . - Good evening . - Good evening . I have unpleasant things to say to you . Me too . It 's a good thing . He doesn 't give a damn . Go back with the others . But boss , it 's dark , we can 't even see where you are . Go back with the others . So OK then . I was told people lose their heads in finance , so listen carefully ... This is what you 'll tell your friends : They 're not my friends . Business associates , if you prefer . Tell them they can play games with financiers , But with me it will be different . This time they 're serious about a cleanup . A cleanup ... why ? Everything is going fine . You shoot at the cops , you make new changes almost every day , and you think everything is fine ? That 's routine . Listen ... That 's the past . Old methods no longer work . My arrival has nothing to do with a gang war . It 's not healthy to scuffle in every little corner . So what will it be then ? Martians ? Sex with your sister , I 'm afraid . And to be reasonable . Nobody wants you out , they just want your cooperation . This is a large-scale operation . Martians go home ! So ? We 'll have to attack on all fronts at once . You saw him ? Yes , yesterday . He 's taking it personally . He didn 't even want to listen . Well then , we 'll take care of him . Zorro had arrived , and the waltz of the bigwigs ... was beginning . It 's dry . Ah , thank you . Could we have a few more explanations please ? This contract is not clear to you ? - You either ? - It 's clear to me ! Are you familiar with our folklore madam ? So it 's a merger ... But why let ourselves be bought so easily by the Americans ? I know I won 't be signing such a thing . I 'll wait at home for more clarification . Miss , please . Happy signing , gentlemen . The young lady is in the living room . Ah . Here . This is worth a lot of money . Your turn now . Perfect ! Perfect ! Well done ! Now , we can move on to serious things . Police ! What 's with you ? We 'll need to search your home . We got a tip . It 's not up to me . We 'll work as quickly as we can . Pardon me . Chief ! Heroin . Here is a photo of the trafficker arrested earlier today . An industrialist who claims to know nothing about heroin seized in his home . Why him ? I didn 't even know him . Exactly . They chose him to start with someone who knew nothing . So he can spill nothing . Just an example for the others . A warning . And the woman who just arrived ? What is she exactly ? Difficult to know for sure ... She seems rather quiet . A good mother . We should kill all of them . They asked me for a meeting tomorrow . Let 's hear them out . Oh sure ! We sit waiting and they just offer proposals . Alright , I 'll call you tomorrow night . Why don 't you answer him ? He asked you a question . What question ? I don 't know , ask him . You always act like he 's not there . - That 's it , I 'd prefer he wasn 't . - I am here ! Listen , you 're free to work with whoever you want . Plainly , this has become much too serious . We can 't keep playing cowboys and indians . - I 'm a cowboy or an indian ? - Be quiet . You didn 't understand that you were asking dumb questions ? Are you trying to scare me ? What are you getting at ? - We trust you . - Not me . Don 't worry . I 'll explain to him why we can trust you . Is it serious ? I could be , yes . Oh my ! You shouldn 't work yourself into such a state . About 49 billion francs profit in the American market each year . Such sums become incompatible with a clandestine operation . Where are we going ? The machine room . Can you guess what is inside these containers ? - Bananas ? Dishtowels ? - Dollars . Bank paper . An exchange closes , a transfer error ... and this falls into our lap . And so ? It 's not so bad . Ah , you think so ? Tell me what you would do with this big pile of paper . I 'd pass it off in Switzerland . Once it 's in Switzerland , then what ? I try to re-invest it . Until the day when , for whatever reason , someone asks where it came from . It can 't be helped . All this money is illegal . - What if it were legal ? - Say what ? - If this money were legal . - I don 't understand . Suppose we legalize all drugs . Legalize ? You 're kidding ? Not at all . Prohibition was useful in its first stage . Now we have the means to go further . And take over control of it all while you 're at it ? The old traffickers are irresponsible and so inept . We no longer need them . Don 't count on me to become your employee . What a country ! Shouldn 't you be in school ? Why ? You care about my education ? I tried your contract , don 't ask me for any more . And don 't try the planted packet trick ... Because I 'll have something to say about it ! He 's all yours . Good evening . Good evening . Get out of my car . Who are you ? - Start the car . - Not a chance . So ? You don 't frighten me ... - But you 're crazy ! - Easy , just start the car . Easy ! Easy ! Easy ! Why are you trying to put new networks into place ? Some what ? Leave me alone ! One : You tell us your financing plan . Two : You pack your bags . Financing plan ... what are you talking about ? Help me . Quickly ! I 'll die ! Just enough time , if you talk quickly , of course . Alright . OK . That 's all , it 's all I know . That 's fine . Hurry , get me to a doctor . Sorry . That 's not part of the plan . He slit his wrists only hours after the hunt for him began . This affair is likely related to the arrest of another industrialist ... a few days ago . - We sure could do without TV . That 's not what I meant . I 'm sorry . It 's nothing . It 's better your reflexes are still good . DRUGS : A GROWING CRISIS I don 't see what they all have against drugs . After all , they only kill a few hundred people a year , that 's nothing , compared to alcohol , or ... - You don 't understand anything ... - It 's all marketing . - What ? Oh right , I get it . We 're seeing the first results of a vast dragnet . Security has now been tightened at all borders . Let us hope this police team fishing expedition , along with their American colleagues , will be miraculous . See that ? I 'm sure ... They seem incompatible ... Good day . Sit down , we have finished . That 's the ending , it won 't work well at all . We can ask the computer , then we 'll know better . OK , let me know the results . Yes , alright . Good day , sir . What is this thing ? You know , good commercials are rare . We need novelty , especially for what we 'll be selling . You 're really on the side of freedom aren 't you ? Exactly . Yes , that 's it . How far have you gotten ? I 've managed to control almost all of his teams . Perfect . Now he 'll have to move everything himself . And we won 't help him . Careful , don 't let up on him . We 'd have no way to recuperate the imports and refineries . Don 't worry . Fear is like sex : It can be useful . Now what 's going on ? - Is there a problem ? - Tell him to let go , he 's crazy ! What happened ? He doesn 't want to buy anymore ! He nearly took off while I phoned you . Of course I did ! He started punching me ! Let him go ! Stop ! Damn it all ! Damn ! Calm down , let him explain . Why don 't you want to buy ? You found better elsewhere ? No , not at all . It 's just we 'd rather , the situation was clearer ... What situation ? I sell , you buy , it 's very clear . Listen , there are rumors ... - Word is you 're alone now . - You 're pissing me off . - I 'll let you two discuss it . - No ! OK . I 'll buy . Hell , if it was my men , they 'd wait until I left , no ? Who even knows anymore ? These are not cop tactics . Then we should get out . Where 's the car with the merchandise ? Third one up there . Let 's go . Hey ! Wait for me ! Now what do we do ? What do you think ? We open the the doors , get in and bust through . Sure , we 'll all get killed . You can stay if you like . Very good . I hope he 'll get the message this time . Madam ? It 's 10 P.M. the mail is done , may I go ? Of course , see you tomorrow . Once I lived like a sheep in a herd . My day-to-day life was terrible . - OK ? - It 's fine . Then one day ... And since then ... At last I am a man . CHEMISTRY RECREATES THE NATURAL CONDITIONS OF LIFE . Sure , but don 't you think it 's too ... too childish ? Childish ? Not at all . In advertising ... Good evening . Good evening . How are you ? Not very well . Remain seated ! This is not very smart . She will follow me without resisting . You 're kidnapping her ? But why ? Let 's say it 's the only means of pressure I have left . You really don 't understand a thing do you ? Listen to me ... And you 'll have to quickly make up your mind . Imagine what could happen in your great country if supply is cut off . Come on , let 's go . No funny business ! Promise me you won 't hurt her at least . That will depend on you . One second then . What do we do next ? You , nothing . Let me work in peace and you 'll get her back . No funny business ! You said that already . - No funny business ! - A bit to the right . Hello , it 's me . The hysteria has begun . You may proceed as planned . The others too . No , don 't worry , you won 't stay long . See you soon . Good . Another rape . Hello ? Is this the number to report people ? Good . There 's a strange man in a car on the street ... His music is so loud that we can 't sleep . He must be on drugs , it 's impossible ! Yes , General DeGaulle Street . DeGaulle . Oh , damn ... Music . Turn it down you savage ! Stop it . Turn it off right now ! You called the cops didn 't you ? You piece of garbage ! Garbage ! Thank you for calling us . Pass by the station tomorrow any time . It 's no problem , sir . News of the providential capture of an international drug smuggler ... known as The Brazilian . His arrest , along with others in a sweeping raid ... Has left underworld leaders on the run ... Police now hope interrogations will lead to the kingpin ... of the few who control heroin in France . No ! That 's our last one . They got what they deserved . DRUGS - RASH OF ARRESTS You think this is good for us ? Well ... explain ? One : Our financiers disappear . Two : The Brazilian gets arrested . Three : Our regular teams are in jail . Conclusion : Why should our dealers still trust us ? But it 's not our fault ! Take a trip to Marseilles , then you 'll understand . What ? They refuse to deliver ? I couldn 't even find a contact . Good thing we grabbed her kid then . Sure , that 's it . I don 't want to go to jail ... - Me neither . - Then we must do something . What shall we do ? Sleep on it and think . We can 't think any more than we already have ! - Say ... she never sleeps ? - No ! Doesn 't eat , doesn 't want to move from her couch ... At night I have to stay here , it 's really creepy to see her watching me , eyes wide open in the dark . They 're truly a special breed of people . Bah ... she 'll get used to it . I hope so ... poor kid . What ? Well , she 's nothing in all this , it hurts me to see her go hungry . OK , I 'm going to bed . See you tomorrow . Good night . What 's with you ? What ? Hungry ? Is that it ? Hungry ? Food ? Miam miam ? Fantastic ! Over here , we don 't serve people hot dogs . What 's going on ? Hey ... what happened ? Damn it , talk to me ! Oh my god . Boss . Damn . Oh my god . Not sure , maybe some sort of fit . What did you do to her ? Nothing at all , I swear ! Then what did you try to do ? Nothing ! When I came out , she was lying over there . I don 't understand . You don 't understand why she was lying there ? Is that it ? But I didn 't touch her , I swear ! Go ahead . What are you waiting for ? I thought you were cured of this . I didn 't do anything . Shut up , you 're making it worse . What are you doing ? I 'm phoning her mother . Why ? Guess . What 's wrong ? Something not right ? As if somthing could go wrong . Well then good , please continue . I had to decide to swallow my pride . Damn ... This is not easy to say . It was nice of you to buy her a dress , but you shouldn 't have . I know . It seemed to make her so happy . Don 't you find it sinister here ? Think so ? I really like it . It brings back good memories . Let 's go have a drink . Why do you drink that junk ? So I can burp and be reformed in case of war with the U.S. You know it gives you cancer ? No . Why isn 't it banned then ? Just before he died , Walt Disney , only great modern U.S. visionary said : " Tomorrows ' politics can be boiled down to two things : " " Prohibit or permit , and only the weak prohibit . " Who are you exactly ? Where do you come from ? C.I.A. , Wall Street of the Mafia ? How about you ? Who do you speak for ? We have to obtain as quickly as possible the legalisation of all chemical substances . What you still call " drugs " here . What do you need me for ? Any revolution needs a king , and papers call you the King of Heroin . - Perfect , isn 't it ? - That 's called a scapegoat . If you wish . We 'll provide you with merchandise for a time ... Sell it like you did before . We 're only asking you to play your usual role . What could be easier ? - Go talk somewhere else , damn ! - What 's with this guy ? If you don 't like music , shut up ! Bah , it 's just accordion . Good evening . - Let 's hurry . - Of course . Don 't spit ! Do you do that in your own car ? - This is real garbage ! - And prices have doubled . What ? ! No way ! In that case ... Take it easy . Look out front . Be careful , they 're jonesing and will do anything for their fix . I was right to be wary . When you start selling guys out to the cops , you 'll do anything . I never ratted on anyone . Ohh , you 're making me sad . What do we do ? I pay regular price , take the car , and that 's the last time we see each other . And you hand over your weapon . - Do I shoot him in the face ? - No . Do what he says . Then we all die . No , just take it from him . He understood . Here then , it 's all there , let 's go . Take it easy now . No heroics , we 're leaving now . What 's going on ? You can see same as me . Bastards ! What an idiot ! Wait for me ! Tranquilizers and stimulants are already part of daily life but results are mediocre . We need a read cure . The only one possible is joy . Pleasure . Euphoria . All these things that are dangerous for a society if they are prohibited ... uncontrolled . Quality of life must be made more cost-effective . You 're very persuasive . Yet the government thinks public opinion isn 't quite ready . One question : What to do when the economically weak want to taste the forbidden fruit at any cost ? You 're risking civil war . Maybe . But for the moment ... For the moment ? Listen . Last night a drug addict is killed in the streets . This morning we find three corpses killed by heroin , cut with 80 % rat poison . Well , this is what we must stop right away . Illegality is disorder . Excuse me . Hello ? Ah yes , put him on . Tell me , what 's this joke ? What did you make me sell exactly ? Rat poison ? Three guys are dead now . How does that make me look ? When ? Not before tonight . Alright , see you later . ... no communication nothing works in this damned ... ... nothing works ! My god , it 's dial tone withdrawal . Will you give me a dial tone ? Hey ? You think this is funny ? Asshole ! So ? You can 't seem to stop playing war ? Give me time to learn . My first time selling rat poison . If I 'd warned you , you wouldn 't have sold it . Ah ? You think ? Rest assured , from now on , it will all work automatically . We 've already centralized everything . And what do we say ? You want me to thank you ? That would be nice , no ? Listen , you made us no gift . This was an unbelievable mess . I live by a personal code . In the end , I really like you . Me too , we 're alike . Not at all . I can be replaced . Nothing depends on me personally . You 're much too modest . Any outfit depends on its leaders . You 'd prefer being beaten by someone stronger than you , eh ? Nothing is so bad if it leaves one you can respect . Is that right ? I don 't understand what ... Damn it . ... the pass is up the right side oh , that 's incredible yes , penalty on the field ... Alright . Coming ! It 's not safe to stay alone at night , in an isolated place . Bring him over this way . - Lay him on the sofa . - Good idea . Why do you laugh ? I spit better than you do . That 's true , you 're making progress . - Know what 's in this ? - I don 't give a damn ! It 's what I bought from you . What you stole , you mean . Oh damn ! He sells rat poison and still dares to answer . Rat poison ? Ever seen someone with poison in his veins ? But I didn 't know ! Worst thing is , it 's probably true . Someone 's trying to ruin our reputation . And succeeding . Haha , you 're funnier than I am . Maybe so . Say , maybe he wants a snack too ? I 'm trying to get information . You 're chicken . Well ... I need revenge . Let 's go ! We could even sterilize it for him first . Understand how we appear to our clients ... the ones we have left . Shut up , let me die in peace , damn ! As you wish . Hello , paramedics ? Another victim of the killer heroin ... With this growing massacre , the public demands answers ... In an attempt to see clear , we 've gathered a panel of experts ... - Gentlemen , the floor is yours ... - My children , the question now is not ... how to fight against drugs , but ... For a parrot chorus , this is better than opera ! You know quite well , overproduction is out of control . We need to sell other things besides material products . It 's urgent that we work less , pollute less ... Most importantly , pharmaceutical industries promise to pay for daycare , and hospitals for the worst drug cases . That 's enormous progress . What have alcohol producers done to help alcoholics ? Not much , truth be told . So you see ? Gentlemen ... There he is . - Your card . - What card ? It 's Saturday , you need your weekend card . Weekend card ? Ration card , if you prefer . Rationing what ? Anti-traffic jam rationing . You 're only allowed one weekend a month . No card , you must turn around . Someone always trying to beat the system , eh ? Don 't back up ! Take the service exit . REJECTED - EXIT MANDATORY And this is why the youth wish to live communally ... Yes , and this recalls the monasticism of early Christianity , which was itself a rebellion . Chemical experience then doesn 't necessarily lead to revolt ? Tomothy Leary said , " LSD is the blessed host of modern times . " Agreed . Then we 'll hold a referendum . " Yes " or " No " to legalization . You 've adopted the common sense solution . The only one possible , really . Thanks to you , I can go home now . I was going to suggest that . We Europeans really , really , value keeping our independence . Someone 's here . Is that the guy ? Hello , how 's it going ? Don 't go ! We 're alone . Stop ! We need you ! Thanks , I know that . Courtesy of you , by the way . No , that 's all over . Doesn 't seem so , since you 're back . Easy , let me explain . I was used just like you . Except you were with them against me . I was with no one . They needed me for a short time . They wanted it to look like a break down around you . That you were isolated . That 's why they asked to put me in jail , promising to release me right away . They were happy to be rid of me . You 're a hero ! You can be our figurehead ! Leave me alone ! No , you fought alone against chemistry , and then gave up , bravo . Now you should get hip , get with the program . We need your experience just like we need his . Listen . We 're putting together a protest movement against ... The legaization of maximum capitalist profit . Compulsory heroin , planned excess , it 's crap ... Who is this guy ? Go get the car . I 'll talk to him . OK , but if he 's stubborn , he can go fuck himself . We 're just proposing using who you are to your advantage . What advantage ? Taking your place in an emerging market . Nobody can afford to compete with them ! Sure , we just need to choose the terrain . The counterculture ! Ever heard of it ? - So are we decided ? - That one pisses me off . Be quiet , he 's the son of a high-placed official . He can be useful . Come , we 'll show you our plans . COUNTER-AD # 1 Know that when government says to take it to the limit , they 're talking heroin of death , they 're thinking genocide ! Attention ! They want to inject napalm into our veins . Hippies ! Yippies ! Marginals from all countries ! Unite ! Remain outlaws ! Our drugs are not their drugs ! Our metric not their metric ! Fly ! Fly ever higher ! Don 't get bogged down in shit by their aseptisized syringes ! Chemical War is declared ! JOIN THE REVOLUTIONARY ADDICT LIBERATION FRONT And how will you broadcast this ? Listen to this : Chemical Needs - A First Accord We announce the creation of an international committee , led by an American woman , a pioneer of legalization , a woman from the race who influenced an entire era . Here we go . They found a woman for the times . But of course ! This is what we 'll do : We simply kill her . We take out their leader . We make an example of her , to show the world our existence . It 's the best publicity possible . Plus , I really feel like it . She disrespected me too much . Freedom ! This is my first public speech , I won 't talk too much about myself . - You know me . - Louder ! I was a trafficker , I no longer am . I was an outlaw , I decided to remain one ! My past you can read in newspapers . But you won 't read the lesson I learned : We must unmask them before it 's too late ! Today , I want to destroy the image of me they created . Our image too ! They called me " gangster " to have you believe they were against me . When in fact , I was working directly for them . - And they could remain " honest folks " . - We are all the underworld ! We are all the underworld ! We are all the underworld ! FOR FREE AND SUBVERSIVE EXCESSES ! AGAINST OFFICIAL SUICIDE DRUG BARGAINS ! Frenchmen and Frenchwomen no longer need to risk their lives . At home , in front of their TVs , in all safety , Chemistry will bring intense , enriching joys . This use of chemicals by powers is no more no less than fascism . Leisure civilization must become a reality . Yes to legalization ! Vote Yes in the referendum ! When people are asked to answer " Yes " or " No " things become complicated . - What are our means of action ? - Any means . He showed us the way . Provocateurs scream " Death ! " Legalization 's goal is actually an end to the underworld . The referendum " Yes " is a " No " to disorder . Their final goal is control of society via pharmaceuticals . A end to material growth ! No to anti-angst pills . Down with anti-revolt shots . Let 's return to spiritual values . Let 's build a society that satisfies men 's fundamental needs . ... men 's ... fundamental ... needs . Good . I 'm going to bed . See you tomorrow . OK , I 'll check the proofs . This must go out tomorrow . Oh , it 's you . Going home ? - Yes , yes . - You want me to walk you ? No , don 't bother . See you tomorrow . Oh shit ! He 's been kidnapped ! - What ? Who ? - Him ! - Some guys threw him in a car . - Know who it was ? They didn 't look like cops . Well-dressed , fancy car and everything . Damn it , I think I know what this is . Damn it ! Hello ? Give me extension 22 please . Hello ? Yes ? Ah , good evening unworthy son . Yes , that 's right . Don 't worry , we 're not going to eat him . There . He just walked in . Want to speak with him ? As you wish . Good night unworthy son . Ah , call your mother some day , if it 's not too much hassle . - Pleasure . - What 's with these procedures ? Please sit down . No thanks , I 'm in a hurry . As you wish . Why did you kidnap me ? First to congratulate you , and then to make a proposal . We want to help you . We want to give you the means to continue on a larger scale . We 'll need people like you to save the revolutionary image of drugs . To sell a product , we must make it exciting . If they 're not illegal , drugs risk being thought of as dish soap or toothpaste . You want me to work for you ? We need opposition , Big Brother states get old fast . My god . My god ! My god ! My god ! And I guarantee you 'll remain completely free . - And if I refused ? Publicly ? - Fantastic ! It 's a great idea to begin your campaign ! So we 'll pretend to accept , and wait until we 're stronger , then hop ! We 'll overtake them . It took only 50 idiots applauding , for you to lose your head in all this . - What does this mean ? - What does this mean ? It means if they paste us in all the newspapers and on TV we 're fucked . Reclaimed . You understand ? Are you stupid ? You want to stop when we can make a big step forward ? Take a social promotion , you mean ? Reclaimed movements cannot grow . So then ? What will you do ? Self-immolation in Place de la Concorde ? - Maybe , yes . - You 're doing what they hoped . They hoped we would help them . Helping them isn 't giving your blessing , in the end . You 're just a piece of shit fucking rich daddy 's boy . Back to work . This fucked-up referendum is the day after tomorrow . Here we go , at this moment across the country , polls are opening . We begin with breaking news : The RALF , the Revoltionary Addicts ... who paradoxically waged a passionate campaign against drug legalization , has just disbanded . Now a few scenes of the voting in France . New communiqué : The RALF has now become RAF : Revoltionary Addict Front " This is only the beginning ! " Excuse me ... We thank the voters for their frank , overwhelming " Yes " . The new law will be put to the Senate in the coming days . We apologize , the RAF leader refused comment saying only , " TV is for idiots . " - Did you clean it after ? - Well , yeah . Oh , don 't take that harried tone . - If you don 't , then I have to . - Yeah , yeah . - Dad ? - Uhh ? When can shoot up too ? - You know , it 's not a good habit . - You 're one to talk . But I know what I 'm doing . I can quit at any time . - I have willpower . - Willpower ! Ah ... Stop mumbling will you ? Just watch your TV ! Hashbang : The hash of guerillas of the future ! Hashbang : The hashish of rebels . - Hey , don 't smoke it all ! - Leave her alone , she needs this . This sucks ! I 'm sure she 's just faking it ! Will you be quiet ? ! Calm down OK ? Oh ! It 's starting ! Here 's part 2 of our series on the troubled , heroic time of Prohibition . Will Heroin Queen be up to the challenge from Amphetamine Prince ? Good , very good . Buddha butt-fucking Papa Mao . Bernadette of Lourdes naked . Millet 's Angelus . What 's this tranced-out tribe ? - Australian aborigines . - Really ? Well very good . It will be tough to decide between these great ad ideas . - Well that 's your job . - True , that 's my job . If I had to rely on you idiots , we could put the key under the mat . Aww , why say that ? That 's not very nice . You 're mocking me . Don 't get excited . You don 't like our ideas ? Ideas ? You dare call those ideas ? Buddha , Angelus , aborigines ? Why not add pop music ? Or environmentalists ? That would be a new twist . Listen , you shouldn 't put us down like that . My god . Brains like yours even the most demented horoscope writer wouldn 't want . - I don 't need to listen to this . - Stay there ! Can 't handle guys who think they 're boss . Stay there I said ! Stay there ! Stop it ! Stop , you 're hurting me . Let go of him ! That guy 's a menace , they should lock him up . - What 's with you ? - I don 't know , I 'm burned out . - I 'm sick of this stupid job . - Relax then , take a vacation . - Yeah , he can go get cured ! - Leave him alone ! No , he 's right , you 're both right . I 'm going to take a break . Orchestra seat . Move out , old fool ! NO SMOKING OR SHOOTING UP Hey . Can 't read the sign ?

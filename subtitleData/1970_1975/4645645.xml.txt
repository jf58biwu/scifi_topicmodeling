 All right , cut ! - So , John , what did you think ? - Great , Dad , great . Come on , let 's take a look around . - Be quiet ! - Sorry about that . 'Unidentified flying objects , bearing 012-48 ... ' - Still maintaining course . - Termination ? Should be through any second . - The Interceptors ? - They didn 't make contact . - They what ? - They 're coming in too fast . Nearly home , John . How 'd you make out with that model boat I 've sent you ? - I finished it . - You finished it ? Straker . All right , Alec . Thanks . I 'll be in about 6 o 'clock . Right . Do you want to see it ? - The boat , Dad . - Oh , sure . You bet I do . Moonbase to SHADO Control . Speed SOL 1,4 . - SOL 1,4 ? That 's crazy ! - They 're changing course . A correction . One maintaining flight path . The second , new course : 042-183 ! I don 't get it . One 's veered off , the other 's coming in so fast it can 't possibly land . Wait for me , Dad . Hello , Mary . Hello , Ed . You 're late . Yes . We were having such a great time , I thought an extra half hour ... Mary ! Could you make it a week later next month , say , the 18th ? The 18th . Yes , that 'll be fine . Listen , I 'd like to talk to you about John . Is he ... ? No , no , he 's fine . - We 're both fine . - Mary ! We 're all perfectly all right . Johnny wanted to show me something . I think you better go . I 'll explain to Johnny . Right . Goodbye , Ed . Dad ! Dad ! Dad , Dad ! Dad ! Johnny ! Johnny ! I couldn 't do a thing , he just came running out . Johnny ! Ed ! Well , do something ! 'Green alert , St Mary 's Hospital . 'Patient suffering head injuries , over . ' 'Dr Avery , please . Dr Avery , please . ' The doctor will see you soon . They came out of surgery 10 minutes ago . He is as well as can be expected . Thank you . Termination coming through . Ireland , west coast . - It 's still coming in too fast . - Range 7 million . Confirm . 1,4 . Moonbase to SHADO Control . We still have UFO on positive track . Confirm speed SOL 1,4 . It must slow soon . 75,000 . - Reducing speed . - Alert ground radar . Radar areas B142 and 144 , red alert . Sky 1 airborne . Proceeding to search area . ETA 21 minutes . Mrs Rutland ? I 'm Dr. Segal . No , please don 't get up . How is he ? Well , the boy has a fractured right femur . He 's also got a compound fracture of the tibia and fibula . There 's serious internal haemorrhage . We 've given him a transfusion . - May we see him ? - Not just now , I 'm afraid . As you probably realise , your son has an allergy to antibiotics . - Yes , when he was a baby , he was ... - When he was 3 months old , he was critically ill from a Terramycin injection . - I 'm the boy 's father . - I see . Well , the problem is one of elimination . We have to find a suitable antibiotic . It takes time . There must be something . Well , there 's the new American anti-allergeretic drug . - Will it do the job ? - Well , it 's been tested . - Its supply is very limited . - But available . In America , yes . We need it urgently . Within the next few hours . We 'll fly some over . I 'll charter a plane it 's necessary . I 'm afraid there won 't be time . I 'll take care of it . What are you talking about ? How can you ? I said I 'll take care of it . He 's still my son . If you 'll let me have the details , Doctor . Yes , naturally . I have to leave . You always had to leave . We 'll stay and see the boy through , Mary . Tell your contact to ask for Dr Ashley . Miss Ealand , contact our people in New York . I want a special courier to pick up a drug from the Westmoor Hospital . Take down these details . 4,800 miles from impact . Speed ? - 24,000 knots . - He 'll never make it . We have it on ground radar . Impact confirmed . - Do we have a grid reference ? - Yes . Area B-14208 . Just off the west coast of Ireland . - Tell Captain Carlin to overfly . - Yes , sir . Crazy coming in at that speed . - Could it have been damaged ? - I don 't see how . The Interceptors didn 't get near it . The aliens don 't usually make that kind of mistake . At least they 're fallible . - Miss Ealand . - Yes , sir . Has that drug been picked up yet ? Yes . They 're taking it to the airport . Fine , fine . I 'll arrange for the transporter myself . Yes , sir . Straker . 'Voiceprint positive . Commander Straker . ' Keep in contact with Carlin . I doubt if he 'll tell us much . - Yes , sir . - What 's the situation , Alec ? Two UFOs . One veered off , the other one crashed . Western Ireland . Its entry speed was too high . Right . Sky 1 will look for wreckage , but I don 't suppose there 'll be much to see . Fine . - Is everything all right ? - Is it ever ? I was going to grab a bite to eat . Care to join me ? No , Alec , I 've got a few things to clear up here . You go ahead . All right . See you later . Tell the SHADO New York Transporter to stand by for immediate takeoff . 'But it doesn 't leave for 7 hours . ' - I said " immediate take-off ! ' - ' Yes , sir . ' No calls , Miss Ealand . And would you get me 012-414 , please ? Intensive Care Unit , please . Hello , I 'm enquiring about a patient , a young boy . John Straker . Well , there must be . John Rutland ? Yes , he could be under that name . No change ? Thank you . Well , Mrs O 'Connor . There 's not a lot wrong with you . I could 've told you that myself , Doctor . I 'll bet you could . I 'll drop in next time I 'm passing . Won 't you stay for a cup of tea ? No thanks , it 's getting late and I have to go over to the Regan farm . - Say goodbye to the doctor , Billy . - Don 't be daft . You 're a naughty boy . I 'll see you to the door , Doctor . I have to treat my gentlemen callers with great respect or else they won 't come back . Sky t to Skydiver Control , it crashed about 100 yards offshore . I 'm going around once more before the light fades . Did you hear that ? What was it , Billy ? I 'm sure I heard a noise . Didn 't you hear it , Billy ? Is anyone there ? I know someone 's there . Oh . You must excuse me . You see , I 'm blind . What are you doing ? What are you looking for ? There 's nothing of value here . Please . Please don 't touch the bird . - Where 's that Transporter ? - ' Just taken off . ETA London 23 : 30 . ' Fine . I want a car and an escort at the airport to meet it . 'Yes , sir . ' Great steak . Medium rare , side order of salad . Sounds very appetising . Yeah , it was . It certainly was . Look , it 's pretty quiet here . There 's nothing you can do . Why don 't you go home ? What home ? Who are you ? - What 's the position , Peter ? - ' Sky 1 has re-docked . 'Skydiver proceeding to crash area . ETA 15 minutes . ' Fine . Contact us the moment you have anything . 'Roger , Control . ' I still can 't figure out why it came in so fast . To avoid the Moonbase Interceptors . It 's possible . The moment it passed Moonbase it had plenty of time to decelerate . - That the Transporter ? - Yes , sir . 23 : 30 hours confirmed as ETA . Have my car outside in 30 minutes . - I 'm going home . - Yes , sir . Oh , Alec . Maybe that UFO tried to decelerate but couldn 't because it 'd been hit . The Interceptors were way out . What else could have caused it ? The second UFO . The one that veered off . Tell Carlin to look for wreckage with damage not consistent with the crash . Right , sir . Right . Thank you , SHADO Control , we 'll do that . Out . - Anything ? - Not a sign . - Steer 042 . - Yes , sir . A Block , night nurse speaking . Yes , she 's still here . It 's for you . 'Dr Jones . Dr Jones . ' Yes ? Oh , it 's you , Ed . No , there 's no news . The drug is on its way . Everything will be all right , Mary . Yes . Yes . Yes , I will . No , no , I 'm fine . I want to stay here . Don 't let Johnny down this time , Ed . Don 't let us down . All right . Bye . That could be it . About 50 yards ahead . Couple of degrees to port . Stop engines . I 'll take a look . Release a marker buoy and inform Control . Yes , sir . Tell me . Who are you ? Why don 't you answer me ? Why won 't you speak to me ? What 's that noise ? What are you doing ? Why don 't you go away ? Why don 't you leave my house ? I want you to hear something . It 's important . - Play it back . - ' Yes , sir . ' 'Why don 't you go away ? Why don 't you leave my house ? ' It cut in 3 minutes ago on our waveband . - Cut in ? - Clear as a bell . Estimated signal strength 1500 megawatts . That 's as powerful as a medium-sized commercial transmitter . - Do we have any bearings ? - Ireland , the west coast . What is that noise ? What is it ? I 'm only trying to feel your face . 'Don 't you understand ? I 'm blind . 'Why , you 're trembling . Why don 't you answer me ? 'Why don 't you tell me who you are and what it is you want ? 'Because then I might be able to help you . ' UFO crashes off the west coast of Ireland . And an old lady broadcasts from the same area with a powerful transmitter . It can 't be coincidence . - Cancel my car . - Yes , sir . Did you get closer bearings ? No , sir . We 'd have to triangulate from ground vehicles on the area . And there aren 't any . Where 's the nearest Transporter ? Just over the Atlantic . 200 miles out . - Coming in from New York ? - Yes , sir . I thought that wasn 't supposed to take off until 1400 hours . Correct , sir , but it 's been en route for 50 minutes . Straker 's orders . He must be psychic . Close outer hatch ! - Outer hatch closed . - Evacuate ! Open inner hatch ! Opening inner hatch . Inner hatch open . I want these shots developed and sent to Control as soon as possible . How 'd it look ? Part of the metallic structure have practically been vaporized . It had been fired on by something before it crashed . Captain Carlin just radioed these in . There 's no doubt . That UFO was damaged before it crashed . But by what ? Two UFOs are sighted . One veers off , the other crashes in Western Ireland . From the same area , someone breaks in on our waveband . Let 's make a couple of guesses . An alien survives the crash , goes into a house , the occupant is an old lady . She said she was blind . Yes , so she thinks he 's a man . An intruder . The alien sets up a transmitter and beams in on our waveband . - Why ? - We 'll know when we track him down . Well , that won 't be easy , Alec . No , with Mobiles we can pinpoint his exact position . So that 'll take time . Less than an hour . Transporter will be there within minutes . Mobiles can be in the area immediately . Once they 're in position , we 'll get bearings from his next transmission . A Transporter ? The one from New York . You ordered an early take-off . - What have you done ? - I diverted it , what else ? Is something wrong ? I 'll tell Captain Carlin to go ashore as Field Commander . - I thought you 'd like some coffee . - Thank you . - What time is it ? - That clock is right . It hasn 't arrived yet . A Block . Mrs Rutland , it 's for you . No . I 'll take it . Hello ? Yes , it 's me . No , no . Just the same . There 's been a delay . The drug will be here as soon as possible . Yes , I know . I know ! I 'd like to explain to Mary . It 's been delayed . Yes ? But ... Important ? ! What can be more important than your own son 's life ? Listen , Mary , please . It 's not like that . You don 't understand . No ! No , I don 't understand , I 'll never understand ! Mary , listen to me . Mary ! - Where 's the Transporter ? - Just landed in Ireland , sir . The second it 's unloaded I want it in the air for London . Look , I 'm sorry about the Transporter . Was it important ? These things are always a question of priorities . Tell the Mobiles not to move in till I give the word . Get me a large-scale map of the area . - And get me Captain Carlin . - Sir . It 's all right , Billy . Our visitor 's a nice man . He doesn 't want to hurt us . It 's all right , Billy . - Mobile 1 in position . - Roger , 1 . All Mobiles in position , sir . All we can do now is wait for the next transmission . An alien who wants to cooperate . To help . Why else would he transmit on our waveband ? Why won 't you speak to me ? Get a bearing . Why don 't you tell me who you are ? It 's better to tell someone . What the devil 's jamming that signal ? 'Second UFO re-sighted . Moonbase : red alert . ' Interceptors , immediate launch . Missile firing : minus 6,4 . 'Interception negative . UFO proceeding to Earth . 'Red alert . Replacement Sky 1 . ' 'I know I can 't do very much , but I 'll try and help you . ' Got it . Mobile 1 to Control . Signal vector : 138,3 . Tell the Mobiles to move in . Mobile 1 to Control . 8 miles from target . 4 miles . We 'll never know . He might have told us everything . 'Dad ! ' Dad ! Dad ! Ed ! Well , do something ! Mary . I never want to see you again .

Come here ! You 're just in time . He takes a walk every morning for at least an hour . all night sometimes . This science of solaristics of his ! He reminds me of a bookkeeper making up his accounts . We expected you yesterday . He wanted to run away when he saw me . Hello ! How do you do ? I guess I shouldn 't have bothered you today . How old we have grown ! I 'm only now beginning to realize it . Everything will depend on his initial report from the station . Every message we receive is confusing or incomprehensible . the station can be taken out of Solaris 's orbit . I understand . You promised to talk to him . I 've brought the film . of course . Would you mind keeping the boy for a few days ? Anna 'll be pleased to have him . She 'll have more free time now . When does he leave ? he 'll already be gone . It 's very pleasant here . This house looks like my grand - father 's house. I liked it very much . And so we built this one just like it . I don 't care much for new things . I better get going . I 've an awful lot to do . Don 't you want to see this ? I 've already seen it many times . radio biologist Vishnyakov and physicist Fechner went on an exploration mission over the Solaris ocean in an air vehicle . we ordered a search . and we had to call the search off . All ofthe rescue craft returned to the station except the helicopter piloted by Burton . He came back only after the dark had set in . obviously in a state of shock . It was so unusual for a man who had been flying for 1 1 years . but he would never leave the station . And he refused to approach the window overlooking the ocean . While under medical care in a clinic he offered to make a statement one which he felt could affect the whole future of Project Solaris . let 's hear his story . Now is the time to let Burton talk . because the wind had come up . All my efforts were required in operating the ship . I wasn 't watching outside . I entered the fog bank . Was that an ordinary fog ? It was like nothing I 'd ever seen before . a gluey mass . All the windows were coated . Because ofthe fog 's resistance I began to lose altitude . the fog glowed like fire . I emerged into a large open space . about a few hundred meters across . At that moment I observed great changes in the ocean . and the surface looked transparent . A sort ofyellow mucus started to congeal under it . it glistened like glass . and a frothy crust appeared on top . The surface was brown like burned sugar syrup . giving shape to all sorts offigures . so I had to struggle against this force for some time . l saw a sort of garden . A garden ? please . narrow paths . All ofthis same substance . did they have leaves ? acacias ? but in real-life proportions . All of a sudden cracks started to appear . all was in froth . You 'll be able to see it for yourselves . Everything I saw will be on the film . Then I suggest we interrupt the hearing and look at it with our own eyes . show us the film . It 's very interesting . that 's all there is . But we don 't understand . Your film is nothing but clouds ! That must be the fog I was talking about . I 'm as surprised as you are . All this might be the result of the bio-magnetic current of the Solaris ocean acting on Burton 's conscience . but also to be capable of generating thought . That is a hypothesis that has not been confirmed . Weren 't you ill on that particular day ? this next part is pointless . We 'll pick up here . ... I saw something floating . I thought that it looked like Fechner 's space suit . I kept circling the spot to make sure I wouldn 't lose sight of it . as iftreading the waters . and he moved . You mean it was human ? human . You saw his face ? Yes . What man ? Who was he ? It was an infant . - Did you recognize it ? - l 'd never seen it before . what I saw was monstrous . What do you mean ? but then it became clear that it was incredibly huge . It was twelve feet tall . its hair was dark . we can recess the hearing . I will continue . as if new born . or rather slippery . Its skin was glistening . but it was moving by itself . The whole thing was repugnant . there isn 't very much more . ... Burton 's statements would appear to be plus obscure symptoms to which the brain 's cortical substance contributed in some measure through the excitation of associated zones . This report in no way reflects the actual facts . Or almost in no way . There 's a different opinion offered by Professor Messenger who believes that the information supplied by Burton could be true and needs to be thoroughly studied . I saw everything I described with my own eyes ! I would dare to venture another opinion . and it would be unwise to be influenced by the fact that we base our decision upon the observations of an unqualified layman . his talents of observation . we are bound morally to press forward with our probes . however let 's look back at the long road we 've traveled . the Solaris probes are back where we began . Years of effort have proven useless . All we know about Solaris reminds me of a mountain of separate facts which we are unable to squeeze into the framework of any conception . as regards the essential . Solaristics is degenerating . The essential question is far more serious than just Solaristics . We 're probing the very frontier of human knowledge . we limit our concept of the infinity of man 's knowledge . do we not risk moving backward ? What do you mean by saying that the information supplied by me is in no way reflects the actual facts ? I saw all this with my own eyes . It means that some real phenomena could have triggered your hallucinating . In windy weather it 's very easy to mistake a swinging bush for a living creature . To say nothing of a strange planet ! There 's nothing offending in it for you . What action are you going to take in view of Prof.Messenger 's opinion ? Practically none at all . Our research in this area will be discontinued . I have a statement to make . It 's not my reputation but the spirit ofthe expedition that you offend ... et cetera ... lt 's considered to be good manners now to laugh whenever Burton 's report is mentioned . but still I know so little about you . You were very handsome then . but thanks anyway . what do you think about all this ? I would like to speak to your son alone . I hate to look like an idiot before you once more . I 'll wait for you outside by the swing . your Burton . Don 't say that . He 's obviously ill at ease . He feels he 's intruding on us . it 's because he considers the matter so important . I didn 't want to see outsiders today any more than you did . We don 't talk to each other often enough . It 's good to hear you say that . Even on the last day . The last day ... you feel awful afterwards . Let 's meet after dinner . We need to talk . why did you invite this Burton fellow today of all days ? Where are the guests going to sleep ? I guess . I 'll be down by the swing . - But perhaps ... - Just a second . The question ofwhere they 're going to sleep can wait ! Chris ... What 's the matter ? standing in the garage and looking at me ? It 's just a horse . I 've seen it already . Come on ! He 's very gentle . Look how beautiful he is ! I think that Solaristics is at an impasse as a result of irresponsible fantasizing . but you want to convince me ofyour point of view . I can 't draw conclusions based on " reasons of heart " . I 'm not a poet . My problem is simple : withdrawing the station from orbit like bombarding the ocean with high intensity beams . not that ! Didn 't you want to continue the research at any price ? And you want to destroy that which we aren 't capable of understanding ? I don 't advocate knowledge at any price . Knowledge is only valid when it rests on a foundation of morality . Man is the only agent who renders science immoral . Don 't forget Hiroshima . Then don 't make science immoral ! It 's strange ... There 's nothing strange about it . Even you can 't be sure that all you had seen weren 'tjust hallucinations . Thank you for your time . We have nothing more to say to each other . - ls anything the matter ? - l 'm leaving . Leaving ? not a scientist . but you shouldn 't say that about him ! I guess . Are you leaving the child ? Why did you have to offend him ? You 're heartless . It 's dangerous to send your kind to the cosmos . Everything is far too fragile there ! though at what cost to humanity ! not you ? It 'd been established that the Solaris ocean is a peculiar kind of brain . that is the Ocean is a thinking substance . For years this hypothesis could not have been substantiated . This program is about Solaris . Very few true believers have remained . they are those who are connected with the station . only three men are still working . cyberneticist Snout and physiologist Guibariane who is dealing with the problem ... I 'm calling from the city . Burton ! we need to talk . What I talked to Chris about was not important. I should have told him about Messenger who had a different opinion at that meeting . He got very much interested in Fechner who died in Solaris Ocean . he had left his family . Messenger and I paid a visit to Fechner 's widow . I saw this child with my own eyes . You never told me about that . what about it ? He looked exactly like the child I 'd seen on Solaris . Except that he wasn 't twelve feet tall . but he should remember this when he 's there . There 's no point in keeping these . The only ones to be kept are those in my room . my thesis ... I wonder why we kept all these ? I 'll find someone to take care ofthem . don 't look for the film with the campfire. I 'm taking it with me . do that ... Kelvin ? - Ready ! You have nothing to worry about . Have a good trip . - When is the lift-off ? - You 're already under way ! Station Solaris ! Can you do something ? I seem to be losing stability . Where are you all ? You 've got company ! Doctor Snout ? Snout ? psychologist . It appears you weren 't expecting me . Did you receive the radiogram ? certainly . Why are you so upset ? I 'm sorry ... Where is Guibariane ? And Sartorius ? Sartorius is in his quarters . Guibariane is dead . Dead ? He committed suicide ... I knew Guibariane. lt 's not like him to ... He was in a state of profound depression . Since these mysterious disorders began ... take a bath . You may take any room . Come here in an hour . I 'm impatient to meet with Guibariane ... I mean Sartorius . I doubt if he 'll let you in . He 's up in his laboratory . and perhaps I ... Doctor Kelvin ... come in an hour . and rest . me and Sartorius . You know what we look like from our photographs . try not to lose your head . - What would I see ? - That depends on you . - Hallucinations ? - No ... but don 't forget . - Forget what ? - That we 're not on earth . Why don 't we have our talk tonight ? let 's make it tomorrow morning ! A. GUlBARlANE HUMAN being TO C. KELVlN Chris . I still have a little time left . that I must warn you about . I suppose you 've been told what happened to me . Snout or Sartorius can tell you the details . it matters little . The trouble is that no one can really explain it . I 'm afraid that what 's happened to me is only a beginning . but it may happen to all ofyou . for sure . But don 't think that I 've gone mad . You know me well . I 'll tell you why I did this . you will know it 's not madness . That 's the main thing . l 'm ofthe same opinion as Sartorius . Bombard the plasma ofthe ocean by high-powered X-rays . but there 's no other choice . We - or rather you - will be drawn in . It may offer a way to break this deadlock . It 's your only chance to establish contact with this monster . There 's no other solution left . Ifyou ... my name is Kelvin . I arrived two hours ago . I 'm in a ridiculous situation here . or I 'll break the door ! but don 't come in. I 'll come out . My name is Kelvin . You must have heard of me . I worked with Guibariane . Dr. Snout told me about Guibariane ... I can 't believe it . you know the story . I only know he 's dead . All of us may die . But he insisted upon being buried on the earth . with the worms . Have you ever heard of Burton ? he was on the search party for Fechner . and Guibariane was a coward . Please ... He 's dead ! Whyjudge him ? Duty to the truth is the only concern that should count . You are misguided in your search . Look ... This courage you pretend to is only inhumanity . Go away . You 're obviously overemotional . You must adapt yourself . Good health to you . I saw Sartorius and we spoke . I don 't find him very likable . He 's a very talented scientist . I 'm afraid I don 't feel so well . but you won 't listen to advice . is there anyone else on the station ? Did you see anything ? What were you warning me against ? What did you see ? A human being ? Was she real ? hurt ? today ? how do I know who you are ? Shhh ... - Where did she come from ? - Leave me alone ! You 're afraid ... I 'm not going to think you 're insane . you know so little ... Madness would be a blessing ! listen ... lt 's all so absurd . They don 't understand anything . They 're sure that I 've gone mad . I 've got to do this . I 'm afraid that Snout and Sartorius will try to force their way in . Chris ... I can 't ... No one will ever understand ... open the door ! Don 't be a fool ! Snout and Sartorius ! We want to help you ! They say they want to help me . quit knocking . I 'm my own judge . Have you seen her ? I 'm not mad . It has to do with my conscience . I really hoped you 'd get here in time . How did you ... lt 's so good ! But you can 't possibly ... How did you find out where l was ? What do you mean " find out " ? that tickles . Where are my shoes ? No ... they 're not there . Who 's this ? this is me ... You know ... I have a feeling as if I 've forgotten something . What 's the matter with me ? .. Do you love me ? as ifyou didn 't know . wait here . - Can 't I come with you ? - No. I 'll be back soon . No ! Why ? I don 't know ... I can 't ... You can 't what ? to see you ... Hari . I 'm acting childish . you 're as nervous as Snout . - As who ? - As Doctor Snout . How do you know ... you can come with me . But you won 't be able to get into a suit with your dress on . I can 't do it by myself . Why do you keep staring at me ? come quickly . You might at least knock . I thought I heard you talking to someone . All the more reason . So you 've had visitors ? You handle that very cleanly . you won 't die from it . I hope you used moderation in the beginning . eh ? you might as well leave . You 're not going to tell me you haven 't tried the rope or hammer ? I don 't suppose you threw an inkwell as Luther did ? pressed the button and that 's it ! you mustn 't panic . Try to launch it from the corridor . - Do you know what it was ? - No . But we 've been able to establish a theory at least . - Who was it ? - She died ten years ago . You 've just seen the materialization ofthe person you think you knew . - What was her name ? - Hari . This began after we experimented with X-rays . so we initiated a concentrated surface sweep using high intensity rays . but this is ... You 're fortunate . This woman is only part ofyour past . out ofthe recesses ofyour soul . I don 't see what you mean ... from which it extracted isolated bits of memory . - You think she 'll come back ? - She will and she won 't . - Hari the second ... - There may be many of her . - Why didn 't you warn me ? - You wouldn 't have believed me . I got scared and acted not very ... Don 't berate yourself . The point is to liquidate the station . This is my mission . will you sign it ? for so long ? The night is a blessed time here . Somehow it reminds me ofthe earth . You can also tie strips of paper to the air vents . At night you 'll think you 're hearing leaves rustle in the dark . it 's so simple . but he has something like that hidden in his closet . Try and get some rest . We 'll meet in the library later . I 've prepared a list of books for you . is that you ? where are you ? Come here . It 's so dark ... don 't be afraid ! The door opens the other way ! Don 't be afraid. I 'll be right back . I was afraid ... Chris ! I can hardly hear you . What are you doing right now ? Nothing . Sartorius wants to see us in the laboratory . I 'll be right with you . what 's wrong with me ? is it epilepsy ? This is my wife . How do you do ? Hi . We 've been waiting for you . I couldn 't get away sooner . they 're Snout 's . they are structured ... Let 's call them " The Visitors " . theirs is based on neutrinos . But any neutrino system would lack stability . There must be a magnetic field out of Solaris stabilizing them . You 've got an excellent specimen . She is my wife ! My congratulations. I 'm delighted . Take a blood sample from your " wife " . - Why should I ? - You 'll see things a lot clearer . Snout ? I 'm fed up with the lot ofyou ! but it regenerates itself . Self-regeneration ? Immortality ! Faust 's problem . There 's no need of absorbent cotton . Are you qualified to perform an autopsy ? She 's my wife . Don 't you understand ? It 's more humane to experiment on them than on the earth rabbits . It would be like cutting off my own leg . Did you feel pain when you broke through the door ? Pain ? Of course ! So if I ever catch you attempting anything on her ... You 're very lucky to have established an emotional contact with them . but ... - What ? Are you envious ? - Perhaps . the guilt is mine . you can call on us . We will empty your chamber pot . among others . My father shot most ofthe film . I shot bits of it . Do you know ... I don 't even know my own self . Who am I ? As soon as I close my eyes I can 't recall what my face is like . Do you know who you are ? all humans do . she hated me . before we ever met . Stop fooling me . and she told me to leave the house . So I left at once . I remember it very well . What happened after that ? I went away . That was the last time we ever saw each other . Where did you go ? To another city . - Why ? - l was transferred . Why didn 't you take me with you ? Because you refused to come . I remember that . I thought you were awake . What 's up ? The rate of regeneration has slowed . For two or three hours we can be rid of our visitors . And you 've come in the middle of the night to tell me that ? I 'll tell you exactly why I came . We thought that since the ocean it might be in our interest to communicate to it our waking thoughts . but how ? - By X-rays . Perhaps it will get the message and spare us all these apparitions . Again your idiotic X-ray theories about the greatness of science ? We 'll modulate the beam with the brain waves of one of us . of course ? A transcription of my thoughts ? to disappear ? Give everything back to that ... mass ofjelly ? It 's already invaded my soul . we 're losing time . Sartorius has another project . The annihilator . To destroy only neutrino systems . Blackmail ? I convinced him that we should start with the encephalogram . forget all about it . Tomorrow 's my birthday . You 're invited . I am . she 's sleeping . So she knows how to sleep already ? This is going to end badly . What do you propose then ? Nothing . So you 'll come ? To the library tomorrow ? We 'll set up the table . At least there are no windows there . In the meantime let 's go and see Sartorius . She 's sleeping . Suppose that she follows us ? Try leaving the door unlocked this time . What door ? It 's just a mirage . I 'll be right back . Where are you going ? Forgive me ! Why aren 't you sleeping ? You don 't love me . Stop it . - We have to talk . - About what ? I don 't know where l came from . Do you know ? What are you talking about ? Chris ? What are you talking about ? I don 't understand anything . you 're afraid to . So I 'll have to tell you . I 'm not Hari . Hari is dead ... She took poison . And I 'm someone else . - Who 've you been talking to ? - Sartorius told me . When ? Last night ? It would 've been less painful ifyou 'd told me yourself . my God ! What 's the difference ? How did you live all that time ? Were you in love with someone ? Did you ever think of me ? not always . Whenever I felt unhappy . I think someone is playing a kind of game with us the worse it will be for you . I wish I knew how to help you . what happened to her ? we used to quarrel a lot . I packed my things and left her . She made me understand ... She didn 't say it in so many words ... words aren 't necessary . but then I remembered that I 'd left the laboratory preparations having explained to her their effect . but then I thought she 'd understand that I took her words seriously . On the third day I did go to her after all . She was already dead . There was an injection mark on her arm . Like this ? Why do you think she did that ? I believe she felt that I didn 't love her anymore . But I love you . Chris ! I love you so much . Go to sleep . I don 't know how to sleep . but it 's not . It 's like a sleep within a sleep . It doesn 't come from inside me . It 's from far away . It 's still a kind of sleep . I guess our hero is not going to show up . - Why ? - Perhaps he 's having guests . everybody 's here ! You 're one and a half hour late . What is that you 're reading ? This is all rubbish ! Where did I put it ... Where the devil ... Here ! but a man needs his nights for sleeping . That 's our problem . Man has lost the gift of sleep . You 'd better read it. I 'm a bit overexcited . I know only one thing . When I ... no blessing ... that balance and weight that and the simple with the wise . Sound sleep has but one defect - it smacks too much of death . have you pronounced such a gracious speech . " That 's great . Now perhaps you 'll let me inject a few words of my own ? and his devotion to duty . and to Snout ! To science ? It 's a fraud ! nor idiot ! We have no ambition to conquer any cosmos . We just want to extend Earth up to the Cosmos 's borders . We don 't want any more worlds . Only a mirror to see our own in . but we 're doomed to failure . We look ridiculous pursuing a goal we fear and that we really don 't need . Man needs man ! Let 's drink to Guibariane . In memory of a man . was out offear . Guibariane was not afraid . There are worse things than being afraid . He died because he saw no way out . was happening only to him . All that heart-breaking moaning is just second-rate Dostoyevsky . Who do you think you are to judge us ? At least I know why I 'm here . Nature created man so that he might gain knowledge . man is condemned to knowledge . The rest is of no consequence . what exactly are you doing on Solaris ? What a question ! nothing here seems to interest you . Your time is spent lolling in bed day after day . is that how you understand your duty ? you 're plain lazy . Stop it ! to Man ! Are you suggesting he was not a man ? Chris ! We 'd better not quarrel . today is my birthday . I think Chris is more logical than both ofyou . In these inhuman conditions he alone acted human . and that your visitors are just an exterior enemy . they are your conscience . perhaps he just defends himself . he wants ... that 's not the point . It doesn 't matter why a human loves . it 's you ... I hate you all ! Don 't interrupt me . I 'm a woman after all ! Woman ? You 're not even a human being . ifyou 're capable of understanding anything ! Hari doesn 't exist ! She 's dead ! a mechanical repetition ofthe form ! A copy from a matrix ! perhaps . But I ... I 'm becoming a human being ! I can feel just as deeply as any ofyou . I can live without Chris already . I ... I 'm in love with him . I 'm a human being ! why are you so cruel ... on your feet ! My dear man ! Nothing is more easy . It 's wrong of us to quarrel like this . our dignity as humans . but each one in his own way . That 's why you 're quarrelling . I hope I 'm not bothering you ? You 're really a good fellow . Only you look awful ! I 'm worn out . Could you help me ? Doesn 't a man who 'd give up his life doesn 't he have a right to get drunk once in a while ? absolutely . do you believe in our mission ? I 'll stay up a while yet . It 's important we don 't sleep . I 'm going to see Faust in his laboratory . is still seeking his remedy against immortality . While we ... Suppose we opened all the windows and yelled down as loud as we could ? Do you think it would hear ? Only who shall we call to ? Maybe we should whip him with birch leaves ? Or we could even pray to it ... What 's the matter ? I think I closed the door ... She 's alone there . Go on. I feel a lot better . The station changes its orbit . At 17 hours there 'll be thirty seconds ofweightlessness . So don 't forget . Hari ! I was lost in my thoughts . is anything wrong ? nothing 's wrong . Everything 's all right . She drank liquid oxygen ... She did it out of desperation . It is going to get worse . the more human she becomes . - What are you going to do ? - Wait until she comes back . And then what ? Leave the station ? on the station . What else can I do ? I love her . Love whom ? Her ? Or the girl on the rocket ? She will return . She can return a hundred times over . Don 't convert the scientific problem to an insignificant love story . I had a foreboding that this would end badly . You should help her . isn 't it ? I 'll never get used to these constant resurrections ! is it me ? What ? .. What ? .. Why ? Why ? No ... I 'm not ... Not her ... Not Hari ... And you ... What ifyou aren 't either ... Hari . - l 'm not Hari ! Maybe your appearance maybe the ocean sent you . But you 're more to me than all that science could ever mean ! - Do I look very much like her ? - You may have looked like her . But now it 's you who are real Hari . Tell me ... Do I look ugly ? Can you look at me ? - Do I disgust you ? - No . - You 're lying ! - Stop it ! I must be looking disgusting ! Don 't touch me ! I love you ! what can I do ? Nothing ... I won 't return to earth . on the station . I 'm afraid . The ocean 's activity is increasing . Your encephalogram may be the cause . Whenever we show pity we empty our souls . Perhaps that 's true . Suffering makes life seem gray and suspicious . I don 't believe that ... I will not accept that ... What is not indispensable to life is in some way harmful to it ? that 's not true either . Itjust isn 't true ! Remember Tolstoy 's suffering about the impossibility of loving the humankind in general ? How much time has passed since ? I can 't figure it out ... Help me . Let 's suppose I love you . but never explain . One can only explain the idea . You love that which you can lose . your country ... had no way to reach love . There are so few of us ! human beings as a reason to love ? He 's feverish . How did Guibariane really die ? You haven 't told me . but later . he died out of shame . The salvation of humanity is in its shame ! I ... I 'm two hours late . I know . How was your trip ? It was just a bit tiring . It was all right . It 's running slow again . I 'll set it right . You have lots oftime . I don 't know what 's the matter with me ... I have completely forgotten your face . You don 't look well . Are you happy ? Happiness is an idea that 's obsolete . I think that 's too bad . I feel so alone now . Why are you hurting us ? What have you been waiting for ? You might have telephoned . You seem to lead such a strange life . you don 't take care ofyourself . How did you get into this state ? I 'll be right back . Hari ... How are you ? You feel better now ? Where 's Hari ? - What is it ? - There is no more Hari . I 'm sorry I had to deceive you . There wasn 't any other way . This is the only solution for us both . I asked them myself. lt was my decision . Do not blame anyone for this . Hari . " She did it for you . listen ... Chris . How was it ? .. and a breath ofwind . To think that we quarreled so often those last days . why are we being tortured like this ? We have lost our sense ofthe Cosmic . Ancient man had no such problem . He 'd have never asked why ... You remember the myth of Sisyphus ? not a single one ofthe visitors has returned . Something beyond our understanding is happening to the ocean . Islands have begun to form on the surface . then others began to appear . Are you telling me that we were understood ? Just like that ? In one stroke ? At least we can hope now . - How old are you ? - Fifty two . Have you been here long ? You must have read my background papers . do you still feel as clearly your link with the life down below ? eh ? let 's not be ironical . the meaning of life and other themes of eternity rarely interest him . These questions should be asked at the end of one 's life . that 's why we 're in a hurry . The happiest people are those who never bother asking those cursed questions . We question life to seek out some meaning . Yet to preserve all the simple human truths we need mysteries . love . You may be right . But try not to think about it . To think about it is the same as to know the day of one 's death . Not knowing that date makes us practically immortal . my mission is finished . And what next ? To return to earth ? everything will come to normal . new acquaintances . But I won 't be able to devote all of myselfto them . And do I have the right to turn down to which my race is trying to stretch a thread of understanding ? which still remember our breathing ? What for ? Just for the hope of her return ? But I have no hope . The only thing left for me is to wait . Wait for what ? I don 't know ... A new miracle . Are you all right now ? I feel fine . it 's time for you to return to earth . is that your opinion ? The End

 This is where they must be . Reported seen here and here . They 're headed toward the sea . Alien humans . " Astronauts , " they call themselves . And that renegade ape , Galen . Are you sure , Urko ? I am sure of nothing except they think differently . They 're a threat and they must be caught . There are several settlements in this district . - Human settlements ? - Yes . Each one has an ape garrison and a prefect . I want you to go there . Alert every prefect in the district . Give him their descriptions . Every stranger is to be arrested on sight , and this office notified . We 'll find them , sir . Get troops from the nearest garrison and bring them back here to me , alive . - Unless they try to escape . - Yes , sir . Jason I expect them to try . - Understood ? - Understood , sir . - Here . - Thanks . I think . Thank you , Galen . Okay , what do you call it ? - An oper . Peel it , it 's good . - An oper ? Okay , I 'm willing . It 's ... Good . I told you . Looks like a bomb , feels like a banana , tastes like an orange . It must be a mutation . It 's obviously tropical . If the sun and compass aren 't loused we 're north of what was San Francisco . We should be eating apples and pears . Right , Alan ? I 'm sorry . What ? Anybody who thinks a disk will get us home is strictly off his rocker . Hey , try an oper . They 're good . This is our only chance , Pete and you know it . - Lf you say so . Look , every detail of our flight is recorded right here . It can tell us when , where and maybe even how we hit that time warp . - Lf we run that through a computer ... - What computer ? Where ? Behind that tree ? No , not behind that tree , or that tree , or that hill maybe . But somewhere on this crazy planet , maybe there 's a civilization with the same technical knowledge that we had . Even more . And , Pete , you can 't tell me that it doesn 't exist . - Galen , do you know this area ? - Not very well . Are there any settlements here ? Not that I know of . And certainly not one with a computer ? Whatever that is . Well , we 'll just have to keep on searching till we ... - Pete . Alan . A horse ! - Come on ! - Well , training hard , I see . - Yes , sir . We were . Until two human strangers came , attacked us and ran off . - I don 't know what they wanted . - Probably outlaws passing through . Some no better than wild animals . I 'll have the patrols watch for them . More important , Tolar , is your son ready ? - Almost , sir . - Good . Good . Wait a minute . Wait . Hold it ! I 've gotta go back . I must have dropped the disk . Alan ! No ! We can 't risk that . Come on . I expect to be proud of you someday , young man . - Yes , sir . - You will be , sir . Strange . - You 're not serious ? - I 'm getting it back , Pete . I don 't know how , but I 'm not leaving without it . What difference does it make ? If we find a civilization to interpret it they still have to build a spaceship and reverse the process . Even then there 's no assurance we 'd wind up back in the 20th century . - I 'm aware of all that , Pete . - Then why take the risk ? Forget it . I can 't . It 's home . It 's hope . I can 't forget it . - Few soldiers come this way . - How far to the nearest village ? Half a day . You should be there by morning . That 's it . - Are you sure ? - He wore the prefect 's insignia . And that 's a prefect 's house . You wait here . Wait . Why you ? That disk means nothing to you . It 's important to you . You 're my friend . I know , Galen , but you don 't know ... He is my species . I have a better chance alone . Really . He 's right , but I don 't think it 's worth the risk . Well , you 'd do the same for me , wouldn 't you ? I 'll get your disk . - Yes ? - My name is Galen . May I come in ? Yes , please do . Keep your fingers crossed . Horses . If Galen gets into trouble , we have to get out of here fast . Come on . - Thrown by a horse ? - Yes . - Where ? - Out there somewhere . I 've been walking for miles . I was delighted to see your village . And what were you doing on your horse , " out there " ? Scientific exploration . I am searching for artifacts of past civilizations . Don 't we have enough trouble coping with our own ? I wasn 't exactly sure we had one . I 'm going to like you , young chimp . Yes , I think I 'm going to like you very much . - How about something to drink ? - Oh , yes , yes , thank you very ... Thank you very much . It can be a rather lonely life here . Gorillas . They have no understanding of beauty or culture . I 've been a prefect in this village for 25 years , would you believe it ? - You don 't look old enough . - Come , come . Here you are . - Oh , thank you . - Are you traveling alone ? Oh , yes ... Twenty-five years . Since I was your age . - To companionship . - Most certainly . That 's good . You ready , Alan ? Wait . Here , hold this . Okay , let 's go . Rather nice , isn 't it ? One of the humans did it . You know , some of them are surprisingly talented , even artistic . - So I 've heard . - As a matter of fact , I have a theory . Take 50 humans , put them in a room with pots of color and brushes . Give them time and eventually they 'll duplicate every masterpiece ever painted . I wonder if this could be one of your artifacts . Well , I don 't know . I 'd have to examine it . No , no . It can 't be . Too new . I have found a few artifacts myself over the years . - Some of them are fascinating . - Are you a collector ? Oh , just an amateur . But one finds strange things . For example , our ancestors must have been excellent metal-workers . Very advanced , but the use to which they put the metal was primitive . For instance , I found a weapon , a club . Beautiful workmanship , but so inefficient for combat . The quality of metal is higher than we could produce today . - A lost art . Interesting , huh ? - Oh , very , very interesting . That disk seems to be made of the same metal as this . May I see ? Any particular reason ? You seem quite eager . - Curiosity . - That is characteristic of us chimps . - Oh , yes . - Let 's restrain our curiosity until later . - You 'll stay for the night . - I 'm not sure ... Yes . I wouldn 't dream of letting you go . Now we must find you a place to sleep . Should we tie him ? He 's not gonna be moving for a long time . This isn 't Central City , you know . Our accommodations are simple . There 's much I 'd like to discuss with you . So many aspects of life that we could ... What ? Out here . Both of you . They 're not from my village . I never have this sort of trouble . Of course . The two outlaws Tolar saw . Put them in the cage . Oh , yes . There 's a comfortable hut that I 'm sure would be suitable for you . - Hey , Pete . Pete . - What ? Hey , come on , wake up . Come here . What are they gonna do to us ? Does anybody know ? Look , we 're not your enemy . You don 't seem to be getting through . Look who 's coming . What 's gonna happen ? Do you know ? What do you think you 're ... ? These books are my closest friends . - What will you do with the prisoners ? - I found this one in an abandoned underground shelter . - Really ? What about the prisoners ? - Why should you care ? - They 're only human . - They walk , they talk , they breathe . You sound like a revolutionary . They 're humans the only animal on Earth that wars on its own kind . - I know . - War and revolution are outlets for man 's aggression . Man must be kept docile and unwarlike . We must find less dangerous outlets for his hostility . - Do you agree ? - Yes . What 's that have to do with ... ? They 're thieves , my friend . They 're strangers . - But they will serve a noble purpose . - What do you mean ? Come . I think you 'll find this interesting . - Do you know my fondest wish ? - No . To remain here for the rest of my days as prefect with my books , my flowers and my humans . There . Which one ? Good . All right . It 's time . A small ambition , of course but its fulfillment would give me great pleasure . Get back , both of you . You . Come . Come ! Tolar . - Prefect . - Are you ready , Tolar ? - Yes , sir . - And your son ? - Soon , sir . - Not today ? - Please , sir . Not yet . - Why ? - I don 't think ... - It 's his stomach , his his stomach is not good today . - Very well . Not today . Thank you , sir . The father is a fine human being , but the son is a problem . He has no proper appreciation of the games . - What are the games ? - His attitude will change . It will change with his first kill . " First kill " ? - They seem so tense . - They 're waiting for blood . - It 's their nature , human nature . - Oh , not all humans . All humans . And I give it to them here , in the arena . Normally , with a challenger from the village . They work out their aggression , and after the game they live peacefully and quietly until the next game . That 's the secret , my friend . All the human hostility in my village is used up here and nowhere else . Oh , it 's time for me to go through the usual nonsense . But they seem to expect it . And it does seem to help . Welcome to your games , humans of Kaymak . Welcome to your hero , the greatest fighter of Kaymak . Welcome to Tolar . All honor to the man who will face death . Bring in the challenger . The game will begin . To the winner , life . To the loser , death . Take it easy . Take it easy , pal . They 're like children , aren 't they ? Barlow . Prefect Barlow ! The sword ! The sword ! The sword ! Hey , what 's happening ? The sword ! The sword ! The sword ! Kill him ! Kill him ! Kill ! Jason . Galen ! Galen ! Out ! Everybody out ! - Virdon . - No time . Later . - Well ? - We cleared humans off the street . - Any injuries ? - Nothing serious . One trooper was hurt . I 've never seen the humans so ... A trooper hurt , by a human ? Don 't you have any guns ? My orders are that guns are used only as a last resort . You may go . Your reports always describe this as a peaceful village . It was . I mean , it is . The game wasn 't completed . Games ! You don 't govern with games . You govern with this . And you don 't allow two important prisoners ' escape . - I didn 't know they were important . - Must you play with that ? Thank you . Now let 's see the one prisoner you haven 't lost . Or not yet , anyway . Father ? Fresh water from the well ? - You should have some light in here . - Leave it closed . - But , Father ... - The dead have no need of light . - And the living ? - He disgraced me , Dalton . Why didn 't he use the sword ? Why ? I 'm not sure , Father . I think ... I 'm a dead man who breathes . - He did this to me . - He spared your life , Father . - Can that really be bad ? - A man without honor shouldn 't live . Where did your friends go ? Where is their meeting place ? - There is no meeting place . - Tell me or ... - I don 't approve of this method ... - I 'm not interested in your approval ! - I 'm warning you ... - I 'm still prefect here , and I forbid it . Enjoy your title , Prefect Barlow . You will no longer have it once I make my report . - Prefect , thanks . - Why did you ever come here ? Can we come in ? Look , we need to speak ... - This is Galen , my friend . - Friend ? An ape ? - Yes . It 's possible . Hello . - Hello . - It 's possible , isn 't it ? - We need your father 's help . Yours too . Our friend is in the cage and we have to get him out . No ! You 've disgraced me . But in this house we 're loyal citizens and we won 't help you disgrace the prefect too . My friend is a human being . They 'll take him to Central City and kill him . He 's a stranger , we owe him nothing . You owe me something . You owe me your life . Yes , and for that you will leave my house . No , Father ! He 'll stay . And if I can , I 'll help . So now you are the father . I 'm sorry . I can 't turn him away . The approach you were taking with that man would not have worked . Some men do not respond to force . I have made a study of human behavior . You 'll have a chance to tell Urko all about your studies . He doesn 't share your tender concern for humans . But my way is practical . It controls humans with the minimum effort and cost . Yes , I saw an example in the arena . They need death in their games . They didn 't get it ... Games ? I 'm sick of hearing about your games , Barlow ! But it 's true ! Human behavior . Violence . Hostility . Aggression . - My way keeps them from ... - Wait a minute ! I 'm such an idiot . Your way . Your humans want a death . - We should let them have the prisoner . - Don 't you have to bring him back ? - Officially , yes . - You , you needn 't send that report . I have a feeling I shall continue as prefect . You 'll see how my theory works . Humans more important than apes ? - There was such a time ? - I was there . - What happened ? - I don 't know . But I can guess . War . Killing . Men destroyed each other , themselves . - But you didn 't kill my father . - I had no reason to kill him . - It 's the way of the games . - I had no reason to kill him . In your time , did all humans feel this way about killing ? Depended on the war . There were some who wouldn 't kill for any reason , pacifists . They figured human life was just too special . Do you understand this ? I 've never understood the need to kill . It 's a thing for humans . My mother was a " pacifist , " I think . - Someone 's coming . The prefect . - In there . Hurry . Prefect . How is your father , Dalton ? Tolar . And how are you ? Ashamed , prefect . The man who fought you , he should be ashamed . Not you . Yes , I ... - Prefect ... - You should lie down , Father . - And I think he should know . - There 's nothing for him to know . - Nothing . - What ? What is this " nothing " ? My father 's disgrace . How much it troubles him . It will be forgotten . I promise you . The game 's tonight , and they will forget . - Tonight ? - Yes , the torches will be lighted and you will bring back honor to your family . You will fight the friend of the man who disgraced your father . And this time there will be a death . Is that understood ? I want no error . There will be a death . You say you 're from another time , I hear . - You and your friend ? - Yes . Tell me , is it better than now ? Well , it 's different . But it 's home . Of course . Just as this is home for me . That 's why I ... Oh , I 'm sorry you ever came to my village . - Any of you . - No sorrier than I am . We had no choice . When you picked up that magnetic disk , I had to get it back . It was that ? That little thing ? That 's why Galen came to ... ? Oh , I wish he 'd simply told me about it . I 'd have given it to him with my blessing . Well , you can still do it . Give me the disk . Let me go . To search for your home while I lose mine ? I 'm sorry . Truly . But the time for choice is past . - It 's impossible . How can we do it ? - I don 't know . But it has to be before tonight . I don 't think we can swing it alone . Wait . I 'll be back soon as I can . Dalton ? Tolar ? Dalton ! Dalton ! I loved your mother very much . What would she tell me to do ? A man is not a woman . She said there was no honor in killing . She said . But she loved me . She would never have noticed me except for the games . I would have been nothing except for the games . - How many men have you killed , Father ? - The prefect created the games . - They brought peace to the village . - How many men have you killed ? As many as I have fought . - As you will tonight . - But I have no reason to kill him . It 's the way of the games . Is it ? It is the nature of man to kill . Then why didn 't the stranger kill my father ? Exactly what do you want of me ? Prefect , I think the games are wrong . - I 'm not going to fight . - I order you ! I can 't . It 's wrong . I have to tell others in the village . - I have to make them understand . - You 'll do no such thing ! They have to know what 's been shown to me . They have to know the games are wrong , that killing is wrong . Sergeant ! Sergeant ! This human has broken curfew . That 's all I need . Destroyer ! You destroyed me , now you 're destroying my son ! - Now take it easy . Tolar ! - You tell him killing is bad ! And you ! What have you done but kill ? You killed my honor . - Now you 're killing my son 's manhood ! - You 're wrong ! - Tolar ! Your son ! He 's been arrested . - What ? Your son 's been arrested . He 's in the cage . - What do you mean ? - He 's been arrested because he was against the games . My son . - Did they have a plan ? - No . - Lf they 're smart , they 'll take off . - " Take off " ? That means to leave , go away . It 's an expression from my time . In your time , if there had been no killing then men might still be important now . That 's true . - It 's possible . - It could still happen . No closer . - I want to see my son . - Nobody sees the prisoners . - No humans are allowed on the street . - I wanna see my son ! - Don 't do it , Tolar . Go back home . - Look , look ... All I ask you , both of you , is a little pity . A little pity for a poor human whose son has been condemned . I don 't understand you now and I never will . But that 's no reason for anybody to put you in a cage . - Stop ! Stop before I ... - Run ! No ! Nobly done , my friend . - He 's dead . - Yes . As you saw , he died a hero 's death fighting a crazed human . - But I could ... - Your bravery is not in question . I will see that you are properly cited in my report . - Thank you . - We must not allow unfortunate incidents like this to interfere with our normal routine . Come on . No . Please . - My father ? - He was a brave man . - And the games ? - I 'm afraid they died with him . Perhaps there is a better way to govern . - There must be . - Tell your friends I have never met them , and they have never met me . - Yes , prefect . - And wish them good luck for me . That way . - You won 't go with us ? - There 's so much to think about so much I still don 't understand . - It could be dangerous here . That isn 't important . What is important , I think is that killing should stop . People should know that . Killing should stop . Good luck . Good luck , Dalton . Bye . A beginning ? Who knows ? The world could sure use another one . Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH ]

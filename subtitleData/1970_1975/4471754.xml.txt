 A Big Grey-Blue Bird Now he 's leaving , too . - He 's still warm , want to bet ? Tom ! Tom , please ! Don 't do this to us ! He 's sleeping ! Come on , Tom ! Get up ! Wake up ! He 's expired ... Come on , boy , wake up ! Get up ! - Tom , please . You can 't do it . Come , Tom . Come with us . We 're going on a journey , a nice trip . We 're leaving here . We 're going abroad . But you have to get up now . Wake up ! We have to go . Wake up , come on ! We have to leave here ! Hey , the cops . What ? They 're coming up here , let 's go ! This way ! What now ? Gentlemen , please get in . Oh boy , quite the turmoil must have gone on here . Ah , look ! Here we are ! Well , Tom , what are you seeing in those clouds ? You won 't get anything from him today . - We 'll see about that . Excuse the interruption . - Do continue . Freeze ! Stay where you are ! You 're under arrest ! - Are you crazy ? Give yourselves up , there 's no point ! Great ... - The column ! - Don 't shout . Hold on ! Did you really not see that wall ? For heaven 's sake , one-way street ! That 's it now . - That gate only opens from outside . Well , someone would have to get up there and press the little button . What are you doing ! Fabulous . Hey , stop , Luba ! - That 's Knokke , he has to come with ! Who 's dead ? Old Belotti , he ran away . Watch out , Luba ! How are you driving ? Where do you want to go ? - To the hideout for now . There 's another of those white cars . - The same one ? From when Belotti died ? The cops came around . What did the cops want ? We have to leave the country ! - We won 't get out of here ... I 'll take care of you . - Who 's this guy ? - That 's our dear Gio . He 's also on the list . He 'll get us out of here alright . What 's happened ? - How long have you been sleeping for ? I don 't know anything since the day before yesterday . Luba , I 'm begging you ! Do you have any of those bonbons left ? They are great . Sweet , or sour ? Luba , darling , don 't let me die . We 've taken a different route . Not in a long time ! - How will we get out of here ? We do have a chance : Belotti . - I heard he 's dead already . Sadly he is . But there 's someone who knows what Belotti knew . You wish . And there are people , who would do anything who could do a lot . - Yes , kill . Kidnap . Blackmail , things like that . I don 't mean Belotti 's murderers , somebody else entirely ! How would you know ? - Tom . Tom , now listen to me . I want to get out of here . - We all do . Where would you want to go ? Tom , I remember ... you wanted to go with Diana to the south , didn 't you ? Now with Diana again ... - Another victim of your whim ! Why , is she dead , too ? - Knokke , what are we seeing next ? No idea , I think Belotti . No , Diana ! But there 's - - Tom , your show ! Look at this ! Maybe this will open your eyes . Tom , Where 's the body in the plan ? - Will you shut the fuck up ! Why ? - That hasn 't even been proven . He 's hiding somewhere ! That film is centuries old ... - Yeah , a whole three days old ! Tom , I have given these documents neither to TV nor the police . I have risked my well-paid position for your sake ! Don 't exaggerate . And committed embezzlement ! There he is ! Your friend Belotti , there he is ! And who 's that ? He committed suicide when they attempted to abduct him . How does this concern me ? - You know who he really was ! You picked him up yourself , and brought him to Diana 's press reception ! Get these people away from me ! Tom , I understand that you don 't want to be reminded of this . And I 'm only interested in the old guy ! I 'm only interested in this Belotti ! The great scientist ... Inventor of the time machine , able to - - What are you even talking about ? Your story about Belotti ! Just listen ! Knokke , can 't we turn it up ? - Don 't shout ... We think we 're taking pictures of him , but really he 's taking pictures of us . This is the man who knew the formula all his life . And now , nearing the end , he won 't tell . Or will he ? Speak , speak , speak , come on . Speak , speak , speak , come , come , come ! The man has it . 40 years underground . - He didn 't get all of it , that 's all . Look at this fabulous man ! He threw it out just now . He 's still afraid . See how he 's looking . See how he 's trembling . But it 's certain , it was him . You walked around with it for 30 years , right ? That 's what you told me . Right ? Knokke did good work . Alright , come on . Now say it . But ... only ... where ! - Yes , where ! What where ! What 's where ! I hid it inside a poem . - What did you hide ! By me . Come on , out with it ! Say it ! Never ! You 'll never know ! Never ! Never ! Never ! What is this supposed to prove ? They are after me ! - Who is ? Always ! Always ! - Who 's after you ? Who , who , who , who , who ? I staged this for you . For you and the others at Diana 's . Come on , don 't make excuses now . I forgot it ! I forgot it ! - That 's not true . You knew who this Belotti was ! - Great , how the old guy played along . Yes , and that is irrefutable proof . You know everything about Belotti ! He told you his secret ! - Gio ... What do you want , anyway ? You didn 't really check the story yourself , did you . It 's nothing but a quirk , a little game . For you maybe ! But not for others . I know people who were willing to pay any price for Belotti 's head . And you sold him . - Not Belotti , you ! Rather , your story about Belotti . Just stop it already with this idiotic story . - Do you want to see the sequel ? What do you have next , Belotti 's death ? - Promise me , Tom ... Next time you find a dead frog , you tell me about it . Kids , kids , kids , won 't you understand what 's in this for all of us ? This isn 't about your private , poetic ideas , but about realities ! You should have warned me that No. 3 is capable of this . Yes . I might be able to get you somebody else , though . No. 3 did come clean , right before his death . Nice , nice , utopia you say ! All made up ! But it isn 't just a figment of the imagination ! The idea you did get from Belotti , didn 't you ? He did tell you something . I 've done some research . Here 's the facts ! This Belotti was one of five scientists who thirty years ago , sometime before the war , were supposed to work in armament , and vanished from Germany . Vanished without a trace ! Until now that is ! I 'm supposed to have said that ? - Yes , pretty much . I 'm not interested in what I may have told you , that was a hundred years ago . But this very morning , somebody attempted to abduct Belotti ! Knokke , Bill , that 's what you said ! You saw it , you even filmed it ! We were only outside . - What else would you like to know ? Did Belotti tell you anything about the people who were after him ? Do whatever you like ... - Who are they ? If you 've seen everything you don 't need me . - Where can they be found ? Is it true Belotti was going to meet them ? Dear Gio , I 've sold you a story . Whether it 's true is your business . If we had only the smallest hint where to find the other four ! Where Belotti was going to meet them , we 'd be fine ! I just want to know : What did Belotti tell you ? Where did he want to go ? - You 'd better ask where Tom wanted to go . In his former life . Wait , if it 's the location you want to know about , I 've got something . A note , from this Tom-X , taken out of his pocket this morning . You listening ? Gio , forget about it . That 's all there is . I 'm not giving up that easily ! Gio , G.O. Ah , Mr. Morelli , finally ! No , not yet . Just let him do his thing . We 'll keep him under control . Do you realize what this could mean ? Well , first we 're going to fly there . Identify the people , photograph or film them . And then we 'll take offers . As you like . But I told you what we need . No , two charter planes . Okay . But in three hours at the latest , that 's six o 'clock . Okay , till six . Connect me with Germany again . With Lunette . Mr. Morelli . I 'm up to date , you hear ? I 'd like you to take care of the matter yourself . And leave today , at once . I can tell you the location . This G.O. won 't be able to identify the gentlemen . That 's why he wanted you to be there as an expert . But ... just come to the intercom . Gio ? You just don 't get it , he 's totally fooling you . He just came up with this trip to travel to Diana . How and why he got hold of this matter needn 't concern us . The important thing is to get out of here before we perish . Who were you talking to on the phone ? If we 're supposed to participate , I 'd like to know . A number of colleagues believe , just like me , that the five made the invention we 're working on now before they vanished . But it 's assumed almost impossible that they could be alive . The superpowers ' secret services searched the whole world for them after the last war , and found no traces . This may well serve as an indicator that they were indeed already in possession of the invention , and either made a mistake or they used it on purpose to temporarily leave our normal space-time continuum . What is it ? I don 't know yet . Gentlemen . I would like to remind you , he must be under observation the whole time . Most of all I want photos of everybody he talks to . Okay , boss . You 'll be pleased this time . I 'm not repeating a mistake like that . I hope so . Gio , G.O. Yes , speaking . Yes , an abandoned airfield near Munich , no risk . I 'm sorry , I can 't share that . We 'll tell our pilot first . Here 's Belotti 's death now . - Tom , come down and take a look at this ! I can see it from up here . Tom ! We 're leaving in about 28 minutes . If you two plan on joining us , it 's about time you left that playground of yours . Besides , we have things to talk about . Did you notice what I 've managed in the meantime ? I was having miserable dreams . - Or were you sleeping through everything ? You know , Gio ... For my ideas , I need 12 hours of sleep . So you 're all clear now ? - But of course . I remember ... The legendary seven - - Five . Twelve then , magicians keeping the secret . The formula , hidden inside a poem . Space levelled , time dissolved . One fabulous trip , and every seven years they reappear , like this Belotti . And whoever reveals it must die . - Alright , but I need the location ! Boy , I have to know the location ! Try to remember ! Which country would you like ? - The location of the meeting ! - Tibet perhaps ? We have to know the location ! - I 'll think of one , and let you know . Yes , one moment ... Tom , it 's for you . Hello . Where are you ? When are you coming ? Where ? Where ? Help yourselves . We 're emigrating . We 're leaving , across the border . You can take anything , the weapons , too . We 're just taking our cameras . It 's a game of chess . Either we go below the ground or into the air . Let 's stay here in the forest . What ? You 're being childish . They 'll get you in a week tops , and then it 's good night . Alright . Stay here and get caught . You 've obviously never been in jail . You 'll get the shock of your life . And what will we get down there ? What are we doing there , anyway ? - Continuing our film . Come on , people , two minutes left ! Yes , where to ! - You know very well where to . So let 's get going . - Yeah , let 's start . You do have the note . Everything 's on there . No , I don 't think I can work for you with these gentlemen following me around . If you don 't get rid of these people , I 'll make it a vacation . And nothing else ! Yes . Hey you ! Hey you ! You with the newspaper , yes you ! Come over here ! Just a second , one 's coming . Here , the boss wants to speak with you , and thanks for the newspaper . How do you know Morelli 's whereabouts ? Because that 's where we 're going . Why is Morelli there ? It 's where Diana is . How does Morelli get there ? What 's he have to do with Diana ? That 's what I wonder . Hey you . Do you know what Morelli has to do with Diana ? How does Diana get there ? How do we get there ? She was brought there . She inherited a villa . From her uncle Belotti . Who is Diana working for ? Who is Morelli working for ? Who are you working for , and who is he working for ? But we 'll see about all that . Tom . If everything turns out to be nonsense , that would be horrible . - an imaginary place - Space becomes plane . Centuries one second . Entire bodies , reproducible - - all eternity - Break it off ! They are our people . Calm down , it 's alright . They work for us . I want the film ! - Everything 's fine ! Boss 's order , we 're at your service . That 's wonderful ! Start by bringing in my luggage . Get up ! Move it ! What is it ? Be so kind as to get me a Whiskey on ice . I 've had a long afternoon . Ah , you 've brought a sample of your work . Here , a document . Got something to project this ? Yes , we have everything here . Put this in . Excuse me , I 'll just get dressed . Herbert , what 's Morelli been up to ? Have you been watching him ? He has this lady ... Well , at the right place ! Luck of the journalist . But it wasn 't all coincidence . We were after him just like you were . How much do you want ? A copy of the film is in a safe at a Swiss bank . Say we let you publish this , how much could it earn you ? Earn , earn ! We don 't just want to earn ! We 're journalists after all ! This story is a sensation ! It will make us world-renowned overnight ! So how much ? You know , this is about our very existence . - Yes , it is . I mean , our professional future . This is where you see your future ? Where are you coming from ? You shouldn 't ask . Or I 'll wake up , and faint right away . I 'm coming ! Evening . He does this sometimes . He 'll be fine . How will your story continue ? The next step is the search for the remaining four scientists . Which , as of right now , is still somewhat utopian . Why would you start your search here of all places ? Well , why not ? - Didn 't you hear ? It 's utopian ! No specific place , neither in space nor time ! - Exactly ! It could be anywhere . Nonsense . Why here ? Well , you 'll have to ask our author . He 's the one who suggested this place . - The author ? This Tom-X ? This friend of Mr. Belotti 's ? Our work is based on the assumption that the four colleagues of Belotti 's are still alive and meet from time to time . Secretly , of course . And around this area , this time . And all of this is based on the fiction of your famous poet Tom-X ? But the fact that you too chose this place and took appropriate measures seems to me to be proof we 're not all that wrong with our information . At the same lady 's ? All four ? So a quarter million dollars . I 'll let you know tomorrow . - Great , so I can leave . I 'm meeting somebody for dinner . I want to talk to you . Well , I 'll be leaving too , then . I suggest you get to know Tom-X , have a chat with him . So you can still go see your lady , Morelli , you 'll meet Tom-X there , too . If you ask me ... Go ahead ask me . - I 've started to quit asking . Even if you do not ask me ... This is an incredibly cheerful setup . And if you ... take a look at the panorama . It 's all terribly proper . - It 's all an illusion . What 's with the tone ? But you don 't want to hear about it . And here comes our exquisite friend , Gio . Damn , my machine is broken . They 're so very unqualified people . - All very neat in here . Hello , Mr. Tom-X , how are you ? - No , no , that 's not him . This is our cameraman , Knokke . - Hello , Tom ! That 's not him , either . - You can call me Bill . But where is Tom , where is he ? - He 's up there again . Lying on the divan ... - What is he doing up there ? Nice stories ... whatever . - Yes , chairs , let 's have a seat . Gio ? Please listen to me . I need new shoes . Of course , you need money tomorrow . No need to shout at me ! Take a look first . My consciousness has changed . It 's incredibly dark out there ! - although they 're there - So we 're supposed to find four older gentlemen . Who have changed their name , their identity . Maybe more . Their name , their profession - What else can you switch besides those things ? - Women . The tactic . - The Position . The hairdresser . Residence . - Interests . Language . - Taste . The teeth . The style . The car . Wallpapers . - Gender . View of the world . Standard of living . - The character . What do you think ? Is it possible to keep a complicated , scientific formula inside a poem ? Why not ? But you would need an additional key . So you 're saying ... if one has the poem , one has nothing yet . What possibilities can a small group of conspirators possess , let 's say of five scientists , to offer to a totalitarian regime a way to conquer the whole world . Change identity . Abandon all ties to the past . Obliterate all traces . I am a scientist myself , and I know ... This kind of invention you would want to preserve for posterity . Yes , yes , that 's correct . So Belotti would have to have had ... So he did have an heir constituted . The question is , who would he have that kind of trust in ? Probably somebody who can 't use it themselves . What are you waiting for , to work ! - What is it , Knokke , come on ! Get up ! To work ! What 's that ? - Let 's go ! Just get everyone who comes by . To waive fame , success , and wealth . Abandon all ties to the past . Obliterate all traces . But what good is that against a perfect secret service ? Against torture , drugs ... So to a certain degree they must have erased themselves . Had their brains washed . Get everything out ! No , no , I want to keep the candelabra ! Alright then , back inside . If there is anything left ... to recognise the four scientists by ... and which recalls their former existence ... after they erased themselves ... then that would be the only thing that escaped annihilation . The act of annihilation , and the traces of this act . Something wrong ? Is he ill ? No , he 's like that . To really do work I need to know where the material is going . Who 's behind it . Are you getting the one on the left ? - I have the much better view through the lens . - Alright . Those last twelve , and then we 're done . You see , to me it makes no difference , whether they cannot be found , or they do not exist . They did exist . - If we don 't find them , shouldn 't we make them up ? I would prefer that . Got anyone yet ? - About eleven . Him ! That one ! There . No. 2 . Aren 't those - - Yeah , competitors . What are they doing here ? What did you get ? A book . - What about ? It 's my specialty . I write about Chinese music , too . About Chinese music ? Yes , I have a collection of musical instruments . I started it only after the war . Do you speak Chinese ? - No , no , not at all . I do understand Chinese , but I 'm only saying that . This is a sort of deposit . Please sign a receipt . Don 't you want to count it ? - Oh , it 'll be right . What ? Everyone comfy ? This place is full of old guys . If we want ... to get all of them before the lens - - That is exactly our job . It 'll take years . We have to work systematically . That 's right . I have a suggestion . - Yes ? Have a look . 17 , 18 , 19 . About 20 people . - What do you mean ' about 20 ' ? Twenty . More or less ? Seventeen . - I think it 's a good idea . This way we won 't miss anybody . Nice when money 's not an issue . - Until when then ? Tomorrow ? - As quickly as possible . Consider it done . Knokke , the one over there ! Get him ! We missed him earlier ! Don 't fall asleep . - One more or less , enough already ! Here , you 're getting your money , Knokke . Take it ! Let me take a look at this . Just as I thought , window glass . You got fire ? Nevermind . There they are again . Excuse me - The man is good . What we could use would be - I actually didn 't notice . - And for the second time . Tell me , did you arrange all this by yourself ? This could become a threat in the long run . We 're not giving away the material just yet . I don 't know . - Just leave it to me . Your people should appear more reputable . Excuse me ? My people should appear - I understand . I started my research in Munich , in libraries , at universities , institutes , and so on , you get the idea . If we now take this research abroad , I am certain we will find significant clues . But the four were supposed to be here right about now , anyway . That 's what you said , isn 't it ? Well , I think so - - Yes or no ! Yes , that 's what I said . Anyway ... I think we need to zero in on this matter from all sides . And then follow every trace until the end . This way we will find proof , we 'll identify these people , and make them talk . I don 't need proof to make people talk . How many ? Seventeen . Okay , accommodation for seventeen people . I 'm on it . Say , aren 't these the people ... you helped in their search for Belotti - for No. 3 ? What shall we register them as ? A choral society ? How long have you known this Tom ? - Why ? Does he bother you ? He doesn 't bother me . Why not as an amateur film club ? They could be using their equipment the whole time . We leave tomorrow . Why not today ? What 's next ? - Everything 's going according to plan . Though I don 't remember why . You never did . You 're right , but it never bothered me . I 'm surprised too , but there 's progress . Really ? - Yes , really . I hope so . And what else ? Nothing else . Should I stop ? Keep taking care of ... Mr. Morelli . Do come in , Mr. Morelli . You needn 't be ashamed . I 'll explain everything to you . Yes . That one . That 's the one I mean . I believe this could have been him . Focus on him some more . You think ? - like I said , I may have to go to New York next week . We 're fabulously stuck here . - Tom ? Who is this Morelli ? Who 's behind Morelli ? I don 't know yet . But give me some time . Not everything has gone the way I had pictured it . We 've just been filming old men . But not much longer . Soon we 'll do a 180 degree turn and have a go at our client . If they don 't take us out before that . Lunette ? Understood . Where are they ? In the lounge at the Hotel Bellevue . - our equipment , the material - - And Gio ? These guys are underestimating our options . - Think about it . Who 's paying for your material ? And where does it go once it leaves your cameras ? Two new ones . I think I know them . I 've seen them before somewhere . - Maybe at the movies ? Of course , in our own film ! - Tom , I 'm sorry ! I 'll have to leave you lot for a couple of days . I 'm flying to Munich tomorrow , to continue with my research . If you need anything , these gentlemen are always at your service . They 'll take care of everything . You won 't have to do anything for the time being . Just stay calm , talk to nobody . Time for bed , kids . Easy , easy . Did we just pay ? No . To piss . Peepee . Let 's go . That way out . That way ? I thought this way . Tom , Tom , Tom . You have to listen to me ! Tom , believe me , please ! I 'm in the dark myself . I too have been but a tool . But I do want to find out ! Like you ! We have to trust each other . We mustn 't keep anything from each other . Together we know enough , and are strong enough , to get a grip on this thing . He 's worrying me . I think we should be kinder to him . I agree , he 's in quite a precarious state . Maybe the two of you and him should ... - Tom ! So he gets a bit more relaxed , at ease . I got you now . Take it easy . Let him live a bit longer . I 've been meaning to talk to you . I think it 's necessary . If you think so . But alone . Come on , get out of here . I 've wanted to take another look at this . Tom , Tom , Tom , don 't you know what 's at stake ? We can 't lose any more time , don 't you understand ? We just have to cling to the facts . You just need to tell me what you know ! I 'm surprised your boss didn 't fire you after this slip-up in Munich . The only confidants are now our partners . You 're just a henchman yourself these days . - You think so ? After everything I 've seen . - What little you have seen ... You just have to say it . If all you want is to neutralize us , you may well have achieved that . But if you want us to do anything else , I demand to know who is the boss . If I told you the boss is just the financier , and I 'm calling the shots . Would that suffice ? So what do we know ? We know that Belotti - Belloni . Ah yes . The famous tenor . - Belotti ! He used to sing soprano . - Of course . The one with the sex change . - That 's Boletti ! From the Milano Scala . The voice ! Belotti , the scientist ! - What , singing 's not enough ? I 'm proposing we work together . And if I don 't ? Then you could be unlucky . So tell me your price . You must be buyable , too . I only work in public , and for the public ! And the public will fund it , too . Don 't kid yourself ! No , no , really ! I don 't need a syringe ! So how about it ? I don 't think we 'll work together . I 'll have to leave the case to Herbert then . Knokke , where are you ? There 's someone lurking in the bushes . Breakfast , please ! Wake up , we 're surrounded . What , really ? Encircled . Beleagured . Cut off from the outside world . - Fabulous , finally something happens . What 's going on ? The trees are again full of gangsters today . There 's one ! I 'll have that one for breakfast ! Cross the mountains in this old thing ? Say , Lunette ... I 'd like to propose a deal . No drawback - I never do drawbacks . - You get half the profits . What more can you gain ? This is your job . Who , me ? - Yes . Knokke ! Do that again . Do it yourself . Hand it over . - imaginary places , a labyrinth - - kept them alive - - the feeling everything here is dead already everything recurs - The invention has been realised . - reproduction- Not magic , not at all ! Whatever you want . Anytime . Space becomes plane . Simply flat . Centuries become a second . Nothing breaks , just the opposite . Everything is reproduced . - anti-time- - eternity- Belotti wants to talk to you . But who tells whom ? We need to get a head start . You 'll have it easy getting rid of all the traces . - fled from Germany and destroyed everything - But Gio found some info on them . So the boss is one of the five . - Wrong . How so ? - Good evening . Get me this Tom , will you . I had to gain his trust ! To get him to talk ! Now at least we know ... that on the one hand he knows almost nothing , and that on the other hand , what he 's learned from me , can be of no use to him ! Do you understand ? Besides ... I knew the whole time ... you are always being briefed on everything . I knew we were being eavesdropped on . There ! You were always around us ! Your people . Here for example ! - waiting for the code word - Again like a fairy tale , with a magic word . If I had money , I 'd buy a single book . And go someplace where I thought I could read it . I 'm currently reading 1001 Nights at the hotel . And then you really ought to have the money to go to Beirut , Of course . - to read the book . Get up . Come . Hey , put those away . Or don 't you ever read ? Like Belotti , they probably - - been told , that he has already passed . Very strange , suddenly he 's dead - During your search ... did you encounter three , four old gentlemen ... who were looking for three , four old gentlemen like myself ? Again like a fairy tale , with the magic word . And now - - the great - And I found myself with my mistress , as a big , grey-blue bird , dragging its wings ... through the evening 's shades . - very , very complicated scientific formula . - inside a poem - You 'll need an additional key . So you 're saying , if one has the poem , ... one has nothing yet . That 's not for you . Come on , let 's go . Open up . Show us . - What will I get ? I don 't know yet . Show us first . Yes , hands up ! Who has the key to decrypt the poem ? The poem just has to be reassembled in the right way . Certainly a decision would be easier to bear among five than alone . My jacket . You could have run now . I was waiting for these gentlemen . That 's one of the four gentlemen . Memorize him . But no violence , please . Who do you work for ? Where 's Lunette gone ? He should have been here by now . If you would allow me some advice ... Don 't trust him . The man plays foul . I hid it . Inside a poem . Never , never , never ! They are after me ! - Who ? So he does exist . I 'm glad you came . Have a seat . - I was curious . Though your men 's rudeness almost would have thwarted a meeting . I know . But what can I do ? In my situation I 'm dependent on them . Now for you . You 're a poet . What makes you say that ? What lead you there ? You can help me . And he could have been a threat to you . I thought you knew what was at stake . For me or for you ? How can you be this calm ? - Leave , if you want . I 'm staying . You 're in danger , too ! They could be here any moment ! You 're overreacting . Have a seat and calm down . Diana , you don 't know what kind of people we 're dealing with . They are capable of anything ! - So am I. That 's why I 'm staying until I know what happened to Tom . They don 't remember anything . They don 't know each other , anymore . They only know the code word . And each reacts to the other 's code word that he himself doesn 't know . It was Belotti 's idea . - There is no Belotti . You are Belotti . Only he knew . Now you do . - What . I think you 're double-crossing . None of this is coincidence , our encounter , Tom being here . Who are you working for ? You are stupid . You 're imagining things . It 's all very simple . I 've known Tom for a long time . But I know you know more than you say . And how do you know that ? He forced us to destroy everything . Our work , the formula , ourselves . But you 're alive , and you have the others . We didn 't survive it . We outlived ourselves . What else do you want ? Here they are ! Hello friends , I 'm back ! Marvellous , isn 't it . Signor Morelli . I 've got something for you . This will interest you . And not just you . Here , you know him ? It 's all a scam . - a certain idea - I 'll tell you who that is , you 're not going to believe it ! That is one of the five scientists we 're looking for . One of the five wise men , you know the story . The man in the background . - Cinque . - Your boss ! It 's all a scam . Just stop it already . Not before I have it back . Before I know - All a scam . ... who I was . What we knew back then . What we did . Belotti knew . Why didn 't he tell you himself ? We couldn 't find each other . We didn 't know each other . - You almost had him . Yes , almost . It didn 't work . Lunette is with me now . I made him flip . But Lunette is Cinque 's right hand . - He was , he was . Now he 's acquired an interest . He got me those photos . Another uncle for the family album . What have you done to Knokke ? Hey , are you crazy ? - Where is he ? How should I know ? - But you should know , shouldn 't you ? It 's you who managed everything . - Why don 't you ask Lunette ? It wouldn 't work . It cannot work . With these people , with these methods . Are they acting on their own , or was this necessary ? They just think they 're acting on their own . They are just doing what 's necessary . And they believe in it . Once I 'm ready again , there will be no questions . All will be restored . Made up for thousandfold . Careful ! - Bill , stop with that , he 's a killer ! He is Knokke 's murderer ! - Excuse me , excuse me . You 're very touchy . If at all possible , not in the stomach . It only happened ... because I wasn 't around . Now I am . Bill , calm down ! It could have happened to everyone of us ! You betrayed all of us . - I saved all of us ! We were all on the hit list . Now we 're holding all the aces ! Now we can get them ! Your aces are blanks , just like you ! But I don 't believe it . If you could ask of me whatever you wanted . Everything I possess , and that 's a lot . A whole lot . Tell me . - This poem . The cue . The code word . The formula . I don 't know , anymore . I have forgotten it . Like Belotti . I 'm Belotti , and he has forgotten . You will remember . I am certain . We have time . Accompany me to the library . Good work . I made this one . Mine are better , though . Hey you ! She scratches ! That 's nice . He thinks of us for once . Pays a visit . Let go of me ! You 're not like this usually ! Fidgeting ! I like it ! Not here . Take her to the basement if you must . The boss himself . Your people 's behaviour is characteristic . Lock her up . No , Herbert will do it . Yes . Did they resist ? What ? They were expecting you ? Don 't worry . I 'm sorry . My uncle owns a silver mine in Bolivia . Bolivia ? - He needs a bodyguard . We 'll set up a press conference . What do you think ? That 's our salvation , escape into the public ! I don 't care about the public . I want to know : What happened to Tom ? - The press has been alerted . It 's your risk , darling . But I 'll come along . He 's old and I 'm the only heiress . You get it ? Ah , that 's what you mean . - Exactly that . Stop staring at me like that ! What else do you want ? I know how to get out of here ! Almost all of them are gone . Come , Tom . Come on . Come , please . You are thirty years too late . It 's a single word . We just need that word . No. 3 knew it . Let go ! Stop that ! Give me the pistols ! Tom , there you are ! - Is it over now ? If you all agree - But to use your comparison : You wanted gold and made porcelain . If I want ... only the porcelain from the start - Lunette . What has this Gio offered you ? Ten times that . Herbert , you were right . Now you can make up for the fact this Mr. X got away . Go to this event . Get him back at any price . O 'Brien , you go , too . Bring him to the castle . Morelli aswell . Cinque 's people are everywhere . - Got it . Stay calm . One hour . Not a word about Cinque . Nothing will change . - What does he want ? I don 't know anything now . They will try to answer your questions . Just go ahead and ask . Yes . You promised us the solving of the Belotti aka Dr. Scheinfeldt case . What about the other four ? They were supposed to rise from the dead to make an appearance . We detested violence . You wouldn 't have come voluntarily . They are my colleagues . They are all part of this story and will and will in due time will in due time give their explanations . You looked for us , we let ourselves be found . - too many . Take a look . Recognize anyone ? Camera running ? Playboys ! Who are you referring to ? The situation has changed , only the five of us - Nothing will change ! Where 's that cameraman of yours ? I believe he has had a little accident . And he will soon - Soon be available again . We are obliged . - But nobody can force us . I don 't want to force you . I 'm asking you . The mystery will unravel - will unravel here today before your very eyes ! We 'll have to wait just a little bit longer . Hey , what is this again ? We 'll have to wait . How much longer ? Are you trying to provoke us ? Does anyone here play - Is there a piano player among you ? Belotti will come . He will not participate . Our agreement persists . - an outrage ! We 're not here for the fun of it ! Come up here . Shut up ! I 'll now explain to you what 's going on here . You 'll see in a second . I - Do not panic ! Follow orders and you won 't be hurt . Away from the doors ! Resistance is futile . All exits are guarded . Everybody on the stage ! Get on the stage and remain calm ! You will stay on the stage for one hour . Then you can leave . Try to leave the stage before that , and you will be shot . We 're not joking around ! Let 's go ! Only now we are ready ! Am I ready ! You were once much more so ! Let 's forget about the years . Let 's start over ! Together . We cannot grow apart . Each of us is part of the whole . Friendship . There 's a car coming ! I told you : Belotti will come . Don 't go this fast ! Turn right for the castle . May I introduce : Tom-X , our fifth man . Belotti 's heir . Morelli , my expected scientific successor . Well then . Prove to my colleagues that Belotti let you in on our secret . Tom-X is going to be our new boss . We 've become good friends by now . And I found myself with my mistress as a big , grey-blue bird - - ascending towards the stucco ceiling , dragging its wings through the evening 's shades . At the foot of her canopy bed . That should be that , Morelli . So we have four parts . Now we only need the fifth part of the code . And the key . Verse number five - Cinque . You can stay , though . Did he give you some ? Yes , great stuff . Easy ! Don 't move ! And I ... found myself ... with my mistress - - big , grey-blue - At the foot of her canopy bed , I was a clumsy bear ... with purple gums , and fur faded from grief . The eyes ... fixed on fixed- - fixed on the ... crystal and silver ... of the consoles . All became ... shade . And glowing - All became shade - - glowing aqua . Aqua !

 Devereaux ? - Frazer ? ! - ( Rattles handle ) What are you playing at ? Let me out of here ... ( Hissing ) Devereaux , for God 's sake ! ( Coughing ) ( Electronic shrieking ) ( Electronic shrieking continues ) ( Electronic shrieking stops ) Oh , it 's stopped . Oh ... My eardrums are hanging out . What was that terrible noise ? Some sort of sound beam . I think it was coming from up there . What is this place ? What are they up to ? What about Traynor ? Did you see what they were doing to him ? ( Liz ) How horrible . He looked like he was being suffocated or something . And those men in gas masks ! Liz ! Hi. I haven 't seen you two before . Are you new around here ? Er , yes . Didn 't you change ? It doesn 't work unless you get into the gear . Can 't say I blame you - we look stupid . Still , you get used to it . - Maria ! - Huh ? Your name 's Maria . - How do you know that ? - We met before , five years from now . Only ... you were much older then . Professor Devereaux ... is this wise ? Traynor , of all people . You know as well as I do , Dr Frazer , that gas is only a tranquilliser . That 's not what I meant . Er , good afternoon , sister ! Good afternoon , Professor . - What did you mean ? - What happens now ? To Traynor ? We let him sleep it off for a bit , maybe he 'll be more reasonable . - We can 't hold Traynor here . - What do you suggest ? We should abandon the project before the whole thing gets out of hand . - lf the government finds out ... - Who will tell them ? The volunteers will start asking questions - the entire programme could be in danger . The cloning will go ahead , with or without government approval . And Traynor ? Suppose you leave that to me . I have one or two rather interesting plans of my own for Commander Traynor . All clear . Come on in . - ls this your sleeping quarters ? - Home , sweet home . All mod cons . They treat us really well here . We get anything we ask for . - The beds are comfortable . - You should taste the food . - We get three huge meals a day . - Prisoner 's last request . - Hm ? - Oh , nothing . Now , what 's all this about Professor Devereaux ? And me ? In the future ? It 's a long story , and you won 't believe it . - You and the others are in great danger . - For goodness ' sake , why ? What are you doing here ? What is this place ? Don 't you know ? This is the Devereaux Institute . - We 're all volunteers . - For what ? Scientific research , of course . We 're all students on our summer break . - To help Professor Devereaux . - What experiments ? Where have you two been for the past five years , on the moon ? Devereaux 's working on life expansion , everybody knows that . So it is the longevity theory - l was right . We 're submitted to daily genetic observation , - intensive blood tests , psychiatry . - Psychiatry ? Mm , a course of hypnosis . That 's where Mr De Sarem comes in . - Doesn 't it scare you ? - No , actually it 's quite enjoyable . - We don 't even know it 's happening . - So in that room you were hypnotised ? - The time chamber , you mean ? - Time chamber ? There are several of them . A Regency drawing room , a Neolithic cave , even a space capsule . It 's all done by special sound waves . So by wearing strange clothes and sitting in that strange room , - you can be transported through time ? - Right back to the reign of George lll . - Fantastic ! - lt 's exhilarating , I can assure you . Devereaux must be using psychiatric research for the cloning process . Then why was I in the room without windows ? Room without windows ? What on earth 's that ? Commander Traynor . Commander , can you hear me ? It 's me , Frazer . How are you feeling ? Don 't try to move , I promise you you 'll be all right . ( Gasping ) What ... What have you done to me ? I can 't ... I can 't move . Listen carefully , Commander , they 've used a tranquilliser drug on you , your muscles are paralysed . It 's only temporary . In two or three hours the tension will go . No , Commander , don 't - it 's quite useless . Please ... please listen to me . It wasn 't my fault , you 've got to believe me . I didn 't want this to happen . I was forced into it ! ( Gasping ) Frazer ... Help me ! There 's nothing I can do . Devereaux would kill me . Please ! I can 't believe it. I just can 't believe it . I trusted Devereaux , we all did . Everything he told us seemed to make sense . What did he tell you ? How did he persuade you all to come here ? Oh , Simon , don 't you understand ? He didn 't persuade us , we answered his advertisement in the newspaper . Advertisement ? I remember the first time he interviewed me . He was so quiet and gentle . And logical . Men of his age find it difficult to talk with young people , but not him . He told me that if I helped , that getting old would one day be a thing of the past . And now you 're trying to tell me that you 've seen me as an old woman five years from now . I know it sounds incredible , but no more than you being hypnotised to a different time phase . Even if it were true , why should I be turned into an old woman ? The point of these experiments is to prolong life , not reduce it . The longevity tests have never been perfected . That 's why Traynor 's been trying to get the longevity drug . Nobody 's used any drugs on us . Not yet . But they will . But we 're volunteers . Devereaux assured us this was the way that young people could contribute to society . - We 're not here against our will . - Then why can 't you leave here ? Why are you caged in like animals ? It isn 't true ! No , I tell you , we 're here for a purpose ! We don 't need iron bars ! Maria , don 't you see ? You 've got to get out of here before it 's too late . You mustn 't let the future happen ! - This boy , where did he come from ? - With the new volunteers . I never interviewed these two . You better tell me what 's going on here , De Sarem . I can assure you that neither of them are anything to do with me . - When they came in , I thought ... - Where are they now ? - ln the wards , I presume . - You presume ? Ward sister ! If they catch you in my room there 'll be trouble . What are you going to do ? I don 't know , not until I 've had a chance to talk with the others . When you get out , turn left along the corridor , at the bottom there 's a door on your right , that 's the laundry . You can get out through the window . We don 't want to get out yet . We 've too much to do here . Maria 's right , if they catch us there 's no knowing what they might do . We can 't achieve anything by getting caught . All right . Be careful , whatever you do . See you again , sometime in the future . Too late , it 's the ward sister ! Quick , over here ! - You alone ? - Yes , sister . More or less . Who 's that ? It 's Joan Peterson , she had a headache after the hypnotherapy . I told her to sleep it off . She 's only just got to sleep , poor thing . - lsn 't it time you were at meal break ? - Yes , sister . Just going . Well , hurry up , then . You can come out now . ( Tuts ) You might 've taken your shoes off . ( Door opens ) Traynor ? Commander Traynor ? Are you awake ? Ah , splendid , you are awake . I think you and I ought to have a nice little chat . Water ... Oh , how inconsiderate of me , you have a thirst . Allow me . You know , we have a lot to talk about , you and I , Commander . A lot of work ahead of us . I want you to tell me all about yourself . Your past , your present , your future . I mean , that 's what we 're concerned with now , aren 't we ? ( Devereaux ) Who unbolted that door ? It must 've been like this all the time . I want a guard on this room , night and day . Nobody is to enter without my permission , clear ? Yes , sir . I said that no personal jewellery was to be worn inside the time chambers . I don 't understand , everyone 's checked before they enter . On second thoughts , forget about the guard on this room . If we have mice then we must set a trap . Lost it ? But you can 't have ! But I have , I tell you . I know I was wearing it . Where could you have dropped it ? Not inside the time chamber ? It must have fallen off behind the sofa . Well , it 's too late now , we must find Traynor . Simon , you promised we could go home ! - Please , don 't let 's stay ! - You saw what happened to Traynor . We 've got to find out why Devereaux wants him out of the way . Simon , I 'm scared . After what happened upstairs this place gives me the creeps . - Of course , that 's it ! - What is ? That 's where they 've taken Traynor . Come on ! Oh , no , Simon , I couldn 't bear it ! Please , don 't make me ! There 's nothing to be scared of . You don 't think I 'd let anything happen to you ? - Very funny . - Anyway , if we can find Traynor it could solve a lot of problems . And you know by now , no real harm can come to us when we 're in the past . Now , come on . This way . Tell Security to close the main gate . - No one enters or leaves until I say so . - Yes , sir . - Ready when you are . - ls he conscious ? Yes . But the drug is still active . He knows what we 've done to him . I want Commander Traynor prepared for hypnotherapy . One hour from now . Commander Traynor ? What is it ? What do you want ? Hm ? Who are you ? It 's us , Liz and Simon . You know us . No , he doesn 't . This is only 1965 . Keep away from me . Don 't come near me . We 're your friends . We 've come to help you . We saw what happened - it was Devereaux . - Devereaux . - Why are they doing this to you ? You ... You want to help me ? Yes . Just tell us what to do . Devereaux 's mad . Mad ! Wants to destroy me . Wants to destroy us all . Wants to destroy us all ! Yes , Commander , I understand . Got to stop him ... Go to my office , tell them ... We 'll take you with us . We 'll help you escape . No ... Too late. I ... I can 't move . My-My body ... para-paralysed . - Simon ... - Paralysed ? No time now , go to my office , get help . Quickly ! We 'll go , but is there nothing we can do ? No , nothing . Hurry , please , hurry . Hurry . Come on , Liz . ( Devereaux ) I 'll see him alone first . Over here . Traynor ? I know you can hear me , I just want to talk to you . We 've come a long way together , you and I . We had a dream . A dream that is about to become a reality . The human mind and body will live on , Traynor . Think of that . Something that man before has never dared to attempt . And you wanted to throw away such an opportunity . But I will not allow our progress to stop there . By your sacrifice ... we shall change the face of the world . The technological world of tomorrow will be vastly different from that of today . And do you know why ? Because of you . I shall give you immortality . One day the world will be yours ! Yours and mine . ( Exhales ) Oh , Simon , he is mad , isn 't he ? Really mad . Yes . And yet ... Well , there 's an awful lot in what he says . Technology must find its way in the world . We can 't progress without it . Oh , you - you and your scientific rubbish ! One of these days Devereaux , or-or somebody like him , will blow the whole world up . We know it could happen ! For God 's sake , go ! While there 's still time . Commander Traynor , I know it 's difficult for you to believe , but we know you 're going to be all right . We 've seen you in the future . - What are you talking about ? - We met you before . We helped you at the old naval station , with the German raiding party . - Don 't you remember ? - No , it hasn 't happened to us yet ! You ... know about the naval station ? You were my father 's commanding officer . Frank Skinner . You must remember him , Commander ? Skinner ... ? Skinner . - You 're his daughter ? - Yes . Please , I don 't understand . I don 't know how you got here , and I don 't how it 's mixed up with Gottfried and the naval station , but if you 're really Skinner 's daughter , then I know I can trust you . But ... if you want to save me then you must save yourselves . Now , go . Please , go ! All right . But we 'll be back . We promise . Come on , we must go . He 'll be all right . Simon , we can 't leave him . We just can 't . Not like that . Listen , there 's something you 've got to understand . To us , this is the past , five years ago . Whatever 's happened to Traynor in 1965 we can 't prevent . To help him we have to stop the future . Devereaux 's vision of the future . We must get back to our own time phase . Come on , we 'd better use the stairs . I told you Tottenham 'd smash ' em . You should 've listened to me . Yeah , got a line on . Yeah , I won ten bob . Eh ? No , they haven 't got any chance at all . Look ... you just ring Uncle Fred , he 'll tell you what to do . Eh ? Oh , er ... Very good , sir. I 'll send it down straightaway . Thank you . - Wait a minute . - What 's wrong ? - Your bracelet . - lt 's too late . We can 't risk being caught . If they find it in the time chamber , they 'll know we 've been in there . Come on , it won 't take a minute . - That 's a bit of luck . - Be careful . - lt is here. I was right . - Don 't touch it . - What 's the matter ? - We were on the floor . Why 's it there ? - Come on . We 're getting out of here . - ( Liz gasps ) Simon ! Simon , what are they going to do to us ? I don 't know . Whatever happens , you 're not to tell them a thing . Understand ? I 'm frightened . We 're never going to get away now . Yes , we are . They won 't hold us . They wouldn 't dare . ( Buzzing ) - What 's that noise ? - lt 's coming from these things . It 's the beam . Simon , it 's the sound beam ! - They 're going to hypnotise us . - Hold on , Liz . Whatever you do , hold on . I can 't bear it ! The noise ! It 's going through my head . - Simon ! - Hold on , Liz ! Concentrate on anything but hold on !

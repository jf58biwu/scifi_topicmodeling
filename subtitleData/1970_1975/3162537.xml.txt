 Why don 't you stay and make your home here ? Well , that 's a good question . I guess the reason is that Virdon 's got an itch in his feet and I got rocks in my head , which is why I go along . We 're taking a survey of the far side of every hill on the horizon . I 'd like to give you a better answer , but I can 't think of one . Daughter . Amy will you say goodbye ? No . You 're a stranger from another world . I don 't know how to talk to men from another world . I 'm sorry Amy 's upset . I expected her to be . I know my daughter . - I wish you well . - Thank you for everything , Talbert . You ready ? Let 's go . - Bye . - Bye . Maybe they will come back someday . No . Never . All right . Move along . Move along . I 'm just transferring these two to the work force in the next village . Father what 's wrong ? It 's nothing . I 'm just a little tired . Little tired . If I were only young and strong again . Urko , a message from Trion . The troopers report the humans have sleeping sickness . I 'll do better next time . Urko , we have a bet . The best two of three ! I haven 't got time to play games . What 's the matter , Galen ? You hear something ? - Not yet . - Expecting company ? Trouble . What is this , crystal-ball time ? Let us in on it . What 's the matter ? Something 's bothering you . You are . - I don 't like what you did . - When ? When I joined up with you two I knew that I would have to face the same dangers that you face . In fact , Urko has probably told his gorillas that I am first priority on his death list . With my own people , I 'm a renegade . I accept that . But I did think at least that we would try to protect each other . Hey , who 's not protecting what ? Or did I miss something ? Galen , I still don 't understand what it is . If you tell me what it is , I 'll correct it if I can . You can 't put water back into a broken bottle . Time and time again you have cautioned us that we must be very careful not to tell anyone about ourselves . Amy . Amy . I 'm in love with you . Amy , you met me one week ago , you 'll forget me in two . Will you forget me ? No . Alan take me with you , please ? - I can 't . - I 've told you why . - You 're married . I don 't believe you ! You 're lying . Amy now listen . I 'm a stranger here . I come from a world that 's very difficult to explain . It 's this world but in a different time . A long , long time ago . Now , you must not tell anyone but I want you to understand . Where I come from where I hope to return someday in that world , I do have a family . Lies ! There is no other world ! First , you made her angry . Then you told her who we are . Not only did you trust her with your life but you trusted her with ours . You 're right , Galen . I shouldn 't have told her . She ... Well , she was hurt . I wanted to make her understand why I couldn 't stay . That 's not an excuse , that 's ... I 'd just like you to know why . I am truly sorry . I didn 't think that you meant any harm . It just did seem like such a needless risk to take . It was . Chalk it up to the fact that I 'm only a human . - Oh , yes . Sometimes I forget that humans can 't help the weaknesses they have . Father ! Father ! Order . Order . Please come to order ! You babble on like frightened humans . There is much at stake here , Zaius . Our historians have brought this to my attention . In the early part of the Ornan period a fever , which struck only the human population killed several hundred in a section of the rural zone . The entire sector became barren for years afterwards . I am aware of the possible loss of goods and labor . - I have ordered Trion quarantined . - Quarantined ? Burn it ! Before we consider any such measures , Urko our chief medical officer , Zoran , has something to say . Members of the council I have done considerable research in the diseases of the lower species . - I have certain theories of treatment ... - Theories ? ! Excuses to waste time and resources on intellectual games . I intend to test my theories in Trion . The entire labor force is threatened , and he wants to test theories ! Trion is quite isolated . With the quarantine , the risk is reduced greatly . If I can save Trion , we need fear this fever never again ! Zero loss of labor and goods in the future . - Lf you can save Trion ! - Vote ! Vote ! Those in favor of allowing Zoran to proceed to Trion ... - Aye . - No ! So be it . I will be at Trion to enforce the quarantine and if you fail ... You will not regret your faith in me . Well , good morning , friend . - Hey . - I 'm sorry , sir . - You 're from Trion . - You 're the coal carrier . - Not anymore . - What do you mean ? I was lucky . I was outside the village . Guards let no one in , no one out . - A man was shot . - What are you talking about ? It 's quarantined . A plague . I was told many are dead and more will die . Many more . - Do you know the names of the dead ? - Nothing . Nothing . I was spared . Even a name could carry the fever . Now wait a minute ! Wait ! Guy doesn 't have to be a mind reader to figure out what you 're thinking . Tell him that it makes no sense to go waltzing into a plague-ridden village . If you did go back , what good could you do ? I don 't know . But what if we were the ones who started it ? What if we were carrying some virus , harmless to us but deadly to them ? If you went , isn 't there a possibility you could catch the fever too ? Yes , there is , if we didn 't get shot trying to get in . Come on , Alan , this makes no sense . Pete , we 've gotta try . We 've got to at least try to help them . Did I say we didn 't at least have to try ? All right , we 'll try . I 'm in . I 'm in ! Now , look , you just wait one minute ! Now you just wait ! Are you planning to include me in on this trip back to Trion ? Yes , I figured ... - I hoped we would stay together . - But we 've just been through all that ! Just because that girl is in love with you , should I risk my life ? No . There 's no reason at all for that . Should you risk your life by going back there ? But you stubbornly insist upon doing it , don 't you ? I am getting to be no better than a human . Come on , let 's go ! What are you doing back here ? Haven 't you heard there 's fever ? We know about the problem and would like to help . The council has sent the chief physician . Now go back ! - All we want is to ... - I have orders to kill anyone that crosses the quarantine line ! Now move ! Look , look ! Stagnant water . - And mosquitoes ! - Yeah , come on . Help me . Please . - No question about it . - Malaria . Okay , let 's get started . - Alan ! - Amy . My father ... My father is dead . Amy , I 'm so sorry . Amy , how do you feel ? I 'm fine . I 'm very tired , but I 'm not sick . All right , listen to me . All of you . Come in here and listen . Hurry , people . Please . There 's no time to lose . Closer . All right . The first thing , we 've gotta bury the dead immediately . If we don 't , we 'll be fighting fever and dysentery and worse . We 've gotta set fires , make smoke to keep away the mosquitoes . A treatment center 's gotta be set up right way . Work parties have to be organized . Everyone who is ... Silence ! - You . Who are you ? - Just a man trying to help . I am Zoran . Chief medical officer of the Supreme Council . This is my assistant , Inta . I have complete authority here now . We 're happy to see you . Perhaps we can work together . A pit will be dug at once . It will be filled with water . And I will add certain medications . Everyone will immerse themselves . Each one of you will be bled the amount determined by your size and age . And there will be no physical contact between men and women until this disease is under control . You seem to have a talent for organizing . You 'll supervise the digging of the pit . Inta ! - You 're whistling Dixie , doc . - I 'm whistling ? I shall speak more clearly . You still hear it ? Is there something wrong with your ears ? - No , what I 'm saying ... - What he is suggesting , sir is that this particular disease , with which they are very familiar does demand special treatment . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? I 'm just transferring these two humans to another farm . Listen to them , sir . They are more intelligent than most . - So you 're familiar with this disease ? - It 's malaria . How clever . He even has a name for it ! Inta , call the guards . I haven 't the time to fool with him . - Please . The guards aren 't necessary . - Sir . You see , malaria means " bad air . " Like the type you find around those stagnant pools that we passed . You see , sir the mosquitoes that live around that stagnant water carry the disease . - It 's communicated by their sting . - That is enough ! I don 't know whether to have you shot for stupidity or hanged for insolence . Germs flying through the air on the backs of insects . Disease of the lower species are transmitted from bodily contact ! This one isn 't . - You are challenging my word . - Sir , he did not mean to be insolent . Like most humans , fear puts foolish words in their mouths . - I have a quick cure for that . - But they do both know something about medicine . - That is impossible ! - Arrest these two ! - Arrest them ? I 'll shoot them ! They 've crossed the quarantine line . - As you please . - I protest ! Has he had bodily contact with the lower species ? He has malaria . What is he saying ? What is malaria ? You said the fever strikes only humans . Explain ! I can 't . I can 't explain ! I can 't ! Neesa . Neesa 's dead . You dare tell that to Urko ? I want guards at that end of the road and more guards at that end . Watch closely . If anyone tries to escape from the village , shoot them ! - Now move out ! - Urko . - Think he 'll come into the village ? - I don 't know . Does it matter ? - Only if you wanna stay alive . - Maybe we could get away before Urko has guards posted everywhere . Look , Galen . You were right about us getting into trouble . And you 're probably right that we should leave now . But you won 't . - And you , Pete ? - I know it sounds silly . It sounds so silly , I won 't even say it . You know the answer . I know the answer . I knew it before I asked . I always do . I always disagree , and I always go along . But maybe I 'm sick ... In the head . Fire ! Fire ! Purification by fire ! That 's the only course left to us ! The situation is different now . Apes are being threatened ! Please . We must calm ourselves and think rationally . But an ape has died , Zaius ! It 's no longer a minor problem . You and your theories . He ought to be burned ! Urko , you are out of order ! I suggest we hear Zoran 's appraisal of the situation . I agree . He has promised us success . Upon my arrival in Trion , I discovered that the fever was not of the Ornan variety , as related in the textbooks . I made a discovery of a rare disease called " malaria " obviously fatal to apes and to humans . And obviously not transmitted through bodily contact . Then how , Zoran ? I have reason to believe that the disease grows in stagnant pools of water and is introduced into the bloodstream by the bite of mosquitoes . Zoran are you aware of what you 're asking us to believe ? - You can 't be serious ! - He 's got the fever himself . There are such pools of stagnant water in Trion . And humans and your soldiers were exposed to it . And what do you propose we do now ? Well , I need several hours to further reappraise the situation . I will not back down to a mosquito ! Urko , this disease is fatal to our people . We should use this situation to develop a cure . Yes . Perhaps there 's a positive side to this . We can experiment with the humans . Even if we lost an entire village if an ape cure was developed , it would be worth it . Historically , medicine progresses because of such experimentation . Yes . I believe we should use this opportunity . So be it . You will report to us . Yes , Zaius . You 're very good , ladies . Very good . - What are they doing ? - Protective masks and gloves . We have to send a work crew to drain off the stagnant water . I am in a difficult position with the council . I have told them your mosquito theory . In order to save you from punishment , should we fail I told them that the theory was my own . - You 're very generous . - No , not entirely . You see , if I had told them I heard it from you they would have asked who you were , how you knew this . Urko would be particularly interested and curious about humans who know more than they should . I do hope you know about this disease . - Have we been wrong yet ? - You provided a diagnosis and a name . Right or wrong , it adds up to very little . - What about treatment ? - There is a treatment . It 's quinine . It 's extracted from the bark of a tree called the " cinchona . " I 've never heard of it . There 's a heavily wooded area where a cinchona could grow . If we 're lucky , you will get a chance to see one . Down through here . Watch the bridge . This swamp 's gotta be drained . Right here . Remember , no part of your body exposed . Good luck , Galen . The rest of you , come on . Quick , everybody put their mask on . - Running away ? - No , the cure for the disease is in the bark of a tree . We believe ... " We believe " ? What do you mean , " we " ? I thought you had the sole authority here . I am the sole authority here . I described the tree to them , and we ... They believe it can be found in the forest . Why do you cover your faces ? What are you afraid of ? Mosquitoes . There are no mosquitoes here . Missed . Albino mosquitoes . All white . Very hard to see . - It could be . - Yeah , it could be . Let 's go . It could be . It 's bitter enough . - I 'd feel a lot better if we were sure . - So do I. - Terrible . - That 's what I learned as a kid . All good medicine tastes terrible . - But will it cure the fever ? - It won 't if we just stand around . Move over here . Take as much bark as you can , but quick . Everybody , come here . We gotta move fast . Get rocks , flat stones . We gotta grind this bark into powder as quickly as we can . - Any more deaths ? - One . - Any more illnesses ? - Two more sick . Amy . Amy . Amy . I 'm sorry . I wanted to help . I know . I know . Honey , it 's all right , just don 't worry . Amy , look , we found what we were looking for . But you gotta hang on . You gotta fight it . Okay ? Thattaboy . Come on . That 's it . Good . Good . Okay . Drink this now . Come on , drink it . I know . I know . Come on , try it again . Alan , Galen 's back . Another time , another world . Don 't go back . I love you . I love you ! Tell me ... Tell me the truth . I love you . Don 't go back . Don 't leave me . Don 't leave me . - The swamp has been drained . - Good work , Galen . Another time ... This world ... - Another world . - Another world ? Don 't go back . Don 't go back . Don 't go back . Doctor Zoran ! Doctor Zoran , come quick to the upper road . Hurry , hurry . Kava 's sick , he 's dying . Urko , Urko , Kava is sick . We 'll all catch the shaking sickness . Now we 'll see , doctor . Now we 'll see if the council still believes in you . This village will burn , and everyone in it . Everyone . Urko , I promise you that I will take care of it . You make empty promises and my troops are dying . Believe me . Believe me . I have the means to cure him . This is a new medicine . A new medication . It 's made from the bark of a tree which I looked for and found in time . You will not experiment with my troops . Now . Burn the village now before we are all destroyed . - No , we are making progress ! - This medication , Zoran is it effective ? - Yes , it will work . - It will take time ... - There is no more time . How many must die before you do what must be done ? - I demand a vote . - You will have your vote , Urko . No , no more talking . I sometimes wonder which you fear most , death or a few words of reason . You . I fear you . All of you . Listening to a fool . Zoran has found a medication . Perhaps it will work , perhaps not . What Urko says is true . With delay , there is risk . We have come this far . The answer , right or wrong , will be in a few hours . Those in favor of letting Zoran continue ? - Those against ? - Aye . Very well . The decision is mine . You have until noon tomorrow . Thank you , Zaius . Fools . When you are all dying in pain , like Kava don 't forget what I told you . Noon tomorrow . I don 't know . You told me the medication worked quickly . Yes , it does , but there could be other factors . We don 't know for sure whether it 's a true cinchona tree . It could be a mutation , no medicinal value . It could be a different strain of malaria that doesn 't respond . So many unknowns . I was in no position to bargain with the council . I know . I understand . We 'll medicate them again in the morning . - Nothing more we can do now . - Yes , I suggest you get some sleep . Well , I think I 'll get some air first . Amy . Amy . - Yes ? - Your friend from the " other world " ... - Yes ? - Where is that other world ? Where did he come from ? - Here . - Here ? Is he an astronaut ? Amy , listen to me , is he an astro ... ? Why are you sneaking up on me ? I was coming to look at the girl . Tell me something . - Is she talking strangely again ? - Strangely ? Yes , it 's the fever . It does make her say the most impossible things . She 's got a very good imagination , though . Yes , yes . I could make no sense of it . Here , drink this . It 'll help you . Who is it ? - What were those shots ? - Where have you been ? - Just a small mercy mission . - You treated Kava ? - Yeah . - Terrific , now he 's making house calls . - You risked your life for an ape ? - His pain is no different than theirs . - I left evidence behind when I ran . - Can anyone identify you ? I don 't think so . It was too dark . - I wonder if it matters . - What do you mean ? Whether Urko believes it was him or me , the results are the same . If Zoran loses , Urko wins . That gives him more freedom , authority , power to run things the way he wants . What difference does it make ? If we don 't come up with the results by noon , this village will be ashes . - What is it ? - I heard a sound . - There was someone with Kava . - Who ? I couldn 't see , sir . Kava , who was it ? Who was it ? Kava , was it Zoran ? Was it Zoran ? Did you drink this ? Did you drink this ? Yes . If Kava dies , if they 've killed him with this medicine I 'll kill you myself . How is she doing ? She seems to be resting better . Her fever 's down a little . When they wake up , we 'll give them the second medication . We need time . Zaius gave me until noon . If he can control the situation ... The gorillas are coming . They 'll burn our houses , everything . - There goes the situation . - Urko acts independently of the council ! I came here for a victory of my own . Urko will not take it away from me . Could the council have changed its mind ? I think not . This is between Urko and myself . - Do we try to get away ? - There 's no way now . Our future is in his hands . Watch . You may see the future come to a quick stop . We are helpless . We can 't run . We have no weapons . We 've got one . - Stand aside . - It is hours yet till noon , Urko . Stand aside or die with the others in the village . - The council voted . - The council be damned ! That is treason , Urko . I command you to withdraw . You command ? You have words , I have weapons . Would you kill me ? Before I allow you to let him kill my troops , yes . Listen to me ! Urko doesn 't care for you . He thinks of himself first . He would not let me help Kava . He would let Kava die to discredit me . It is Zoran who thinks only of himself . He could not help Kava , he could help no one ! It appears you are misinformed , Urko . - It 's a lie , a trick . - No ! Last night somebody came to me from the village . - I was dying . - Silence ! I order you . Urko , you are wrong . They gave me something to drink , bitter medicine . The medicine made me better . It saved my life , Urko ! Urko , I tell you again take your troops and withdraw , while you still have them to command . Withdraw ! Withdraw ! I 'd like to speak to you three for a moment , please . I suppose you 'll be wanting to leave soon . - Right . Today . - Well , I 'm afraid that 's not possible . - Why ? - I can 't let you go . - But , well , everything 's under control . - No , no , you don 't understand . I mean , I must tell Zaius and the others about you . You see , I know who you are . - What are you talking about ? - Don 't make it difficult . Your medical knowledge , the things the girl said . I know you are the two astronauts , and Galen is with you . Understand , I deeply appreciate what you 've done here , what I have learned from you . - Then how could you turn us in ? - Because you are fugitives . Zaius wants you , and I am loyal to Zaius . Then what we did here means nothing to you . No , it does . It does . It does . But ... - But we 're the lower species . - Yes . If we 're lower , how come we 're smarter ? No , I can 't explain that . How will you explain that your victory here is really theirs ? Or do you intend to keep all the credit ? No , I have no other choice . I have my position to uphold . You turn us in , you think we won 't tell Zaius ? He 'd never believe you . He 'd believe me . Very well , Galen , you may leave . Well , you see , where they go , I go . - Lf they stay here , I stay . - You can 't be serious . Just try me . But don 't you see , they are ... - I know , lower species . - Lower species . Lower . Well , now , Zoran , you 've got a decision to make . Your loyalty , or your ego . Ego ... I 'm not familiar with that word . How will you feel when Zaius finds out you 've been counseled by humans ? Every move you made , every word you spoke ? I suggest that you stay out of sight for now and then leave after dark . Good . It 's just as bad the second time . Saying goodbye , I mean . You 'll be all right , Amy . When I was sick I had this terrible dream that I told the apes about you and they were gonna hurt you . What a terrible dream . That 's all it was , just a dream . It seemed so real . There are a lot of things that seem real that , in time , turn out to be not so important or they 're forgotten . Someday , I 'll have a family and I 'll tell my children about this man from another world who 's the kind of man that they should grow up to be like . Be happy , Amy .

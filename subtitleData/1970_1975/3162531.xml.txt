 - Relax . - Yes , Urko . After all , it 's only a horserace . With half my horses and half my land bet on the result . Well , think of how rich you 'll be if you win . Lf . Lf . Lf ! You insist on the race . You make all the arrangements . You demand the bet . Have you ever lost a race to any prefect ? There 's always a first time . My horse is leading . Well , better luck next year . - There is a first time . - Shut up . The horse threw a shoe . - Who shod that horse ? - The blacksmith . I want that horse shod in time for the next race in the village of Venta . If this happens again , I won 't just kill the blacksmith , I 'll kill you too . It 's not necessary you work for the little food I 've given you . It wasn 't necessary for you to give us the food . I never talked to an ape before . - Really ? - I mean they talked at me , you know , giving me orders , things like that . But never like you and I are talking . Saying things you feel like saying . Well , would you believe that it was many years before I spoke to a human ? Except for giving orders . Well , why should apes give orders ? Why do we have to obey ? Well , there are two answers to that : Mine and the authorities ' . Seeing mine isn 't backed up by bullets I think you should listen to the authorities . Horses . Alan , Pete , horses . Stay here . You 'll be safe . This is Urko 's favorite horse . He 's thrown a shoe . - I 'll take care of him well , sir . - You will if you want to keep on living . There have been reports of a young human riding a horse near here . Human ? Riding a horse ? They must be crazy . Why would anyone risk being shot just to ride a horse ? Perhaps he 's crazy , as you say . In any case , he 'll be caught . And you know what the law is for humans riding . You 've been seen . How many times have I warned you ? Being seen is not being caught . Don 't worry , Father , I 'm careful . You 're not careful . You just won 't believe anything can harm you . Well , the apes can , and they will . You 're not so smart you can go on fooling them forever . I 'm not trying to fool them . I just don 't see why I can 't ... I don 't care what you see . I care about you staying alive . I won 't have you risking your life , trying to prove how clever you are . Now I want your word you won 't ride again . Father , I can 't prom ... I 've been bit . It 's a tiger scorpion . It 's a tiger scorpion . - Set him down . - Here he goes . - Tourniquet . Rope . Give me rope ! - Right . - It 's no use . - What do you mean , " It 's no use " ? Without an antidote , the sting of the tiger scorpion is fatal . - Where do we get an antidote ? - The clinic in town . I 'll go . It 's five miles . By the time you get there and back , Galen will be dead . - I 'm gonna steal one of your horses . - You 'll be caught . - Maybe not . - I 'll go . No , you won 't . If anybody takes a chance , it 's gonna be Alan or me . Galen 's our friend . - Right . - I 'd like him to be mine . Believe me , I know a back way . I can be there and back in no time . You 'd never make it , and Galen will die . - Galen needs help now . - Yeah , okay , then go . Go . If he just hadn 't have moved . Tiger scorpion never stings if you don 't move . And remember what I said . Stay off of the leg . Excuse me , but my brother 's been bitten by a tiger scorpion . - How long ago ? - It happened a couple of minutes ago . Are you telling the truth ? If it 's been any longer , the antidote won 't help . I am telling the truth . Wait here . This is to be given by mouth as soon as possible . Thank you . Halt . We 'll make camp here . We could stay in the village but there are too many loudmouthed humans here for the race . Did you see his face ? I think it was the blacksmith 's son , but I 'm not sure . Shoot him ! After him ! He 's back . - You made it . - Use this immediately . - Nice work , Gregor . - Thanks . We 're indebted to you , for Galen . Good boy . Martin says it takes about half an hour for the antidote to work . If it works . - What 's this ? What happened ? - It 's a bullet wound . I was seen . Now we are in trouble . The bullet was stopped by the shoulder blade . It 's nothing serious . Just be glad they missed me . Let 's get him into the barn . I 'll see if I can dig that bullet out . Stay with him , Pete . That horse looks like it 's wounded . I 'll see if I can 't lend a hand . Let me take a look at that , Gregor . I 've had some experience with horses . It 's not too bad . Give me a knife . Gregor , you hold his head tight . - Quick , Gregor , out of sight . - What ? Go on . Was it you riding the horse ? Do you deny it ? I don 't deny anything . This horse has been hurt . He 's got to be taken care of . Take him to the village . We 'll make an example of him . - I rode the horse . - So it was him after all . Come on , Gregor , don 't lie just to save my neck . Please , he 's young . He meant no harm . His own father confirms it . Let the other one go free . I won 't be so easy on you if you were to lie to me again . - Seize him . - No , please . Very , very foolish . You 'll be invited to witness the execution as part of the celebration after the race . Here 's your new saddle , Prefect Barlow . You 'll find it very good . Your horse will run well under it . It 's no use . We have no chance of winning the race . - Urko 's horse will win as usual . - It doesn 't seem fair . Fair ? When has Urko ever been fair ? Look at the way he transferred me here from Kaymack . Yes , and the stakes . Half my lands and half my horses if I lose . And of course , I 'll lose . Martin , Galen 's gonna be fine . - Look , Pete and I talked it over , and ... - We want to help Gregor . If there was any way , anything , you think I 'd be standing here ? We can go talk to the prefect . We 'll tell him Gregor was riding that horse to save an ape . The prefect will not listen to humans . - Well , then we 'll try something else . - We 're gonna go look around . Venta 's a small village , isn 't it ? We don 't need identification ? The new prefect , Barlow , lets humans come and go freely . - Barlow ? - Barlow ? - Galen . - You 're supposed to be in bed . No , I 'm fine . Is that the same Barlow who used to be prefect at Kaymack ? - Yes , that 's what they say . - Well ! Wait a minute , I know what you 're thinking . We 'll talk to Barlow . You belong in bed . No , look , he 's a friend of mine . I think he 'd pay more attention if I talked to him . We 'll tell him we 're delivering your message . You 're still too weak . Fine . And just to make it more convincing I 'll go along and faint in his presence . Very funny . Is Barlow really your friend ? Would he listen ? - Could he help to save Gregor ? - I 'll do everything I can . - What are we waiting for ? - Be reasonable . Venta 's five miles from here . You 're not strong enough to walk . An ape of my wealth and position , with two human servants , walk ? - Well , I can borrow a horse , can 't I ? - Right away . You two walk and please be sure to maintain a respectable distance behind me . - Someone to see you , sir . - Who ? He didn 't give me his name but he said he 's a friend of yours from Kaymack . Please come in . Galen ! And Virdon and Burke . What are you doing here ? - Don 't you know they 're looking for you ? - Of course , but I had to see you . You are looking wonderful . - You probably need my help again . - No , not us . A friend of ours . A human . He was arrested for riding a horse . That one . Young Gregor . He 's a friend of yours ? Yes . There is absolutely nothing I can do . - But , Barlow , he saved my life . - Galen was stung by a scorpion . I 'd have died if Gregor hadn 't come to get that antidote . And he did it for one of your own . If you can get to Zaius and tell him ... You suggest I appeal to Zaius because he saved the life of an outlaw ? You don 't exactly have to put it that way . Of course not . Come on , now , Barlow , be reasonable . There was a time when I tried to be reasonable . Now I 'm less reasonable and more safe . I hate it here . I want to go home , back to Kaymack . There 's a chance that I can if I keep my record clean . Is a comfortable job more important than saving a boy 's life ? I have sympathy for humans when they behave and know their place , but that boy 's a fool . - He deserves punishment . - For saving Galen 's life ? It 's a wonder the horse didn 't throw the boy . These laws protect humans as well . Only apes know how to handle horses . Barlow , I grew up on horses . I 've been riding since I was 7 . No , no , no , no . Humans can 't ride like apes . Alan 's about as good a rider as anybody in this whole world . Is he telling the truth ? My friends don 't lie . Would you ... ? Would you be willing to prove that your skill is not only talk ? What about Gregor ? Let me see how you ride first . Then we 'll talk about Gregor . All right . Never been ridden , right ? Even without a rider , he runs like the wind , but he 's a killer . No ape has been able to ride him . Forget it . So you 're not the great rider you say you are . Now you give me one good reason why I should risk my neck on a wild horse . If you can ride him I 'd be very helpful to you . - All right , I 'll do it . - Good . Saddle him up , Martin . Come on . Come on . Come on . - Look at him . - I told you he could ride . Come on , come on . There . You 're not as tough as you thought you were . What a beautiful animal . Good riding for a human . - Thank you . - I never saw a horse go so fast . Maybe that 's because you 've never seen a human jockey before . I have a proposition to make to you . I 've been challenged to race my best horse against the fastest horse in the territory . I want you to ride Woda . Virdon can 't ride in a race . He 'd be seen . I have a certain influence with Zaius . I can get him to make an exception . Well , what do you say ? Why should I say anything ? I 'm not interested in racing . You ride Woda , and I 'll get Zaius to pardon your friend Gregor . That is , if you win . - Okay , you got it . - Wait . What if he loses ? Well , Gregor dies , of course . But if you don 't ride , he 's certain to be shot . - Excuse me , do you know who Urko is ? - Yes , sir . I just saw him . Does he come to town often ? No , sir , only for something important like the big race . I won 't interfere with your departure in any way . I knew I couldn 't trust Barlow . Come in . Barlow what is this I hear ? Are you seriously going to use a human as a jockey in the race ? I have received permission from Zaius . You 're a bigger fool than I thought . All Zaius has done is to make certain that your horse will lose to mine . We shall see . Who is this human who 's foolish enough to ride against one of my apes ? What does it matter ? He 's just a human . Well , has he ever ridden a horse before ? Yes , he 's quite good . I trained him myself . Well , in that case you won 't mind if we raise the stakes just a little bit . How much ? Well , instead of half your horses , all of them . If you lose . And all your lands . And if I win ? - What do you want ? - Transfer me back to Kaymack . If that 's what you want . I 'm determined to win this race . Everything I have depends on it . You 're gonna win . When Urko sees Alan on your horse , he 's gonna kill him , and us too . I don 't understand you . Don 't you feel guilty about tricking us ? - Absolutely . - Well , that 's a big help . Well , what was I to do ? I was forced into this race , and my entire future depends on it . And , besides , I wasn 't sure that Urko was coming . And I used to boast about honor among apes . Speaking of honor , I don 't like to spread gossip but I 've heard talk that Urko 's horse doesn 't always win by fair means . Is this designed to cheer us up ? I 'm only trying to be a big help to us both . Come on , Galen . Hey , but where ? Well , if Urko has all this going for him maybe we should jiggle a few odds , get things in our favor . Make it deep and muddy . I wish I could help you , but we 've got to keep up appearances . - Yeah , right . - No , I mean if someone saw me doing something like that , they 'd say : " Why are you doing such a thing ? Such work is for humans . " Otherwise I would be right in there giving you a hand . Hey , will you cut it out ? You love it . Anyway , I 'm doing what you asked me to do , even if I don 't understand it . Do you think this will help Virdon ? You 're getting warm , buddy . Getting warm . Warm ? I 'm not the least bit warm . Sometimes I do not understand you . First of all , you have me carve a spool with notches in it , and now ... What are you complaining about ? I 'm doing all the work . You 're terrible . Martin , you gotta make it thinner . A racehorse has got to have thin , lightweight shoes on his hoofs . Urko 's racehorses use the same shoes as any other horse . That 's the point . That 's where we have an advantage . And in a horserace , every little bit helps . If it 'll help save my son , I 'll make them feather-light . Twist them , but leave the way open at the side . Kagen will be told to ride my horse to where he will be clear of the vine . The human will be stupid enough to jump across the middle . I want to be sure he falls . More vines here . Make it thicker . More vines here . There you go , Martin . With those shoes , the only thing that gorilla 's gonna see is Woda 's tail . I still don 't see how you hope to beat Urko . His horses never lose . Come on , Martin . Nobody 's got this race sewn up . Even if you do win what 's to keep Urko from killing you just for daring to ride a horse ? I 'm not gonna ride up to Urko and see if he shoots me . We 've got a couple of tricks up our sleeve . I know you 're doing this for Gregor and I thank you . But if you trick Urko , Gregor will surely pay . If everything goes all right , we 'll bail out Gregor and I 'll be in the clear . I 've gotta take Urko 's horse to him . I 'm gonna ask him to let me take Gregor 's place . I don 't care what happens to me . This way , you won 't have to ride , you 'll be out of danger and so will Gregor . Urko doesn 't make that kind of deal . Now , look , Gregor 's only chance is for me to win that race . I think I 've got a pretty good shot at it . Come on . Beat that , if you can . I 'm a little out of practice . What about the tree ? We have something special planned . - What ? - A net . Better work . Zilo , you know you 're to be in place 50 yards before the end of the race . If the human is winning when he passes you , shoot him . Of course . The human will surely lose the race . Shouldn 't I shoot him anyway , just for riding ? Zaius has given his permission , this one time . It isn 't important enough to kill the human just because he loses the race . We still have the other young human to serve as an example . Urko . The blacksmith . What do you want ? Excuse me , I 'm Martin . I 'm the one who shod your horse . What do you want ? I can be of help to you . I also shod the horse Barlow will race against you . I know how to make sure you 'll win . Is there any doubt about my winning the race ? Yes . Barlow 's horse Woda is very fast . But I know how to fix his shoes with wedges that 'll cause great pain and slow him down . I know where to put them , and it wouldn 't be found out until too late . Why do you want to help me against Barlow , who pampers all the humans ? It 's for my son , Gregor . He 's the one that 's been sentenced to die . Please , he 's very young . He didn 't know . He just didn 't think . Let him go and I promise you he 'll never ride a horse again . I 'll help you win . Gregor will be safe , and there 'll be no need to worry about the other man who 's riding Barlow 's horse . Say nothing about this to anyone . If my horse wins the race I 'll set your son free . Thank you . Thank you . Zilo ! Release the human from the cage . At the start ? What ... ? What if the blacksmith is lying ? What is done to a human who tries to run away and escape ? In the meantime , if the human is winning kill him before he reaches the finish line . If the human is losing kill him after he reaches the finish line . Just a matter of when . Look at that horse . A magnificent horse . I love racing ! Well , Barlow , we 've finally arrived at the moment of truth . Not quite . The moment of truth comes at the finish line . Well , we 'll see . It 's quite a show you 're putting on here today . We always try to please . Zandar , is everything prepared ? Everything will be to your total satisfaction , Urko . Good . Barlow , this may come as a surprise to you but I dislike losing so much , I 've always made it a habit of winning . I always thought the enjoyment of a race depended on being unsure of the outcome . Don 't worry about my enjoyment of a race . I intend to have a marvelous time . Here are the horses . Well , I see your horse , but where 's your wonderful human jockey ? He 'll ... I 'm certain he 'll be here . There 's time . The race won 't begin for a while yet . It 's all right if he doesn 't turn up . I don 't mind winning by default . I don 't like how the horse is acting . I don 't like anything about this whole race . Well , Alan , now is as probably a good a time as any . Be careful . You better take off first , Galen . There 's something the matter with that horse . Maybe he 's nervous being near the crowd . Well , we 'll soon find out . See you after the race , Pete . Yeah , hey be careful . - You too . - Yeah . He 's a wonderful jockey , your human . Except he can 't sit on a horse . Hey , that 's great . You look awful . Urko would never recognize you . - What 's the matter with him ? - There 's nothing wrong with him . He 'll be fine . Good luck . Here , so that 's it . Pete , look at this . Give me your knife . What 's holding up the race ? Races never start on time . Well , this one does ! That 's it . Get that one . Start the race . Get ready for the start . Let 's get the other one too . I said , start the race now . Bring your horses to the starting line . Three times through the village and around the course . Good start . You put those wedges in the horse 's shoes . Why ? You didn 't take them out ? Yes , of course I did . I promised Urko I 'd make Virdon lose if Gregor was spared . Alan 's riding this race to save your son . He can 't . Urko has a gorilla there to kill him if he wins . Two more to go . There he goes . There he goes ! Well , Barlow , it 's all over . Too bad , Barlow . I 'm going to win . I 'm going to win . I think it 's time we made our move . Careful . Don 't move . I won ! I won ! I won ! That 's Virdon ! Kill him . Kill him ! Kill him ! Kill him ! That 's Virdon . Kill him ! Kill him ! That was Virdon , your jockey ! Your human jockey was Virdon , the fugitive ! Is that a fact ? Well , that has nothing to do with our bet . Get the horses . Follow them ! Follow them ! Did Barlow 's horse win the race ? Yes , now you can run . Why should I run if I 'm supposed to be free ? You run because I tell you to run . No , something 's wrong . Move out of there , or I 'll shoot you right where you are . Pete ! This way . Have you seen the fugitive ? Yes , with you , when he won the race . Barlow , if I thought you knew anything about this beforehand ... How could I dream that a fugitive would dare to ride a horse under Urko 's very nose ? I don 't trust you , Barlow . Urko , I 'm an honorable ape . I don 't lie . I don 't break promises . And I always pay my debts when I lose . The payment has been arranged . Yes , I know . I 'm on my way back to Kaymack . I heard what you said to Urko . You " don 't lie . " Perhaps not , but you certainly know how to tie the truth into a knot . I also said I don 't break promises . Where are they ? You two may come and live with me in Kaymack . There you 'll be safe . But you are not to ride on horses . Yes , prefect . When I 'm watching . Thank you , prefect . Thank you . Bye . Friend . Friend . Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH ]

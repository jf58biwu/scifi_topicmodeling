 You know , before I met you two , I lived in a comfortable house . I ate excellent food every day . I was living the good life , and now look at me . You 're very hard to please . You don 't like being on the run with a fair chance of being killed by Urko ? Well , I would like a couple of minutes to think that over before I answer . What about all the excitement and stimulation we provide ? And all the fun things you 've learned ? I have learned that life is made up of a series of hills that I get to climb up so that I can climb down . I know exactly the way to find out what 's on the other side of that hill . It 's marvelous the way you figure these things out , you know . There you go . Can 't be . I 've forgotten what a city looks like . This is downtown nowhere . Hello , there . What do you call this city ? Hey , look , we 're friends . We just wanna talk to you . Are there any apes here ? Well , there goes the welcoming committee ... Hold it ! Listen . Okay to get my heart started again ? - We 'd better find a place to hole up . - Another day , another hole . What about this place ? Wonder what it was . - Must be important , by the looks of it . - So was the Colosseum . What 's a colosseum ? It was an arena where humans were forced to fight animals . The animals usually won . " Oakland Science Institute . " - That was a government think tank . - This , Oakland ? Well , it was . Come on , let 's take a look . It 's interesting decor . Done in early-American disaster . This looks like it could be something interesting . Let 's take a look . Vacuum sealed . But what is that ? Beats me . Did you ever see anything like that , Pete ? Someone sure wanted it to last for a long time . Wanna push some buttons ? I don 't understand . In the years to come , whoever finds our institute we , the scientists , greet you . The destruction of our world , as we know it is imminent . But our civilization ' s great advances must not vanish . We have , therefore , deposited the sum of all our scientific knowledge in a number of vaults , which are located in various cities throughout the world and which we hope will be found by future generations . In this city , the vault is embedded in concrete on the lower level ... Power . Could be . This baby 's been around for a long , long time . Is it magic ? No , Galen . It 's technology , but it 's way ahead of our time . - Here . Try this . - Yeah , good . What do you think ? There 's probably zinc in the power unit . We should be able to find some copper plumbing pipe . Then all we need is a container and sulfuric acid to rig up a battery and get this thing going again . Does it matter ? It could give us all the answers that we 've been looking for . Let 's go get that copper . - Insulation . This should do it . - Do what ? We burn this , collect the fumes , we 've got sulfur dioxide . Blend it at the right temperature with water and oxygen , you get sulfuric acid . Then we melt the copper we 've found form a base conductor , and we 've got a battery . Maybe . Soldiers . Those two . They 're not like the other humans in this city . Too well-fed . And an ape . When I give the signal , we separate and run for it . Meet back at the institute . Anybody not there within 24 hours , we figure they 've had it . Just get that projector rolling and find the film . Top priority . It 's more important than any one of us . Okay , now , take off ! - No ! No ! - Don 't be afraid . I won 't hurt you . - You have to go . - I can 't . No ! Captain . I can tell you something you 'd like to know . - Yes ? - It 's worth a lot . - How much ? - Two day 's food . One day ? Talk . Come on ! Take them ! Sit and wait . Sit and wait . No , no , no . There 's gotta be something more we can do . When you joined us , you got stuck obeying orders from the commanding officer , Colonel Virdon . - I do not take orders . - Then what are you doing here ? I accept suggestions . Okay . Alan suggested we sit tight and wait for 24 hours . It 's liable to be a long , cold night . Well , Virdon . It 's good to see you again . You should be flattered . We rushed here the minute we heard you were captured . Now let 's not waste time . Where is the renegade ape and your friend Burke ? Well , help him up . - Where are they ? - I don 't know . Where are they ? Where are they ? Like a needle in a haystack . It 's an old expression . Hey , wait a minute . Wait a minute ! I 'm trying to find somebody . In a haystack . Why don 't you eat ? I was starving . Are you planning to beat the prisoner again ? If necessary . You 'll kill him . If necessary . That 's too bad . You mourn for a human ? No . I mourn for Urko and the strong influence you were becoming in the High Council . I 'm not worried . My influence will continue to grow . By killing humans ? We 're not concerned merely with the death of this prisoner . We must make certain his dangerous ideas do not infect domesticated humans . To this end , I believe that we ... I will make certain . Ideas die with the man . Eliminating him is useless if his companions are free to spread the poison . Urko , your prisoner , alive is the surest method of capturing the other two . I see . The wise Zaius has his own plans for getting information from the prisoner . I have been thinking about it . Stop fighting . You 're in luck . You 're gonna earn more food than you 've ever seen . What do I have to do ? Just ask somebody the right questions and tell us the answers . Is that all ? She was Tomar 's woman . He was a rebel . When you capture a rebel it 's probably better to kill his whole family . Those around him are usually infected . Please , I didn 't mean ... Quiet ! It 's just as well you didn 't kill her . She will serve a better purpose . What are you gonna do with me ? Come along . - Are you all right ? - Yes . You sure ? I 'm glad of that . Who are you ? What 's going on ? Why 'd they put us in here ? Where 's Virdon ? A man . He was captured yesterday . Yes . He was brought in . To that building ? Which room ? Which floor ? He 's not there . The truth . He was taken away this morning . I don 't know where . You 're lying . There 's no one else here but us . You 've no idea what it 's all about ? What about you , son ? Do you know why they put you in here ? I was caught stealing food . A human can be killed for stealing food . Urko doesn 't need an excuse to kill me . I wonder why he didn 't do it . What is this place ? This was kind of famous in my time . It was built with oil money by someone who wanted to live like a 16th century baron . I don 't understand . What do you mean , in your time ? Where are you going ? When Urko has a chance to kill me and doesn 't do it I want to find out why . They could have killed you . Yeah , they could have . But they didn 't . Deliberately . It was an easy shot . No , they want me in here , alive . And why was that gorilla hiding in the ... ? Of course . It 's got to be . It 's a trap . They 're using me as the bait . - Trap ? - Yeah , for my friends . But it won 't work . Urko 's traps aren 't going to catch anybody . Why ? I heard shots . Are you all right ? Yeah , yeah . I 'm okay . He tried to escape . Yeah , but I 'm not gonna try that for a while . I think ... I think I 'll wait about 24 hours then we 'll all find a way out . It 's been such a very long time . I think Alan is not coming back . Galen , I 'm making a battery . Batteries ? I don 't care about batteries or all of that knowledge you fellows keep talking about . I just care what happens to Alan . I know . You got company . I wonder how they do this . I wonder how they do this . This thing that Virdon carried with him . I wonder how it was made . Why do you waste your time on that stupid picture ? - He tried to escape . - But he didn 't succeed . This will be the key to our problem . You 'll see . I 'm sorry I let you talk me into it . I 've studied the humans . They 're extremely vulnerable in family situations . It 's only a matter of time until he 'll come to think of that woman and the boy as his own family . He 'll lower his defenses with them . Then he 'll tell that boy things all your torture could never drag out of him . My name is Virdon . Alan Virdon . I 'm Kraik . Kraik . That 's a good name , Kraik . Pleased to meet you . You see , in my time , when two men met and wanted to be friends that 's what they did , they shook hands . - Why ? - Well , I 'm not really sure . Customs have a way of starting a long time ago and hanging on even when the reasons are forgotten . But ... I think maybe it started a long , long time ago . When two new friends met they 'd grab hands so they couldn 't strike each other with their weapons . That 's a very good idea if the friend hasn 't got a knife in his other hand . You really hit all the bases , don 't you ? - I don 't know what that means . - Yeah , it doesn 't matter . Do you have any parents , Kraik ? I wonder why they put you in here with me . You 're no threat to Urko . I don 't know , but I 'm glad I 'm with you . How much longer ? I have to make sulfuric acid to find out if it 'll start that projector . Then what ? Then we find out where that hidden vault is and we go there . What then ? Then we stash all that knowledge someplace safe . And after that ? And then we come back here and we find Virdon . That 's what I wanted to hear . - Look . Look what I 've found . - What ? No . No , Kraik . No , no . Hey , now . Now look . Now take it easy , now . Come on . That 's not gonna solve anything . If you eat all the food now , what about tomorrow ? I 'm hungry now . I don 't care about tomorrow . But you will tomorrow . Now , what do you say we let Arn divide up the food equally so there 'll be enough for today and for tomorrow ? We start at daylight . I want all the soldiers you can spare . - Yes , sir . - That 's all . Planning a war party ? A search party , Zaius . A search party for the chimpanzee Galen and Burke . You do it your way , I 'll do it mine . Section by section , building by building . It 's very good , Arn . I 'm glad you like it . I want more . Something doesn 't taste good ? Oh , no . No . No . I was just thinking about my friends . These friends of yours , where are they ? - You 're better-off if I don 't tell you . - I 'd like to know . If the gorillas thought that you knew they 'd tear you apart to get the information . I don 't care . Can 't you just tell me ... ? Kraik , he 's trying to protect us . Can 't you see that ? He 's protecting us . You are a very good man , Alan . Like Tomar was . And you 're a good woman , Arn . Like ... You 're a good woman . Don 't touch that . Sulfuric acid . Burn a hole in your hand . Are you ready to put it together with the copper and see if it 'll work ? In the morning , huh ? I 'm bushed . You are delaying . It 's been over 24 hours . Maybe he 'll be here in the morning . What are you making ? An airplane . It 's a flying machine . - Flying machine ? - Sure . - Will it really fly ? - Maybe . - Can I have one ? - Maybe . Did you ever fly , really ? Sure . Many times . There was a time when people used to fly everywhere . And did they always have enough to eat ? No , not always . Not everybody . Like here , now . Well , actually , people in that time didn 't have it as tough as you do now . I don 't eat bad . If anybody can find food , it 's me . I know this city like nobody else does . If I hear somebody 's got fruit or maybe sometimes meat I sneak in the back way or come up through a sewer or crawl in a hidden window . I grab and run before anybody 's even looking . Yeah . Well , if we can get our hands on what 's buried in this city you nor anyone else will have to scratch or steal for food . Is food buried ? No , but a lot of long-forgotten ideas that could help make this a nicer world . A million things you never even dreamed of . Could I have my own flying machine ? Maybe . He respects you , I think . My son would be about his age . I 'm sure he 's never trusted anyone before . Go ! It works . It works . We haven 't much time . Gorillas are going in every building . - They 're moving in this direction . - The battery 's ready to be hooked up . There we go . There . Now , all we have to do is whomp up a strap to hold it to your side and you 've got something to carry your things in . What things ? Yeah , that 's right . You don 't have a baseball or bubble gum or even a crumbled-up chocolate cookie . You see , where I came from boys loved to have pockets like that pouch . So you could carry your things in it . This place you come from will you go back ? - I hope so . Someday . - I think I 'd like to see it . I think I 'd like to see you start pulling your weight around here . What ? That means do your share of the work . How about going down below and collecting us some firewood ? In a little while . That story you told Kraik about what the world could be like was it true ? It was a hope . Only a hope . But it 's not impossible . See , my friends and I found a place here with a message and it told about a hope for the world , for humans . In the form of human knowledge . How do you find this knowledge ? You know that building near the one where you lived ? The one with the big columns in the front and the arched entranceway . I 've been there . There 's nothing inside . No food , no clothes , nothing . Wrong . There 's a machine in there , Kraik and by now it might have told my friends where to find that knowledge . A machine that talks . You 're making fun of me . Oh , yeah ? If you don 't get to work right away , I 'll really make fun of you . - I wanna hear more stories . - Later . Do your job first . - But ... - Right now . I like to hear stories about your world too . Compared to where you were living I 'm sure that almost any place must sound wonderful . When I first met Tomar , he lived on a farm with his brother . It was beautiful . Couldn 't you go back to the farm ? I 've thought about it . But it 's easier to do nothing . When you 're alone maybe it 's better not to go where you 're always reminded that once you were ... You weren 't alone . You couldn 't meet another man ? Yes . I didn 't think so but I do now . I 'll be right back . Kraik ? - Why did you take it ? - I didn 't take anything . All right . We 're gonna lay down a few ground rules on how to behave . You and me and Arn . And the first thing is , we trust each other . Okay ? Maybe . And we don 't lie . And we don 't take things without permission . I 'm tired . I want to sleep . - Let me have the model , please . - I won 't . Now , you 're not to take anything unless you have permission . Kraik ... All right , let me have the airplane . There 's your stupid airplane ! I don 't want it ! I hate you ! I hate you ! He wants to see you . He says you promised him a reward . Well . Tell me . Don 't waste my time . Do you know where the outlaw ape and the human are ? He was very upset . Kraik . He made the airplane just for you . I told the gorilla . You , see that no one gets out the back . You go with him . Post two guards on each side of the door . Hey , come on , Kraik . No , I don 't hate you . I 'm sorry . What will happen to your friends ? They 've long since left that building . Would they take the talking machine with them ? No , but if my friends were able to get it to work it could tell me where they are . But it doesn 't matter . You can 't go to them . But the apes might find that message . I 've got to get out of here . I know a way out . Why didn 't you tell me that ? I liked it here . I had enough to eat , and the gorillas said they 'd give me more if I helped . All right , Kraik . I can 't promise you any food , but I could use your help . - Did you get it ? - Get what ? The gun . What are you talking about ? I told the sergeant , Virdon had a gun . I threw it out the window . - Where ? - I 'll show you . It 's here somewhere . Arn . All right . This way . Wasn 't there anything at all in this place ? Nothing . Not Galen , not Burke . - Are you sure ? - Of course I 'm sure . They were gone . If they 'd ever been there . Just in the event Virdon should escape they would leave something behind something that would tell him where to go . Take me there . Where are they ? We 'll find out . They 've built it back up . Give me a hand . In the years to come , whoever finds our institute we , the scientists , greet you . The destruction of our world , as we know it is imminent . But our civilization ' s great advances must ... You said there was nothing here ? Yes , but there ... That wasn 't here before . What is it ? One of these must be a control . We have , therefore , deposited the sum of all our scientific knowledge in a number of vaults , which are located ... - What is it ? - Witchcraft ! - Quiet ! - It 's evil ! - Quiet ! - ... throughout the world . In this city , the vault is embedded in concrete on the lower level of the midtown railway station at the gateway to track number four . We wish you well . You who find and use our knowledge . - What is a railway station ? - I 've seen pictures of them . We passed such a place when we rode in . A long , narrow building . Come . I know the place , and I know a quicker way to get there . The apes will have to ride through the cities . Through places where buildings have fallen and no horses can pass . Could man ever have known so much and done so little with it ? Come on , let 's go . Alan ! Alan , where have you been ? - Galen ! - We thought you were dead . Listen , we spent two hours breaking into this place . It 's a gold mine . Yes , it is . It 'll be a mausoleum if we don 't get out . Urko and Zaius are on their way here right now . We gotta move . Come on . Knowledge . Death . Destruction . In the history of this world , one has been the same as the other . Destroy everything in here . Burn this place to the ground . Wait ! Wait ! What is here would give us great power . The knowledge would be safe with us . We 're not like humans . Would we really be better-off ? Or safer ? Remember , once the knowledge in here is set free it will spread out of control . - I will be in control . - You are now . You have weapons , troops . Suppose one of your officers learns the secrets in there . He 'll have the power to destroy you , to destroy the world . Would you risk that ? Burn it . Burn it ! Virdon is no longer of any use to us . I 'll go back to the castle and kill him . Is that the farm ? Tomar 's brother , what 's his name ? Durlin . It 's so quiet . Peaceful . You ... You do feel all right about coming back here ? It 's different now . I can 't explain . Maybe because Kraik 's with me . Maybe because I 'm not so alone inside myself anymore . Why don 't you stay with us ? - He can 't . - Why ? You 're gonna like it here , Kraik . You 'll get plenty to eat . Every day ? If you behave yourself . Alan ! There are two times when you shake hands : When strangers meet and when friends say goodbye . God bless you both . Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH ]

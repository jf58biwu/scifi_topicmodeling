Would have had pneumonia if we hadn 't jumped the place . They took us up to Burlington to check us out . Last I heard , Joe was somewheres on the Alagash . You try that sometime , pal . You try that sometime in february in 1934 , Then see if this is so bad . There are plenty of worse places . Plenty of worse places . He was at the top of his class in optometry when this happened . I don 't doubt it , mrs . Pilgrim . The doctor says it 's nervous exhaustion . Oh , I 'm sure that 's all it is . I think it 's the war . That certainly could have a lot to do with it . But he had some awful experiences . He was in Dresden when it was bombed . His closest friend was killed there . Oh , dreadful . Dreadful . And his father passed on while Billy was in training . But I knew God would send Billy home safe to me . I prayed every night , mr . Rosewater . Even though we don 't belong to a church . We 're all in God 's hands , dear . Billy ! Billy , mama 's here . You can come out now . He 's engaged to a very rich girl . Her name 's Valencia . Valencia merble . Her father 's Lionel Merble . He owns the ilium school of optometry where Billy was going . He 's building a brand-New home for them on the lake for a wedding present . It 's a surprise . Billy . Billy , sweetheart . The war is over . You can come out now . Pilgrim ! You killed me , Pilgrim . You son of a bitch . You call my mom and dad in Pittsburgh , see . You tell them I died and that you killed me ! Weary . This is Paul Lazzaro , Weary . I 'll get revenge for you . Lazzaro . Yeah . Did I ever tell you what happened to the dog ? It 's hot . Son-Of-A-Bitch dog bit me . So I got some steak , And I got this spring out of a clock , and I cut that spring up into little pieces . I stuck it into the steak . Way inside . I went to where they had that dog tied up . I said , " Hey , boy . I 'm not mad . Come on . Let 's be friends . " And I threw him the steak , and I waited around for around ten minutes . And he started cryin ' , and the blood spilled out of his mouth . He tried to chew out his own insides , and I said , " Hey , boy . That 's me inside there with those knives . " Anybody ask you the sweetest thing in the world , It 's revenge . Weary 's dead , Pilgrim . The patient has been suffering from trauma ... Which can be treated by electric shock . Hello , Billy . Hello . We 've prescribed a series of 12 , and we 're up to number seven . The patient was a prisoner of war in Dresden when it was bombed . He claims that well over 100,000 people were burned to death in the fire . Worse than Hiroshima . And since Billy was actually there , It 's natural to assume that this has had a contributing effect on his present condition . - He 's ready , doctor . - You 're going to sleep now , Billy . Aufstiegen . Was is los ? Arouse ! Arouse ! Schnell ! Name ? Paul Lazzaro . That 's two z 's . Parents ? I don 't got no family . I said two z 's . To whom we send the number in case of death ?

That 's the way to do it , Pilgrim . Best thing for him . By God , Pilgrim . You 're really gonna do it . You bet your boots I 'm gonna do it . His mama 's not gonna keep him all of his life . My old man did the same to me . Done me a world of good . Oh , you betcha ! It 's the only way ! Well , this is it , Billy boy . It 's sink or swim ! And don 't - Billy ? Billy ! Who are they ?

To share our food ? And cheer ? Evening . Come along inside . We 've organized a little welcome . We had a couple of days notice of your arrival . That gave us an opportunity to prepare . Hear you had a pretty beastly time in Bondem . Jerry put on quite a show . It can 't last forever , can it ? - Where 'd you get all this ? - Red cross . Clerical error . They 've been sending us 500 parcels a month instead of 50 . Three years now . We 've got rather a lot , actually . Shouldn 't you tell ' em ? Shouldn 't you give it back ? Oh , yank . You haven 't been in the fight very long , have you ? Come along . I keep forgetting wars have always been fought by children . Where did you get this absurd garment ? They gave it to me . Who ? The Germans . They didn 't give you a coat , yank , they gave you an insult . Hey , son . Over here . Do you understand what I 'm saying ? Jerry tried to humiliate you . Now you must wear that coat as if you were proud of it . Teach him a lesson . It 's terribly important that you understand that . It 's been almost four years since I was taken prisoner . True , most of us here . We haven 't seen a woman or a child in all of that time . Think about that for a minute . Want to know how we survived ? Well , I 'll tell you . The day that I was captured , I made a promise to myself : Each day I would brush my teeth , shave my beard , Wash my hands and face before each meal , evacuate my bowels with regularity . And do you know why ? Because the war consists of continual petty humiliations . And I for one was going to treat myself with a good deal of self-Respect and survive . Do you think you can do it ? # Johnny Fedora met alice blue Bonnet ? # In the window of a department store ? Get it ! # It was love at first sight ? Come on !

But then I 'm lucky , I guess . Margaret 's a very understanding woman . We were childhood sweethearts . - Hey , that 's nice . - You got a girl back home ? No one special . Margaret 's the only woman I 've ever known . There 's Margaret . Aw , she looks awful nice . She 's just about everything a man could ask for . Oh , oh . What 's this ?

When did you enlist ? - It wasn 't quite like that . I was drafted . - Oh ? It 's not that I didn 't want to go , I just wanted to finish school first . - Where were you in school ? - First year of the ilium school of optometry . An optometrist . That 's a very good field . Yes , ' cause you 're doing things for people , and there 'll always be a need for optometrists . Boy , what you just said ... Is a very good philosophical way of life . - What ? - I mean about filling a need and helping people . Why , that 's self-Determination and free enterprise backing itself up all the way . That 's why we 're in europe stopping hitler . My name 's Edgar Derby , son . What 's yours ? - Billy Pilgrim . - Billy , it 's nice to have you aboard . - Thank you . - You had enough of that ?

They shot him for , uh - What was it , Billy ? Well , anyway , before that , They found this diamond right in the pocket of his coat . Lord knows how it got there , and lord knows why somebody didn 't find it before . It probably came from some poor old jew . So many of them have their money in diamonds . Jesus , dad ! I 'm on the john . My , God , Robert . There 's a party downstairs . Why don 't you lock the door ? 'Cause mom broke the lock the last time I locked it . - Can 't I have any privacy ? - What have you got there ? Where ? There . Shouldn 't be reading that kind of junk , Robert . Jesus ! Lads . Lads . Hey , Billy ! - Billy . Over here . Can I have your attention ? Please , please , please . You 're being transferred to a camp in Dresden . You 're going to be leaving for there this afternoon . Actually , I 'm quite envious of you . Dresden is a beautiful city . Paid a visit there myself before the war . Besides being quite lovely , it 's quite safe . It 's an open city without war industries or troop concentrations . It 's by far the safest place to be until we get this all over with . Now then , you must elect a leader . He 's going to be in charge of all this group . You 'll all be under his direct orders , And he will be your line of communication with the Germans . Nominations are now open . You need a leader . I nominate Paul Lazzaro . Lazzaro . Right . Anyone else ? Well , then ... I nominate Edgar Derby . Anyone else ? You 'll be responsible , to this man you elect , And he 'll be responsible to the Germans . So if you mess him up , he 's the one they 're gonna be after . Oh , yeah ? Hey , pop , you want it so bad ; you got it . I un-Nominate Lazzaro . I don 't think it will come as a surprise to anyone ... When I introduce our lion 's club president for the coming year .

Is to see that each of you gets through this safely ... And are reunited with your loved ones . I 'd like to ask you - I know we 're all of different faiths , But we 're all Americans - Oh , God . To bow our heads together and pray . Oh , go take a flying fuck ! If that isn 't the most obscene vulgar - Oh ! Is my bath ready , silvio ? Yes , ma 'am . My robe , silvio .

See how you like this one . " Dear Meg , " We 're on our way to Dresden where we 'll have to do some work for the Germans . " It won 't be war work because the geneva convention prohibits that , " And besides , there isn 't any war production in Dresden . " Dresden is the town where our little dancing figure came from . Remember the one that johnny knocked off the table and broke ? " " Dresden 's never been bombed because it isn 't a military target , " So we 'll be safe there . " Please write to johnny and give him all my love , " And tell him I know we 'll all be back together again soon . Tell him how proud I am of him . " - Where is he ? - Your boy 's in the car , mr . Pilgrim . He 's the only one we actually caught . They knocked over 14 gravestones , all told . Why he 'd do such a thing ? Has he ever said anything about catholics ? - I mean , has he anything against them ? - We 've got catholic friends . What will the mcnalley 's think ? What are we going to say to the mcnalley 's ? Mr. Pilgrim , if I could see you up here . My , God ! Why did he do it ? I don 't want to take the boy down to the station . It might be embarrassing to you . - Maybe we could handle it in some other way . - Thank you , officer . If you can get the damages from the church , I 'd pay for that . I 'll see what I can do . And I 'd like to show my appreciation by giving you this for the policeman 's fund . You don 't have to do that , mr . Pilgrim , but it 's very generous of you . I 'll call you after we 've been able to determine the extent of the damages . What 's the matter , Billy ? You must be the greatest father in the world . I love my son , Billy . Guess that 's all it takes . Hey , you guys . We 're there . It 's beautiful . I never saw anything like it . It 's lovely . It 's the land of oz . Herr kommandant . Where 'skommandant ?

They have the audacity to put me in a room with a basket case . They just don 't have a private room , sweetheart . - Well , I don 't know - Goddamn it , lily ! I 'm gonna pepper your radcliffe ass with buckshot if I catch you smoking again ! You better stay in condition to keep up with b . C. Rumfoord . - You guys go on without me . I 'll be all right . Christ . All he does in his sleep ... Is quit and surrender and apologize . Shoot . I could carve a better man out of a banana . Did you bring me those books from widener ? The boys at theharvard crimson have a beautiful bit about you . - Oh ? They call you the red baron of military history ... And want you to get well soon . Those little bastards ! The truman statement about hiroshima is in here , And those eight army air force documents . Oh , yeah . And the irving book on Dresden . I was there . Honey , why did they keep Dresden a secret for so long ? Oh , hell . For fear a lot of bleeding hearts ... Would say bombing it was a chicken shit thing to do . My book 's gonna lay it on the line , sweetheart . Nobody 's gonna weep and wail over Dresden after they read my book . I was there . What 's he saying ? He said he was there . Says he was where ? Dresden . At dresden , b. c . ! The hell with him . Let him write his own book . Schlachthof-Funf . What the hell is he saying now ? Ich bin amerikanische soldat . Dresden . - Schlachthof-Funf . - You wanna know something ? We didn 't start the last war ; the nazis did . And 135,000 people dying in Dresden ... Does not seem so very much when put against over five million allies who had to die ! And you just might remember that when we were bombing Dresden , The Germans were sending v-1 and v-2 rockets into london , Killing men , women and children . Don 't get so uptight . Jesus ! Weeping over Dresden and not give a damn about our own losses ! Hey , what about coventry ? What about rotterdam ? What about the extermination camps the Germans were running ? Gassing , maimings ? I want your attention . Attention , please . You are having a visitor . Howard campbell , junior . I have just come back from the Russian front , so I 'll make it short . I know how hungry you are . Food 's not much though , is it ? Food 's terrific ! Almost as neat as your outfit ! Men , I have a proposition for you . How would you like to come back to America after this war as heroes ? Great , as long as I could wear that fag outfit ! Since you 're so interested in my outfit , I 'll tell you what it 's about . Blue is for the American sky . White is for the race that pioneered that continent , Cleared the forests , drained the swamps , built the roads and the bridges . And the red is for the blood of fine American boys ... That 's been shed in defense of your freedom . I don 't see you shedding any blood , campbell . You all know that communism is out to enslave the world . And who 's out there trying to stop them ? The Germans ! They 're not your enemies . They 're your allies ! Communism is the enemy of all of us ! I want volunteers for the free American corps . Men who are willing to stand up to these commies . - Sit down , Lazzaro ! I didn 't vote for you , derby . Good . Now , who 's next ? - If we don 't stop them - - Everybody to the air shelter . Move . Let 's go ! Get outta my way . There 'll be no bombs . Churchill 's nephew lives in Dresden . Don 't worry , soldier . Well , men , do I have only one volunteer ? Listen , pal . I only stood up back there to tell you that one day your doorbell 's gonna ring , And there 's gonna be this guy in a trench coat - We 'll eat German craw for so long , campbell , because we have to . But we 'd rather die than eat your dung , Which is sick and lousy and foul ! History will prove you an ass . Oh , shit . No bombs , eh , campbell ? You can 't trust the jews . Daddy , you should really stay with us . And you shouldn 't talk about mama ... Or the accident , or even the war . I just wanna go home . But we want you with us ! I 'll be fine . Just for one night ? No . Oh , daddy . Honestly ! Daddy , you should consider yourself lucky . Practically every optometrist in ilium was wiped out . Stanley 's been working night and day for you . Stinking old dog . Hello , spot . Yeah . Yeah . Daddy , honestly ! Won 't you please change your mind and come stay with us ? You 'll be in this empty house with that old dog . I 'll be all right . But , daddy , be realistic . You just turned middle-Aged . You 've got your whole life ahead of you . Good night , dear . Ja , schweine ! Verfluchen schweine ! Mama ! Mama ! Mama ! Mama ! - Dad ? Dad ? Papa ! Dad ? Robert ? Hiya , dad . Hi , spot . How did you get here ? Well , they - They gave me leave to visit mom . But you know - Sure , dad . I know . That 's why I 'm here . And to see you . How are you , dad ? I 'm fine . God , dad . To think that you lived . It 's a miracle . Like one time when a chopper got hit by charlie , Just outside our camp . It came down like , like a stone . But the door gunner walked away . Dad ? Dad , i-I did the right thing , joining up . I 'm sure you did , son . Aah , it 's a lousy war , but sooner or later it 's gonna be us or the communists . We 've gotta stand up to them somewhere . Dad ? Dad ? I know you and mom worried about me a lot . I guess I haven 't been the best of sons . - You 've been just fine , Robert . - No , I ... I know . I was pretty wild , And I want to make up for it . Remember that stuff in the cemetery ? Geez ! I 'm so ashamed of that now . Really , I am . But I 've changed a lot , dad . And I just hope I can make you real proud of me from now on . You already have , Robert . Dad , will you come to mom 's grave with me ? I 'm not ready yet . I know how you feel , dad . I 'm just not ready . Okay , dad . What 's happened ? Where am I ? Welcome to the planet Tralfamadore , mr . Pilgrim . Tralfam - Tralfama - Tralfamadore . Oh . How did I get here ? There is no " how , " mr . Pilgrim . There is no why . The moment simply is . I don 't understand . - Where are you ? - Oh , you can 't see us , mr . Pilgrim . We live in the fourth dimension . But we can see you , And there are many important tralfamadorians here to welcome you . Oh . Well , uh , how do you do ? We hope that you 'll find your accommodations here suitable . I have to stay here ? I 'm afraid so . You mean , I can 't leave of my own free will ? Mr. Pilgrim , we have visited 31 inhabited planets in the universe . We have studied reports on a hundred more , And only on earth is there any talk of free will . Well - What 'll I do ? You will aid in the removal of the bodies . Those that are identifiable ... Will be tagged . Their personal effects will be tagged and given to an officer . There will be a classification ... According to the degree ... That the victim can be identified . Any looting or stealing ... Will be dealt with by a firing squad . Follow me . It looked like the end of the world . What looked like the end of the world , mr . Pilgrim ? Dresden , after the bombing . Don 't be so egocentric . We know how the world ends , and it has nothing to do with earth , Except that it gets wiped out too . Really ? How does it end ? While we 're experimenting with new fuels , A tralfamadorian test pilot panics , presses the wrong button , And the whole universe disappears . But you have to stop him ! If you know this , can 't you keep the pilot from pressing - He has always pressed it , and he always will . We always let him , and we always will let him . The moment is structured that way . Mr. Pilgrim , a pleasant way to spend eternity ... Is to ignore the bad times and concentrate on the good . It 's - It 's all right ! It 's all right ! Will you be quiet , please ? Will you please be quiet ? Can 't you see you 're frightening her ? Who are you ? My name 's Pilgrim . What 's this scene ? - Where are we ? - We 're on a distant planet . Are you mating now ? What ? Have you mated ? Who are you ? I 'm a tralfamadorian , miss Wildhack . A what ? You 're on the planet Tralfamadore , miss Wildhack , 423 billion miles from earth . Oh , Jesus . Hey , hey . Hey . You 're okay ? Yes , thank you . - When were you born ? What month ? - What month ? What month ? July . - What day ? - The fourth . The fourth of july . You 're practical , straightforward , with a belief in others ... Based on your own integrity and almost compulsive honesty . You 're a moon child ! Oh , you 're a moon child . I 'm a what ? A moon child . That 's your sign . Were you born in the morning or the afternoon ? It doesn 't matter . I don 't have my charts . Miss Wildhack ? Would you like something to wear ? Oh , yes . Thank you very much . Um - I was , uh - I was down in palm springs at a home of a producer friend of mine , Sunning myself by the pool . That 's why I 'm like this . I don 't want halter marks . Naturally . And ... All of a sudden , it was like a - A ray - - This is all - I can offer . - Thank you . And - - I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to interrupt . Th-That 's all there is . And the next thing , I was - I was here . What 's it like up here ? I don 't know . We can 't leave the dome . The atmosphere of Tralfamadore is cyanide . It would be fatal to you if you left the dome . This is it ? I 'm ... afraid so . - How long will they keep us here ? - I don 't know . You are here , you have always been here , And you will always be here . Is he trying to blow my mind ? No , no , no . It all makes sense in a way . You see , in Tralfamadore - Would you please mate now ? Look . We 're not going to put on a show for you . That 's one thing . Another is I demand you get miss Wildhack some clothing . If she 's cold , we can always regulate the temperature . Now , you get down to earth and get miss Wildhack ... A complete wardrobe , and one that fits ! What 's your size ? I take a ten . But I have to take it in here and let it out a little here . So , they 'll have to bring a needle and thread . Did you hear that ? And remember , miss Wildhack is used to the best . Thanks ! Uh - - Billy . - Billy . Now we would like the night canopy . Why do you wish the night canopy ? Because we want it ! Will you mate ? We hardly know each other ! Do you mind if we take time to get better acquainted ? You are acting very unnaturally . We would like the night canopy . Oh , very well . Would you like to sit on the couch ? Where is it ? Here . Just take my hand . Ooh ! Ooh ! I 'm sorry . Um , that 's all right . Careful . Get away , spot . He 's not bothering me . I like dogs . Come here , spot . Come on . - It 's pretty comfortable , isn 't it ? - It 's fine . They got everything from sears and roebuck . I appreciate what you said to them about me . - Thank you , miss Wildhack . - Montana . - Montana . - You don 't meet many gentlemen ... In the entertainment business . I 'm an optometrist . Oh . Would you like to kiss me ? Yes . You kiss nicely . Thank you . Oh ! Did I hurt you ? Oh , no ! Oh ! Mr. Pilgrim ? Miss Wildhack ? Are you mating now ? Billy ! Billy , look at this ! Look at this ! Perfect . There 's not a chip on it . It 's exactly like the one we had at home . The one your son johnny broke ? Yeah ! How 'd you know about that ? The letter you wrote home . Of course . It 's a miracle , isn 't it ? This little dancer survived all this destruction . Wait 'll I bring it home . Can you imagine how Meg 's eyes will light up ? Arbeit ! She 'll love it . Diener ? Was haben sie da ? Oh , uh , look at this . I found this down there . There 's not a chip on it . It 's pretty , isn 't it ? We had one like it . Used to sit - Oh ! What 's the matter ? Feuer ! Stop ! Stop ! Billy . Billy ? Billy ? Where were you , honey ? Billy ? Do you like this ? - It 's nice . - It 's , uh , not too tight ? A little , maybe . I 'm so big here . I like it . That 's ' cause you 're a man . - I 'm gonna have to let it out . - I really think - Give me something to do . Oh . You like it too , spot . Huh ? He always growled at my wife . Do you miss her ? She died . Somebody smacked into the rear of her car ... And the exhaust fell off . She died of carbon monoxide poisoning . Oh . Like what they have out there ? No . That 's cyanide . That 's worse . Oh , wow . What did you love most about her ? Her pancakes . If we had a real stove , Billy , I 'd make you an out-Of-Sight macrobiotic souffle . I 'd like that . And then ... We could think about having your baby . Could we have the night canopy , please ? Oh , daddy ! There is no such planet as trilaflamaduke ! Dad , I think what Barbara and I would really like to know - Would you be willing to see a psychiatrist ? Listen , I have a friend who 's not only a doctor , But he 's interested in outer space . Why don 't the three of us have lunch together today ? I 'm not going to commit myself to an institution . - Dad , I wasn 't - If it weren 't for Tralfamadore , I might have needed an institution . I don 't need a doctor , Stanley . On Tralfamadore you learn that the world ... Is just a collection of moments all strung together in beautiful , random order . And if we 're going to survive , it 's up to us to concentrate on the good moments ... And ignore the bad . Besides , I 'm in love up there . You know , dad , I 'd really like to have lunch with you today . I 'll be very busy . Montana 's pregnant . What 's her name ? Montana Wildhack . That 's the hollywood starlet who disappeared , isn 't it ? Oh , my God . Dad ! Hey , w-Wait a minute , dad . Dad , listen . I - If you go back and forth in time , do you go into the future too ? - Mm-Hmm . Frequently . - Well - I mean , h-How far do you go ? Do you actually go - All the way to my death . I 've seen it many times . I died in philadelphia , where I was giving a speech on the subject of Tralfamadore . You see , in Tralfamadore , where I presently dwell , Life has no beginning , No middle and no end . For example , many years ago ... A certain man promised to have me killed . He 's an old man now , living not far from here . He 's read all of the publicity associated with my appearance . He 's insane , and tonight he 'll keep his promise . If you protest , If you think that death is a terrible thing , Then you have not understood what I have said . You see , it 's time for you to go home ... To your wives and children . It 's time for me to be dead for a little while ... And then live again . I give you the tralfamadorian greeting : " Hello . Farewell . " Hello . " Farewell . " Eternally connected , " Eternally embracing . " Hello . Farewell . " Nobody fucks around with Paul Lazzaro ! Do you hear me , Pilgrim ? Pilgrim ? Hey , Pilgrim ! You hear me ? Pilgrim , get your ass over here and give me a hand ! What are you gonna do with that ? I 'm gonna make a fortune ! Are you kidding ? Haven 't you got enough stuff ? What if we get caught ? We ain 't gonna get caught . The Krauts have all left . If we don 't steal it , the Russians will . Let 's get the fuck outta here ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! I surrender ! I surrender ! I surrender ! I don 't know . Billy ? Billy ? We just had a baby ! Billy . We 've just had a baby boy ! Look at him ! Isn 't he beautiful ? Ahh . Yes . Isn 't he incredibly beautiful ? He 's perfect . Every bit of him . What shall we call him ? Billy , of course . Anyway , even if he doesn 't look too much like you , he 's got your name . Hello . Are you hungry ? I think he 's hungry now . Mm-Hmm . You hungry ? Huh ? Here . There it is . Take it , take it . Ouch ! Oh . Ah .

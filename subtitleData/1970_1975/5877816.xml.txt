 ( Inaudible ) ( Woman choking ) ( Director ) All right , cut ! - So , John , what did you think ? - Great , Dad , great . Come on , let 's take a look around . - ( Director ) Be quiet ! - Sorry about that . ( John laughing ) ( John laughing ) ( Bell rings ) ( Switches on radio ) ( Switches radio off ) ( SID ) ' Unidentified flying objects , bearing zero-one-two-four-eight ... ' - Still maintaining course . - Termination ? Should be through any second . - The Interceptors ? - They didn 't make contact . - They what ? - They 're coming in too fast . Nearly home , John . How 'd you make out with that model boat ? - I finished it . - You finished it ? ( Phone buzzes ) Straker . All right , Alec . Thanks , um ... I 'll be in about six o 'clock . Right . - Do you want to see it ? - Hmm ? - The boat , Dad . - Oh , sure . You bet I do . Moonbase to SHADO Control . Speed SOL one-decimal-four . - SOL one-decimal-four ? That 's crazy ! - They 're changing course . A correction . One maintaining flight path . The second , new course zero-four-two ... one-eight-three ! I don 't get it . One 's veered off , the other 's coming in so fast it can 't possibly land . Wait for me , Dad . Hello , Mary . Hello , Ed . You 're late . Yes . We were having such a great time , I thought an extra half hour . ( Man ) Mary ! Could you make it a week later next month , say , the 18th ? The 18th . Yes , that 'll be fine . Listen , I 'd ... like to talk to you about John . Is he ... ? No , no , he 's fine . - We 're both fine . - ( Man ) Mary ! We 're all perfectly all right . Oh , uh ... Johnny wanted to show me something . I ... think you better go . I 'll explain to Johnny . Right . Goodbye , Ed . Dad ! Dad ! ( Horn ) Dad , Dad ! Dad ! ( Horn ) ( Squealing tyres ) Johnny ! Johnny ! I couldn 't do a thing , he just came running out . Johnny ! Ed ! Well , do something ! ( Siren ) ( Radio ) ' Green alert , St Mary 's Hospital . 'Patient suffering head injuries , over . ' ( Radio continues , indistinct ) ( Engine starts ) ( Siren ) ( Siren continues ) ( Tyres squealing ) ( Radio , indistinct ) PA : ' Dr Avery , please . Dr Avery , please . ' ( Phone ringing ) ( Phone continues ringing ) The doctor will see you soon . They came out of surgery ten minutes ago . ( Nurse ) He is as well as can be expected . Thank you . ( Ford ) Termination coming through . Ireland , west coast . - It 's still coming in too fast . - Range seven million . Confirm . One-decimal-four . Moonbase to SHADO Control . We still have UFO on positive track . Confirm speed SOL one-decimal-four . It must slow soon . 75,000 . - ( Woman ) Reducing speed . - Alert ground radar . Radar areas B-one-four-two and one-four-four , red alert . Sky One airborne . Proceeding to search area . ETA 21 minutes . Mrs Rutland ? I 'm Dr Segal . No , please don 't get up . How is he ? Well , the boy has a fractured right femur . He 's also got a compound fracture of the tibia and fibula . There 's serious internal haemorrhage . We 've given him a transfusion . - May we see him ? - Not just now , I 'm afraid . As you probably realise , your son has an allergy to antibiotics . - Yes , when he was a baby , he was ... - When he was three months old , he was critically ill from a Terramycin injection . - I 'm the boy 's father . - I see . Well , the problem is one of elimination . We have to find a suitable antibiotic . It takes time . There must be something . Well , there 's the new American anti-allergeretic drug . - Will it do the job ? - Well , it 's been tested . ( Segal ) Its supply is very limited . ( Straker ) But available . ( Segal ) In America . We need it urgently . Within the next few hours . ( Mr Rutland ) We 'll fly some over . I 'll charter a plane . ( Segal ) I 'm afraid there won 't be time . I 'll take care of it . What are you talking about ? How can you ? I said I 'll take care of it . He 's still my son . If you 'll let me have the details , Doctor . Yes , naturally . ( Beeper ) I ... I have to leave . You always had to leave . We 'll stay and see the boy through . Tell your contact to ask for Dr Ashley . Miss Ealand , contact our people in New York . I want a special courier to pick up a drug from the Westmoor Hospital . Take down these details . 4,800 miles from impact . Speed ? - 24,000 knots . - He 'll never make it . We have it on ground radar . ( Whirring engine passes ) ( Bird squawking ) Impact confirmed . - Do we have a grid reference ? - Yes . Area B-one-four-two-zero-eight . Just off the west coast of Ireland . - Tell Captain Carlin to overfly . - Yes , sir . Crazy coming in at that speed . - Could it have been damaged ? - I don 't see how . The Interceptors didn 't get near it . The aliens don 't usually make that kind of mistake . At least they 're fallible . - Miss Ealand . - Yes , sir . Has that drug been picked up yet ? Yes . They 're taking it to the airport . Fine , fine . I 'll arrange for the Transporter myself . Yes , sir . Straker . 'Voiceprint positive . Commander Straker . ' ( Lift machinery whirrs ) Keep in contact with Carlin . I doubt if he 'll tell us much . - Yes , sir . - What 's the situation ? Two UFOs . One veered off , the other one crashed . Western Ireland . Its entry speed was too high . Right . Sky One will look for wreckage , but I don 't suppose there 'll be much to see . Fine . - Is everything all right ? - Is it ever ? I was going to grab a bite to eat . Care to join me ? No , I 've got a few things to clear up here . You go ahead . All right . See you later . Tell the New York Transporter to stand by for immediate takeoff . ( Ford ) ' But it doesn 't leave for seven hours . ' - I said " immediate take-off " ! - ' Yes , sir . ' No calls , Miss Ealand . And would you get me zero-one-two-four-one-four , please ? ( Phone buzzes ) Intensive Care Unit , please . Hello , I 'm enquiring about a patient , a young boy . John Straker . Well , there must be . John Rutland ? Yes , he could be under that name . No change ? Thank you . Well , Mrs O 'Connor . There 's not a lot wrong with you . I could 've told you that myself , Doctor . I 'll bet you could . I 'll drop in next time I 'm passing . Won 't you stay for a cup of tea ? No thanks , it 's getting late and I have to go over to the Regan farm . - Say goodbye to the doctor , Billy . - ( Billy ) Don 't be daft . ( O 'Connor ) Oh , you 're a naughty boy . I 'll see you to the door , Doctor . I have to treat my gentlemen callers with great respect or else they won 't come back . Sky One to Skydiver Control , it crashed about 100 yards offshore . I 'm going around once more before the light fades . ( Billy squawking ) ( Rustling outside ) ( Bottle falls to pavement ) Did you hear that ? ( Squawks ) What was it , Billy ? I 'm sure I heard a noise . Didn 't you hear it , Billy ? Is anyone there ? I know someone 's there . ( Rustling ) Oh . You must excuse me . You see ... I 'm blind . ( Squawking ) What are you doing ? What are you looking for ? ( O 'Connor ) There 's nothing of value here . ( Squawking ) Please . Please don 't touch the bird . ( Door closes ) - Where 's that Transporter ? - ' Just taken off . ETA London 23 : 30 . ' Fine . I want a car and an escort at the airport to meet it . 'Yes , sir . ' Great steak . ( Freeman ) Medium rare , side order of salad . Sounds very appetising . Yeah , it was . It certainly was . Look , it 's pretty quiet here . There 's nothing you can do . Why don 't you go home ? What home ? Who are you ? ( Freeman ) What 's the position , Peter ? ( Peter ) ' Sky One has re-docked . 'Skydiver proceeding to crash area . ETA 15 minutes . ' Fine . Contact us the moment you have anything . 'Roger , Control . ' I still can 't figure out why it came in so fast . To avoid the Moonbase Interceptors . It 's possible . The moment it passed Moonbase it had plenty of time to decelerate . - That the Transporter ? - ( Ford ) Yes , sir . 23 : 30 hours confirmed as ETA . Have my car outside in 30 minutes . - I 'm going home . - Yes , sir . Oh , Alec . Maybe that UFO tried to decelerate but couldn 't because it 'd been hit . The Interceptors were way out . What else could have caused it ? The second UFO . The one that veered off . Tell Carlin to look for wreckage with damage not consistent with the crash . Right , sir . ( Woman ) Right . Thank you , SHADO Control , we 'll do that . Out . - Anything ? - Not a sign . - Steer zero-four-two . - Yes , sir . ( Ringing ) A Block , night nurse speaking . Yes , she 's still here . It 's for you . ( PA ) ' Dr Jones . Dr Jones . ' Yes ? Oh , it 's you , Ed . No , there 's no news . The drug is on its way . Everything will be all right , Mary . Yes ... Yes . Yes , I will . No , no , I 'm fine . I want to stay here . Don 't let Johnny down this time , Ed . Don 't let us down . All right . Bye . That could be it . About 50 yards ahead . Couple of degrees to port . Stop engines . I 'll take a look . Release a marker buoy and inform Control . Yes , sir . Tell me . Who are you ? Why don 't you answer me ? Why won 't you speak to me ? ( High-pitched beeping ) What 's that noise ? What are you doing ? Why don 't you go away ? Why don 't you leave my house ? I want you to hear something . It 's important . - Play it back . - ' Yes , sir . ' ( O 'Connor ) ' Why don 't you go away ? Why don 't you leave my house ? ' It cut in three minutes ago on our waveband . - Cut in ? - Clear as a bell . Estimated signal strength 1500 megawatts . That 's as powerful as a medium-sized commercial transmitter . - Do we have any bearings ? - Ireland , the west coast . ( Beeping continues ) What is that noise ? What is it ? I 'm only trying to feel your face . 'Don 't you understand ? I 'm blind . 'Why , you 're trembling . Why don 't you answer me ? 'Why don 't you tell me who you are and what it is you want ? 'Because then I might be able to help you . ' UFO crashes off the west coast of Ireland . And an old lady broadcasts from the same area with a powerful transmitter - it can 't be coincidence . - Cancel my car . - Yes , sir . Did you get closer bearings ? No . We 'd have to triangulate from ground vehicles . And there aren 't any . Where 's the nearest Transporter ? Just over the Atlantic . 200 miles out . - From New York ? - Yes , sir . I thought that wasn 't supposed to take off until 1400 hours . Correct , but it 's been en route for 50 minutes . Straker 's orders . He must be psychic . Close outer hatch . - Outer hatch closed . - Evacuate . Open inner hatch . Opening inner hatch . Inner hatch open . I want these shots developed and sent to Control ASAP . How 'd it look ? Part of it had practically been vaporised . It had been fired on by something before it crashed . ( Irregular heartbeats on monitor ) Captain Carlin just radioed these in . There 's no doubt . That UFO was damaged before it crashed . But by what ? Two UFOs are sighted . One veers off , the other crashes in Western Ireland . From the same area , someone breaks in on our waveband . Let 's make a couple of guesses . An alien survives the crash , goes into a house , the occupant is an old lady . She said she was blind . Yes , so she thinks he 's a man . An intruder . The alien sets up a transmitter and beams in on our waveband . - Why ? - We 'll know when we track him down . Well , that won 't be easy , Alec . With Mobiles , we can pinpoint his exact position . So that 'll take time . Less than an hour . Transporter will be there within minutes . Mobiles can be in the area immediately . Once they 're in position , we 'll get bearings from his next transmission . A Transporter ? The one from New York . You ordered an early take-off . - What have you done ? - I diverted it , what else ? Is something wrong ? I 'll tell Captain Carlin to go ashore as Field Commander . - I thought you 'd like some coffee . - Thank you . - What time is it ? - That clock is right . It hasn 't arrived yet . ( Phone ) A Block . Mrs Rutland , it 's for you . No . I 'll take it . Hello ? Yes , it 's me . No , no . Just the same . There 's been a delay . The drug will be here as soon as possible . Yes , I know . I know ! I 'd like to explain to Mary . It 's been delayed . Yes ? But ... Important ? ! What ... What can be more important than your own son 's life ? Listen , Mary , please . It 's not like that . You don 't understand . No ! No , I don 't understand , I 'll never understand ! ( Phone clatters ) Mary , listen to me ... Mary ! ( Sobbing ) - Where 's the Transporter ? - Just landed in Ireland , sir . The second it 's unloaded I want it in the air for London . Look , I 'm sorry about the Transporter . Was it important ? These things are always a question of priorities . Tell the Mobiles not to move in till I give the word . Get me a large-scale map of the area . - And get me Captain Carlin . - Sir . ( Irregular heartbeat on monitor ) ( Mary sobbing ) ( High-pitched beeping ) ( Squawking ) It 's all right , Billy . Our visitor 's a nice man . He doesn 't want to hurt us . It 's all right , Billy . - Mobile One in position . - Roger , One . All Mobiles in position , sir . All we can do now is wait for the next transmission . An alien who wants to cooperate . To help . Why else would he transmit on our waveband ? Why won 't you speak to me ? Get a bearing . ( Beeping ) Why don 't you tell me who you are ? It 's better to tell someone . ( Static ) What the devil 's jamming that signal ? ( SID ) ' Second UFO re-sighted . Moonbase red alert . ' Interceptors , immediate launch . Missile firing minus six-decimal-four . 'Interception negative . UFO proceeding to Earth . 'Red alert . Replacement Sky One . ' ( O 'Connor , above static ) 'I know I can 't do very much , but I 'll try and help you . ' Got it . Mobile One to Control . Signal vector one-three-eight-decimal-three . Tell the Mobiles to move in . ( Beeping continues ) Mobile One to Control . Eight miles from target . ( Irregular heartbeat continues ) ( Beeping continues ) Four miles . ( Beeping continues ) ( Beeping fades into distance ) ( Beeping continues ) ( Whirring approaches ) ( Whirring gets louder ) We 'll never know . He might have told us everything . ( John ) ' Dad ! ' Dad ! Dad ! ( Horn ) ( Tyres squealing ) Ed ! Well , do something ! ( Violent sobbing ) Mary . I never want to see you again . ( Sobbing ) ( Sobbing echoes and fades )

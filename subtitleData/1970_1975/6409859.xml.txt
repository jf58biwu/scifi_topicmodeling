 [ theme music plays ] Adam , breakfast ! [ clattering ] Just a moment . [ heartbeat pulsing ] Adam , breakfast 's getting cold . Do hurry up . [ David 's voice in Adam 's head ] I love you . David . I love you . David . Adam ? Adam , how many more times must I tell you breakfast- - What 's the matter ? Are you ill ? David 's letter ? I didn 't expect you to search my bag . - I needed aspirins . - Yes . Well , I suppose something like that had to happen . Who is he ? Not anyone you know . - I 'm sorry . - Sorry ? That you had to find out like this . The last thing I want to do is to hurt you , please believe that . Don 't let 's be silly , shall we ? Tell me , it isn 't true . Shall we talk about it over breakfast ? Come along . Adam , do come on . Sit down and eat your cereal , dear . [ scraping ] Is it serious ? Do you mean is it worth a divorce ? I don 't want a divorce . I love you . That 's what I thought . No , it 's only physical . Physical ? I 'm only human , flesh and blood . We both are . You wouldn 't think so from your past performance . I haven 't done so badly . We 've done our duty by the marriage service , - if that 's what you mean . - If we 'd had a child- - I don 't want a child , not now . I 'm over 30 and I want love . I love you . Adam , dear , you 're very considerate , affectionate , domesticated . I 'm very fond of you . And there 's no reason why we shouldn 't continue . What ? Neither of us wants a divorce . I need security and you need looking after . But to you , the most important thing in your life is your work . What do I have ? So this David is just a hobby and medicinal pastime . David is my lover . I can quite appreciate that your pride has suffered , but let 's be intelligent and constructive , shall we ? You expect me to condone this filth . It 's a matter of give and take , that 's all . No . Adam , whether you like it or not , I 'm not prepared to give David up . It means too much . I want him . A bloody gigolo . David is married with two children . He is gentle , passionate and he knows what he 's doing . - He is not an amateur . - Oh , for God 's sake . Personally , I think we should have no trouble in coming to an arrangement . You 'll manage . You 're my wife . Yes . Except in the bedroom . I 'll do anything . You could never do anything except be what you are , average , safe , suburban . You always wanted security . And got it . Everything about us is safe , even your job . Any other local journalist would have ambition . Here 's you , centre pages . Double-Crosse two columns of readers ' questions . My articles get more letters- - Your articles could be written by Aunt Edna . Why aren 't you covering that ? That 's everything you 're not . Positive , basic , masculine ! Why didn 't you dare to tackle something different ? It was you who said no when I wanted to go freelance . It was you who was so afraid of losing your damn security . I was afraid of you failing . No , that wasn 't the reason , no ... How could I ever tell you the truth ? I protected you constantly . I guided you , taught you , mothered you like a child . You smothered me with your damn need for security . Everything was done to make life good for you . - You never even realised- - - " No children , " you said . That was the most difficult sacrifice of all . I wanted children . But you couldn 't . I 'm going out tonight . No . Adam , don 't be tiresome . I 've said we must be sensible . Stop it ! I just wanted you to know where you stand . Now , I 'm going to wash up and then I 'm going to bake a cake . It 's a lovely day . Haven 't you any little jobs to do ? Why don 't you clean the car ? Lydia , please- - We 'll talk again later , if you 'd like . The worst is over , really , isn 't it ? Hmm ? Come along . Out you go . [ door scrapes ] [ heartbeat pulsing ] [ Lydia 's voice ] David ... David ... David ... It 's only physical . David is my lover . [ engine revs ] Two children ... Children . He 's not an amateur . [ Adam 's voice ] You 're my wife . [ Lydia 's voice ] Not in the bedroom . [ Lydia 's voice echoing ] [ Lydia ] It 's only physical . David is my lover . [ Adam 's voice ] I wanted children . [ Lydia 's voice ] But you couldn 't . You couldn 't . Afraid of failing , darling ? David is my lover . Positive , basic , masculine . I 'm going out tonight . [ Adam 's voice ] No . [ engine running ] [ engine continues to run ] [ Adam , thinking , distorted , echoing ] Turn on the water . [ engine running ] [ heartbeat pulsing ] Yes put her on the front page where she belongs . Yes put her on the front page where she belongs . [ Adam , thinking ] Go on , now , now , now . [ Lydia screams ] [ crashing ] [ engine revving ] [ doorbell rings ] I suppose you know you 're a danger to the community . Beg your pardon ? Your hose . Your hose is flooding the footpath . They don 't issue us with rowing boats , you know . - Sorry . - Here . I 'd switch your car off too , if I was you . Morning . [ male voice reading ] " Dear Adam Crosse , I did so love your dignified article on the first cuckold in spring . " [ rapid , heavy breathing ] [ rustling ] [ typewriter clicking ] [ faint hissing ] [ line ringing ] [ man ] Crawfield 0136 Arnold , Adam Crosse here . Last week 's article on the chemical factory , I 've had a letter . The editorial conference isn 't until Monday . Let me read it to you . It 's very short . " Dear Adam Crosse , your stupid article on the chemistry set , I know what they really make up there . Come and find out . " And it 's signed , Quilter . So what ? A crank . Oh , it 's crank very likely , but it would make a lively follow-up , don 't you think ? Maybe . Is that all ? I was gonna drive up there this morning . It 's about 40 miles . Have a lovely day . I thought I would get your sanction for expenses . For pity 's sake , stop being such an old woman . Just make it worthwhile . Goodbye . [ Arnold hangs up ] Thank you , dear Arnold . Goodbye . [ rustling ] [ splashing ] [ Lydia 's voice , echoing ] But Adam , it 's too isolated . But , Adam , why ? Why come here at all ? Away from all our friends . I love you , David . I love you , David . David ... David ... David ... David ... [ operator ] No fault reported , caller . I 'm sorry . ln that case , operator , would you put that call through to Crawfield 1602 , please . Hold the line , please . [ operator dialling ] [ line ringing ] [ phone beeping ] Hudson speaking . [ coins clattering ] [ beeping ceases ] Hudson , old chap . Adam Crosse here . Look , I wondered if you can help me . I 'm out in the country , a follow-up on last week 's article , yes . Trouble is I 've tried phoning Lydia , there 's no reply . Oh , well . She 'll be out shopping , I expect . Yes , I suppose so . What I wanted to ask you was would you go in and pop into the house and tell her I 'll be back as soon as I can ? Awful cheek to ask you like this , but I wouldn 't want to worry her . Of course , I will . [ chuckles ] I thought for a minute you wanted me to supply an alibi for you , eh ? You will go in , won 't you ? As soon as possible ? [ Hudson ] Yes , of course . Now , don 't you worry . Thanks . [ officer over radio ] Proceed to injunction of Elm Street and Fell Avenue ... [ voice breaking ] Yes , it was Lydia . Sorry to have to ask you this , Mr. Crosse . I want to help you . You must find the man who did this terrible thing . Roberts , just see everything is decent out there , will you ? They 've taken her ... Crosse , look , we 're only friends in a way of business , I know , but if there 's anything I can do . Find Quilter . Leave it to us . He 's the killer . I 'm sure of it . Now we don 't know that . That letter was a trap and to lure me from the house . It could be sheer coincidence . Or even an innocent hoax . And to send me on a wild goose chase . All right , all right . We 'll look into it . What if there were some kind of clue ? Not even a footprint . There was mud and dirt everywhere at that cottage . Look , I got it all over me . [ laughing , nervously ] Forensic cleaned up the kitchen best they could , sir . Lydia would have appreciated that . Thank you . Not at all . We 'll go now . If there 's any other information I can give you , Chief Inspector . There is one thing , yeah . Had your wife started her cooking when you left ? I can 't remember . She said she was going to do some baking . Pity that . [ Adam ] Why ? The oven , it kept the room and the body warm , makes it difficult to pinpoint the time of death . Is that important ? It could be . Very important . Oh , well . We 'll see ourselves out . Take care . [ door closes ] [ weeping ] [ engine starts up outside ] [ continues to weep ] [ laughing ] [ attempts to contain laughter ] [ laughing loudly ] Absent friends . To David and Lydia . [ doorbell rings ] Oh , Adam . Dorothy and I wondered if you- - That isn 't the answer , you know . What ? Drinking alone , it 's not good . Come in with us . Really , Stanley , I 'm quite all right . It 's very kind of you . Look , Adam , Dorothy and I , well , we thought perhaps you might like a , well , a meal or some company rather than staying here on your own . The last thing I want to do is to bother you- - Adam , it 's the least we can do . Now , please come . We really do want to help . - You don 't understand . - Now come along . - Come on . - Thank you . Now , Adam , what I meant was , well , would you like me to help organise things , announcements and so on ? Is there any family to be told ? No . A lot of people will miss her . She was such a generous-hearted girl . Darling , I 'm trying to be practical , not sentimental , please . Lydia wouldn 't have wanted us to be sentimental . But you 're bound to get sympathy from your readers for a start . They regard themselves as your friends , too . One of those readers killed Lydia . I 'm afraid I don 't understand , Adam . I mean , how on earth can- - [ Adam ] When I telephoned you this morning , I told you I was following up a reader 's letter . A crank I thought , but probably worth the effort . That journey was a wild goose chase designed so that Lydia would be left on her own . And you think that this letter writer- - - I know he did it . - How dreadful ! You 've told the police , of course . They have the letter . It was signed , " Quilter . " - [ Hudson ] Quilter ? - Complete stranger , but he is a murderer , I 'm sure of it . Of course , the signature could be a fake . What ? Well , this crank , as you put it , he wouldn 't use his real name , surely ? Quilter killed my wife . Yes , yes , Adam , yes . Yes , of course , he did . You 're humouring me , aren 't you , Hudson . Look , Adam , you 've been through a terrible experience . Yes , but you don 't believe me , do you ? A fixation brought on by shock , that 's what you 're thinking . - An unreal imagining . - Adam , please . What would you know about it , middle class , middle-aged , safe , suburban ! You mustn 't torture yourself , think of Lydia . Lydia , she was only physical . [ Hudson ] Adam ! Adam ! Look , Adam , please . Try not to let it get you down . Oh , yes . Chin up ! Stiff upper lip . Tell that to Lydia . She 'd appreciate that . About time . Adam Crosse . Quite a write-up they 've given you , haven 't they ? Look , I 'm not talking to the press . Get out ! You 'll talk to me . I 'm Quilter . [ heartbeat pulsing ] Hope I haven 't spoiled things for you . What the hell are you talking about ? This whole sordid business , front page , too . Where you 've always wanted to be . [ Adam ] I know your sort . One of those perverted tormentors . Oh , for God 's sake , Crosse , spare me the journalism . I 'm Quilter . I 'm going to telephone the police . Go ahead . [ dialling ] [ line ringing ] I 'd like a word with Chief Inspector Schofield myself about that alibi of yours . Oh , it was very clever , your idea to create an invisible man . I don 't know what you mean . But it wasn 't very nice , was it ? Using my name in vain like that . I mean , an honest , upright citizen like me , think what I could get in damages . Using my name as an alibi is as good as calling me a murderer . If you 're trying to blackmail me- - No , don 't get all het up , old son . What do you want ? A look-see at the murder spot , for a start . They did a good job of the cleaning up , haven 't they ? - Who ? - Well , the police . You 're pretty forgetful , aren 't you , for a so called journalist . No wonder you 're on the slide . I 've been through a terrifying experience . - Yes , of course , you have . - My wife has been murdered . Yes , I know . Baking a cake , I gather . Was it a blood pudding ? [ heartbeat pulsing ] [ Quilter ] Thought you were made of stronger stuff , Crosse . You 're not such a cool customer as you look , are you ? - [ Adam ] Why have you come here ? - I 'm curious . [ Quilter chuckles ] And what 's so amusing ? It 's all Lydia , isn 't it ? It 's as though your personality never had any significance . You were dominated . Inadequate . But now Lydia 's out of the way , you can change all that . Or can you ? She was a bitch , wasn 't she ? She was my wife . Yes , I know . For better or for worse especially in bed , eh ? - Who the hell are you ? - Have another drink . - Answer my question . - Do as you 're told ! [ Adam ] You 've been here before , haven 't you ? - Have I ? - You knew Lydia , knew her well . Not as well as you . You 're David , you 're her lover . Ah . So that 's why you killed her . - I didn 't . - Jealousy . No . He was better equipped than you , wasn 't he ? Physically . Were you her lover ? Why , what are you going to do ? Beat me up or thank me ? Oh , you 're not the physical type , just violent . Stop it ! You 've got one of your headaches coming , haven 't you ? - No . - Oh , how noble . You masochistic pansy ! You enjoy the pain , don 't you ? It 's got a pulse , a rhythm . It 's there , isn 't it ? Hurt-hurt-hurt . You are her lover ! I 'm not David , I can 't be . You know that , think about it . [ frantically ] I can 't ! [ Quilter ] Oh , do I frighten you , then ? Who the hell are you ? Let 's just say , I 'm a free agent , but an interested party . And I know about you . Get out of here ! Get out ! Look at you , the complete suburban superman , journalist of the year , front page of every national daily . [ shattering ] Shut up ! Now , now , I 'm not Lydia . Damn you ! And damn Lydia ! Adam , I was just coming over to fetch you . - I can 't stop now . - Oh , now , come on , come on . Look , you can 't stay in there by yourself . Come on in with us . It won 't take a minute to make up a bed . Perhaps , a couple of tablets ... [ reporter over TV ] If there 's any connection between ... . ... a good night 's sleep and then tomorrow- - Well , tomorrow you 'll feel as right as rain . [ reporter on TV ] ... Chief Inspector Schofield ... Any person who was in the vicinity at approximately 10 : 30 this morning is asked to contact their nearest police station . [ Lydia 's voice ] It 's only physical , Adam . It 's only physical , Adam . It 's only physical , Adam . Adam ? Adam ! [ engine starts up ] [ car pulls away ] [ Quilter ] Think you 'd got away with it , Crosse ? [ honking ] Easy , does it , old chap . For God 's sake , stop persecuting me . But we 're just getting to know each other . I don 't know you . I don 't want to know you . Oh , but you do . I 've been watching you , Crosse . You 're clever , you 've got a brain , you 've got nerve and you 're subtle , not blatant . - I like that . - I know I 've got potential . Of course , you have . There 's an untapped stream inside you , Crosse , a power , - creative power . - You think so ? But it 's twisted , Crosse . Malignant . - And it 's got you trapped . - No . You 're a prisoner , Crosse . Lydia 's prisoner , even now . I 'm a free man . I can do what I want . Can you ? I bet the girls in the office have got a nickname for you . " Loo-Loo , " because you 're always on the run . [ woman 's voice ] Good morning , Adam . Hello , Loo-Loo . Good morning , Loo-Loo . Have me , Loo-Loo . [ mocking laughter ] [ brakes screech ] [ woman ] Did you know your car door 's open ? Don 't you want it closed ? From the inside . Sit in . Okay . - A bit antique , isn 't it ? - What ? The car . It 's not exactly Mille Miglia . It 's a stand-in . - You getting a new car ? - I wrote off the Jag . - You getting a new car ? - Dino Coupe . - Super . I like sports cars . - And their drivers ? Them , too , if they 're nice . - I can be nice . - Can you ? Yeah , that sends me . - What does ? - That smile . Do you only have a look at girls ' teeth ? The rest of you looks pretty great , too . I know . What would you do if you found somebody else in bed with your lover ? Of course , it is his pad . - Walk out . - I did . It 's your life . Nobody owns you . Trouble is , all my things are there . - I 've got absolutely nothing . - You need help . I need a bed for the night . That 's no trouble . All right . - But no strings . - No . No strings . A crime of passion ? He 's not that type . His alibi 's like a flaming guided tour . Everywhere he went , he either left a trail or brought back a clue . There wasn 't one minute he couldn 't account for . You wanted facts . Oh , no . It smells all wrong . Oh , come on . Look , I know Adam Crosse . He 's a journalist . Facts are food and drink to him . He 's trained to get things right . And you like him and all , don 't you ? I 've known him a long time . You don 't reckon on her having a lover ? Never . It could happen . And provide you with a convenient motive , granted . But where 's your proof ? I just don 't see why you 're so sure it 's not him . Look , I told you , he 's clever , precise , a bit dry , not wild or passionate . He 's just a good , solid , suburban citizen who lives by the rules . I mean , just look at the killing . Crosse couldn 't do it . Not that way . - Perhaps not . - So what 's left ? A brutal bloody murder in a kitchen . But he doesn 't fit the Kitchen Killer type . Tell that to the victim . I thought you said you were a writer . - I am . - Here ? Writers live in houses , too , you know . I know . You 're a journalist . - Admit it . - What if I am ? I know about journalists . Well then- - Look , I 'm not ten minute Tallulah . You 're absolutely gorgeous . Well , don 't get a muck sweat on . There 's a good chap . And besides , think of the neighbours . It 's us that 's important . Oh , darling , this thing is bigger than both of us . I 'm serious . I 'm Joanne . We haven 't been introduced , have we ? Adam . So this is the Garden of Eden ? Imagine an angel with a flaming sword ever coming here . You 'd make it look like a palace . Do you talk like that to your wife ? It 's no wonder she isn 't home . Does that bother you ? Why ? Did you fancy a threesome ? How do you mean ? Oh , Adam , you absolute goof . It 's all right . I am not butch and I don 't welsh . - If you only knew . - I do know . - You want me . - Yes . - Then don 't be clumsy . - I 'm sorry . And don 't be such a creep . Be a man . Not yet . I want to be pampered . - Anything . - A shower ? - Upstairs . - I 'll find it . - I 'll put a record on . - Super . And I 'll have a large Scotch with ice , and a big cheesy sandwich . And then , if you 're lucky . [ doorbell rings ] Who is it ? - What do you want ? - Adam , it 's me , Stanley . I wondered if you 'd like to come out for a short stroll , - blow away the cobwebs . - No . Just as you like , but ... Shall I come in and sit with you for a while , share a small nightcap , eh ? - No , I 'm all right . - Look , Adam . Adam , Dorothy and I , well , we 're very concerned about you . Sleep at our house , just for tonight . No , go away . [ Quilter ] You dirty old lecher . [ heartbeat pulsing ] Nearly got caught out , didn 't you ? [ chuckles ] Oh , she 's a delightful piece , Crosse . Skin like a peach . And did you see the way the body moved under the dress ? Mother naked and so young . Get out ! You 're going to need some help ... Someone who can do the job satisfactorily . Just as well I 'm here . It 's going to be fun , the three of us . - You 're not staying here . - Oh , but I am , old chap , brought my toothbrush and towel . See ? It 's going in the street this minute and you with it ! You can 't frighten me ! Adam . Lydia . I 'm Joanne , remember ? Is it all ready and super ? Don 't let 's- - I 'm not going to bed yet . I want a drink ! I know , you 've got a surprise in there for me . Seduction City . What a trip . - The record . - Where 's the bloody drink ? [ record plays ] [ Joanne laughs loudly ] - Oh , it 's too much . - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Joanne . Oh , it 's great ! It 's a real suburban orgy . Where did you get the snake , Adam ? Under the settee , along with all your porny picture books and your inflatable , plastic wife ? I know everything 's gone wrong , but- - That 's all part of the game , isn 't it ? Did you ever manage to make your wife , Adam ? Look at you , middle-aged peeping Tom who likes to tickle little girls . Strip show Johnny . Did you ever dare to look at your wife naked ? I want you . Of course , darling , but could you do anything ? You 'd probably need permission first . I 'm not an amateur ! Oh , a specialist . What in ? Dirty daydreams ? No . What I want is real . But it has to be kinky ? Different ? Is that it ? No . - Then rape me . - I only want to love you . Oh , God ! Why do suburban men have to be so useless ! [ Lydia 's voice ] David is my lover . He knows what he 's doing . Do you know what action is ? What have you done with your pretty little life , except eat and sleep and fornicate ? You still live inside the rules , but I dare to break them . Twelve hours ago , I disposed of my wife . She was slowly destroying me , like you , trying to cripple my mind , rejecting me , but I liberated myself . I killed her . I was only playing . You can 't escape me . No one can . You are a victim . [ clattering , fumbling ] [ heartbeat pulsing ] [ door slams ] Don 't leave me ! Please don 't leave me ! [ Quilter ] You poor fool . Now you 've done it . Given the game away completely , haven 't you ? I haven 't done anything . Tell that to the police . They 'll be here very soon . She wouldn 't tell them . Lydia wouldn 't tell them . She was always so loyal . She 'll come back , she 'll stay . [ Quilter ] Lydia 's gone . Gone for good . But I 'm here . I 'll look after you . Let me go ! You pathetic creature . Can you feel the pain now ? The memories , aching and bleeding like Lydia 's head ? And you , Lydia 's cuckold , that girl 's plaything , broken , spineless . My head ! All right , thanks very much . That 's Sergeant Flash from the Yard . They 've picked up the Kitchen Killer bloke . Been holding him in custody since this morning in Liverpool . I want to report an attempted murder . She 'll come back ! No , Crosse . Lydia 's dead . The girl 's gone . There 's no escape from the pain . Don 't hurt me . Please , don 't hurt me . It 's too late to ask for mercy . Help me , please . After what you did ? - I loved her . - Look at her face . You needed Lydia , yet , you killed her . You needed the girl , yet , you drove her away . But I 'm here and I know what you are . For God 's sake , give me peace ! Useless old queer . Poor , poor Adam . Murderer . You are not an amateur , darling . It 's only physical . Have me , Adam , murderer . She 'd let you , Crosse , in the kitchen . Take her in the kitchen , go on . It 's a blood pudding , dear . Adam , you can do it . Adam , you can do it . Come on . Make it here . [ Lydia 's voice ] Lovely day . Such a lovely day . Anything to do ? Any little jobs to do ? Why did you kill Lydia ? She loved you . I 'm not finished yet . What is there left ? Only the shadows in your mind and the refuge of an asylum . - I can kill you ! - Can you ? But I don 't exist and you realise that your sense of guilt created me . There 's only one way you can get rid of me . [ Quilter ] I am you ! [ siren wailing ] [ Quilter ] I am you . I am you . Self-inflicted , definitely .

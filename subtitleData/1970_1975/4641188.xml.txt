 Here we go again . Red alert . Red alert . Interceptors immediate launch . Ground Defence Control , position rocket launchers . Moonbase to SHADO Control . Moonbase to SHADO Control . Go ahead , Moonbase . 'Ground defences ready . Interceptors spaceborne . - ' Contact minus 47 . ' - Roger . Firing range minus 8 . UFOs retreating . Giving chase . It smells . Moonbase , tell your ground defences to get nervous . SHADO Control , 3 more UFOs approaching , orbital reference 318 . Decoys ! Moonbase , instruct the Interceptors to return immediately . 'Ground defences out . ' That 's it . They 're wide open now . Where are they ? 8 UFOs destroyed in a week . Do you think they 'll take the hint ? First , two under cover of sunspot activity , then three at ground level . Now six in a decoy manoeuvre . All or nothing . Last fling . Do you think they 'll give up ? Colonel Lake , they didn 't lose all those craft just to give up . What worries me is what will they try next ? - Coffee ? - Yeah , black . - Two . - I think I 'm a bit old for this . - Steve ? - Yeah ? - 20 more hours ... - Then home to Mother Earth . Great ! 48 hours in our natural habitat . - Enough time just to mow the lawn . - What ? I said I 'm going to mow the lawn . 'The following personnel report for combat training . 'Phillips , Robinson ... and Regan . ' - Never a dull moment . - The show must go on . - See you later . - Give ' em hell , baby . - Touche . - My pleasure . - Come on , Regan . You 're half asleep . - It 's been a long day ! Oh , yes ... - Submit . - No . Come on , it 'll break . You should have broken it . That was a mistake ! 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ... - You 're coming on , Regan . - You 're still too good for me . You nearly had me but you lack killer instinct . - Well , I 'm a nice fella . - Earth tomorrow ? - Give my regards to the wife . - See you . Thank you . You 're welcome . I think we 'll stick to theory for a little while . Bit formal for chess . Why are you in this gear ? Straker 's orders . All astronauts on alert until relieved . From bed to battle in 128 seconds . What more does he want ? With no ground defences , he 's taking no chances . And he wants five practice alerts a day until further notice . He 'll have us living in that launching bay next . Don 't even suggest it . Will the real James Regan stand up , please ? It must be me . Morgan ! Get out here ! Hello , Jim ! They tell me you had a busy time up there . Dan Dare wasn 't in it . How are you , Earthman ? - Can 't complain . - See you Thursday ? - Sure thing . - Cheers , Morgan . Jim . I was so worried about you . We don 't talk about those things , remember ? I 'm sorry . It was just that I ... Hard time ? You look exhausted . I 'm fine . You 're the nicest excuse for an early night I can think of . - The Thompsons ... - Thompsons ? Lovely people . - The Thompsons . - What about the Thompsons ? - What about the Thompsons ? ! - Dinner . Tonight . The Thompsons . Remember ? Do we have to ? - It was your idea . - That was a week ago . - I was a young man . - Come on . You 'll feel better after a shower and a drink . In you go , Methuselah . How are you ? - Would you like a drink ? - Only if you bring it in , fair lady . - Yes , master . - OK . Don 't forget , if they bring out those home movies , you develop a headache . Don 't be so mean . You know how proud your cousin is of his photography . Yes , I know . But the films he makes ... Take the last one : The Courting Habits Of The British Earthworm . - The fellow 's kinky . - Oh , Jim . You are a fool ! It 's so nice to have you home again . We could always turn back , tell ' em we had a puncture . Nothing I 'd like more but we can 't . We must go . - Muriel 's made your favourite meal . - Oh , not again . I 've no idea where it came from . There was a knock , but nobody was there , just this package . I thought it was a face cream I 'd ordered , but when I unwrapped it , it was this Ouija thing . Help me put the cards out , darling . Can 't imagine who sent it . I know it 's all nonsense but why look a gift horse in the mouth ? - I thought we 'd try it for fun . - What about Albert 's latest film ? This 'll be much more fun . Albert doesn 't mind , do you ? - We 'll save yours for next time . - It isn 't actually finished yet . Good . You sit there , Albert , Jean there and Jim here next to me . Come on , Jim . Now , everyone has to put a forefinger ... Wait a minute ! I 'll lower the lights . Must have a bit of atmosphere , in case we frighten away the spirits . Now , right forefinger on the top of the glass . What happens now ? Yes . Somebody asks a question . - Jean , you ask . - OK . Are we having a boy or a girl ? No . You 'll have to rephrase the question . We 've got a " yes " card and a " no " card . So , you ask , " Is the baby going to be a boy ? " If it says " no " , you know it 's a girl . - What if it 's twins ? - That 's a point ! Don 't be difficult , Jim . Are we having a boy ? It 's a boy ! I suspect there was some cheating going on there . Now , come on . We must take it seriously . - Albert , you ask a question . - Yes , let me see now ... Oh , my goodness ! I 'll ask one while you 're thinking . What is going to be the fashionable colour next year ? S E A ... Sea green ? N C E S-E-A-N-C-E ? Seance . How strange ! Oh , come on . Somebody was pushing . Not me . I didn 't even know how to spell it ! Well , Let 's have a go . Everybody hold hands . - Really , it wasn 't me . - Never mind . Come on . Everybody concentrate . Is there anybody there ? Muriel ! Is there anybody there ? Albert , take that pipe out of your mouth . Perhaps we ought to concentrate with our eyes closed . Right . Is there anybody there ? Is there anybody there ? Is there anybody there ? Is there anybody there ? Is there anybody there ? Is there anybody there ? Is there anybody there ? Is there anybody there ? - Are you all right , darling ? - Let me get you a brandy . No ... No . I 'm fine . What happened ? I must ... I passed out . - Are you sure you 're all right , Jim ? - Yes . I 'm fine . Must have been more tired than I thought . Silly damned game . I don 't know what came over me . It must have been that foul tobacco that Albert smokes . It was rather frightening . Oh , come on . Let 's not make something out of nothing . You are the last person to believe in that nonsense . Course I don 't . I was just worried about you . Just tiredness catching up with me . I 'll be fine after a night 's sleep . Jim , why are we taking the long way home ? Sorry . - Just wasn 't thinking . - Do you want me to drive ? Perhaps you 'd better . What on earth ... ? Why did you do that , Jim ? Something in the road . Poor thing . It was dazzled by the lights . Yeah . He was lucky I saw him . Well , we can 't just leave it . We 'll drop it in at the police station . - Jim ? - Yeah ? - If they can 't trace the owner ... - Here it comes . Can I keep him ? He 's so beautiful . He 'd be company when you 're away . I 'll have to think about it . I don 't like competition , you know ? Who said cats were lucky ? I think we 'll call this one Jonah . Get out ! Quick ! Jean ... Jean ? Jean ! Jean ? Jean ... - Straker ? - Yes . - Jim , what 's the matter ? - I want to see Straker . Regan ! - Regan ! - ' Voiceprint positive . ' ... and then they gave us what could only be a medical . Peças de reposição Transplante de órgãos . - No ! - That 's all it could have been . No . It couldn 't . It couldn 't . Or they would have taken me as well . You could have been an unsuitable donor . Wrong body tissue group . But why leave you alive ? What puzzles me is how come they pick on a member of SHADO ? Could be coincidence . Four other people were taken on that road . A woman was left behind , apparently dead . Before she died she told us what had happened . She had a weak heart . Who shall I assign to replace Jim ? No one . You will report for normal duty tomorrow . That 's all , Regan . Can 't you see the man 's in shock ? He needs to ... We need . With all these attacks , the Venus probe coming in soon and that UFO still around , we need every astronaut available . That 's all , Colonel . Doctor Jackson . Commander . You heard what happened about Regan ? Yes . Poor man . A tragedy . - I 've ordered him back to duty . - Quite right . The only thing you could do . Well , it 's nice that somebody understands . I 'd like you to keep an eye on him , though , Doctor , just in case . I most certainly will . You look a bit under the weather , yourself . Just a headache . If it makes you feel better , I 'll have an aspirin . All right . They asked me to drop this in as I was passing . I 've got a couple of weeks ' leave due , if you want to relieve Regan . That 's nice of you , Paul , but I think he 'll be better off occupied . I want to go through the Venus probe escort procedure with you . - Thank you , Doctor . - Don 't go ! This is the result of the autopsy I carried out on the alien 's body . The one found after the Moombase attack ? It could shatter all our past theories . Go on . This is mostly conjecture . The head was badly damaged . I may be wrong . Until more proof is available ... Cut the caution . We 're not likely to quote you . All right . I 'm sorry . As you are aware , up until now , we 've believed they were humanoid . A dying race , keeping themselves alive by transplanting our organs into their bodies . The alien I examined this morning , I think his whole body was human . - His brain ? - Even his brain . You mean he was one of us ? Outwardly , yes . - But if his brain ... - His brain may have been human but it doesn 't mea his mind was . - Mind , brain , they 're the same . - No , no , no . Let me try to explain . There was so much damage , it was almost impossible to tell but certain sections of the brain seemed to be missing . The parts that control emotion , creativity . Only the analytical , the logical remained . It 's possible that these creatures are not humanoid at all . They just use our bodies , erase from the brain all knowledge , wipe it clean and reprogram it with , or transmit to it , their own thought patterns , their own intelligence . But why ? That I don 't know . It could be they aren 't capable of travelling in space . The form of life they take , I can 't begin to imagine . They may have no physical being at all , and therefore need a vehicle , a container : our bodies . And so , with spare-part surgery , they 're able to keep these human computers alive and free from senility during their years in space . - Exactly . - Well , that 's unbelievable . So were UFOs . Yes , as fantastic as it sounds , they could be living computers . What are you doing here ? I should report you . This is a restricted area . Looks like we 've got ourselves a mascot . Red alert ! Red alert ! UFO leaving earth . Area PZ-17 . Direction : Amber 4-G . Speed : 1,500 . 'Moonbase . UFO approaching . 'Area Amber 4-G . ETA 387 . ' Red alert ! Red alert ! Interceptors immediate launch . 'ETA in Area Amber 4-G minus 364 . ' Instruct Interceptors , new course . Area Blue 12 . ETA minus 197 . The UFO will cross their path diagonally . - Maintain station 150 miles apart . - Yes , sir . Near miss . Some damage . 'UFO speed dropped to 250,000 . ' A sitting duck . Regan must get him . Regan ? His wife 's aboard that craft . I swear I don 't know what happened . One moment it was right in my sights , next it was gone . It was unfortunate that you had to encounter that particular UFO . The fact that my wife was on board made me more determined . I wanted that UFO . I 'd rather she was dead than ... It wasn 't entirely your fault . I made a bad decision , sending you back to duty so soon . But now I 'm resting you for a month . I don 't want . I 'm on Venus probe escort tomorrow . There may be another chance . Regan , I can 't afford vendettas . Colonel Foster will take your place . - I have to go . - You 're suspended . That is an order . - But ... - That 's all . Colonel Foster will be replacing James Regan until further notice . Inform all departments . - Doctor Jackson ? - ' Jackson . ' I 've just relieved Regan from duty . Tomorrow morning I want a full physical and psychiatric report . So , that 's where you got to . Oh , is it yours ? My wife 's . Well , he would have been . We found him in the road just before , just before the UFO ... - Are you all right , Jim ? - Just a headache . Well , how 's show business ? There 's no business . Well , hardly . They 've finished The Rebels of Santa Domingo and there 's a dog food commercial on stage 4 , and a script for your approval . It 's a period piece about World War II . World War II ? Well , I 'll leave this until Miss Ealand gets back . - Let her handle it . - Right . Miss Holland , I haven 't thanked you for filling in . No need . It makes a break from Section 9 . How is Colonel Blake ? Oh , he 's the same . - I 'll give him your regards . - Yes , do that . Well , I suppose I 'd better show my face . Stage 4 , you say ? Yes . Sir , how 's Jim Regan taking it ? He 's taking it . Jim , what are you doing here ? It was terrible about Jean . I don 't know what to say . If there 's anything I can do . Are you OK ? I 'll take you back . Now wait a minute . Wait ... ! Hello , Jim . - Sorry about ... - Yeah . - You 're late . - Got held up . Wait a minute . I thought Colonel Foster was taking your place . The order was cancelled . - I should check . You know Straker . - Straker 's orders . I should still check . But seeing it 's you ... Good luck . 'Interceptor crew change : minus 30 minutes . ' I wonder how poor old Jim 's taking it . Yeah , she was a nice girl . 'Interceptor pilots , stand by to escort Venus probe in . ' - Foster 's cutting it fine again . - Probably in the gym . Don 't worry . 'Interceptors , stand by . 3 minutes . ' Well , I 'd better report . Jim , I thought Paul was taking your place . - The order was changed . - I wasn 't informed . - Last-minute decision . - I 'm sorry , Jim . I don 't doubt your word , but I must follow procedure . Hello , Operations Room ? Captain Minto here . I 'd like to speak to Major Heath . 'Interceptors , immediate launch . ' - Doctor Jackson . - Jackson . The medical report I asked on Regan hasn 't come through . I haven 't been able to contact him . Nobody seems to know where he is . Locate Regan . He is to report to Doctor Jackson at once . - Straker . - ' Morgan here , sir . ' Regan went to Moonbase this morning . - Colonel Foster wouldn 't replace him ? - Yes , but he said you 'd cancelled it . I 'll see you tomorrow , Morgan . I won 't have my orders ignored . 'Yes , sir . ' Moonbase . - Moonbase . - ' I wanna talk to Captain Regan . ' - He 's escorting Venus probe in . - Where 's Foster ? - The Colonel 's not on Moonbase . - Find out what Regan 's playing at . Yes , sir . Regan ? Come in , Regan . 'Regan . Come in ... ' - Regan 's flying . - I thought you grounded him . - I did . - He 's never disobeyed orders before . That 's what worries me . Find Foster . - Is he on Moonbase ? - No , he isn 't . He 's here somewhere . - ' Yes , Commander ? ' - The minute Captain Regan lands , - I want him brought back here . - ' Yes , sir . ' God Almighty ! Paul , what happened ? Regan . He was like a madman . Why ? Why did he do it ? I don 't know . I tried to reason with him but he was like a wild animal . - Did he say anything ? - No , nothing . - Nothing at all ? - He just made noises , - like a cat . - A cat ? There is a cat . Belonged to his wife . He said he found it near the UFO . Something else . When he picked it up , he suddenly developed head pains . - Jackson ? - ' Jackson . ' That theory of yours , could it apply to an animal ? - Well , without researching ... - Is it possible ? The brain structure is different ... - Never mind that . Yes or no ? - ' Yes . But ... ' I 'll get the building searched . Let 's make sure it 's still here . Get Miss Holland . Miss Holland . Yes , I did . About half an hour ago . 'Commander , Regan 's broken formation . ' Trajectory ? 'Interceptor 3 on collision course : Moonbase . 'I repeat , collision course : Moonbase . ' They 're using Regan to destroy Moonbase . Instruct Interceptors 1 and 2 : pursue and destroy Interceptor 3 . - ' Say again , sir . ' - You heard me . Yes , sir . Interceptors 1 and 2 , destroy Interceptor 3 . Something 's wrong . No power . Same with me , nothing . - Find that animal . - We haven 't time . Try ! Wait a minute ... The dogs ! That 's it ! Get on to it .

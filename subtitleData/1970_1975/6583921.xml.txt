 ( Phone ) - Yes , Miss Ealand ? - If there 's nothing else , I 'll go . No , that 's all right , I 'm about to leave myself . Good night . ( Intercom buzzes ) - Straker . - ( Man ) ' Possible sighting . ' ( SID ) ' Have trace on positive track . 'Course four-two-eight , one-four-six green . 'Speed zero SOL eight . 'Range , 32 million miles , closing . Red alert . ' - ( Alarm ) - ' Red alert . ' Control to Interceptors . Have UFOs on positive track . Moonbase to SHADO Control . Confirm UFO sightings . Going for intercept . ( SID ) ' Maintaining speed and course . 'Apogee zero-two-seven decimal-three-two-four . 'Range 20 million miles . ' ( Kelly ) Positive track green one-four-zero , two-seven-three . Yes , we have that . Roger . We confirm orbital reference . Speed correction ? SOL 0.7 ... ( SID ) ' I have green on one , two and three . 'Speed SOL zero-decimal-seven-eight . 'Range 17 million miles . ' - Anything ? - No , nothing yet , sir . 'Missile three , destruct negative . 'UFO beyond Interceptor range , heading for earth . ' Pretty effective blanket detonation by the Interceptors . But not good enough . The one that got through must be damaged . Sky One should get it . - Where 's the trajectory termination ? - Just coming through , sir . North Atlantic , grid reference G6 . Commander Straker , there 's an aircraft entering the target area . 'Confirm tracking zero-one-three . 'Area red four-one-two . 'Have positive trace . Waiting for confirmation . ' Well , if it 's not a military jet , what the blazes is it ? Not a commercial airliner - too high and way off the air lanes . - XV-one-zero-four to Control . - ( Kelly ) ' This is Control . ' Levelled out at 250,000 . Airspeed 2200 , pressure normal , cabin temperature 72 . We 'll start the test schedule when we get to area G6 . 'G6 . Roger . ' Is that VAC ? Have you an aircraft overflying the Atlantic ? - Shall I call it off ? - Hold on . Sir ... - It 's a jet on a test flight . - Commercial ? Ventura Aircraft Corporation - on the line . I hear you have a jet over the North Atlantic . - Grid reference , er ... - G6 . G6 . Right . Tell your pilot to alter course . Anywhere ! Just get him out of that area . Look , I don 't care how much it cost , get him out or you won 't have an aircraft to test . We 're 150 miles from the test area . ETA four minutes . Right . It 's coming over , sir . Captain Carlin . What 's your position , Captain ? 'We can go for immediate intercept after Sky One lifts off . ' Right . Right . Stand by for liftoff . Sky One airborne , sir . Going for intercept . Course steady at zero-one-four . Airspeed 2185 knots . - Jim ... - We 're just about coming up to ... - ( Jim ) What is it ? - We 'll soon find out . We 're closing , fast . It 's unbelievable ! Stand by with reconnaissance camera . Try to get some close shots . Have viewphone radar track . Closing in for attack . 'Control to XV-one-zero-four . ' - What is it , Control ? - ' Alter course to zero-two-four . ' Listen , Bill , we 're onto something up here . I 'll explain later . 'Paul , this is a direct instruction . Alter course ! ' Sorry , Control . Out . Get onto someone in authority . - Dig the chairman out of bed . - What do I tell him ? Tell him the aircraft 's violating a war game area , anything . - Just get it out ! - Yes , sir . Range 125 miles , closing . - You 'll have to call it off . - Sky One attacks . That aircraft takes its chances . Programme set . Missile launch 25 seconds . Paul . There 's another aircraft . Just keep taking those shots . Five , four , three , two , one zero . Positive . UFO destroyed . - And the jet ? - It was close . It must 've been hit . ( Screaming ) My eyes . My eyes , what 's happened to my eyes ? - My eyes ... - Mr Foster , it 's all right . It 's all right . Come along , it 's all right . There , there . Right . Thank you , nurse . Temporary blindness , Mr Foster . In a few days you 'll be able to see as well as ever . My name 's Frazer . Dr Frazer . - Where am I ? - Grendel Hospital . You ejected , just in time . Hungry ? - I guess so . - Good . I 'll have some food sent in . What time is it ? Nearly 2am . - How long have I been here ? - Six days . I 'll see about that food . What ... what happened to Jim ? He didn 't make it . I 'm sorry . Paul , how are you ? - Fine . - Doctors say you 're in great shape . - Well , they should know . - Sit down , Paul . - Cigar ? - Oh , thanks . Paul , you 're a pilot . A test pilot . One of the best . You 've ... been through a ... traumatic experience . Still , that 's all in the past . Consider the future . - Your future . - My future ? What I thought was that you should take a rest . - On full pay , of course . - Oh , of course . I suggest that we , uh ... talk again , in say , a couple of months . ( Jet takes off outside ) - One question . - Go ahead . Where the cinefilm from the reconnaissance camera ? - Now , look , Paul . - Where 's that film ? - Paul ? - You 've got my report . You read it ? You wrote that report three days after recovering from a six-day coma . Six days , six weeks , what 's the difference ? What I wrote is true ! That 's the way it happened ! Explosion ? Strange lights ? Unidentified flying object ? Look , just process that film ! Both the plane and the film are with a military investigation unit . I want a hearing . They will tear that story of yours to shreds . You will never fly again for me . Or for anybody else . Do you understand that ? Hi , Alec . Well , what do you think ? You should have warned me . Isn 't this what any well turned-out film executive would wear ? Have to maintain our cover . I gotta start showing my face up top . Talking of cover , I 've had General Henderson on the line . - What does he want ? - Foster wants a hearing . Foster ? The test pilot . And he 's no pushover . He knows what he saw and he 's sticking to it . - Wasn 't the copilot killed ? - Yeah . - What he says is not corroborated . - Right . Well , I hope you find the surroundings to your liking . - It 's a new twist . - Do sit down . Comfort , privacy ... Complete security . What more could you ask for ? The answer to a couple of questions . Try me . Where 's the cinefilm from the XV-one-zero-four ? As I was about to say , the camera in question was undamaged . Then did I or didn 't I see an unidentified flying object ? - You 're not sure ? - Don 't play games . You know , I believe you saw something . Well , at least that 's a start . Ah , coffee . Look , Jackson , let 's stop fencing around . That film shows close-ups of an object . I 'm an experienced test pilot . That thing was extraterrestrial . Run the film , Tsi . ( Foster ) I don 't understand . There 's the other aircraft . What have you done ? What are you trying to pull ? You 've erased it , fixed it ! Why ? Why should I do that ? I ought to knock that smile right back down your ... ( Grunting ) Yes ... Things are not always what they seem to be , Mr Foster . OK . - You saw that ? - More games ? - Did you see it stop ? - Stop ? Look . I throw it up , and it falls back into my hand . But for a split second just at the top of the trajectory , it stops . - Did you see it ? - ( Sighs ) - But it did stop ! - If you say so . No , Foster , it didn 't . It 's moving forward at 500 knots . Like everything else in this plane . Yet again , this whole aircraft moves with the rotation of the earth . Confusing ... but fact . Facts can be confusing in an aircraft at night , at 250,000 feet . Now , tell me all about it . What did you see from that cockpit ? An extraterrestrial spacecraft . - A light source ! - Yes . - A trick of light . - No ! - A panel reflection . - No ! Refracted from your visor and the windscreen . No ! There are 100 other explanations . Only one . And you know it . Well , I have a report to write . If you ... If you could give me a few facts . Your name , Paul Foster . Address , I have it . - You 've been a pilot for ... - Eight years . Eight years . - And a test pilot for two ? - Right . Now , I can see here you reported a sighting ... - three years ago ? - Yes . And another two and a half years before that . That 's right . Then we shouldn 't be meeting again for another couple of years . I , er ... don 't normally enter rooms this way . - The janitor let me in . - Good old janitor . Drink ? Why did you murder my brother ? - You 've read the report , Alec ? - Couldn 't put it down . - Conclusions ? - We can be cautiously satisfied . Yes , I agree . Three UFOs . Two knocked out by our Interceptors , one destroyed in the atmosphere by Sky One . There are still areas that need work . Interceptor launches . Too slow . Yes . I want astronauts spaceborne within two minutes of a red alert . Go to Moonbase , Alec . Drill them , cajole them , but get those times down . Nice assignment . Where 's my stick ? No , Alec , that would be my way . I 'm sending you because you 're the right man for the job . OK . Anything more on Foster ? Yes . He 's tough . And persistent . What happens if he starts getting close ? One man blow the cover of a multi-billion dollar setup ? What do you think ? Then they told me you 'd worked out a story to cover wrecking a very expensive aircraft and killing my brother . Well , you 've heard both sides . What do you believe ? I don 't know . You know , as long ago as 1968 , the authorities issued a report denying the existence of UFOs . - Why ? - I don 't understand . Why deny it ? Why bother ? I 'll give you a reason . Let 's say the authorities had proof , indisputable proof that UFOs had come to earth . What would be the result if it leaked out ? Mass hysteria . Terror . A breakdown of authority . So , they issue a report . An official denial , to discredit anyone who claims to have seen one . Five years ago I saw one . Two years later , another . They exist , you 've got to believe me . Up there with your brother , I saw something . I believe you . Thanks . Your brother had a camera . Did they find it ? I don 't know . There are some personal effects but I can 't have them yet . - Something to do with security . - Who told you that ? - A man called Kofax . - Kofax ? - Do me a favour , meet me tomorrow . - What are you going to do ? Follow my nose . Everybody else thinks I 'm a nut , I 've got nothing to lose . - Where are you going ? - See you tomorrow . ( Jet engine , dog barking ) ( Jet taking off ) ( Door shutting in hall ) ( Footsteps approaching ) ( Dog barking ) ( Footsteps receding ) Kofax , you 've got a mind like a steel trap . Straker . Right . Right . Thank you . Trouble ? Paul Foster broke into Kofax 's office . They don 't miss a trick . There 's nothing . No , but it proves somebody was interested enough to doctor this film as well . Paul , might it be better to forget all this ? No ! I can 't just drop it . Don 't you understand ? I 'll go and get those back-issue papers you wanted . ( Door opens and closes ) ( Knock at door ) ( Grunts ) ( Glass shattering ) ( Grunts ) Ohhh . Paul ! Are you all right ? Yeah , I feel great ( ! ) Who did this ? Well , it certainly wasn 't the janitor . I 'll get you a drink . - Of course ! - What is it , Paul ? Straker . Ed Straker ! Paul Foster ? No , I don 't think I want to speak to him now . Uh ... tell him to meet me in the studio . In an hour . Right . Find Alec Freeman for me . Ask him to come here . Yes , sir . - You wanted to see me ? - Yes . I 'm seeing Paul Foster in an hour . - How much does he know ? - That 's what I aim to find out . You look after things down here . You plan to use that ? - Good afternoon . - My name 's Foster . Ah , yes . To see Mr Straker . Mr Straker told me to tell you to meet him at Rupert Square . Rupert Square ? Hold it right there . You must be Foster . I 'm Straker . Ed Straker . Hey , Louis ? Where are you ? I 'll be right with you , sir . Is , erm ... that thing real ? Excuse me . ( Straker ) We 'll get something built here . I 'd really like to see something along the top there . Yeah , I think it 's gonna be fine , Louis . You can go ahead . Thanks . We 'll start building right away . - Check with me in the morning . - Right . Yeah , it 's gonna work out just fine . That 's Louis , my construction manager . Great guy . Well , what 's on your mind , Mr Foster ? - Unidentified flying objects . - Good subject . You got a script ? No . I really mean it . I saw one . Now , why don 't you tell me all about it , then ? ( Phone ) - Yes ? - Where 's Commander Straker ? - He 's still with Foster , sir . - Thanks . That really is a very good story , Mr Foster . But I 'm in the film business . I suggest you tell that story to the police , the Army , the Marines . Now , excuse me , I have a very heavy schedule . Quite a switch - Air Force colonel to film executive . - You must have your wires crossed . - Have I ? Mr Foster , let 's step into my office . - Some office . - It 's too big . Sparsely furnished , very hard to heat . But we won 't be disturbed . Oh , it 's ... soundproof , too . Look . Ten years ago , you were a colonel in the Air Force . A degree in astrophysics . Two years lunar research at MIT . A career officer . What happened ? The car crash made me want to change my career . - Why did it crash ? - A blowout . - On a Rolls Royce at 50mph ? - They don 't make the tyres . Why was the area cordoned off ? You 've read the report . A cabinet minister was killed . Security . - I don 't buy it , Straker . - I 'm not trying to sell anything . Look , sir . I 've been through a lot these last few weeks . First there was Kofax . I found a letter to you in his safe . Oh , that was innocent enough , but someone got at him . Then Jackson from the Military Investigation team . What happened to the film ? The film that showed the proof ? ( Fan roars ) The film that cost my copilot his life ? ! And those two boys who came to my apartment and bust it up ! I suppose they were sent to frighten me off . Where 's your evidence , Foster ? Just show me one thing . You 're saying Foster 's right and everyone else is wrong . What I 'm saying is that I 'm right . Oh , you 're wrong , Foster . You 're so wrong . Look , I don 't give up . I keep slinging the mud until some of it sticks ! You haven 't heard the last of this , Mr Film Executive Straker ! ( Fan slows and stops ) Things are not always what they seem , Mr Foster . An acoustic gun . It 's very clever . Place charges in the set wall , for example , load it with blanks and when you fire it the sound detonates the charges . Very realistic . You look surprised . I think we 've got a few more surprises for you . Let 's go . Open up . It 's all right , Miss Ealand . - So , you 're a test pilot . - That 's right . - Trained to expect the unexpected . - I guess so . Then brace yourself . Straker . 'Voice identification positive . Commander Straker . ' ( Lift machinery grinds ) Where are we ? The underground headquarters of SHADO . SHADO ? ( Indistinct announcements on PA ) OK , Alec . Wheel them in . So what happens now ? You were on a test flight over the North Atlantic , Foster . Due to a kind of dogged stupidity , you found yourself in the middle of a UFO incident . This is Colonel Freeman . Dr Frazer you already know . Hello , Foster . How are the eyes ? We induced a temporary blindness , just to keep you on ice a few days . Now , your boss , Kofax , knows nothing of all this . But he played along . He has his military contract to think of . Operatives Doug Jackson and Tsi Chan . Jackson 's a psychiatrist and interrogator . His report told me quite a lot about you . Yes . Determined , good logical thought pattern . A little headstrong . Louis Graham , electronics man . And he happens to be a pretty good construction manager as well . So you had the whole thing wrapped up from the start . Why the setup ? Why SHADO ? Why the secrecy ? You summed it up pretty well yourself . ( Foster ) ' I 'll give you a reason . Let 's say the authorities had proof , 'indisputable proof that UFOs had come to earth . 'What would be the result if it leaked out ? Mass hysteria . 'Terror . A breakdown of authority . ' - I said that in the apartment . - ' So , they issue a report ... ' ( Tape stops ) Hello , Paul . ( Straker ) Ah , the field leader of Project Foster , Operative Janna Wade . It 's all been a test for you , Foster . You followed a predictable set of clues , showed a certain initiative . But basically , it was an inevitable chain that led you to the studio . Thank you . No , stay , Alec . You realise , of course , that we can never let you go free . You know too much . There is one way . SHADO needs men . I 'm talking about leaders , commanders . Men able to captain the world 's most advanced submarines , take control of Moonbase . The right men . Are you one , Foster ? After the stiffest medical you 've ever experienced , after weeks of computer and psychoanalytic tests , after a training course tears your guts out , you might be halfway there . Well , I 'd like to try . I thought you would . Read this . " Foster , Paul J. 804 . " ( Intercom buzzes ) He 's all yours , Alec . Straker . Yes , yes , I 'll speak to him . Would you get me Moonbase , please ? And where are those transit reports ? Would you get this please and get it good and clear ? Immediately means now . Right .

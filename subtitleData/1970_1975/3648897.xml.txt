 - Zap ! Got ya ! - Stop it , Billy ! Stop it ! Come back to bed and go to sleep . Stop it , Billy . I 'm afraid . Billy , will you stop trying to scare me ! - What 's the matter , Billy ? - Watch out , Sis ! What 's the matter , Billy ? - What 's going on here , Billy ? - I told you , hush up ! Hey , Billy , this is all wet here . Smells like kerosene . Mommy ! Daddy ! Mommy , wake up . Father ? Mommy , wake up ! Mommy ? Father ! Damn fire siren . What fire siren ? That fire siren . Don 't hear a thing . You ... are sabotaging ... the Evans City Volunteer ... Fire Department . Uh , didn 't the doctor say something about moderation ? What does he know ? He knows ... What a shameless , lustful woman you are , my dear . And he doesn 't want us to hurt the baby . Oh . Well , we 're gonna have to be careful . Anyhow , I have a feeling that if anything happened to this baby ... you wouldn 't marry me . I wouldn 't take a chance like that . Oh , now that 's a hell of a thing to say . I 'm marrying you , not the baby . Would you believe I don 't want you to go ? Hey , where you goin ' ? David , I 've gotta answer the phone . What phone ? Okay . I 'll make you a deal . I won 't answer the phone if you don 't go to the fire . Deal . Go on . Geez . Hello . God , that 's awful . Sure , I can come down immediately . Yes , Doctor . - What 's that all about ? - The fire , it 's at the dairy farm . - Mitchell 's ? - Mm-hmm . Yeah , those poor kids . They 're both burned pretty bad . They 're going to bring them into Dr. Brookmyre 's office ... until we can get an ambulance in from Unity . Evans City Fire Hall . Where 's it at ? I didn 't hear the code . That 's the old dairy farm . Must be pretty bad . I could see the flames clear over at my place . Hey , Clanker ! See the soldiers ? - Soldiers ? - Couple truckloads of ' em . Hmm . Poor schmucks . Wonder what they 're doing here . Evans City Base , off and clear . Is Dan here yet ? Didn 't see him . What 's everybody looking so happy about ? Give me a smoke . - Don 't it bother you , dragging ' out like this ? - Somethin ' to do . Good morning there , Judy . The Evans City Volunteer Fire Department apologizes for dragging you out of bed this way . - You got a bad mouth , Clank . - Yeah ? You 're late . I was the first one here . David , be careful , please . I will . Don 't worry about him . I won 't let him do anything dumb , even though I still think you picked the wrong guy . You 're a slob , Clanker . Ain 't no girl gonna pick you . I 'm gonna break your head . - Aw , ain 't that cute ? - Shut up and drive . Where 's Dr. Brookmyre ? Are you the nurse ? Who are you ? Where 's Dr. Brookmyre ? - In the office with Major Ryder . - Major Ryder ? - How many syringes do you have ? - Look , what 's going on here ? Major Ryder will explain . We haven 't got time . Break out those syringes . We 're gonna need a lot of them . The girl just died . I think I can save the boy . Move , Nurse ! - You 've known about this for days . - We never thought it would happen . - But you notified me ! You must have suspected ! - Notifying you was precautionary . We never thought it was possible . We 've got to call the hospital in Unity ! We need an ambulance for those kids ! I 'm afraid I can 't allow that . We 're bringing in our own medical personnel with emergency equipment . - But this isn 't the sort of thing - - Look , we 've quarantined the area . We 're sealing off the town . - Have you got Colonel Peckem yet ? - Yeah . Uh , get Dr. Brookmyre a gas mask . Yes , sir . Yes , sir , they 're certain . They have three cases reported . They 're waiting for verifying blood tests . We 'll need somebody from Trixie on the spot . Is that being taken care of ? I 'm leaving for the airstrip now . I should be in Evans City within two hours . Who knows about this ? Press blackout ? Yes , sir , we 'll button it up . I 'll be available by radio on the plane , and I 'll report in from Evans City . All right , sir . Give me Major Ryder on 2C , please . Major Ryder , have you set up a perimeter around the town ? Do the best you can . Three more companies are on their way . They may get in there before I do . In the meantime , try to set up some kind of a perimeter . Nobody gets in or out of that town . Now , is that clear ? This is a blackout situation , so from here on in we 're using voiceprint checks for all communications . You don 't talk to me or anybody else unless you got a voiceprint check . That 's the order of the day . Go on , fellas , bring the hose here . We need a lot of slack . You may want an air mask . Easy . Easy ! Sheriff , what the hell 's going on ? What do you think , you lunkhead ? There 's a house burning . - No , no , what 's this about the soldiers ? - Okay , let 's move it . Clear the area around the house and let it burn out . We could still save a good part of it . Just get the lead out of your ass and do something to help . I want them trees down over the garage . I don 't want them trees goin ' up . There 's a chain saw over by the wagon . What the hell ? Get that fireman by that window there ! - He just went crazy . He set that fire himself . His wife 's dead . He killed her . When Mac and I first came here , he was laughing like a hyena . Then all of a sudden , like as if he had realized what he had done , he started to cry like a baby . Look out the car in there ! It 's gonna blow up ! Come on , man ! Attaboy ! Go in through that window ! Come on , through the window ! Oh , my trees ! My trees ! They 're all gonna go ! Uh , that is correct . With the ultraviolet light operative , there is no need for your masks . We want all medical personnel to wear their masks at all times , however , and any civilian volunteers . You will need masks outside the protected area , Looks good . Looks good . But in the ultraviolet , we 're considering it safe without a mask . How much serum do we have ? Not very much , I 'm afraid . Boy , you people sure come prepared , don 't you ? Everything 's on its way , Doctor . I mean , I can 't snap my fingers and make it appear ! In a couple of hours we 'll have everything we need . It 's not a cure . Just a strong antibiotic to build up resistance . Sir , Company " A " has arrived with the rest of the radio gear . Where do you want it installed ? Set it up here . This 'll be temporary headquarters . Sir , need a deployment for Company " B. " Where do you want this box ? Put it over there . - Grab this one . - I 'll do it . Somebody give me a hand , will ya ! What the heck they gonna do with all this ? What 's happening ? Listen to me and don 't talk . There 's a quarantine on the town . Everything 's going to be all right . I just don 't want you and the baby exposed . Exposed to what ? Just listen and don 't say anything . It 's a highly contagious virus . We 're expecting several cases of it by morning . I just don 't want you around here . You 're gonna need me . I need you like a hole in the head . - We 've got a whole army medical unit on the way . - What 's the army do - Will you listen to me ? They 're not going to want me to let you go , so you 're going to have to sneak out . Okay , try this one ! I want you to take a syringe and some antibiotic for David . You have to stay in town , so find David and the two of you stay away from people . Get this one over here ! Dr. Brookmyre , I think we should discuss larger facilities . If this thing gets any worse , we 're gonna need someplace to set up an infirmary . Nurse , I 'd like you to work with my doctor there . The men that haven 't been inoculated are gonna need their shots when they report in . Nurse , we need more needles ! These men with the ultraviolet need shots ! Follow doctor 's orders . What 's all this stuff for ? So we can get in and out of here . Over here . Over here ! All right . Got it . Burn a little ? Yes , ma 'am . You 're okay . Thank you , ma 'am . Get out of the way ! I 've got things to do ! - Come on , move your legs ! - All right , all right . Spend all day and night around here . Start moving your ass and unpack this stuff . This is headquarters now . Major Ryder , you said you wanted to discuss larger facilities . Maybe we could set something up at the high school . How do you intend to let the people know about all this ? How ? Well , we 've been promised bullhorns and loudspeakers . No telling when they 're gonna arrive ! Hey ! Wait ! Hey ! Hey ! Stop ! You can 't - Hey , hey , hey ! Twenty-five minutes before the hour of 10 : 00 . This is Bob Lee till 12 : 00 . News and sports is in 25 . The weather forecast for the western Pennsylvania area - cloudy and cool tonight with a 60 % chance of rain . Come on ! Let me see them asses move . We ain 't done yet . Move it ! Move it ! Somebody can 't find nothin ' to do ! - It 's about time you got here . - Sheriff , they 're setting up roadblocks . - What ? - Out on the interstate ramps . They got one up over on I-80 too . What the hell gives here ? I don 't know . They 're making an announcement at church services tonight . All hell 's broke loose in town . Nobody knows what 's going on . We 're up to our asses in soldiers . What are you talking about ? Where is that major ? At the doctor 's office . They 're setting up their gear there . They 'll be headquartering over there . - Brookmyre 's office ? - Yeah . They 're giving the soldiers some kind of injection . - They say there 's not enough for the town . - Injections ? What the hell is this about ? I don 't know . Stoney said he 'd seen a truckful of ' em going through town . Truckful , hell . Must be a couple hundred . - Couple of hundred ? - Just get your butts back after that fire . What the hell 's going on , Sheriff ? You 'll know when I do , boy . Let 's go . What do you think , old buddy ? Judy 's at Brookmyre 's . I got the wheels if you want to bust in and find out what 's up . Let 's go . Saturday night service is a high mass . Yes , Father . We 'll try not to disturb it any more than necessary . - Perhaps after the mass I could ask the people to wait . - No , Father , I have to insist . We need to inform the people . I 've got to make this announcement . Excuse me , Father , but we have the authority to do this with or without your approval . You 're aware of the plane crash last week . Yes . That plane contained an experimental vaccine . We are afraid that crash may have caused the spread of an infectious virus ... through this area . We can 't give a story to the press yet . We 've got to see what develops . We need some medium for reaching the people in that town . It 's bad enough we didn 't have adequate supplies ready . It 'll all be under control within a few more hours . A few more hours ? That can be disastrous . You put martial law on a town , drive a sneak perimeter around ' em like that , and you 're just polarizing the situation . That army becomes an invasionary force . Those people are gonna resist . We 're all concerned with Evans City , Mr. Hawks , but our primary consideration at this point is national security . All the citizens are being rounded up . We 've got to get them together in a central area . That 'll solve the communications problem and check any possible spread of the virus . Telephone and telegraph are cut off except inside the Evans City limits . They 've jammed the air to prevent any ham stuff from going out . You 've got to get the president on the phone . We 've got to get a nuclear weapon in the air above that town . - Isn 't that a little drastic ? - None of us wants to resort to that . But we 've got to be ready . If Trixie jumps that perimeter , this thing could spread over the entire continent . All right . Get me the president . We 'll recommend that he - Instruct SAC to send a plane ... on a training mission over Evans City . Find out what size weapon it should carry to ... burn out the infected area . - Any report from Trixie ? - They haven 't rounded up the entire team yet , sir . But several of the ones they reached are already airborne . They 're on their way to Fort Dietrich . We need somebody from that team in Evans City , damn it ! Well , Trixie was going to recommend a man . Oh , the hell with that ! Get the first Trixie man that arrives ! - It 's a mistake . - Have a plane at Dietrich and get him on it ! - One of the biggest goddamn boners of all time ! - The first man . You understand ? - Dietrich ? - Don 't even bother to check him in . We 're not to even check you in , sir , just get you on that plane . What 's going on ? Look , I 'm a key man on the Trixie team . A key man ! I 'm one of the developers of the goddamn thing ! I gotta have access to a lab . Gotta have access to my computers . Our orders are to get the first man on the team in the field , sir . Jesus Christ , this is so random ! A lousy technician is what you need out there ! Fly me out to Evans City and you 're tying my hands ! Don 't you see that ? I don 't have access to that equipment , I 'm useless ! You 'll have to clear this with command . - Don 't you realize the consequences ? Soldier , stop the car . - I 'm sorry , sir . Those are the orders . Orders , my ass ! Stop the car ! You 're gonna have a hell of a time getting me on that plane , soldier . Maybe so , sir , but we 'll do it . It 's the last we have . Aw , come on ! Can I have a hand over here ? Goddamn voiceprint check is a waste of valuable time . We gotta make snap decisions . If I can 't get through to you without a five-minute delay - I gotta authorize all these decisions on my own . I don 't like the position it puts me in . I know , I know . I know Peckem will be here , but until then I 'm in charge . I don 't like being a brass asshole . I 'm not an infantry man . I 'm Chem Corp. Remember that ? You don 't know what it 's like out there . How can I hold the perimeter and fight a small-scale war at the same time ? I need those additional men ! Many of the people in the outlying area are farmers , and they 've got weapons . You expect us to lock up our end , huh ? Well , what about your end , damn it ? All right . I 'll see what we can do . They 're meeting with more resistance , and they 've run into a few more cases of infection . Major Ryder 's requesting more men . I 'll wait for Colonel Peckem 's evaluation . - Sir , if - - Peckem 'll be in there by 2 : 00 . They can hold out till then . - We have a man in there telling us that maybe they can 't . - Oh , come on , Frank ! This is highly organized , riot-trained army . You can 't tell me that they 're unable to hold the perimeter ... on a small town through early morning . Please ! Listen up ! Listen up ! Town is under quarantine . We have you all under martial law . We 'll take you all over to the high school . We 'll explain it to you over there . Everybody out ! Everybody out ! What is this ? - The place is under emergency - - Get out ! Wait ! Wait ! I want a lawyer ! Mommy , Mommy , what 's happening ? Come with us , ma 'am . Now , hold on , fellas . Just what 's going on here ? - We 're not going no place till we know more about this ! It 's the lights ! Where 's Mommy ? My mother ! Get out ! It 's my mother ! Tell me what this is all about , and maybe I 'll cooperate with you ! What 's going on ? Let go ! Please tell me what you 're doing ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! No ! I 'm not going ! Larry ! - Hey ! What 's going on here ? - For God 's sake - - Where are we going ? - I want my doll . Here , sweetie . What 's going on ? Let me go ! Come on ! Come here , little fella . Sir , come with us ! What 's going on ? Hey , leave her alone ! Hold it ! Leave her alone ! - Don 't give me that shit , boy . - That 's all right , soldier . That 's right . 0900 . Check . Now , you listen to me , Ryder . Buck 's been telling me what 's going on here tonight . I don 't mind telling you we 're mighty tired of being pushed around like this . Yes , sir , I know . We 've just had no way of preparing anybody for this kind of thing . It just kinda snowballed on us and we were forced to take action . You said it would never come to this ! Look , we 've cooperated with you . We 've attempted to keep this thing quiet in order not to create a panic . But , Christ , we never expected this ! Neither did we ... sir . We 're trying to get everyone into the high school . We 're setting up an infirmary there . - Are we under martial law ? - Yes , sir . Well , let me tell you something . You just can 't walk all over the people of Evans City that easy , Major . And as mayor of this town , I 'm protesting your action . In fact , I 'd like to speak to somebody higher up . Yes , sir . I 'm Colonel Peckem . Good evening . Major Ryder ? Yes , sir . I assume we don 't need the masks in the ultraviolet . That 's correct , sir . I 'll be with you gentlemen in just a minute . I want to speak with Major Ryder and find out exactly what 's been happening . Major ? Yes , sir . Right this way . I 'll be a son of a bitch . You don 't smoke , you bastard . No . Where am I gonna get me some smokes ? - Hey , Clanker , that 's Judy . - Sure it 's her ? Yes , I 'm sure . She 's heading out to the fire . You sure ? Yes , I 'm sure , damn it ! Hey , be cool , buddy . We 'll get her . Rainy and 65 outside the Big " K " studios . - She 's giving it more gas . - She doesn 't know it 's us . It 's 10 minutes before midnight . Almost time for headlines with Bob Brewster . This is Bob Lee . Judy ! What ? What ? Come over to the van . Move it back . Move out . - What 's all this about ? - We 're rounding everybody up and taking them to the high school . What about my car ? Don 't worry . We 'll take care of it . David , I feel stupid . Stupid ! Shh . You didn 't know it was us . - Come on . Get up . - Will you tell us what 's going on ? - Let 's see it ! - Look , I 'm a nurse . - What is it ? - I 'm a nurse , I work for Dr. Brookmyre . I 'm supposed to inoculate - No , it 's for him . Get in the truck . Come on . Come on ! Hey , wait . You 're clean . Let 's go . Come on . Hey , no problem . Okay , in the truck . In the truck . No problem , man . Look , I 'm not causing any problems . In the truck . In the truck . Yet . Mothers . - Who 's all here ? - Artie Fulton . My daughter 's with me . - I heard you said you were Dr. Brookmyre 's nurse . - Yes . I 'm the appendectomy . The emergency appendectomy at Christmastime ? Kathy ? You okay ? Yes . Okay . - Who else is in here ? - That 's Frank Winston . - I don 't know what 's wrong with him . He seems to be sick . - Know anything about what 's going on ? We were asleep and they dragged us right out of the house . It 's a quarantine . What ? It 's a quarantine on the town . Some kind of virus . What about the soldiers ? I don 't know . - Said he 'd send a medical team . - We heard some shooting . - What kind of virus ? Do you know what it is ? - Brookmyre just said it was highly contagious . - And it 's dangerous . - Maybe that 's what he 's got . Winston ! Oh , Daddy , I 'm all r - - We heard there were roadblocks up . - The military 's involved . This must really be big . David , I 'm scared . It 's all right . It 's all right , honey . Man , ain 't this some shit . Grab this one . I got it . Did you get this one over here ? Yeah , I 'll get it . I want to set up a second perimeter . The inside line will continue to move in toward the downtown area , bringing everything they find with them . I want the second perimeter two miles inside the first . This two-mile stretch 'll be called , uh , a no-man 's land . Nothing can stay on it . No one can cross it . - You 're talking about an awful lot of men , sir . - We 'll just have to get them in here . What do we have now ? Five companies . Why did this get down to the last minute ? These deployments should have been ready ! Well , the initial information was that the vaccine was harmless . You mean they didn 't take any precautionary action ? Routine procedure . I got here the day of the crash . Plane went down in these hills above the town . Investigators reported that the casings wound up in the river . Apparently the water flows through an underground reservoir ... and Evans City is supplied with artesian systems out of that . So I stayed in town , notified the police and the town doctor ... to be on the alert for any high-fever symptoms or delirium . Sir , the report was that the Trixie team had deactivated the vaccine . Major , Trixie wasn 't developed as a vaccine . Trixie was developed as a bacteriological weapon . Comm Central calling Colonel Peckem . Comm Central , Colonel Peckem . - This is Peckem . - Sir , we have completed your voiceprint check . That 's why the blackout . I knew the blackout was to avoid embarrassment , but a bioweapon never occurred to me . I fell for that story hook , line and sinker . That was the idea . Uh , Colonel Peckem - No , no , no , his first name . Uh , Christopher . Chris . Chris . This is Brubaker , Chris . Glad you 're there . Major Ryder 's a competent man and a good officer , but I get the feeling he 's hitting the panic button too prematurely . - Mr. Brubaker - - You want a real evaluat - Mr. Brubaker . What it 's really like out there - Mr. Brubaker , we 're running out of time ! If you want me to get the job done , you get me the stuff I need and get it before the morning 's over ! Let us move over to the high school ! - We haven 't got the room here to handle this ! - They 're clearing the infirmary area , sir . We 'll move over there as soon as they complete disinfecting . I 've heard that for the last three hours ! " Equipment and personnel are on their way ! " Why can 't we call Unity ? If we can 't go out , surely we can let them in . We need that equipment ! I 'm sorry , sir . We can 't let them in . We don 't know how long this quarantine will be in effect . We 're talking about the lives of the citizens of this city ! We 're also talking about the lives of many of our own men , sir ! Your men are your worry , Sergeant ! The people of this town are my worry ! Message for Major Ryder sir . Major Ryder 's in with Colonel Peckem . I 'll take it . Heavy assembly , sir , at the interstate highway . One of the trucks blew up with masks and filters . We have a lot of men hurt . - Any civilian casualties ? - Three dead , sir . Now , you just listen to me , mister . In addition to being mayor of this town , I also happen to be a practicing attorney . I know the rights of civil law . Sergeant , I want a weapons search of the entire town . That 's stores included . Confiscate everything . Just a minute ! I 'm demanding a writ of habeas corpus . Sheriff , I 've gotta take your weapons . Now , you just hold on ! Don 't you give ' em to him . You don 't have to ! - Soldier . - Look , you just can 't push us around this way ! Don 't you do it , Bucky ! What the hell is going on here anyway ? Sheriff , you 're in a hopeless situation . Don 't make us use force . - Let 's go . - What we 're doing here is for the g - - Let 's get the hell outta here ! - Watch it ! - Every civilian weapon inside the perimeter area . I want every damn civilian weapon in the entire perimeter . Do you understand ? Right away - Jesus Christ . Colonel ! Colonel Peckem , please , sir ! This is exactly the kind of thing we 're trying to prevent ! You ain 't taking ' me no place ! Take cover ! Oh , man , this isn 't getting anywhere ! Hey , he 's shootin ' at us , Burns ! - Son of a bitch shooting ' at us ! - Get in here , boy . Come on ! Get down ! Return fire ! Okay , hold your fire ! All right , let 's check it out ! Move in ! Remember , he ain 't hit until I see him hit ! Keep away from me . Keep away from me . I 'll kill y - Lunatic , man . Take a look at this , man . Miss ? A recital . Place sure is a loony bin . No wonder they want us to round ' em all up . Look . Check it out upstairs . Ma 'am ? Is that - that there your husband downstairs ? Oh , Jesus . Oh , Jesus Chri-Jesus ! Can 't breathe . I 'm bleedin ' bad . - Ma 'am ? - Hello . I 'm bleedin ' bad ! I 'm bleedin ' ! I 'm bleedin ' ! - Maybe we 're in some kind of war . - Shut up a minute ! More shooting . We 're in the middle of something . Them boys ain 't playing games . Check out the people ! Come on , let 's move ! Stop , or I 'll shoot ! Come on , let 's go ! You two ! Lets go , mister ! Get back here , or we 'll shoot ! I 'm scared ! No ! Thiryt-five cents a gallon . Fifty-eight cents . Goddamn it , what 's going on ? What 's happening ? I said , what 's going on ? Give me a fuckin ' answer ! Come on ! Come on , soldier ! Soldier ! Stay with me ! What 's going on ? - David , come on ! - Hey , man ! - Hey ! Soldier ! - What 's going on ? Tell me what 's happening ! - David ! Come on ! Soldier , why are you here ? Tell me ! - Come on , soldier ! - David , please ! Crazy fuckers . I think you 're all crazy . Every one of you . Pretty funny , you think , huh ? That isn 't the army . - Pull out of there ! Let 's go ! You knew who the people were . Go on ! Take off ! David , the hypodermic ! Check those two guys out over there . Hey , they 're gone ! - They 're in the van ! They took off in the van ! - Welcome , brothers ! Get that guy out of the gas station . They took - They took off ! Hey , buddy ! We lost ' em ! - Where you headin ' ? - I don 't know ! Try the hills by the country club ! Maybe we can hole up there ! I got ya , boss ! No , it only affects primates . At least we don 't have to worry about its being spread by dogs or cats . Whatever consolation that may be to you . Unless there are any pet monkeys hereabouts , the only ones infected will be human beings . If we catch it in the early stages , can it be reversed ? Oh , we searched for an antidote the three years that project was in existence , Doctor . No dice . How many are based in the area , Sergeant ? Don 't know . They haven 't called me . - Dr. Watts , I thought you - - I haven 't even been able to call any commanders yet . They told me I could use the radio on the plane , but it wasn 't piped through your alternate network . We 're using the alternates to avoid any chance of a leak . Ah , yes . Precious security . Keep it under wraps at all costs . Meanwhile , do you realize the blunder that 's been made ? We can have you flown back as soon as we run a compete med check and get a clearance from Washington . - Let 's get started . - We don 't have all our equipment in yet . Beautiful . And when 'll that be ? As soon as possible . Appropriately vague , Colonel . Look , it 's you think boys who created this thing in the first place . Oh , that 's beautiful . I 'm one of the only chances we have . I can 't get back to a lab because you 're not equipped to run a medical check , which we wouldn 't need in the first place if I hadn 't been packed off here ! The whole operation is one fat blunder ! You talk about blunders . According to the report from your team , the virus was considered inactive . " Considered . " Yes . That 's the important word . Any man on the team will tell you that means 99 % , maybe . That 's a standard we don 't set , Colonel . That 's set by the military . - We 're not getting anywhere trying to assign blame . - Then authorize me back to the lab ! I can 't take a chance on breaking the perimeter with somebody that might be a carrier . Trixie has been in these waters for six days ! Some truck driver could have taken it out of here long before you set up that perimeter . We 're going under the assumption we 've got it contained . We 're gonna keep it contained until it runs its course . - Runs its course ? - You said it can 't stay active in the ultraviolet light . It 's in the water , man ! Underground ! It 's obviously in people too . People are vectors . They carry it about with them unawares . The incubation period may vary , Colonel , but ultimately Trixie is going to spread throughout this entire town ! - The town is sealed off . - Oh , Colonel . Look , shortly before the funds ran out , two of my technicians caught this bug from a rhesus monkey . One of them was delirious for two days before he finally died . The other phased in and out until he finally went hopelessly mad . Those are the two ultimate effects of this thing . It 's not just gonna run its course and be forgotten . How are you guys gonna explain away a town ... that 's either wiped out or reduced to mindlessness ? What is this , another piece of information they forgot to pass on to you guys ? Oh , gentlemen , we 're not dealing with a flu virus here . We 're dealing with an often lethal , always debilitating encephalitic mutation . It leaves its victims either dead or incurably mad . You got that ? What are you doing ? Nitwit . Somebody 's gonna see you out there . Christ . I didn 't mean to hurt you . I know . It 's not you . It 's not what you did . You 're nice . I like you very much . - Man - - I 'm sorry for being such a little girl . It 's okay . I understand . I mean , I - I knew that people die . Yeah ? You know , I knew people died . My father - Your father ? You understand ? It 's like , uh , all - all these people ... dying and , uh , my father ... can 't feel that . You can . I know you can . I - I have it , don 't I ? I have the disease . Man , you 'd better take care of your daughter , ' cause she 's in pretty bad shape . Hey , reveille , buddy . We gonna move ? We 'll be right up . Hey , I found some cigarettes , man . I had to break a machine open . There 's all kinds of goodies around this place . - Any food ? - Yeah , food and drink . - Just don 't get yourself tanked . - No , I 'm just warming up . Hey , you still figure we should try to get out ? I don 't know , man . These new two are gonna slow us up , buddy . That chick 's got the bug . I gotta think about it . - Hey , I came up with a radio . - What 'd it say ? Anything about what 's going on ? No , just , uh , music . It 's really weird . Yeah . We 'll be up in a minute . Hey , if that chick 's got the bug , we could catch it from her , right ? It depends on what it is . Well , it 's a bug . We could catch it , can 't we ? We 'll be up in a minute . Yeah , okay . I mean , it 's just ... a little ol ' bug , right ? Can 't be much - Clank , would you leave us alone for a minute ? Okay . Okay , buddy . You know , the whole time I was in ' Nam I figured you were old Clank 's girl . I never could figure that out . I hardly even knew him . Well , I didn 't know that . I saw you with him . When ? At one of the games . Good God , David . I mean , big Clank ? How could you even think that ? Well , I didn 't know . I figured , big football hero . And I didn 't really know you . I didn 't know what you were like . It wasn 't my fault . Action and adventure . Evans City 's only Green Beret . Oh , hear ! Hear ! Christ . I can 't believe that was me . We 're gonna be all right . I 'll work on natural immunity . A million to one against developing any foreign antidote in time . Sergeant , you get your ass out from behind your desk , quit calling me on the telephone and telling me what you can 't do and get that equipment on the double ! You understand me ? We 're working off the census . Inside the white perimeter - 3,613 . We 've got about - Wait a minute . Say that again , Chris . Three-six-one-three . Three-six ... We 've got about two-thirds of the population accounted for . One-three . We 've got an open revolt . It 's turning into a war zone . Wait a minute . We gotta get them into that high school . Chris , make that your main objective at this point . Understand ? Just don 't let those perimeters break . The perimeters are holding , but we 've got about 50 square miles of woods and hills that we 've still gotta cover . What 's your estimates , Chris ? How much time ? I can 't tell you how long it 's gonna take . We talking about hours , days , or what ? Give me a ballpark . I just can 't . All right , all right , keep it locked up , and let us know as soon as you do . Standing order , Chuck . Get this out . Anyone obviously infected or resisting is to be treated as an enemy , with the ultimate objective to bring them in at any cost . Yes , sir . Chuck . - Yes , sir ? - We 've gotta burn the bodies . - Sir - - I 'll listen to any alternatives , soldier , but until I hear a good one you burn them . " A " Company reports two men possibly infected . Sir , the men are getting panicky . Some of the men haven 't even been told why they 're here . Of course not , Major . That would just constitute a security leak . One of the objectives is to keep this thing quiet , yes . But the main objective is to keep the virus contained . If those men know the truth , they 'll be breaking the perimeter themselves . - How can you tell ? - What ? Don 't you see ? The whole thing 's insane . How can you tell who 's infected and who isn 't ? - They can 't get the helicopters in here for another 15 or 20 hours . - Goddamn it ! There 's a police bird and two city-owned choppers out at the community field . Get them in the air ! - What sort of authorization will I need ? - Anything ! Use your rifle if necessary . I want them in the air , inside the perimeter , radio-linked with the ground . Report anything they spot , and keep circling the no-man 's-land day and night . Anyone in that area gets one warning shot . - Sir - - Is that clear ? One warning shot . What 's going on at Trixie ? Take ' em upwards of days just to reprogram all that data , Colonel . Until then , we won 't even be able to re-create the virus itself . And afterwards , with the incubation period , my guess is a good week to infect a new set of monkeys . We have got to start taking blood samples , and we 've got to start flying them out to Dietrich so they can at least have a sample of the active virus . We can 't send anything out . We 've got human guinea pigs here . Over 3,000 shots at finding an immune , but we 've go to start taking blood and we 've got to start flying it out . - We can 't send anything out yet . - Can 't you see - What do you want to do , send 'em out in empty pop bottles ? We need airtight canisters . I 've requested them along with the other decontamination gear . I don 't mean to jump on you , Colonel . It just amazes me at how shoddy this operation is . Nothing amazes me anymore , Doctor . Nothing in this goddamn army amazes me . I 'm a combat man . I shouldn 't even be here . Just happened to be available . Maybe expendable . I 'll get your samples out to Dietrich . In the meantime , why don 't you get off your ass and start collecting them ? - Well , does that high school have a chem lab ? - Yes , sir . - I 'm gonna need some things . - Medical will set you up . - Can I have a radio put in over there ? - Man needs a radio , soldier . Man needs a radio . I need a - Man needs a radio . Will be tested and treated for the virus . Do not resist . They are preventive measures to ensure your survival of the epidemic . Repeat - Twenty . Twenty . Very good . I 'm gettin ' out of here ! I 'm gettin ' out of here - Outta here ! Get outta here ! I 'm getting out of here ! Maybe we 're doing the wrong thing . Maybe we should go back to the van and try to get back into town . - The army may just be here to help . - The man thinks the army is our friend . I just don 't know that we 're doing the right thing . - Yeah , well , ask Sheriff Cooper . - Whatever they 're here for , it 's turned into a riot . Maybe they are just here for control . If they can turn a campus protest into a shooting war . Some of the rednecks that live in this area , they could be shooting at each other and not even care why . So whatever 's going on , we 're better off away from it . That ain 't saying you can 't go back , buddy . What about the virus ? Kathy is acting strangely . For all we know , we may all have been exposed . We may need medical attention . I 've been thinking . Maybe somebody 's hitting us with bacteriological weapons or something . Maybe we are in a war . I just wanna be sure that we 're doing the right thing . Well , we can 't be sure , damn it ! Brookmyre told Judy to keep isolated . That 's good enough for me . You can go back to town if you want to . The army ain 't nobody 's friend , man . We know . We been in . I don 't know about you , but , uh ... I 'm gonna stick it out with David . 'Cause he 's gonna make it . He 's got a brain . The church is a holy sanctuary ! These people have sanctuary ! Leave them alone ! Leave them alone ! Sanctuary ! Okay , let 's go . God is with us ! Come on ! Move ! In ! Everybody ! Come on , in , in ! In there ! Father ! Father David ! Let 's go ! There goes a couple of ' em ! Shit . Mommy ! I 'm all right . She 's all right . She 's upset , that 's all . It 's funny . We 're all upset . She 'll be all right when we leave here . She 'll be all right . Isn 't it ? - How far you figure it is to Saunders ' farm ? - Couple miles , maybe . Well , they can 't have every inch covered . All those woods . There are ravines behind Saunders ' . If we can get through it all , it 's there . Hey , Dave , I think we better shake them . Shh ! I 'm telling you , that chick 's out of her head . - Shut up , man . Listen . - What ? Get down , man ! Out of sight ! Shit ! He spotted us . We gotta break through the woods . We 're gonna break through the woods ! If we get split up , we 'll meet at Saunders' place . We won 't get away from that bird , man . We can 't sit here ! Stop where you are . We have you spotted . Stop where you are or we 'll open fire . We 'll be forced to open fire on you . Stop where you are . We have you spotted . We 're in communication with the jeeps . We 're in communication with the ground troops . You cannot escape . Stop where you are or we 'll be forced to open fire . I 'll try to keep the damn thing away so maybe we can duck it . Stay put ! Bums ! Hey ! I told you , Dave . Hey , Dave ! You 're forgettin ' about the infantry . Let 's go . The crazies in here are detained , but they might not be infected . Keep them somewhere else . Keep ' em isolated . Yes , sir . We 're using the gymnasium for any consulting . Take her blood pressure . I 'll need a hand with this . Got a blood pressure yet ? 124 over 67 . All right , keep checking . Get it off of me ! Get it off ! He 's arresting . Come on . Let 's go . Get another nurse over here , will you , please . These goddamn things returned . - Don 't you med guys have anything more powerful than this ? - No , sir . - Hey , uh , Elly ? - Yes ? I 'm not getting any further on that formula . For Christ sake . It 's in the written records . We can 't read the microfilms manually , Elly . We 're gonna have to wait until it 's all in the computer . Once it 's all back in the computer , we can have it in a matter of seconds . But it won 't be all in the computer for three days ! We 'll just have to try all the combinations . You gotta get a sample flown out to us . Lots of luck . Say again . I 'm not reading you , Elly . I said I 'll see what I can do . Give me Peckem . Yes , sir . To Colonel Peckem 's headquarters . We 'll have to have your voiceprint . Christ sake ! He 's only down the street from me . I just left him ! We 'll need to check it , sir , if it 's to go through the network . We 'll have to do a recording . Here , you run this over to Peckem . To Colonel Peckem , sir ? Tell Peckem without those samples , Dietrich might as well close down . If he still refuses to send them out , have him call Dietrich himself and explain it . But get him the hell off my back ! Yes , sir . I 'll try . On that voiceprint , sir , will you state your name and I.D. ? Stick it up your big , fat , electronic ass ! What 's the matter with you , woman ? Ultraviolet 's not infallible when you 're working this closely with it . - So put your mask back on . - As you have discovered , Doctor , it 's very difficult looking into a microscope when you 're wearing a mask . Just how would you rate our chances , Doctor ? - Do you have any family outside ? - What ? Do you have any family outside ? No , sir . Me neither . I 'm sorry , sir . Would you marry me ? I assume from that answer that you rate our chances as good . No , next week . Of course right now ! - That 's army issue , Doctor ! Army issue ! - All right , where is she ? - Doctor Brookmyre 's nurse , sir . - He sent her out ! He sent her out with these ! - What happened , Major ? - Apparently , Dr. Brookmyre sent his nurse out with some of the antibiotics . When was this ? Early last night , just after things started . - We recovered the materials , sir , when they were captured . - " They ? " Yes , sir . There were several of them . At least there were . They got away last night in one of the vans . The van was found , but there was no sign of anyone . - This is army issue ! Army issue ! - Take Dr. Russell to the infirmary . Run a check on him . - Yes , sir . - This is army issue ! There 's no requisition ! This is - This is army issue ! You know if your nurse was exposed to any infected cases ? Very briefly . We had the two children here . Why in the hell did you send her out ? - She 's - She 's pregnant . I was afraid for the child . I sent her with some antibiotic for the father . They 're gonna be married . We 're only doing what we have to do to ensure survival . - I got a message from Colonel Peckem ! I got a message from Colonel Peckem ! - Get in here ! Get in here , soldier . - I got a message - All right , keep down ! Troopers will knock your block off ! Goddamn it ! Give me another man in here ! Another guard ! - Get me " C " Detachment . Get me " C " Detachment ! Your voiceprints are - Survival ? What do you think , old buddy ? There 's four of ' em . That 's four we can see . Must be more inside . Why don 't we just scurry around and pass by ' em ? It 's almost dark . Let 's wait . We need information . Why don 't we just go down and talk to them ? - Get her ! Get her down ! - I really would like to talk . Clank ! Knock it off ! I got it ! All right ! Knock it off . Hey , look at that ! Right on , man ! That dude can 't shoot worth shit . Yeah , missed you by a mile . You mother . Hey , you son of a bitch . I ought to break your ass . Hey , Clanker . - What the hell 's the matter with you ? - I 'm sorry . I - - Thank you for goin ' out after her . - I was savin ' my ass , not hers . Next time I 'm gonna throw her out there and you with her ! That chick 's crazy , man . She 's got the bug . What you figure on doin ' tonight ? I figured I 'd be cleanin out this shit house . That 's about all you can figure in this army . I sure didn 't figure on this . Didn 't figure on what ? This . What ? This , uh , maneuver . But what is it ? Define it . Tell me what it 's all about . I don 't know , Sergeant . You never know what you 're doing or why you 're doing it . You just do it because you 're told to . Yeah . When are we movin ' out of here ? What , you in a hurry ? Me ? Well , relax . You 'll find this ploy somewhere in your manual , I 'm sure . It 's called " sit it out and let somebody else do the dirty work . " Right on . Move slow and easy . Keep 'em from hollerin ' . - Why take the risk ? - We 're doin ' this my way , you hear ? Just get ' em down , keep ' em quiet . When we get inside , don 't get trigger happy . We gotta find out what these guys know . Hey , man , I 'm with you . Okay . I 'll duck around over there . We 're not gonna find anything out here . That 's right . Thought I heard something . Come on now . It 's only a damn patrol . You make a noise and I 'll kill ya . How many men inside ? Three . You wouldn 't be lyin to me now , would ya ? What 's happened ? I don 't hear anything . Shh . It 's been a long time . I don 't hear anything . Quiet . Go for your guns and it 'll be the last thing you ever do . What 's going on here ? What are you doin ' to us ? What army are you with ? Why are you after us ? Okay , now listen to me ! I 'm listening to you . You make it fast ! What do you know ? Nothin ' . Okay , now listen . You let me go - Talk ! Okay . Okay . It 's a quarantine . There 's a virus loose in the area . How 'd the army get involved ? How 'd the army get involved in anything ? I don 't know ! I don 't know , man . Honest to God , I don 't know . It 's a police action . What are your orders ? Round up everybody . Take 'em to the high school . Everything was all right . People were comin ' in with us . They 're treating them at the school . The ones with the virus , man , it 's like they 're crazy . What kind of virus is it ? Oh , I don 't know . The army only tells us what they have to . It 's in the water . In the water ? Yeah . We 're following orders . I mean , I know where you 're at . This whole thing is like - No ! No more lies ! Hey , David . Green Beret . What happened to you , man ? That son of a bitch froze up . These folks is all mine . All three of ' em . All five of ' em . Hey , don 't give me any of this Green Beret shit ! I was just regular army . David ? They 're dead . They 're all dead . Claiming stuff . That son of a bitch , man . Slam ... right against the wall . Hey , man , you really messed up . Man , I thought that dude knew Special Forces . I figured he 's gotta be some kind of bad , right ? Some kind of bad . You know I could never make it . I never even came close to makin ' it . Regular army was all I ever was . Who turns out to be the baddest ? Single-handed ! I got five of them son of a bitches ! Hey , David . Why don 't you put me in for ... a Congressional Medal of Honor ? Hey ! Where you goin ' ? Uh , just goin ' up to see Judy . What ? It 's okay . I 'm just goin up to see Judy for a while . Oh , yeah . I know what you mean . It 's okay . We 'll be in the bedroom . Yeah . My head feels funny . - Did I do something wrong ? - You did what you had to do . Hey , I didn 't do anything wrong , did I ? No , no , it 's all right , Clanker . - Huh ? - It 's all right . You did what you had to do . Okay . I 'll take first watch , okay ? Good . Okay . I 'll see you later . She 's all I have left . My wife is dead - Mae . That 's my wife . She 's been dead a couple of years now . Kathy 's infected obviously . Artie 's acting weird . Even though Clank 's going , he 's fightin ' , but he 's losin ' . But not us . And God knows we 've been exposed to it . Well , I had that injection . Brookmyre said it wasn 't an antidote , just a strong antibiotic . - Maybe that 's enough . - You didn 't have your shot . But I feel all right . David , honey , it 's possible that you have a natural immunity to it . We still have to go away . Hey . We can make it . I know it . I haven 't allowed her to date yet . I don 't think she 's old enough to date yet . The way these kids are today , it 's disgusting . It 's disgusting ! These kids today , they 're pigs ! Not my little girl - No , sir . I 'll never let her get into that kind of trouble . I owe that much to Mae . I 'll never let her get into that kind of trouble . These kids today are pigs . Well , we can 't wait forever to break the story . I 'm for going with the radiation scenario . The thing is , we can release it now , and it covers us for any eventuality . But the onus on it . Sure , it 's embarrassing . But it 's not as embarrassing as bioweaponry . At least everybody knows we 've been using nuclear weapons . So we had an accident . We 'll blame it on A.E.C. But how do we release it now before we know ? We say there were nuclear weapons on the plane when it went down . If the perimeter doesn 't hold , we 're gonna have to go the whole way . We say there was a live weapon on the plane not destroyed when it went down . We got a team workin ' on it . If we have to push the button , we just say the ... weapon went off . For Christ sake ! We 're talking about one of our own towns and fifteen-hundred of our own troops . The town is already destroyed . If they can 't hold that perimeter , we 're lookin ' at the possibility of Trixie spreading across the entire country . You break that perimeter , then we gotta drop the bomb . Like immediately . And God knows I hope we don 't have to , but if we do , we - we gotta have some kind of explanation . I 'm just being realistic . The radiation scenario covers us . Vocom Central calling Mr. Brubaker . - This is Brubaker . Yes , sir , we 've completed your voiceprint check , and we have the president on the line . In a minute we 'll hook you in . - Mr. Brubaker , this is the president . - Yes , Mr. President . Give me your consensus on the press release . Nothing unanimous , sir . But there is a majority in favor of the radiation scenario . Safest , I suppose . Yes , sir . The bombers still up ? Round the clock , sir . Sixty thousand feet over Evans City . Thank you , Mr. Brubaker . Sir ? - Yes . - We 'd , uh , like to leave this line open , sir . If those perimeters break , we 'll have to act immediately . And we 'll , uh - We 'll need your permission , sir , to , uh , use the weapon . Uh , we want to leave the line open , sir , to , uh , avoid voiceprint delay . Sir ? The line will remain open , Mr. Brubaker . Mae ? Still mad ? I was only an hour late , hon . I thought of you all day . On the 15th hole . Ask Richard . He hit one 220 yards right down the middle . And I said - I said , " This one is for Mae . " I used a putter on the 18th hole . Well , he said it was a foot . It was more like three feet . Think I would know that . Sure rolled in . You 're safe , darling . Yeah ! What are you doing ? Don 't . You sick son of a bitch . Get up ! Talk to me about pigs ! What the hell were you doing ? The pig was screwing his own kind . Let me go ! Let me go ! Don 't do it , Clanker . Just don 't grab me like that , man . Okay , cool it . I 'm cold , man . Let 's get out of here . I used to think you had a brain , man . We should 've left them two ! We gonna leave ' em ? Yeah . We 'll leave ' em . Now you 're talkin ' . Now you 're talkin ' . Let 's get out of here . Let 's stay here . It 's too late for you . I 'm saying you 're screwed . And we pull out with one bullet . The pigs . As much as you can fly in . No contact . - Now you keep them up there . - Sure they 're not just out of your range ? Use what you have sparingly , but keep them up there . Yes , I know . - Running out of flares for the helicopters . - We got another missing patrol , sir . Lost radio contact . I want a man posted every 25 yards on that outside perimeter . Yes , sir ! And get this . Post another man every 25 yards on that outside perimeter ! - We got the voiceprint on one , sir . - Right . I know . We 'll reinforce you as soon as we can . Yeah . That 's an order , soldier . I 'm sorry , Doctor , but they won 't authorize anything ... until we run a complete decontamination on you . Oh , for Christ sake . We 'll probably have the gear installed by tomorrow . We can get you out of here by tomorrow night . I 'm telling you , Colonel , this information 's invaluable . Can 't you radio the data to Dietrich ? Every time I break this connection , I gotta go through this voiceprint bullshit . Look , I 'm telling you . We 've got a chance to crack it ! Authorize me out of here ! Screw the orders ! Get me out of here ! I 'll have you out by tomorrow night . If I let you out now , they 'd only stop you anyway . That 'd be a longer delay . At least this way we stay in touch and keep working . I 'm sorry . It 's the best I can do . Hey , they 're gone , man . That son of a bitch and his kid . Oh , my God . David . Get him down . Please get him down . Get him down . I didn 't do it . Hey , man , look at this . Come on , Clanker . We gotta get out of here . Come on , buddy . Move it ! Come on , girl . You gotta go in . Come on . Yeah , we 're taking everybody to the high school . Hello . Hello . What 's your name ? My name is Kathy . Stop it right there . Hey , man , that 's close enough . Do you want to play ? No . You stay away . Stay away , you guys . He said I could come out and play for a long time . - But I couldn 't go far . - We 're gonna have to shoot her . I saw - Stay away from her , man ! Stay away . She 's going insane anyway , man . Shoot her . Come on . I have four guns with me . Come on . My father - My father doesn 't - All right , everybody , shoot her ! - You was gonna leave me . - Stop it ! Stop it ! They 're coming , David ! David . David , they 're coming , please . Come on , Clanker . We gotta move . We gotta get out of here . Jesus , man . My head 's screwed up . I got the bug , right ? Come on ! We 've gotta get out of here ! Oh , no , I got the bug . Take an arm . I 'm scared , man . I flip out and I can 't control myself . - Come on , Clanker . Will you move . - Hey , big man . Big green hat . Move it ! Tell me where I should meet you . For God 's sakes . Come on , man . Tell me where I should meet you . - Clanker . - Goddamn it , tell me where I should meet you ! I know . Meet ya down at the Zebra Club . - Hey , no , man , no . Listen . - Remember the Zebra Club outside of Bragg ? I 'll meet you there . - Listen . Out by the old concrete plant . - I 'll meet ya there and we 'll drink ' em blind . I 'll take care of these guys . I 'm gonna meet ya at the Zebra Club . Okay ? The Zebra Club , man . Hey , David . You got the brains , man . What are we gonna do ? The goddamn bug . I got the goddamn bug ! Hit him ! He 's a crazy son of a bitch , ain 't he ? Watch your asses , you chickenshits in those white suits ! Where the hell 's he at ? I 'm gonna say hello to these goddamn white uniforms . Spread out , goddamn it ! Where are you going ? Keep your eyes open . There he is ! Hold your fire ! Hold your fire ! Hold your fire until you can see him ! I 'm staying right here . I 'm not gonna move . Stay low ! Stay low . That son of a bitch can sure see us , man . All right , let 's move in slow . Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! I can 't see a thing . Am I moving ' ? Move in . Stick to your right . Stay low , you guys . Stay low . It 's starting to come over the railing . Hey , buddy , looks like it won 't work . Out of ammunition , man . Son of a bitch ! Won 't work , right ? It 's your ass , man . Just sit there and sweat it , man . We 're gonna do us some drinkin ' . Whoa . Whoa . Whoa . Whoa . Hold it . Am I going blind , or is this configuration smaller than it was ? Hmm ? Smaller ? I don 't know what it is you 're looking for . Sure . What 's the combination for this stuff ? Uh , 44 and 23 . Ink up another slide . The same thing . A million to one we 'd find it . But this is it . I 'm sure of it . Goddamn it , this is it ! Give me Dietrich . Uh , yes , we 'll have to check your - I know . I know . The voiceprint . Are you recording ? One minute , sir . Come on . Oh , Christ . Well ! Recording , sir . Watts , Dr. Elston . Special unit three , seven , four , three , two , seven . Code name : Trixie . Section : Research and Development . We have that , sir , and we 'll put it right through . Hustle , will you . It is bigger here ! It 's bigger than all the other individual samples . Goddamn it , woman , this is it ! This is it ! We gotta get this stuff off to Dietrich . I don 't understand the significance - You don 't have to understand . - Just have faith . - If you were to explain it to me , sir , I could be of more help . Get me Peckem . Uh , your line is hooked into Central on that voiceprint check , sir . Oh , I asked him for another line ! We can cancel that , sir , and make this new - Listen . - Yes , sir . - When you get me Dietrich , can you put it through to me at Peckem 's headquarters ? Yes , I think - Yes , sir , we can do that . Okay , then do it . I 'm going over there right now . If anything comes , hold it . I 'll be there in two minutes . This is very urgent . Yes , sir . Will do . Watch those slides . And call me if anything different happens . Yes , but what am I looking for , sir ? - Hold it there . - Wait . Listen to me . Listen to me ! Hold on there . Will you listen to me ? I 'm Dr. Watts ! I 'm a scientist ! I 'm with the team ! I 've got a tube of Trixie here ! Will you listen to me ! I 'm working on the virus ! Will you listen to me ! This is a mistake ! Will you shut - Please , God , I will - They 've got a voiceprint on me ! I don 't need a backup ! This is a mistake ! Will you shut up ! Let me go ! Look at that ! I see - It 's gotta be the perimeter . You gotta remember to do exactly what I tell you . Promise , no matter what . I promise , David . - You okay ? - I 'm fine , and ready . I 'm fine , David , really . I want to rest somewhere . Now listen to me . They 're gonna be comin ' through here . If they don 't see us , they 'll pass us by . And we 'll be on the outside , huh ? We 'll be out . How long will I be alone ? - Not long . - It 's the only thing that scares me . Why can 't you come in with me ? I can 't place the blocks from the inside . - David , where will you be ? - I 'll hide up in the tower . You 're gonna hear them come through . They 'll probably search the grounds . You just be real quiet until they pass by . - And I 'll come back to get you . - They 'll never find me . They 'll never - They will never find us . Us ? David , they might find you . No , no . I can hide . They 'll never find either of us . - But what if they do ? - They won 't . They won 't . Now listen to me . After you hear them pass , you be real quiet . And after they leave and they go far away , I 'll come back to get ya . If I don 't come back to get ya , you wait a long time , and then you leave by yourself . Oh , no . No , David . I can 't go anywhere without you . - Now , don 't worry . I 'll - I 'll meet ya . - Where ? I 'll meet ya at - The Zebra Club . - I remembered , David . I remembered . - Oh , no . No , not at the Zebra Club . I 'll meet ya at , uh - I 'll meet you at your mother 's house . Your mother 's house in Danville . That 's a good idea . Okay , now if I don 't come back , you leave by yourself and you go to your mother 's house . You take care of yourself , hmm . Be quiet and don 't move . That goes for both of you . I love you , Judy . - What ? - I love you . David , I can 't hear you . David , I can 't hear you . I love you . David , what are we gonna call our baby ? I think it 's a boy . It 'd like a boy . Our baby , David . You gotta go around and look on the other side . Move it ! I see your lights . All right . Give us an aerial flare . We gotta knock those blocks down . Good place to hide among those blocks . Give a look into one of those things . Somebody check out the building . Two men , check out the building . Gotta work in pairs . We gotta get in there . Come on . Let 's get out of here . - Better check up in the tower here . - Watch out for crazies ! There 's crazies in there . - Shut up . - What 's up ? You see something ? - I don 't know . Come on . Let 's go . Come on . - Hey , man , what the hell are you doing ? - Hold on . I 'm coming . Hey , you all right ? Hey ! Hey , what 's the matter , buddy ? Nothin ' . I 'm comin ' down . Hey , man , it 's scary enough around here . Why didn 't you answer me ? I 'll be right there ! I 'm takin ' a piss ! Aw , kiss my ass . Takin ' a piss . What the hell does that mean , " takin ' a piss " ? Hey , uh , how far out from Cairo ? Don 't know . - Hey , come on . It 's spooky around here . We 'll never find the other guys if we don 't leave now . Come on . All right , I 'm comin ' down ! Okay ! Hold it . Be quiet . Oh , David . There 's something in there . Sounds like a little kid . Hey , it 's a broad . David ? It 's all right , baby , it 's me . David ? It 's all right , baby . No ! No ! It 's all right ! It 's all right , Judy . No ! No ! Judy . Judy , it 's all right ! It 's me ! Judy ! Judy , it 's me ! David ? Oh , David . Hey , it 's all right . We 're not army ! Stop ! Hey , stop shooting ! We 're not army ! Please ! We 're not - Hey , Coach .

Let 's go . Oh , hurry . You decide what you want to name him . I think - I think we 'd better call him David . Judy ? Right on the money as far as the , uh , census info is concerned . 3,613 total population . Twenty - Twenty-one hundred survivors . If you want to call them survivors . Uh , I read you , Chris . That 's a fine job . I hate to drop this on you , but , uh , Chris , we 're taking you out . We 're sending you into Louisville . Louisville ? Now we don 't want to hit the panic button , Chris , but we have reports of symptoms . We 've always considered the possibility of Trixie being carried out before you got your lines up . We doubt it , frankly , Chris , but , uh , we want you in there to check the situation over just in case . If it does break out , you 'll be much better prepared , Chris . You , uh - You have one under your belt now . Yes , sir . You 're the only one to send in there . The state police have blocked the roads and closed the airports . You 're doing a great job . Hang in there . You 've got transport arranged . You 'll have to go through the medical before you leave the area . We don 't want you carrying Trixie out . No , sir . Put your hands on your head , Colonel , please . Breathe through your mouth . Colonel Peckem , sir , we can sign you out . Hear anything from Dietrich ? They 're sending in a new man from Trixie . He should be here tomorrow . If we only knew what Watts was working on . Our boys have checked the slides he left in his microscope , but we can 't make heads nor tails out of it . He was onto something . We 'll dope it out ... sooner or later . Sooner or later . Understand they found a rhesus monkey at Dietrich - immune . Sooner or later , we 'll find a human . Sooner or later . - Want an immunity check on this one , Doctor ? - Are you kidding me , soldier ? I see no way out of this . There 's never been - There 's never been a Trixie before . In admission , there 's nothing about it . And I 'm concerned - damn concerned . I don 't know what you have - How you feel about it . I simply said repeatedly - Accusations and blame are not gonna help anything . / Heaven , help us / Firelight , won 't you let me be / I feel so helpless / How can I find the morning / Daytime heroes / Save me a piece of sunshine sky / A safer place where I / Can get up and find the morning / If time is a healer / Then why are we wounded / And why are those people dying / And I get so weary / In moments of sadness / I can 't even hear people crying / But I know they do / Marching soldier / Fighting behind a losing cause / A better war is yours / If you can find / The morning / Heaven help us / Heaven help us

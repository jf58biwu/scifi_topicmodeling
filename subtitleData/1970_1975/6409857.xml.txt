 [ theme music plays ] [ car engine starts up ] Soda , Mr. Gregory ? [ northern accent ] No , I 'll take it as it is . Call me Jack . I 'm so sorry my husband isn 't here to welcome you . He shouldn 't keep you waiting . Time is money , isn 't that what you say ? He can keep me waiting all night if you 're going to entertain me . - Cheers . - All the best . I don 't think I could explain the electro-encephaloscope . Wouldn 't help me if you could . All I 'm interested in is the marketing potential . Of course , it could be used on a mass scale in the treatment of mental sickness . Could look for criminal characteristics , in prison populations and so on . Allen has a collection of brain charts already , taken from student volunteers at the Institute . Does he do them in batches ? A recorder can handle several subjects at the same time . Allen has two outlets fitted to the prototype in the laboratory . You know your stuff , don 't you ? Is it safe ? Well , there was an accident , just over a month ago . Fortunately , the two students were unharmed . And Allen was able to reverse the effect . ln fact , the students never realised what had happened . Hot in here , isn 't it ? It suggested a use for the machine which Allen himself had never dreamed of . What did happen then ? [ echoing ] You 'll find out , Mr. Gregory . We shall demonstrate it for you , tonight . Allen . [ honking ] - Good evening . - Good evening , madam . Good evening , sir . [ lock clicking ] [ Ann ] I 'm so sorry to disturb you . I 'm afraid we 're working late again tonight . We 're going to want some peace and quiet . - Good night . - Good night . The drug 's almost worn off . Once the cycle starts he 'll be unconscious anyway , until it 's over . You both will . Don 't touch that ! I set the controls this afternoon . I 'm only checking . Have you set the transfer ? No . I left that in case anyone should come poking their nose in . I 'll do it now . I 've marked the reverse switch in case you should notice anything amiss . - Still afraid , Allen ? - Of course I am . If you back out now ... - Is my injection ready ? - Yes . [ equipment rattling ] Are you sure it 's strong enough ? It should last just over three hours . Ready ? The controls- - The controls are set on automatic . Once you switch on , the cycle will complete itself in 30 minutes . - I know . - Yes . [ trolley rattling ] All right . [ machine humming ] Allen ? Allen , can you hear me ? Can you speak ? Try harder , remember his muscle co-ordination is different . Are you my husband , Allen Meredith ? Am I ? Am I ? Try walking . You 've got to learn to co-ordinate his body . Come on . Yes , yes . [ clears throat ] Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday . [ engine revs ] Now you say the drug you gave my body , will keep it out for about another couple of hours . Yes . Fantastic to be able to look at one 's own body ! It 'll be ready for him when he wakes up . It 's going to be a hell of a shock . - I know . - I 'll make a note of all the symptoms- - Allen , there isn 't time . No , of course not . I 'll just have my keys . Incredible , Poor devil . Don 't start feeling sorry for him . - His office again , repeat it . - Fifth Floor , Greenway House . Secretary , Miss Pinner . Addresses her as Joan . Partner , George Simpson . Calls him George . - Home background ? - 24 , Liverton Road . Chauffeur , Rawlinson . Wife , Elizabeth . Butler ... Oh , we still haven 't got the name of the butler ! There are bound to be some facts missing . There 's your checklist . If you get stuck , you 'll just have to play it by ear . They may think you 're behaving oddly , but no one could suspect the truth . Now , come on , try his signature again . - That 's good ! That 's very good . - Yes , it is , isn 't it ? It seems to be easier with his own hand . - Where is my notebook ? - Not now . There isn 't time . You must get his voice right . Listen again ! [ Ann over tape recorder ] What do you say ? [ Mr. Gregory ] He can keep me waiting all night if you 're going to entertain me . Go on . He can- - [ imitating Gregory 's accent ] He can keep me waiting all night if you 're going to entertain me . Yes . That 's better too , using his vocal chords . Yes , of course , the whole character of the body- - Try again ! [ car approaching ] It 's the car . It 's back already . Now , what do you say to him ? I say , " All right , Rawlinson . You can drive me home- - " - The accent ! - Right , right , right . All right , Rawlinson , You can drive me home now . I 'm not feeling too well . Try not to be so nervous . You 'll get it wrong . I 'll try again [ doorbell rings ] There isn 't time . Don 't say very much , and keep calm ! [ front door opens ] Hello , Elizabeth . I hope I haven 't kept you up ? God , I hope that 's right . [ incoherent chatter ] All right , Rawlinson . You can drive me home now . Alright Rawlinson ! You can drive me home now . - Home , sir ? - I 'm not feeling very well . Oh , sir . Don 't forget your coat , sir . I 'm so sorry , Mr. Gregory . Nothing serious I hope , sir ? No , no . I 'll be all right . I do hope you 'll be all right , Mr. Gregory . Yes , Mrs. Meredith , I 'll be all right . Thank you . [ engine starts up ] Thank you , Rawlinson . I feel better now . Will that be all for this evening , sir ? Yes , that 'll be all . - Good night , sir . - Good night . - Good evening , sir . - Ah . Hello . I 'm a feeling a bit peckish . Something to eat . Could you manage ? Some steamed fish , sir ? Haven 't you got a steak , some vegetables , something like that ? If you wish it , sir . - Soon as you can then , please ? - Yes , sir . - Jack ! - Hello , Elizabeth . I hope I haven 't kept you up . Good evening , Mr. Gregory . I was passing and I ... I was just going actually , - Good night , Mrs. Gregory . - Must you go ? - I was enjoying our chat . - I 'm sorry , I have to . Good night . Well ! However did you know he was here ? l--I didn 't . Oh ? You came home to spend a night with me ? How very sweet of you , Jack . Have you quarrelled with ... Sheila ? Or is it someone else by this time ? Well ? Aren 't you going to tell me what you think of me ? Oh , come now ! It was my fault , you know . I asked him here . I admit it . So why not start with " bitch " , and carry on from there ? I don 't want to say anything about it , what you do is your own affair . - It 's not my business . - Oh , how very civilised ! Have you started a new approach to living , or is it just another way of being cruel ? - I don 't want to talk about it ! - Oh , very clever ! Unusually subtle for you , but clever . Indifference is so much more effective than threats and shouts . Much more effective . Look , er ... Please don 't cry . [ sobbing ] Perhaps you 're saving it up for him ? I suppose you won 't believe he only came because I practically begged him . Poor Tony . I propose to forget whatever has happened here tonight . All I want to do is have some food , then go to bed . Can 't you just leave it at that ? Do you know , I wanted you to come back . I didn 't think for a moment you would , but deep down inside me , I wanted you to find me with someone . Just so that you 'd be angry . At least you 'd be reminded I was here , and that would be better than nothing . But you 've seen through me . You know exactly how to hurt most . I 'm not trying to hurt anyone ! All- - All I ... Oh God , where 's that food ? [ panting ] [ screams ] Hey ! [ groaning ] I suggest you sit down , sir . What is it ? Mr. Gregory has just had a large steak , with vegetables followed by fruit and cream , madam . Have you gone mad ? Eating a meal like that with your ulcer ? I took the precaution , ma 'am , Thank you . Here drink this . Please see Mr. Gregory to his room . Yes , ma 'am . - Good night , Harvey . - Good night , ma 'am . Come along , sir . Be quiet ! [ [ screaming , grunting ] Lie still and be quiet . Now you know what that machine can do . You are now inside my husband 's body and he is in yours . The process can be reversed . You 'll be changed back again in a few days , if you behave yourself . If you try to escape or injure yourself in any way , it may be impossible . If you draw attention to yourself , I shall say my husband has gone mad , thinking he 's another man . They 'll diagnose acute schizophrenia . We none of us want that , do we ? Are you hungry ? I shall feed you and take care of you . No need to be afraid , or embarrassed . I 'm a trained nurse . But , why ? For the benefit of science . - Good morning , Harvey . - Good morning , sir . - Oh , thank you . - Sir ? [ phone rings ] - Excuse me , sir . - Yes , all right . Mr. Gregory 's residence . Good morning , Mrs. Meredith here may I speak with- - - Meredith ? - Yes . Oh , one moment , please . Mrs. Meredith for you , sir . Thank you , Harvey . - Gregory here . - Good morning . You asked me to let you know how my husband is after that nasty turn he had last night . Ah , yes. that 's right . How is he ? Still quite shocked . But he 's quite recovered physically . His pulse is a bit fast , but his temperature 's normal . There 's no need to worry about him . All right well take a note of all the symptoms- - How are you , Mr. Gregory ? Oh , I 'm fine , thank you . Just on my way to the office . I hope to ... see you again , quite soon . I 'm looking forward to that . Good morning . Goodbye . Jack ! About Tony ... - Look , I told you- - - It wasn 't his fault , really , Please don 't use it against him . I 'm not using anything against anyone . Will you please stop worrying about it ? Goodbye . - Thank you , Rawlinson . - Yes , sir . - Good morning . - Good morning . Good morning . - Good morning , Joan . - Jack ! - Morning , Jack . - Good morning . - I managed it . - Oh . Did you ? Good , I 'm glad . [ coughs lightly ] [ clears throat ] Oh , it 's my throat . [ clears throat ] Mr. Smith phoned . No initial or anything . Just said you 'd know . Wants an answer by mid-day . I had to remind you about Mr. Bloom . And there 's nothing from Sutton Brothers , yet . I could get onto them if you like ? Usual line presumably ? Very well . You 're seeing Mr. Robinson at 10 : 30 , and the board meeting 's fixed for 11 : 00 . - Well , cancel it . Both of them . - What ? Cancel all my appointments , for the next couple of days . Something important has turned up . - More important than- - - You heard what I said ! Perhaps you 'll sign this report ? No , not just now . I was here until 9 : 30 last night , typing that , - because you said- - - No matter what I said , things have changed ! Do you understand ? Yes ! They have , haven 't they ? Yes , well it 's nothing to do with you ... a personal matter . - Morning , Jack . - Hello , George . - How did you get on last night ? - Last night ? I thought you were going to see that man , Meredith . Oh , yes , yes , of course . He 's got a brilliant idea , it 's better than ever . Good ! So now I suppose you 'll con it out of him for next to nothing , as usual . Still , I suppose it helps pay the tax man . I don 't think we 're going to be able to trick him out of this one . - Oh ? That wife of his ? - What ? His wife , is she taking a hand in the bargaining ? No , no , it 's just that , I think we ought to treat him more generously from now on . For our benefit , of course . What ? Oh , God ! Now about the Weybridge Project . I 'd like a word before the board meeting- - I 'm sorry , I can 't talk to you this morning , I 'm too busy . I beg your pardon ? [ telephone rings ] Mr. Gregory 's office . Oh , yes ! One moment , please . - Mr. Bloom . - Bloom ! What are you going to say to him ? Nothing ! I haven 't decided . Tell him I 'm not here . Don 't be absurd ! You 've got to say something . What 's the matter with you ? Bloom ? Gregory here . The answer is no ! That 's all I have to say . Good morning ! [ hangs up phone ] Have you gone mad ? You must be mad ! I 'll talk to him myself . Though what I 'm going to say after that I can 't imagine . I shall want an explanation , Gregory , and it had better be a good one ! I want to see the accountant . Which one ? Er , Randall ! as soon as you can , please . And will you keep everybody else out . - What shall I say when- - - Don 't say anything . Just keep them out . You must eat . Why not ? You can talk to me , can 't you ? Very well , we 'll try again , later . Wait a minute , come here ! Un-tie these things , will you ? I 'm sorry , I don 't trust you . Why are you doing this to me ? What have I done to you ? If you must know , you 've exploited my husband shamefully . You 've never paid him more than a pittance , and made a fortune out of his ideas . This time it 's going to be different . Now , look- - [ knocking ] Good morning , Mr. Gregory . Oh ! It 's you ! Before you say anything , I 've made out my resignation . Here it is . I don 't want your resignation . You can take it back . Forget about last night . It wasn 't all your fault . You can go now . Will you remind my secretary I 'm still waiting to see Mr. Randall , please ? Well , Is there some other Randall ? Your secretary thought you meant me . Naturally , I assumed it was about last night . Yes , of course . I 'm sorry , Randall , I 've ... I was thinking of something else . I do want to see you , it 's ... It 's not about last night . Sit down , will you . Please . It 's about an investment on behalf of the company . It 's a new invention , I want £ 100,000 , paid to Dr. A. W , Meredith . £ 100,000 ? Yes , paid into his account , as soon as possible . You mean , you want to put a proposition to the Board ? I didn 't say that. did I ? But , sir , an investment that size ! The Board must approve the project , and the terms of the contract . There isn 't a contract . It 's a gentleman 's agreement . A gentleman 's ... What about the Board ? Never mind about the Board ! I 'm sorry , sir , Perhaps you 'll have a word with Mr. Simpson . Randall . I could change my mind about that resignation you know ! All right , you can resign , but where are you going to get another job ? You were very indiscreet last night . Suppose that got around ? You 've got your career to think about . I assumed that when I decided to forget last night , I would have your co-operation . I see . I should have known better . I thought for a moment that you were being generous . So now you can think again . Can 't you ? Well ? You have personal authority to increase existing loans , up to 20 percent . If I select half a dozen of the larger investments , and attach Dr. Meredith 's name to each of the projects- - Yes , that 's good ! Sounds very good . However , when the accounts come before the Board for review- - We 'll let the Board take care of itself . How long will this take to arrange ? The papers will have to be prepared . This afternoon ? I don 't mean to be difficult . There are things you wouldn 't understand . Get on with it , will you . [ whirring , buzzing ] What is it you want ? Money ? I 'll find out sooner or later , won 't I ? This is the greatest discovery Allen has made , or is ever likely to . He needs money for proper research . More than the Institute can find , or you 're ever likely to pay him , unless you 're forced to . So he 's using my body to steal it , is that it ? Taking what is due to you isn 't stealing . - Oh , blooming ' heck ! - What is it ? - Smith . - Smith ? Another man who wants money . Today . Wonder how your lad will cope with that one . I 'll tell you , I wasn 't looking forward to it . Shall I phone him ? Warn him ? [ yelping ] What is it ? What 's the matter ? Cramp ! ln our leg . There . Is that better ? Ooh . It 's getting better . [ groans ] If that happens , when you 're not here , I 'll be in agony ! Please un-tie it . I give you my word of honour ! I won 't run away . I 'll behave myself . For pity 's sake , will you please un-tie it ? It 's that Mr. Smith again . I haven 't time for that . I 'm going out to lunch . - I 'll be back- - - Gregory ! - I 'm just going out to lunch . - The Board are furious ! Not only do you fail to attend , they haven 't even got your report ! [ Joan ] It has been typed . yes , but I haven 't time to attend to it now . [ phone rings ] Just give me a couple of days , I 'll be able to explain everything . My God , you 'll have a lot of explaining to do . I warn you , if there 's much more of this , you won 't have me to carry the can for you . - And I mean it ! - Mr. Gregory 's in danger ? - What was that ? - It 's a woman . She 's rung three times already . - She says- - - I 'll take it in the office ! Hello , Mr. Gregory 's just come in he can speak to you now . - Hello Ann , what 's the matter ? - Ann ? Who the hell is Ann ? - This is Sheila . - Sheila ? What are you trying on with Smith ? Smith ? He says he 's been trying to get you all morning . He thinks you 're trying to wriggle out of paying . - Paying ? - He says you won 't speak to him on the phone . He says he gave you until 12 : 00 and you didn 't ring back , You don 't mess about with a man like Smith . - Not if you ' have any sense . - Well , what does he want ? What do you think he wants ? His ten percent , of course ! Listen , darling , do you want him round there to collect ? Chatting up your partner ? Carving his initials on your secretary ? All right then , why should I care ? It 's your look-out . Only , stay away from here . I don 't want blood all over my carpet . Hello ? Sheila ? But how much does he want ? Hello ? Give me those damn glasses . Your husband may fancy a broken leg , I don 't . Ah , that 's better . I can see now . You stay here . I 'll go get some lunch . Yes , all right , just a minute . What are you doing ? Put me down ! Gregory ! Gregory ! Gave you a nasty fright , didn 't I ? [ groaning ] - You all right , sir ? - Oh , yes , I 'm all right . You sure ? You don 't look- - I 'm all right . Yes , just had an attack , that 's all . Drive me to Sheila 's , will you ? Very good , sir . - What are you after ? - That 's great . Neither of you smoke , and he 's run off with my cigarettes . You gave me your word . I trusted you . Got a light ? Last night you gave me a whisky . I trusted you . Sherry . [ coughs ] I 'll have him smoking by the time he gets back . Fancy , falling for the oldest trick in the book . At my age . Flattery . I wouldn 't have come otherwise , and you know that . I really thought you fancied me . Oh ! Why not ? I 'm more your type than he is . What do you mean by that ? It was all your idea , wasn 't it ? Why do you think his contracts were so poor ? Because he was soft enough to sign them ! I told him that . I bet you told him a lot of things . How did you persuade him into this ? " All for the good of science " , is that what you said ? - It is for the good of science . - Science , eh ? Is that all you want out of this ? Don 't you judge everyone by your own mercenary motives . Allen is a brilliant man . He 's got more brains than you 'll ever have . And he loves me very much . I 've no doubt . Do you love him ? I admire him . I refuse to talk about it . Better get on with the cooking then , I 'm hungry . - Say , has he got an ulcer ? - No . Oh , that 's great ! If I get nothing else out of this , at least I 'll have a good feed . Shall I wait , sir ? Yes , but help me up to the flat first , will you ? - I 'm still not feeling well . - Very well , sir . [ doorbell rings ] What 's this ? Lost your key ? Thank you , Rawlinson . I told you to keep away ! Are you all right ? What did they do to you ? You 're a good cook . Haven 't enjoyed a meal like that in years . Something to be said for swapping bodies . Attractive woman . Let yourself relax a bit . Lucky man , your husband . Why did you marry him ? It 's none of your business . Nurse turns laboratory assistant . Falls in love with brilliant young scientist . He talked about it once . So , you dote on him , he dotes on his work , and you get fed up . I refuse to talk about it . How much longer have we got to wait eh ? Well , the least you can do is entertain me . Why should I ? I could make things very awkward for you . I could go out on a spree . Think of the headline , " Drunken scientist dances naked in town square " . That would take a bit of explaining to the Institute . You wouldn 't dare ! [ crockery clatters ] You don 't know me very well , do you ? It 's time you did . Come and sit over here . Certainly not ! Not doing very well , am I ? Trouble is , you 're not the kind of woman I 'm used to . Maybe that 's what makes you so interesting . What do you mean by that ? [ chuckles ] See what I mean ? The kind of woman I meet , she wouldn 't need telling . - You 've got a damned nerve ! - Yes , I have . You 're going to feel even worse tomorrow . No , no . I 'll be all right . No need for heroics with me , lover . They gave me until mid-day tomorrow . Mmm . Generous . The only thing is , I don 't know if I can get hold of the money . - You 're joking ! - I 'm not . Did they hit you on the head as well ? No . Well , don 't go getting vague , here tomorrow or else ! - Seven thousand , five hundred . - Seven thousand , fi ... All right then , you tell me . What 's the approach ? I 'm always ready to be educated . Running away ? What 's the matter ? Not sure of yourself . Come on , come on , woman ! You 've all got the same feelings when it comes to the point . That 's better ! I can understand that ! Can 't cry out for help even , can you ? They 'd only find you here with your husband . What 's his approach then ? More subtle , I suppose , with all that brain . How do you like being married to an electro-encephaloscope ? Don 't you sometimes wish it was a bit different ? More my type , perhaps ? I bet you do . Well , now you 've got your wish . Stay away from me ! - Take your hands off me ! - Why should I ? Your husband 's hands , aren 't they ? The old body 's under new management now . Husband and lover , all in one . How 's that for a package deal ? Oh , damn , blasted things ! How does he manage with them ? [ giggling ] - Well ? - These are for you to sign . Good , good ! You 'll see where they 're marked . How long is it going to take to transfer the money ? About 24 hours . I 'll need some in cash by mid-day tomorrow . You need ? Yes , £ 7,500 for Dr. Meredith . - It 's what I promised him . - Yes , sir . [ man outside ] I don 't give a damn what orders he 's given . I 've something to say to him ! What the hell are you up to now ? Mr. Simpson asked what I was doing and naturally- - Naturally you told him ? I should damn well think he did ! I 've been just reading the duplicates . If this is a new line in criminal embezzlement , it 's the crudest I 've over come across ! It 's not criminal , sir , unless you consider- - Leave this to me ! Well ? I intend to sign those papers ! Very well . Sign them ! Sign them ! And much good it will do you ! I 'm going to my lawyer , do you hear ? I shall call my broker , and the bank . I shall have my investment in this business , wound up by tomorrow morning ! And I shall make damn sure , that every director and every stockholder knows what you 're up to . Every creditor shall hear about it too . And I wouldn 't like to be in your shoes this time tomorrow . Hold on ! I haven 't signed those yet . - Not much point is there ? - What do you mean ? You heard what he said . He 's pulling out . That 's 25 percent . Your margin is only five . They 'll never pay out on this lot . - But they must ! - Very well . Try them yourself . - Randall ! - I 'll post you the resignation . And you can do what you like . With the kind of name you 'll have tomorrow , it won 't much matter ! I wonder if it counts as adultery ? Must be nearly dinnertime . Your appetites are simple enough , aren 't they ? They must be built into the brain-pattern . I ought to make a note of that for Allen 's research . To hell with Allen 's research . How long 's he going to be , on this little jaunt ? Another day , two days ... And then you 'll have him back . Looking forward to that ? Or maybe you prefer the new model ? [ car approaching ] What 's that ? It 's your car ! Ann ? Ann ? Ann ! Where are you ? Allen ! What are you doing here ? Have you got the money already ? No , not yet . Is he all right ? - Yes he 's good . - Over the shock ? Well over ! Good , because we need his help . What ? No Allen , wait a minute ! Good God , it 's me ! Evening , Meredith . Or should I say Gregory ? - He 's un-tied ! - Yes well , he got cramp . It 's quite alright . He gave me his word of honour . ln what I have learnt , I wouldn 't put too much faith in that ! What have you learnt you body-snatcher ? [ muffled shouting ] You pathetic amateur ! I wouldn 't employ you as an office boy , second grade ! A hundred thousand ! You weren 't in it for peanuts , were you ? Did you really think you 'd get away with it ? You 've smashed everything , you realise that , don 't you ? Not just me , but the shareholders . You 'll get out of it , somehow . My lawyers are clever enough , you mean ! Your lawyers ? There will be an enquiry . There could be a prosecution ! I 'm sorry . Sorry ! You 're a blundering idiot . All right . If you want it that way , what have you done with that £ 75,000 you made through Smith ? You know about that ? You didn 't put it through the books , did you ? - No , course I didn 't ! - Where is it ? I want it ! - You want it ? - Yes , in cash , by midday tomorrow . That 's the price you pay to get your body back . After the mess you 've made , I 'm not sure I want to . All right , so you get the money , then you 'll change back ? Yes . If you get it . What do you mean if ? I gave that money to Elizabeth . You 'll have to persuade her to hand it over . [ engine starts up ] What a mess ! Do you really want to go back ? Wouldn 't you rather stay as you are ? You 'd like that , wouldn 't you ? You want all the money ? You said you 'd be wanting 7,500 . But you said I should keep the rest , remember ? For both of us . So that if anything went wrong with the business , at least they couldn 't touch that . It would be our nest-egg to start us off again . Something has gone wrong , hasn 't it ? Terribly wrong , I 've never seen you like this before . I just didn 't want to worry you with it all . You said that as though you meant it . Yes , I do mean it . Kind words come expensive , don 't they ? Seventy five thousand . Will it save the business ? If it doesn 't , I shall lose my own money as well . I 'm sure , you 'll be all right . I have to trust you , don 't I ? ln spite of everything . I need it in cash by midday tomorrow . Tomorrow ? Well , I can ask the broker to sell the bonds tomorrow morning . But to get the money by midday ? You could start a whole new life in his body ! It takes capital . Costs money to start a new life . That 's just the point , You 'll have money ! He 'll put the 75,000 into his own account . That 's your account now . All you 've got to do is learn his signature . It was easy . He learnt yours . He said he wanted it in cash . And he 'll probably bring it with him . Thank you . Oh , I see , Thank you , Mrs. Gregory . He left the house about an hour ago . They 've no idea where he 's gone . Did he get the money ? I couldn 't ask her that , could I ? - Jack ? - Mm ? Even if he doesn 't get the money , it doesn 't make any difference , does it ? No difference ! Well , I 've got my savings , and his ... I know it 's not very much , but , at least it 's better than bankruptcy or court cases . We can do it , can 't we ? Who can stop us ? - He can . - But how ? By telling the world exactly what happened . - No one would believe him ! - Everybody would , eventually . He knows how that machine works . He knows every detail of his own past . Stored up in his memory . Given time he could demonstrate beyond all doubt that he is Professor Meredith and I 'm Jack Gregory . A nice legal point , I grant you . A new line in habeas corpus . But he could make life impossible for me . I see what you mean . His memory ... [ car approaching ] That 's my car ! - Have you got the money ? - Yes I have . So you 've got it ! You actually managed to persuade her to hand it over ! It wasn 't difficult . Why the hell don 't you treat her decently ? - Well , you know me . - Yes , I 'm afraid I do . Well , where is it ? You don 't think I was going to bring it here , where he might get his hands on it ? You 've put it into your account ? No . I haven 't done that either . He might forge my signature . Oh , well done , Meredith ! Two days in my body , you 're beginning to learn the facts of life ! Allen , what have you done with it ? I paid 7,500 to Smith . - That was owing . - So it was . And , I paid £ 50,000 into your business . - You did what ? - Yes , your partners agreed , to let bygones be bygones . So you 'll be all right . - You 're a fool ! - Wait a minute . There 's another 17,000 or more stashed away somewhere . Oh , yes , I 've taken that , in down payment on the machine . You must admit it 's a working proposition . And I 'll need royalties of course . Seventeen thousand ? Yes . I 've made that over to the Institute , for use on research and development . So at least the whole thing hasn 't been a complete waste of effort . [ Gregory laughs ] I 'm glad you find it amusing . Are you ready for the operation ? Yes ! Come on , let 's get on with it . Ann ! Ann ? Ann ? - What 's the matter with her ? - Strain , that 's all . Do we need her to work that box of tricks ? No . It 's completely automatic . - I 'll leave her here then . - Very good idea ! No . No . Right . Lie down on that couch . - Is it going to work ? - It has before . It will again . If it doesn 't , you and I won 't know very much about it . Mind you , I 've enjoyed the rest . I might promote it as a new line in rescuers . Getting away from it all , even the wife . - Are you ready ? - Get on with it . [ machine hums ] [ humming continues ] [ humming stops ] Jack ? Jack . Jack . - Ann ? - Allen ? The Reverse switch . Why , Ann , why ? His lead ? His ? Yes , of course , his ! They were crossed . Jack . Jack !

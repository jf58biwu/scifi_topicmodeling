 Peter , please . Take Jean back to the car . I must get this . Run ! Run ! Minister , Colonel Straker . - How do you do ? - A shattering business , Colonel . The Prime Minister 's already at Chequers . We 'll be there in 30 minutes . We 've been in communication with Paris , Moscow and Bonn during your visits . I think the British Government 's approval will be a formality . The evidence is conclusive . - If I might ... - Surely . Colonel . It may speed things up . My God . The clincher is at the back . It 's an enlarged frame from the cine film , sir . It couldn 't possibly be a fake ? The film was found undeveloped , still in the camera . It 's genuine . Take my word for it . Keep pace with the escort . I 'll take the file , sir . - Good morning , sir . - Good morning . - Good morning , sir . - Good morning . - Good morning . - Miss Ealand . - The report . - Thank you . Messages ? Information . Q21 , answer negative . Q46 , satellite link effective . Q97 , 00 . The computer read-outs available from today . - Put them straight through to me . - Yes , sir . Mr Freeman to see you , sir . All right , Mr Freeman . The girl in reception calls me Alec . So ? Doesn 't that inflame you with jealousy ? Obviously it doesn 't . But , soft ! What light through yonder window breaks ? It is the east and Juliet is the sun . 'Voice-print positive identification 9-7 . 'Freeman , Alec E . ' - Good morning , sir . - Good morning . You 're new , aren 't you ? - Must have passed all the tests . - All of them . I bet . Patrick . - Morning , Alec . - Morning , Pete . Won 't keep you a moment , Alec . - Trouble ? - Why else would I send for you ? Take a look at this . That 's Westbrook Electronics . - Yeah , what 's left of it . - What happened ? For ten years there have been setbacks . We 've had accidents , miscalculations , errors of judgement and other mishaps . Let 's put Westbrook Electronics down to other mishaps . - You mean a UFO ? - Well , there 's no proof . Bang goes the Utronic project , just as we had something to locate them . The Utronic equipment is safe . It wasn 't in the building . It 's intact , fully tested and ready for shipment . The breakthrough . SHADO have had Moonbase and the other satellites operational for the past few months . There have been sightings , but no interceptions . We 've got the teeth . Soon we 'll have the eyes . Freeman , you know how important this is to our whole organisation . The Utronic design team and equipment are ready in LA to be flown here to England . I 'm making you responsible for the security of the entire operation . I mean you . Personally . Right . It must be a while since you landed an SST . Let 's say it 's part of the personal service . SHADO Control , this is Seagull X-Ray , confirm arrival Stevenson Base , Los Angeles , 08 : 35 . 'Take-off scheduled 1100 hours . ' Roger , Seagull X-Ray . - Call Moonbase , will you ? - Yes , sir . Status check . - Target . - Affirmative . - Magnetic field ? - Check . - Saturation density ? - Green . - Resonator ? - Affirmative . - Code . - OK . - Displacements ? - Go . - Filters ? - Check . - Fluctuation ? - Affirmative . Reflex ? Excuse me . Right . - SHADO Control for you , Lieutenant . - Right . - Lieutenant Ellis . - ' Good morning , Gay . 'I have some action for you . 'I want Moonbase put on yellow alert from 10 : 45 'to track Seagull X-Ray . 'It 's carrying SHADO VIPs and the Utronic equipment . 'Let 's keep everybody on their toes . - ' Can 't afford to take chances . ' - Roger . Joan , announce a yellow alert for 10 : 45 . - Yes , Lieutenant . - And complete the status check . I think this will be for real . I 'm going to take a break . I 'll be back about 10 : 30 . OK . Moonbase will be on yellow alert from 10 : 45 , earth elapsed time . 'Repeat 10 : 45 , EET . 'All space trackers to be fully operational by 10 : 45 EET . 'Astronauts to be on stand-by . ' - Joanna ? - Be right with you , Lew . No hurry . I want to run a computer check on the interceptor systems in ten minutes . - Hi , Gay . - Hello , Lew . D 'you think this could be it , Lieutenant ? Looks like it , Lew . An SST travelling at Mach 4 is a pretty tempting target , particularly as it 's carrying the new Utronic equipment . - Hello , Ken . - Hi . - Hi . - Hi , Mark . Gay , this alert , what do you think ? Another false alarm ? Don 't think so , Mark . - So this time it could be real . - Could be . I guess we could all do with a bit of action . I could do with a cup of coffee . - Sure . - Thanks . - Put Skydiver in the picture . - Yes , sir . 'Message from SHADO Control , sir . Yellow alert at 10 : 45 . ' Right . That last entry . - Did you send it ? - Yes , sir . A refuelling schedule transmitted - on security code B ? - Sorry , sir . - How long have you been here ? - 2 years , sir . 2 years . Long enough to know how important security is to SHADO . Look , this headquarters , controlling Moonbase , the satellites and a fleet of submarines is 80 feet below a film studio , right ? Now , 400 people work up there and not one of them knows all this exists . I have to play games , pretending to be the studio 's chief executive . No one even dreams what my real function is . That 's what security is all about . I 'm sorry , sir . Sometimes it 's pretty difficult . Difficult ! So you think it 's difficult , huh , Ford ? Well , I 'll tell you when it gets difficult . Have you ever thought about the victims of UFO incidents ? Have you ever considered their parents , brothers , sisters ? What do we tell them ? They can never know the truth , so they live in agony for years , praying that some day their loved one may turn up , clinging to a thread of hope . Don 't ever tell me that security 's difficult . Sometimes it gets pretty close to home . 'Yellow alert starts in two minutes , sir . ' Be right with you . Stevenson Base , this is Seagull X-Ray . Liftoff check complete . 'Liftoff clearance ? ' 'Roger , Seagull X-Ray . You are clear to go . ' - Nina . 10 : 45 . - Right . Brakes off . Airspeed building . 130 ... 140 ... 160 V1 . VR . Rotate . This is Moonbase calling SID .

I have to do my stuff with the passengers . Right . Herr Mahler . Good morning . - Colonel Alec Freeman . - Ah , Colonel . I 'd like to congratulate you and your team . This could be the breakthrough we were waiting for . Not my team , Colonel . May I introduce our chief designer , Virginia Lake ? How do you do , Colonel ? For the first time , I wish I was flying subsonic aircraft . The trip would take longer . Just in case anyone 's interested , I 'm Phil Wade . How are you ? Well , looks like you 're the answer to all our prayers . Would you like to see the Utronic equipment , Colonel ? I think your equipment is fabulous , but I am familiar with it . - Really ? - Yes . I know that a Utronic beam travels instantaneously . - Almost instantaneously . - We 'll be able to detect UFOs flying many times the speed of light in deep space . Go on . So our Moonbase Interceptors will have a chance to destroy them - before they reach the earth . - Very good . I could tell you more over dinner . Hadn 't you better get back to your little seat up front ? I suppose so . I 'll be seeing you . Colonel ? You were right . You are familiar . With the equipment . - Everything OK ? - Yes , sir . - No sign of any activity . - Good . ' ... in 5 seconds . '4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 . ' 'Can we have a read-out on pressure fuel gauge ?

Gentlemen , Miss Lake , SHADO Control have informed me that a UFO is approaching the North Atlantic . We must assume that this aircraft is its target . We 're reducing height to take advantage of cloud cover . This means we have to reduce speed , but in the dense atmosphere , so will the UFO . That must increase SHADO 's chances of intercepting it . Yes , it does . I suggest you fasten your seatbelts . Look , don 't worry . It 'll be OK . Anyway , we have a dinner date . I wouldn 't let anything interfere with that . Thank you . 'UFO entering visual speed range . ' Radar on visual alert ! UFO on radar , track speed : Mach 5 . Thank God for the atmosphere . It 's the best protection we have . Positive radar fix .

Alec , are you OK ? I 've aged about five years but we 're in one piece . Hello , Sky 1 . Follow it down , Captain . - ' Use your reconnaissance cameras . ' - Roger . Will do . It went straight under . It seems to be breaking up . Hold it ! There 's a body ! Please confirm . Did you say body ? Yes . It 's a body . How 's it going , Alec ? - Everything 's fine . - Good . Good . Moonbase and the other stations will have the Utronic system operational within a week . That 's great . You look tired , Alec . Why don 't you help yourself to a drink ? Thanks . Think I will . - You never touch it , do you ? - Self-control . Maybe drinking needs more self-control . When does ... it arrive ? Any time now . We 've waited a long time for this . Yes , 10 years . It 's been 10 years since we had the first confirmed UFO landing on earth . That was after a decade of speculation , reports , - official denials . You name it . - You know , Alec , when I was made commander of SHADO , I thought it was all going to happen . You 've done a good job , the best . Well , I 've tried . But how far have we progressed ? I mean , what do we really know about UFOs ? What are they ? Where do they come from ? What do they want ? Yes . 'Mayland Hospital , SHADO section . 'Your special patient has arrived , sir . 'We will use underground corridor 32 to SHADO medical centre . ' Right . Well , maybe some of the answers are coming in now . - Well done , Peter . - Thanks . - You 're wanted in debriefing . - Right . See you later . - What 's the position , Doctor ? - Alive but in a critical condition . What are the chances of survival ? He was equipped with an advanced apparatus that enabled him to breathe liquid . The helmet was removed when he was picked up . An attempt was made to restore normal breathing , but there 's still liquid left in his lungs . So it 's too early to say yet . Excuse me . Space travel in a liquid environment , just what we 're experimenting with . Apparently they 've done it . I must ask you to leave now . Right . Let me know the moment you have anything , Doctor . Commander Straker . - Is he alive , Doctor ? - Yes . Well ? The general analysis shows that he is humanoid . You mean ... like us ? More or less . Body temperature three degrees paranormal , blood pressure low , muscular development poor . The skin is an artificial green colour , probably from the liquid . However , the hair hasn 't picked up this tint , suggesting the liquid may contain bioaquaphilic compound . That the eyes were protected by plastic shells supports this theory . We 'll know more when we get the computer read-out from the first electro-medical check . It 'll be a few minutes . A man ... from a solar system perhaps a hundred million million miles from earth . - It 's incredible ! - What is ? We can 't be certain yet , but this test shows organ and gland transplants . Heart , liver , left lung , thyroid . D 'you realise what this could mean , Alec ? - It 's still theory . - Theory . Fact . After almost ten years of possible , probable , and confirmed UFO incidents . Fact . On a number of fully documented occasions , mutilated bodies found after UFO attacks . Organs missing . Fact . An electro-medical examination on the first alien we get shows organ transplants . - The doctors aren 't certain . - No . Not yet . But I bet that our proof lies at the end of that corridor . Dr. Shroeder ? Intensive care unit . We have an emergency . I 'm afraid he 's dead . - When can I have a postmortem ? - 48 hours . Make it 24 . Not the details . Just what really matters . The rapid ageing isn 't documented in the report . We 're not sure , but it 's connected with the reaction of earth 's atmosphere on the body . Gentlemen , let 's concern ourselves with the three main questions regarding UFOs . One , where do they come from ? The fact that the lungs were filled with an oxygenated liquid seems to indicate a subjection to phenomenal acceleration and fantastic speed over a long period . Long enough for the skin to pick up the green colouration of the liquid . All this would appear to add up to an extended journey through space , perhaps several months at many times the speed of light . Question number two , who are they ? Obviously , in science and technology , several hundred years in advance of man . But everything in this report seems to add up to a dying race . Hereditary sterility was evident . But by using drugs and advanced transplant techniques , they could have found a way to stop the natural ageing process . They 're also highly intelligent , so they come to earth knowing the risk of contact with our atmosphere . Which brings us inevitably to question number three ... why do they come ? This report indicates five major organ and gland transplants . In the case of the heart , tissue compatibility tests show that it was human in origin . It came from earth , gentlemen . Therefore one of the reasons they must obviously come is to obtain organ replacements . But there may be other reasons . Imagine a dying planet in some distant corner of the universe , its natural resources exhausted , its inhabitants sterile , doomed to extinction . A situation we may one day find ourselves in , gentlemen . So they discover earth , abundant and fertile , able to satisfy their needs . They look upon us not with animosity but with callousness , as we look upon our animals whom we depend on for food . Yes ... it would appear they are driven by circumstance across a billion miles of space , driven on by the greatest force in the universe : survival . The check on the test , sir . - There 's no possible doubt ? - No , sir . Electronic tissue analysis is as positive as a voice-print . Right . You wanted to tell me something . Yes . I wanted to have a word with you before you flew out . - It 's about my sister , isn 't it ? - Yes . I 'm afraid she 's dead , Peter . There 's no longer any doubt . I think you know how sorry I am . What happened ? I don 't think you 'd like to know the details . I think I 'd like to know . Your sister was last seen in the vicinity of a UFO incident nearly ten years ago . The alien recovered from the sea underwent intense medical examination . The heart was a transplant . The donor was Leila Carlin . - What will you tell your parents ? - I don 't know . You realise , of course , that they can never know the truth . 'A funeral without a body . 'A symbol of human compassion . 'The long finger of tragic coincidence 'stretching across a billion miles of space . 'Is this the end or the beginning ? 'Where does the universe end ? 'Where does it begin ? '

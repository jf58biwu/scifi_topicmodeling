 In the beginning , God created beast and man so that both might live in friendship and share dominion overa world at peace . But in the fullness oftime , evil men betrayed God 's trust , and in disobedience to His holy word waged bloody wars , not only against theirown kind , but against the apes , whom they reduced to slavery . Then God , in His wrath , sent the world a savior , miraculously born oftwo apes , who descended on Earth from Earth 's own future . And man was afraid , for both parent apes possessed the powerofspeech . Come on ! Cornelius ! [ Gunfire ] So both were brutally murdered . But the child ape survived and grew up to set his fellow creatures free from the yoke ofhuman slavery . Do . No ! Yet in the aftermath ofthis victory , the surface ofthe world was ravaged by the vilestwar in human history . The great cities ofthe world split asunder and were flattened . And out ofone such city , oursavior led a remnant ofthose who survived in search of greener pastures , where ape and human might forever live in friendship according to divine will . His name was Caesar , and this is his story in those far-offdays . You 'll never make it , Jake . Nah , we 'll make it . I 'll showyou how . Thanks , aldo . You will call me by my proper rank ... General ! Yes , General . Don 't put him in the corral . I won 't be long . Ape shall never kill ape . Ape shall never kill ape . Ape shall never kill ape . Ape shall never kill ape . Shall ape ever kill man ? You 're late , General Aldo . Come and read this to the class . I won 't . You won 't because you can 't , and you can 't because you don 'twantto learn , and it is my duty to report this to Caesar . [ Growls ] If my father were a gorilla , we 'd be learning riding instead ofwriting . [ Laughter ] Silence . Silence . Cornelius , you are Caesar 's son and heir . Being a good rider isn 'tenough for being a good ruler , though in human history , quite a number of military dictators seem to have thoughtso . Now , all of you take up your charcoal sticks and your parchments and copy down what I 've written . The bestshall be hung from these hooks . I can think of betterthings to hang from those hooks . But , Virgil , can we tamperwith time ? - Acceptmy premise . - What premise ? Thatsince man once learned to travel fasterthan sound , he could later have learned to travel fasterthan light . We accept . Imagine a musician giving a live broadcast from whatwas once London to whatwas once New York on a Wednesday . He then travels fasterthan light from London to New York , where he arrives ... as physicists would confirm ... on the previous Tuesday , listens to his own broadcaston the Wednesday , dislikes its quality intensely , then travels back fasterthan lightto London in time for him to decide notto give his broadcast . Come . I 'll prove it to you logically . Good , Cornelius , butyou 've made a mistake here . You have puta " B " in place of the second " P " . Teacher , have you forgotten your own name ? Everyone has always called me teacherthat I had forgotten . " Ape shall never kill Abe . " Thank you , Cornelius . Thatwas a very kind thought . Gorillas . All right , aldo , let 's startwith you . General Aldo . With respect , General Aldo , this is barely legible and will have to be written again . Your capital " A " leans over like a tent in a high wind . Ha ha ha ! And your capital " K " ... " Ape shall never kill Abe . " No , aldo ! No ! Teacher ! Teacher , you 've spoken the unspeakable . In all ouryears of slavery to mankind , the word " no " was the one word we were electrically conditioned to fear . Caesar has forbidden you its utterance in perpetuity . An ape may say no to a human , buta human may never again say no to an ape . Tell him you 're sorry , Abe , and go home while you 've still gota home to go to . I 'll put in a good word foryou with Caesar . General Aldo , I 'm sorry . The writing you destroyed was by Caesar 's son . I did notwantyou to suffer Caesar 's anger ! What do I care for Caesar 's anger ? Letme give you a taste of mine ! Grab him ! Stop , teacher ! Grab him ! Stop ! Grab him . Grab the teacher ! Stop ! Stop ! We 'll teach the teacher a lesson . Throw him in the corral , where all humans belong . I said stop , aldo . He broke the law . With his own mouth , he broke the first law . I am the law . What has he done ? Caesar , I was there . Teacher only reverted to type under provocation . He spoke like a slave master in the old days of our servitude . When we were conditioned to mechanical obedience . He uttered a negative imperative . Could you putthat into words which even Caesar could understand ? Um , he said , " No , aldo . No . " [ Grunts ] The schoolroom was wrecked . The class is ended . The schoolroom is closed ! Nowwe 'll go back to riding horses ! Aldo ! You and yourfriends will return to the schoolroom and put it back in order . Abe , no gorilla is to be dismissed until everything is back in its place . Yes , Caesar . Father , since there won 't be any more school today , may I go out and play ? Can 'tyou study in the house ? I could , Father , but ... Run along and play . Where are my students ? I was just in the midst of explaining my theory oftime relativity . If Caesar permits , I would like my ... Caesar permits . You look concerned , MacDonald . I am , Caesar . I think thatAIdo 's hatred is notconfined to humans . Look out ! I think Aldo may be riding for a fall . If only my mother and father , whom I was too young to remember , if only they 'd lived , perhaps theywould have taughtme if itwas right to kill evil so that good should prevail . Butyou know , Caesar , history shows ... Oh , no , no , no . That is human history , notape history . Ape never kills ape . Oh , here 's the list of ourwinter supplies so far . I 've gotto be getting along . I 'm starving . I could eata horse . A horse ? Oh , you remember Lisa . They used to eat lots ofthings ... dead cattle , dead chickens , dead pigs . Nowwe live and chew nuts atourmaster 's command . Thatwill be all , Julie . Thank you . We are not yourmasters . We 're not your equals . MacDonald , I believe that when you truly growto know and trusta person , you cannot help but like him . When we growto know and trustyour people , then we shall all be equals and remain so until the end ofthe world . Which may be sooner than you think . You are such a pessimist ! Or a prophet . Nowthatapes are atthe helm , the Earth will sail safely through space until the end oftime , and Virgil says time has no end , so , you see , I cannot believe you . Would you believe it if you heard it from the lips of your own parents ? Are my parents alive ? No , buttheir images and theirvoices are . MacDonald , when you talk aboutmy parents , please do notspeak in riddles . I cannotsee them . I cannot hearthem . They came out ofthe future . They cannot give me knowledge . Caesar , you can see them . You can hearthem , and they can give you knowledge . How ? Underthe dead city where we once lived in the archives near the old command post , there are tapes ... sealed tapes ... of Cornelius and Zira being examined by officials ofthe American government . When my brotherwas Governor Breck 's assistant , he told me aboutthem . I knowwhere they are , and I knowthatthey concern Earth 's future , from which your parents came . Butthe city was flattened . The bomb left nothing . Except , I suspect ... the archive section . Indeed , many sections ofthe underground city were designed to survive the impact of a 10-megaton overblast . Well , then the tapes and pictures of my parents ... Are still down there . Ohh ... Oh , MacDonald . I wantto see whatthey look like . I suppose every orphan does . I wantto hear whatthey thought and knew . The city 's radioactive . Oh , yeah , well ... letme see . Who is there among your people who knows something about radioactivity ? No one . And among mine ? Who knows everything abouteverything ? Oh ... Oh , Virgil . Go find him . Lisa , you remember your parents . I was too young when they died to remembermine . I don 'twantto have to remembermy husband . I wantto love him now . Well , Virgil will be with us . Now , we 'll take good care . Say good-bye to Cornelius . I don 'twant him to know I 'm afraid . Cornelius . Cornelius . Cornelius . Father . I 'm going on a journey . Whatwillyou bring me back ? Whatwould you like ? More nuts formy squirrel . He 's growing fast . So are you . One day , you will be as tall as a king . Mandemus . He 's asleep . Noteternally , I trust . Mandemus . Who 's there ? Caesar . What does Caesarwant ? Weapons . Forwhat purpose ? For self-protection in the pursuit of knowledge . Self-protection againstwhom orwhat ? We don 't know . Well , then what is the point of protecting yourself againsta danger ofwhich you have no knowledge in pursuitof a knowledge you do not possess ? Oh , God . Is ita knowledge for good or evil ? All knowledge is for good . Only the use to which you put itcan be good or evil . Well put . Thank you . The sun is rising . I should like to getthis matter settled before itsets . Caesar has appointed me notonly as the keeper ofthis armory , butas the keeper of his own conscience . That is why I have asked six boring questions and now propose to ask a seventh before issuing or not issuing the weapons you require . What is the nature ofthe knowledge you cannotseek withoutweapons ? The knowledge of Earth 's ultimate fate recorded on tapes in the archives of the forbidden city ... Which is contaminated , butstill may be inhabited by humans . Hmm . Come in . Name your protective pick . Three submachine guns . For ? The removal of obstacles . Hmm . 1 ... 2 ... 3 . Nowwhat ? Ammunition . I really don 't hold with knowing the future , even my own , which is short . Ageiger counter . I mean , ifwe knewfor a fact there was an afterlife , and thatthe afterlife was bliss eternal , we 'd all commitsuicide in orderto be able to enjoy it . Pistols . To remove smaller obstacles ? It 's a 3-day journey . With Caesar 's permission , MacDonald maywantto shoot , cook , and eata rabbit . Butwho needs three pistols to shootone rabbit ? Enjoy yourmeal . Thank you . He may be old , but he 's gota mind like a razor . When I was a boy , he was my teacher . Let 's collectour stores and be on ourway . There it is ... orwas . Like a storm atsea , butsolidified . By a bomb from an armory 1,000 times the size of ours . And nobody to keep its owner 's conscience . This is the hell my forefathers used to speak about . [ Geiger CounterTicking ] Do you knowwhere we are , MacDonald ? Yes . Now , this is ... I mean was ... 11th Avenue . Ape Managementwas 2 blocks eastfrom here . The archives section , 2 blocks west , corner of Breck and Agamon . Get us there quickly . [ Ticking ] The governor 's very irritable lately . Who wouldn 't be , living in this hell of radiation for all these years ? Lfthe bomb hadn 't killed the old governor , boredom certainly would have . Alma , ljustwantsomebody to talk to , anybody . We are at best brave and atworstmad to be here . This background radiation alone will give us 300 roentgens per hour . Meaning ? That unless we leave this place within 2 hours , we shall become inmates . This is a ghostcity . I wantto put some flesh on it . Radioactive flesh ? Well , we 're all radiated , butat leastwe 're active . [ Ticking ] [ Ticking Gets Louder ] It 's getting stronger . We must hurry . [ Alarm Beeps ] Oh , Governor , look ! F-6 ! F-6 ! [ Beeping ] Alert Mendez . Mendez to control room . Mendez to control room . Mendez to control room . Somebody 's breached the warning system atentry F-6 . One of our scavengers . No . It 's been locked foryears . Itcouldn 't have been one of us . Itmust have been someone else . Well , that 's impossible . There is no one else . We mustactquickly . - Alma . - Yes , sir ? Work the B console . Quick , Mendez . Quick ! Quick ! Oh , quicker ! Faster ! [ Ticking ] Keep going . No , no . Back . This is the place . That 's Caesar , come back to reconquer his kingdom . Doesn 't he knowthat the bomb did that ? [ Ticking ] [ Ticking Gets Louder ] We 're still all right . This way . Quicker ! Quicker ! There . Hold it . Can anything live down here for long ? Oh , yes . But in the end , not recognizably . But in the end , not recognizably . The black man is the brother of my predecessor 's personal assistant . He supervised the archives . I don 'tthink I knowthe orangutan . Look ! It 's been there foryears . The late governor had this whole place equipped with cameras to forestall ape conspiracies , as I remember . Hmm . Archives . We haven 't been in there since , uh ... I wonderwhatthe devil theywant in there . We 'll find the tape thatwe 're looking for underthe heading of " Presidential Commission . " " Proceedings ofthe Presidential Commission on Alien Visitors , 1973 . " Is this it ? Let 's see . Yes , that 's it . Now , ifthis thing works , the picture should come out on thatscreen overthere . All security forces , alert . All security forces , alert . Check outall sections in areas M-5 . Apprehend 3 strangers you will find there : One human and two apes . Butcaution . I repeat , caution . Lfthey resist , you may shoot , butshootto maim . We wantthem alive for interrogation . Lfwe shoot , we break 12 years of peace . Yes , it has been rather boring , hasn 't it ? My mother . Who won yourwar ? Itwasn 't ourwar . Itwas the gorillas 'war . What did the spaceship 's date meter read after Earth 's destruction ? 3950 . And you talk to your pupils abouteternity . There are only 3 . There must be more , but howmany ? We 'll know when we getthem . My father . That 's my father . How did apes first acquire the powerofspeech ? They learned to refuse . On a historic day , an ape spoke a word which had been spoken to him by humans . He said , " no . " No wonder all of mankind thirsted formy blood and wanted my birth aborted . In the year 3950 , apes will destroy Earth . Notapes , gorillas . Besides , that 's only one future . How can there be more than one ? You remember the old motorways ? I believe thattime is like an endless motorway with an infinite number of lanes all running from the past into the future . Adriver could change his lanes and change his future . If you left this room right now , you might wind up shot dead . If you left a minute later , you mightsurvive . It 's a blind choice , butyou can change lanes . I knowwhat it is I wantto change . [ Rattle ] [ Rattle ] [ Rattle ] The camera . Itmoved . Are you sure ? Virgil 's right . Governor , we just lostthe TVmonitor . I 'm not interested in equipmentfailures . Itwasn 'ta failure . Itwas destroyed , sir . We 've gotto find anotherway outof here . Is there anotherway ? They got pastyou ? Then shooton sight . Nevermind about bringing them here . Just getthem . Don 't letanyone escape alive ! Sections 2-5 and R-7 and 8 , form a group here . Quick ! Quick ! All right , move out ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Hurry ! Run ! Run ! I 've gotyour guns . We need another patrol . Quickly , men . Hurry . Hurry . The restof you go to M-5 . Whatare you waiting for ? To R-8 , through the transverse ! Aah ! All forces into exit level 3 . They 're getting away ! Kill them ! Kill them ! Kill them ! [ Gunshot ] You knew every boltand nut in those corridors . You have 100 armed men . How could they escape ? Theywere fast and smart , Governor Kolp . Many of my men were sick , and the chimp surprised us . Yeah . He surprised me too , once , But he 's an animal . He 's only an animal . No , Governor . He 's more than an animal . He can speak . So can they all . So speech makes them human ? Speech makes them intelligent , and intelligence may make them not human , but humane . Perhaps they came in peace . Idiot . Theywere armed . From whatwe saw on the monitor , only fortheir self-protection . Letthem return in peace . To where ? To whereverthey live . So they can return to exterminate those of us the bomb hasn 't already exterminated ? Where do they live ? They came with few provisions . Itcan 't be far . Which way did they head ? They headed north , Governor . Organize scout parties , assemble workable equipment , and followthem to their camp . Yes , Governor Kolp . Why , Governor ? So that we can exterminate them . Stop ! It 's Caesar ! We should have stayed in the city . Visiting the city is forbidden . I know . I forbade it . Then why ? Aldo , if a king forbids his subjects to wear a crown , that doesn 'tmean he can 'twear one himself . Caesar is Caesar . He wentto the city for a reason . What reason ? I went looking formy past , but I found our future . Explain ! You wouldn 't understand . Aldo will make the future ... with this ! Well , then Aldo may very soon be in the past . Hee hee . Hee hee . Hee hee . Aah ! Cornelius ! Cornelius , are you all right ? No , Mother . I 'm just dead . Dead ? We were playing war . War ? Cornelius , hasn 'tyourfather explained thatwar is nota game ? Yes , Mother . Hasn 't he also forbidden you to playwith guns ? Yes , Mother . Then you 'll stop it . Yes , Mother . Now , come along . Fatherwants us . My friends , I have convened this extraordinary meeting ofthe council in orderthat I may report upon an action which I deemed necessary : A reconnaissance expedition to the forbidden city with Virgil and MacDonald as my aides . Why MacDonald ? Why nota soldier ? Because we went in peace to whatwe thought would be a dead city . But in case there were some survivors , we took MacDonald with us so that he could parley with them and secure permission for our search . Survivors there are ... maimed , mutated , hostile , and human . Did the humans followyou here ? We saw no sign of it , butwe must prepare forthe day when they may come outofthe city , when they may come to find us . No humans in council ! No humans in council ! - No ! - No ! - No ! - No ! - No ! - No ! - No ! - No ! - No ! - No ! - No ! - No ! - No ! - No ! - No ! - No ! - No ! Yes ! They are here because I sentforthem . Nowthatwe knowthe danger , we need their help and their counsel . - No ! - No ! - No ! Yes ! Come . We shall notsit in council with humans . Now , let us reason together and make plans . Governor , somewhere along the line of history , this bloody chain reaction has gotto stop . Adestroys B , B destroys C , C destroys A and is destroyed by D , who destroys E. Before anyone knows where they are , there won 't be anyone left to know anything anywhere . Governor , the captain has come back . We found it , Governor . We found Ape City . Where ? This is a gorilla outpost . Below is a valley with orchards and vineyards , enough to feed hundreds . Here is Ape City . Was itvery large ? It is of a size we can deal with , sir . Were you seen ? No , sir . Caesarwas too busy with a council ofwar . One day soon , they 'll be coming for us . No . We 're going afterthem ... now . Captain , you have your orders . Caesar , on the night ofthe fires , you swore an oath that in the future apes and humans would live together in kindness and peace . Why are you nowmaking every sort of preparation to break thatoath ? Because unlike the humans in our city , those in the forbidden city are mad ... mad enough notto want peace and friendship , butenmity and war . Did they tellyou that ? Oh , yes . Yes . By opening fire on us without giving us a chance to explain . You were trespassing on theirterritory . But , Lisa , we didn 't know the citywas inhabited . But how , if you didn 'tspeak to them , do you know its inhabitants are mad ? Lisa , you didn 'tsee them . They 're ... oh ... They 're malformed . Like the freaks in your fosterfather 's circus ? Were they mad ? What 's malformed ? Cornelius , go to bed . I 'm giving Riki his water . Lisa , freaks are different . These humans are the end product of nuclear radiation . They are mutant , and they 're mad . Keep all emergency channels open . Yes , Governor . AII emergency channels will remain open . If anything should miscarry , I 'll signalyou as arranged . Yes , sir . Hurry , man . We need it ! The school bus will be operational , Governor . The restofthe convoy willjoin us at junction C. Getmoving . [ Chattering ] Riki ! Well ... they have guns . We have no guns . We shall take the guns , and we shall beatthem . [ AII Growling ] We are the elite . We are the super-race . We have the rightto lead . Without us , there would be no army . [ AII Growling ] We need power , guns ! [ Growling ] We need power ! Guns ! Guns . Guns are power ! We shall getthem , and we 'll beatthem with guns . We will smash the humans . [ Growling ] All humans ! And then we will smash Caesar ! [ Twig Snaps ] Hmm ? Look ! It 's Caesar 's son . And he overheard everyword we said . Cornelius , come down . Come down , or else . [ Grunt ] Father ! Cornelius ? Mother ! Aah ! Grrr ! [ Twig Snaps ] [ Grunt ] Cornelius ! I only heard about it this morning . His squirrel is missing . He must have been looking for it . How is Cornelius ? Hurt . He 's badly hurt . Oh ! Oh ! Speak the truth . Even ifwe had a hospital ... I 'm not going to tell Caesar , notyet . He still believes he can change the future . Humans , going towards our city . I 'll get him . Aah ! Get ready to fire . Fire ! The doctor is doing her best . I don 't believe Cornelius can live . Caesar does . He refuses to leave his side . MacDonald , how can a benevolent God allow a branch of his own tree to crack and injure an innocentchild ? It didn 'tcrack , Virgil . Itwas cut . Order atcouncil ! Order ! Order ! The humans are attacking . They 've killed one gorilla and wounded another . Tell them . We were scouting desertapproaches to the city and sawtheir army . They fired . My companion was killed . I have come to warn you . And how long before they get here ? Soon . So now , we must prepare . Take the humans out . Lock them all in the corral . Aldo ! AIdo , you can 't do this ! You 're acting against Caesar 's orders . Caesar is not here . Hey ! Whatthe ... Hey ! Jake . Strongman , take him to the corral . Take all humans to the corral . Take all humans to the corral . All humans , take them to the corral . Where are you going ? Martial law has been declared . Everybody is to stay in their homes . Bywhose orders ? Go home ! We want guns ! Guns are power . Nowwe go and get guns ! Mandemus . Who 's there ? Aldo . General Aldo . What do you want ? Guns ! Guns ! Whatwillyou do with them ? We shall do with them whatwe will . " Do whatyou will " is the devil 's law . And who are you , Mandemus , God ? I am the keeper of Caesar 's conscience . And I am the keeper of Caesar 's army ! Under allegiance to Caesar ! Where is he ? Mandemus , as I speak , our city is being attacked by humans from without and within . Who cares where Caesar is ? I care ! There is a law thatweapons may only be issued from this armory under directorders from Caesar and not underthreats from one of his thicker-headed subordinates forwhom warmeans only personal glory . Now , find me Caesar . I will listen to him . First , listen to this . Take every gun in the place , everything . Getthe ammo boxes . Getthe handguns , grenades . Stop ! Stop ! Caesarforbids you ! Ah ! Well , there it is : Ape City . When we leave , I don 'twantto see one tree leftstanding , 2 pieces ofwood nailed together , or anything leftalive . I want itto look like thatcitywe came from . Whatthe devil is all that rubbish down there ? It looks like some sort of barricade , sir . Nothing thata couple of flame bombs won 'ttake care of . Caesar , forgive me , but I couldn 't get here before now . Aldo has seized power . He 's broken into the armory and imprisoned all humans in the corral . MacDonald ? He was dragged from the council meeting by Aldo 's gorillas . I can 't leave Cornelius . He needs me . Every ape and human in Ape City needs you now . I think you should go to Cornelius . Father ? They ... hurtme . Theywant ... to hurtyou . Who hurtyou ? The humans ? No . Then who ? Sh ... Shall ... Shall I be ... malformed ? No . One day you are going to be as tall as a king . [ Sob ] All right , Captain , lay the smoke screen . When I give the signal , start the bombardment . Men and equipment outofthe bus . Deploy yourweapons , quickly ! All is in order , sir . All right . Let 's go . He said they hurt him . Who ? Who would hurt him ? I think you 'll have your answer , and soon . What do you know ? That 's what I know . You did this . For security . Did you also raid the armory forthe same reason ? For security ! Caesar , Caesar ! I orderyou to stop this ! I orderyou to stop it now and release those people ! See ? Aldo was right . War has come . Let 's go . Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Go to the barricade ! To the barricade ! [ Gunfire ] Come on ! Go to the barricade ! They 're laying a smoke screen . Here they come . Where 's Aldo ? Probably the other side ofthe valley by now . Hurry ! Fall back , fall back ! Fall back . Go back to the village . Getaway from the fire ! Fall back ! Hurry ! Leave the barricade ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Get back to the village . Nothing leftalive ! You can 'tstay here any longer . You must save yourself . Ah ! Caesar . Your people weakened our city by rebelling against your human masters . Butwe who survive will create a new race , and you and yours will be brought low , and you shall learn again what it is to have a master . Ha ! You 're learning already ... clever ape . Oh , no . Ape . Clever ape . Butthen , you always were clever . I was told how you chose your own name . Butevery Caesar must have his Brutus . Did you knowthat , ape ? Do you understand that , ape ? And now Ape City is aboutto lose its king . No , Kolp ! No ! Nowfight like apes ! Stop ! Stop . No killing . Take them captive . Getmoving ! No , no ! Don 't kill them . Take them prisoner . No . No , Virgil . All right , Virgil . Let 's go . No prisoners . No prisoners ! [ Gunfire ] Dismount . Hail Caesar ! Hail Caesar ! Hail Caesar ! Hail Caesar ! Hail Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar ! We 've done it ! Hold ! Letthe humans go , Virgil , all ofthem . No ! They stay . Aldo says whatwe do now . They have done nothing . They shall go free . You like humans ? You wantthem outofthe corral ? All right . Kill them ! Aah ! Kill them . Kill them all . Stop . Stop . No more killing , aldo . Put down yourweapons . Take them back to the armory . No ! We shall keep the guns ! Move , Caesar , orwe shall killyou . [ Grunting ] Ape has never killed ape , letalone an ape child . [ Grunting ] Aldo has killed an ape child . The branch did not break . Itwas cut ... with a sword . [ Grunting ] [ AII Growling ] Aldo . You ... you killed . Ah ! Ah ! Aldo killed . [ AII Growling ] Aldo has broken ourmostsacred law . [ AII Growling ] Our child . He killed our child . What 's the matter with them ? I guess you mightsay they just joined the human race . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . You murdered my son . You murdered my son . You murdered my son ! [ Hiss ] [ Hiss ] Aah ! Should one murder be avenged by another ? Only the future can tell . So let us start building it . Lfwe appearto be lacking in gratitude , Caesar , what have we to be grateful for ? If you mean to set us free , then free us completely . What do you mean ? We are not your children , Caesar . We have a destiny , too ... as equals , respecting each other , living together , with love . Love ? The human way is violence and death . Aldo wasn 't human , was he , Caesar ? Virgil ... you are a good and wise ape . And you , Caesar , are a good and wise king . We 'll rebuild what 's ruined and begin again . Tell me something , MacDonald . Can we make the future whatwe wish ? I 've heard that it 's possible , Caesar . There . Everyweapon is back in its proper place . Caesar , I want to ask a favor . This armory 's been my home for 27 years . You may live in itfor the restof your days . But I don 'twant to live in it . No , no . Nowthat the danger is over , I wantto see it destroyed . Blown up . The greatest danger of all is that danger never ends . And so , Mandemus , we must be patient ... and wait . We still wait , my children . Butas I look at apes and humans living in friendship , harmony , and at peace now some 600 years after Caesar 's death , at leastwe wait with hope forthe future . Lawgiver , who knows aboutthe future ? Perhaps only the dead .

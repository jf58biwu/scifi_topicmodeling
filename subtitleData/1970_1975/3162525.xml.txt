 You 're certainly a great help , Galen . We 're trying not to leave tracks ! Stay closer to the water . Don 't be afraid to get your feet wet . My tracks are not cause for suspicion in this part of the world . And besides , we are not quite as fond of water as you humans . Oh , boy . I wonder if this is Pismo Beach ? Or Malibu ? Hey , look ! Come on ! Hey , it 's an old man , Al . A survivor . That 's not a survivor . He 's a victim . Come on , Pete . Watch him , Pete , but keep moving . Galen , let me have your knife . At least he 's still breathing . Pete ... Somebody must have put him on the outgoing tide , deliberately . Let 's get him out of here . Here we go . Hey , look . - Over here . - Yeah . Here we go . There . Hey , there , now . What 's your name , huh ? Hey , come on , you understand ? In shock or deaf ? It 's hard to say . He might not understand us . I am dead . Leave me . He understands . I don 't . Hey , listen to me , old man . Listen to me . What 's your name ? Where do you come from ? I am dead . You heard him . Let 's go . Well , we can 't just leave him here . You listen to him . Now , you 're just talking yourselves into trouble . There you go , pal . Come on , you wanna tell me your name now ? I am dead . The gods have willed it . Look , you know that , and we know that . All we 'd like to know is your name while you were alive . Gahto . My name was Gahto . Gahto , huh ? Well , that 's a start . Hey , Pete , look . For identification , maybe ? Maybe . I 'll tell you one thing , it 'll be on there for life . That 's a band of an enforced labor camp . He 'll be killed if he 's found so far from a permitted area . - What 's a permitted area ? - It varies . It 's some distance from the labor center . It 's a method they have to stop humans from straying . I am dead . Leave me . The gods have willed it . Poor guy , somebody sold him a bill of goods . Question . If he wants to be dead , why can 't he be dead ? I 've known a lot of humans who would be better off ... Is that your question ? Well ... Here 's the answer : Galen , you 'll stay here and keep an eye on him . We 'll go out and scout the area and see if we can find out who old Gahto here belongs to . Does that meet with your approval ? Come on , Pete , let 's take a walk . Hey , don 't mind him . He just got up on the wrong side of the cave , huh ? - See you later . - Here . Thanks . Gahto . Gahto ! Shark ! Shark ! Man . If this is Paradise Cove , they 've sure made some changes . Hey , Pete , look . The bracelets . What do you think ? I don 't know , Pete . They 've got a lot of artillery down there . You ! What are you doing here ? Who are you ? Where do you come from ? Well , actually , we 're just passing through . - We would have called ahead , but ... - Silence ! This way ! Stop ! Stay ! Watch them ! You . Do you know of Gahto ? Wait ! Does Gahto live here ? Looks like old Gahto 's got a lot of acquaintances and no close friends . They 're stray humans , sir . I found them hiding near the fishing area . Probably waiting to steal fish . All right ! Don 't just stand there . More problems ! Send them in ! That 's all I need ! Three wagonloads behind already this period ! And the fertilizer factories wanting more , more , more ! And you ? How many fish do you have in your gullet , eh ? - We didn 't steal any fish . - You wear no band of a fisherman . How else would you get fish to eat if not by stealing them ? - Lf you 'll let me explain . We ... - Silence ! If they 're not fishermen , they 're of no use to me . - Take them out and kill them . - Come ! Wait a minute , now . Hold it ! You 've made a mistake . We 're probably about the two best fishermen in this part of the world . If you lie , you die . Oh , no lie . On the level . Nobody fishes , but nobody fishes , like we do . How is it that you 're not wearing the bracelet of a fisherman ? We were farmers . We were just released from a big farm inland . Because all we 've ever wanted to do is fish . We 've been practicing . You . You have good wind ? To fish long underwater ? Yes , sir ! Do you have your release papers ? - No , sir . Unfortunately , we lost them . - Yeah , while we were fishing . I could use two more good producers . Have to discard the old ones . Takes forever to grow the new ones . We 'll let the fire decide . The fire ? We 'll test you tomorrow . If you can prove your swimming ability under the sheet of flame I 'll band you myself . Two new producers in the prime . Bandor will be delighted . Actually , I don 't think that we 're really ready for swimming under fire . Then it 's out of my hands , of course . You will be killed immediately , before the gods can be offended . Guard them ! No food before the test . If we have to kill them I don 't want to waste any fish rations on them . Quotas , quotas . Out ! Here . Maybe you are not too dead to have one of these . Come on . Eat . I have failed the gods . I am dead . My friends have a saying , I think it goes like this : " You are a pain in the neck . " And if anything happens to them I will personally feed you to the sharks , piece by piece . It is the will of the gods . Oh , shut up ! It is the will of Galen that you stay right here . They 've been gone a day . I 'm gonna see if I can find them . You understand ? What do you think his chances are , Pete ? He 's probably been in training . We get to go that route without even a test run . Well , it can be done . He made it . Look at that . Limbs as strong as a young horse . Lungs like a whale 's ! When the run of fish is good they should produce an extra two , three hundred pounds a day . - Test them . - Come . Good luck , pal . Looks like you won the toss . I say , I think that 's the starting gun . You 're a hard act to follow . Showoff . As one big producer to another I hope we 've graduated and don 't have to take more tests . - Right . - Come ! Well , well . Bandor will arrive tomorrow with new quotas , no doubt . He will expect me to squirm and complain . He always wanted to put his nephew in charge here . I think I will surprise Bandor with these new fishermen . I want to see his face . Bring them along ! - Did they say any more ? - They said nothing . I am sure they have seen my father . Gahto is alive . Silence ! If the gods hear you speak his name , they 'll punish us all . The sea has taken him . It 's the law . Now be still . Well . Let them occupy the hut of the old discarded fisherman . You hear that ? There you are ! Now , I warned you the next time you strayed you would be punished severely , and I meant it ! - Now , you come along with me ! - Wait ! Stay ! Who are you ? Permit me to speak with you , sir . Stay there ! What a lovely place . My name is Zooma , and I am on this expedition from Central City and you have just found my two rather ignorant servants . They 're always wandering off . You know how it is . I 'm very grateful to you , and I 'll just take them now . Now , hold on . This is all very irregular . - That 's not the story they told me . - It isn 't ? Well , of course , it isn 't . They are liars . They 're the most terrible liars . They lie all the time about everything , you know . But I 'll take them off your hands . It is out of my hands . Since they have lied , only the gods of the sea can decide their fate . Well that sounds reasonable enough . Who are these gods of the sea ? The sharks . I object ! I won 't have my servants fed to the sharks to satisfy some primitive custom . I am sorry , my friend . It may not appeal to your sophisticated Central City taste but in areas of production like this with minimum security , it is the law . Send them out ! Wait ! At least , let me have the satisfaction of giving these troublesome humans a piece of my mind . Very well . See any chance of getting out of this at all ? I don 't . Here . Take this knife , it may help . Remind me someday to tell you how grateful we both are . Liars ? Zooma . Enough , enough ! Send them to the gods ! Watch it , Galen . I don 't think they 're really particular who they shoot . Move ! - Stay together till I reach the kelp . - I 'll try to decoy them . Well , that 's that . Get the production started . Look ! Well , I think that 's that . Your law has been carried out . Now I think I 'll take my slaves and be on my way . I am not so sure about that . The float carrying old Gahto to the gods . It 's on the beach with the lashings cut . - Someone has defied the gods ! - It is sacrilege . High treason ! I knew it . He 's alive . The old man can 't be far . Find him ! I don 't think they can leave just now . This is a matter for Bandor to decide . If the old man lives someone must die . Gahto ? Ridiculous ! Come on . Why did you stop me ? Gahto is dead . Some of us would be better off if you were , but you are not . Now you have got to stay out of sight ! I am dead . Oh , I am tempted . I am tempted ! Look , unless you stay out of sight , others may be killed . You don 't want that to happen , do you ? It does not matter . It may not matter to you but most humans do not share your enthusiasm with dying . Look , I promise you , Gahto , I promise you sooner or later , you will be able to die . In the meantime , stay in the cave ! Galen , did you see him ? - He was out on the beach ! - Gahto ? Don 't mention his name . Someone might hear you . I wish I 'd never heard it , believe me . Me too . I got him back in the cave . I hope he stays there . We 'd like to thank you for rushing in and telling them we were liars . - It was a big help . - I couldn 't think of what else to do . And besides , if I hadn 't found you you would 've been banded as fishermen for the rest of your lives . We gotta do something . There 's a big wheel coming tomorrow . That 's Bandor . He 's in charge of many of the producing areas . And he presides over the banding of the fishermen ceremony . You 're pretty thick with Hurton . Can 't you get us out of here ? I am primarily concerned that Hurton 's patrols do not find Gahto . If he points you two out , you will be killed instantly . Move ! - Today you spear fish ! - Wonderful . - Move ! - All right ! Where was he when we needed him yesterday ? Move along , you two ! All right , back in the water ! Move ! Great way to make a living . That 's why we 're doing it , to keep on living . You know , you go to school , you work hard you wind up fishing for raw material for a fertilizer factory . Year after year they raise my quotas . The law requires that I discard worn out producers like Gahto who can no longer pass the test even before new offspring can be raised to take their place . I do so sympathize with your problem . But then , these two slaves are mine . I 'm not sure the law of possession holds out here . After all , they came to me and asked to be fishermen . But they 're liars . I told you that . They are such terrible liars . - The gods of the sea said differently . - They 'll try to escape . I am sure of it . I am having them closely watched . If they try to leave , they 'll be shot . Then you 've gained nothing and I 'm out two good slaves . But I 've told you that is out of my hands . When Bandor comes for the ceremony of the bracelets , he 'll decide . Because Bandor is interested in increased production like you you think he 'll decide in your favor . Are you questioning the ethics of Bandor ? He has high connections in Central City . He knows Urko himself . Urko himself ? - That 's what he said . - That 's just great . Bandor knows Urko . Urko knows us . All the more reason we should split before the big man gets here . I agree , except Hurton 's got anti-split devices all over town . All of this over old Gahto , who no one wanted in the first place . Hello . Gahto is my father . Come on over here . It 's all right . Galen 's a friend . Here , sit down . - Why did they do that to your father ? - It is the law . So that 's why Hurton looked at you when the rider came with the news . Romar , my husband , is afraid we will both die , that we 'll all be punished . Now listen . We saved your father against his wishes . We took him to a hiding place but he 'll die if we don 't help him . - Take me to him . - We 'd like to . - But they 've got us heavily guarded . - I can help . You 're prisoners . But remember , I can come and go as I please . So ? Well , if she 's with me , we can just casually stroll right out of the village . All right . Listen . Leave here like you 're just taking a walk . Ready for din-din ? - Soma ? - Take it easy . Your wife 's all right . - Where is Soma ? - Quiet . You 'll wake the rifleman . Our friend took her to her father . Calm down . - It 's a trick ! The gods want to trap her ! - Hold it ! It 's a trick ! Soma ? Soma ? Soma ! Wait here ! - I can 't move it . - It went clean through . You 're lucky . - I won 't pass the test for Bandor . - What do you mean ? I knew it . Now I 'll be given to the sea gods like Gahto . I knew it was death to mention his name . You did this . Sir , a visitor . Welcome , Bandor , welcome . Did you have a good trip ? Tiring . Whenever you greet me with such big smiles I feel you are holding bad news behind your back . Not so . In fact , I have a special surprise for you . Hey ! The wagon ropes are gone . The factory workers are getting worse not sending wagon ropes back . Get some in the storehouse . - You should have checked . - I should have ? How about you ? - One of them should have checked . - Check . Thank you . I 'm not interested in projections . I 'm interested in production . - My nephew said that . Very clever ? - Yes . Very clever . Unfortunately , we cannot catch fish with words . Or promises . What is this great news ? You have three young ones for me to band to replace the old one you discarded ? Only one has been raised to age and size . But two full-grown fishermen have joined us like they were sent by the gods . Now Hurton is claiming partnership with the gods . Bring in the two new fishermen . You 'll see . Two excellent recruits . They not only spear fish while swimming under the test of fire they kill sharks with their bare hands . Two full-grown fishermen for you to band . Sent by the gods you say ? Well , actually , they are runaway slaves . Once owned by a rather irresponsible chimpanzee named Zooma . - I knew there was some catch to it . - I dispute his claim to them . He 's here ? To claim them ? Does he have papers ? Here , you see ? Strong . Many prime years of production in them . - You say this " Zooma " has no papers ? - None . Or why would he have stolen one of our female slaves ? These skins have not been long in the water . But they kill sharks with their bare hands . I would say this Zooma has made an unwise move . We will just let him keep his worthless female . Tomorrow , at the ceremony , I will band these two myself . I knew you would decide quickly and fairly . Someone has to keep these producing villages going . The fish is burning . I don 't care if I ever see another fish again , ever . I don 't feel like spearing fish and ducking sharks the rest of my life . This thing better work , Alan . It will , Pete . Or we 're gonna be fitted with a pair of permanent handcuffs . Come , human . Don 't worry . Everything 's settled . You and your father have nothing to worry about . Come along . New areas are being opened for crops . More fertilizer is needed , which means more fish . There must be a limit . - We can 't keep increasing production . - Now , now . If you keep getting these god-sent producers ... - And where are they ? - What ? I don 't see these two new surprises who kill sharks with their bare hands . Guard . Where are the two new producers ? - Sir , they 're missing . They 're not here . - Missing ? Your surprises are getting tiresome , Hurton . Okay , Al . Let 's go fishing ! There they are ! - Shoot them ! - Wait ! All right , Gahto . This is where you stop being a dead discard and become a live hero . If you want your daughter to live , go . - Gahto ? - That 's it . Bring it in . Easy ! Easy ! Very good . What is this ? Fish by the dozens from some ... From a net , mighty Bandor . It can trap more fish in a few hours than your men spear in a month ! Just another of the surprises I promised you . And even old men and women can fish in this way . You have fish . The gods will be pleased . So you can let old people and injured live on in your village . - That is so . That is certainly so . - All part of my plan . Now the producers will have all they want to eat and the security problems will be almost eliminated . What has this discard to do with your plan , Hurton ? Mighty Bandor , Hurton has saved his greatest surprise for last . Tell them , Zooma . This magic webbing , which brings in fish , is all Gahto 's idea . Hurton has saved Gahto so that he can teach others how to make and mend the webbing . It 's easy . Hurton , I knew you could do it . Now , that is why I have kept you on here despite efforts of those higher-ups to replace you with my nephew . I appreciate it . I always do my best , as you can see . Extra rations for all from now on . A celebration . And first , we start with the banding ceremony . Sir , would the mighty Bandor do us the honor of assisting in the greatest catch of all ? - What is that ? - Come with me , sir . It 's not fitting the greatest bounty of the sea be taken by a human . Therefore , this revolving wheel will be held by Zooma . I don 't understand . Oh , well , you see the largest fish can break the net but this cord will entangle it in its loop . - Well , here , you hold tight . - " Tight " ? - Tight . - Tight . Come on , come along . We must not keep Bandor waiting . Aye , aye , sir . You watch this . Grab a paddle . Would you rather swim ? Me ? End of the line . Shoot ! Shoot ! At what ? I said you were liars . I had no idea you were that good at it . Listen , Galen , I wanna talk with you about that . I 'd like to discuss this owner-slave relationship . Well , I don 't wanna have to pull you two out of another scrape right away ! Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH ]

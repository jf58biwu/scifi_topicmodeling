 You 're a big help , Galen . We 're trying not to leave tracks . Go closer to the water , don 't be afraid to get your feet wet . My tracks are not cause for suspicion in this part of the world , and besides , we are not quite so fond of water as you humans . - Yuck . - Oh , boy . I wonder if this is Pismo Beach or Malibu . Hey , look ! Come on . Aaah ! Hey , it 's an old man , Al . A survivor . That 's not a survivor , It 's a victim , Come on , Pete . Hey ! Watch him , Pete , but keep moving . Galen , let me have your knife . At least he 's still breathing . Pete ... somebody must have put him on the outgoing tide , deliberately . Let 's get him out of here . Here we go . Hey ! Look . Yeah , yeah . - Over here . - Yeah . There we go . There . Hey , there now . What 's your name , huh ? Hey , come on . You understand ? In shock or deaf ? It 's hard to say . He might not understand us . I ... am dead . Leave me . He understands , I don 't . Hey , listen to me , old man . Listen to me . What 's your name ? Where do you come from ? I ... am dead . You heard him . Let 's go . Well , we can 't just leave him here . You listen to him . Now , you 're just talking yourself into trouble . Hey , there you go , pal . Come on . You want to tell me your name now ? I am dead . The gods have willed it . Look , you know that , and we know that . All we 'd like to know is , what was your name while you were still alive ? Gahto . My name was Gahto . Gahto , huh ? Well , that 's a start . Hey . Pete , look . For identification , maybe ? It 's gonna be on there for life , That 's a band of an enforced labor camp . He 'll be killed if he 's found wandering so far from the permitted area , - What 's a permitted area ? - Oh , it varies . It 's some distance from the labor center . It 's a method they have to stop humans from straying . I am dead . Believe me . The gods have willed it . Somebody sure sold him a bill of goods . Question : If he wants to be dead , why can 't he be dead ? I 've known a lot of humans who would be better off - Is that your question ? Tsk . Well - Then here 's the answer , Galen , you 're gonna stay here and keep an eye on him . We 're gonna go out and scout the area . and see if we can find out who old Gahto here belongs to . Does that meet with your approval ? Come on . Pete . Let 's take a walk . Hey , don 't mind him . He just got up on the wrong side of the cave , huh ? - See you later . - Here . Thanks , Gahto . Gahto ! Shark ! Shark ! Man . If this is Paradise Cove , they 've sure made some changes . Yeah . Hey . Pete , look . The bracelets . What do you think ? I don 't know , Pete , They 've got a lot of artillery down there . You ! What are you doing here ? Who are you ? Where did you come from ? Well , actually , we were just passing through . We would 've called ahead - Silence ! This way ! Stop ! Stay ! Watch them . You . You know Gahto ? Wait , Does Gahto live here ? Looks like old Gahto 's got a lot of acquaintances and no close friends . Yep . They 're stray humans , sir , I found them hiding near the fishing area . probably waiting to steal fish . All right , don 't just stand there ! More problems . Send them in ! Hmm ! That 's all I need ! Three wagon loads behind already this period . and the fertilizer factory is wanting more ! More ! More ! Hmm ? And you , how many fish do you have in your gullet , eh ? We didn 't steal any fish . Huh ! You 're wearing no band of a fisherman . How else would you get fish if not by stealing them ? - Well , if you 'll let me explain - - Silence ! If they 're not fishermen , they 're of no use to me . Take them out and kill them . Wait a minute ! You 're making a mistake . We 're probably about the two best fishermen in this part of the world . If you lie , you die . Ah , no lie . On the level . Nobody , but nobody , fishes like we do , Well , how is it that you 're not wearing the bracelet of a fisherman ? We were farmers . We were just released from a big farm inland . Because all we 've ever wanted to do was fish . We 've been practicing . You ! You have good wind ... to fish long underwater ? Yes , sir . Do you have your release papers ? Uh , no , sir . Unfortunately , we lost them . - While we were fishing . - Oh . I could use two more good producers . Have to discard the old ones . It takes forever to grow the new ones . Hmm . We 'll let the fire decide . The fire ? We 'll test you tomorrow . If you can prove your swimming ability under the sheet of flame . I 'll band you myself . Two new producers in the prime . Bandor will be delighted . Actually , I don 't think that we 're really ready for swimming under fire . Then it 's out of my hands . of course . You will be killed immediately ... before the gods can be offended , Guard them . No food before the test . If we have to kill them , I don 't want to waste any fish rations on them . Quotas , quotas . Out ! Here . Maybe you are not too dead ... to have one of these . Come on . Eat . I have failed the gods , I am dead . Uh-huh . You know , my friends have a saying . I think it goes something like this : You are a pain in the neck . And if anything happens to them . I will personally feed you to the sharks , piece by piece . It is the will of the gods . Oh , shut up . It is the will of Galen that you stay right here . They 've been gone for a whole day . I 'm gonna see if I can find them . Do you understand ? Well . What do you think his chances are , Pete ? He 's probably been in training . We get to go that route without even a test run . Well , it can be done . He made it . Look at that . Limbs as strong as a young horse . Lungs like a whale 's . When the run of the fish is good . they should produce an extra 200 , 300 pounds a day , Test them . Come . Good luck , pal . Looks like you won the toss . I say , I think that 's the starting ' gun . You 're a hard act to follow . Show-off . As one big producer to another . I hope we 've graduated , we don 't have to take any more tests . - Right . - Move ! Well , well , Ho-ho ! Bandor will arrive tomorrow with new quotas , no doubt . He will expect me to squirm and complain . He always wanted to put his nephew in charge here . I think I will surprise Bandor with these new fishermen . I want to see his face ! Bring them along ! - Did they say any more ? - They said nothing . I am sure they have seen my father . Gahto is alive . Silence . If the guards hear you speak his name , they 're gonna punish us all . The sea has taken him . It 's the law . Now be still . Well , let them occupy the hut of the old discarded fisherman . - Hear that ? - Aha ! There you are . Now , I warned you ... the next time you strayed , you would be punished severely , and I meant it ! Now , you come along with me ! Wait ! Stay ! Who are you ? Ah ! Permit me to speak with you , sir . Stay there ! Oh ! Ah ! What a lovely place ! My name is Zuma , and I am on this expedition from Central City . And you have just found my two rather ignorant servants . Always wandering off . You know how it is . I 'm very grateful to you . I 'll just take them now . Now , hold on . This is all very irregular . That 's not the story they told me . It isn 't ? Well , of course it isn 't . They are liars . Oh , they are the most terrible liars ! They lie all the time about everything . But I 'll take them off your hands . It is out of my hands . Since they have lied , only the gods of the sea can decide their fate . Hmm . Well , uh , that sounds reasonable enough . Who are these gods of the sea ? The sharks . I object ! I will not have my servants fed to the sharks ... in order to satisfy some primitive custom . I 'm sorry , my friend . It may not appeal ... to your sophisticated Central City taste . but in areas of production like this with minimum security , it is the law . - Send them out ! - Wait ! At least , let me have the satisfaction ... of giving these troublesome humans a piece of my mind . Oh , very well . Uhh . See any chance of getting out of this at all ? I don 't . Here , take this knife . It may help . Remind me to tell you someday how grateful we both are . Liars , huh ? Zuma ! Enough ! Enough ! Send them to the gods ! Watch it . Galen , I don 't think they 're really particular who they shoot . Move ! Stay together till I reach the kelp . I 'll try to decoy him . Well ... that 's that . Get the production started . Look ! Well , I think that 's that . Your law has been carried out . Now I think I 'll take my slaves and be on my way . I am not so sure about that . The boat carrying old Gahto to the gods . it 's on the beach with the lacings cut . Someone has defied the gods , It is sacrilege . High treason . I knew it . He 's alive . The old man can 't be far . Find him ! I don 't think they can leave just now . This is a matter for Bandor to decide . If the old man lives ... someone must die . Gahto ! Gahto ? Gahto ! Gahto ! Gahto ! Gahto ! Ridiculous . Come on . Why did you stop me ? Gahto is dead . Some of us would be better off if you were , but you are not . Now , you have got to stay out of sight ! - I am dead . - Oh , I am tempted . I am tempted ! Gahto , unless you stay out of sight , others may be killed . Now , you don 't want that to happen , do you ? It does not matter . May not matter to you , but most humans do not share your enthusiasm with dying . I promise you , Gahto . I promise you . sooner or later you will be able to die . In the meantime . stay in the cave ! Hmm . Hmm . - Ohh ! - Did you see him ? He was out on the beach . - Gahto ? - Shh ! Don 't mention his name . Someone might hear you . - Wish I 'd never heard it . Believe me . - Oh , yeah , me too . I got him back to the cave , I hope he stays there . We 'd like to thank you for telling him we were liars . It was a big help . Well , I couldn 't think of anything else to do . And besides ... if I hadn 't found you , you two would 've been banded ... as fishermen for the rest of your lives . We got to do something . There 's a big wheel who 's coming in here tomorrow . Mmm , that 's Bandor . He 's in charge of many of the producing areas . and he 's the one who presides over the banding of the fisherman ceremony . You 're pretty thick with Hurton . Can 't you get us out of here ? I am primarily concerned that Hurton 's patrols do not find Gahto . If he points you two out , you will be killed instantly . Okay ... today you spear fish . Well , wonderful . - Move ! - All right . Where was he when we needed him yesterday ? Move along , you two ! All right , back in the water ! Move ! Great way to make a living . That 's why we 're doing it , to keep on living . Yeah . Yeah , you know . you go to school , you work hard . you wind up fishing for raw material for a fertilizer factory . Yep . Year after year they raise my quotas , The law requires that I discard worn-out producers like Gahto , who can not longer pass the test . even before new offspring can be raised to take their place . Oh , I do so sympathize with your problem , Oh ! But then , of course , these two slaves are mine . Oh , I 'm not too sure the law of possession holds out here . After all , they came to me and asked to be fishermen . Oh ! But they 're liars . I told you that . They are such terrible liars . Oh , but the gods of the sea said differently . But they 'll try to escape , I am sure of it . I 'm having them closely watched . If they try to leave , they 'll be shot . Well , then , you will have gained nothing . and I will be out two good slaves . But I told you , that is out of my hands . When Bandor comes for the ceremony of the bracelets . he will make the decision , And because Bandor is as interested in increased production as you are . you think that he is going to decide in your favor ? Are you questioning the ethics of Bandor ? He has high connections in Central City . - Oh . - He knows Urko himself . Urko himself ! . Oh ! That 's what he said . Well , that 's just great . Bandor knows Urko , and Urko knows us . All the more reason why we should split before the big man gets here . Yeah , I agree , except that Hurton 's got his anti-split devices all over town . Oh , all of this over old Gahto who no one wanted in the first place . Hello . Gahto is my father . Come on over here . It 's all right , Galen 's a friend . Sit down . - Why did they do that to your father ? - It is the law . So that 's why Hurton looked at you when the rider came in with the news . Romar , my husband , is afraid we will both die , that we 'll all be punished . Now listen , we saved your father against his wishes . We took him to a hiding place , But he could die there if we don 't find some way to help him . - Take me to him . - They 've got us pretty heavily guarded . I can help , You 're prisoners here , But remember , I can come and go as I please . So ? Well , if she 's with me . we can just casually stroll right out of the village . All right . Just leave here like you 're just taking a walk . Ready for din-din ? - Soma ! - Take it easy . Your wife 's all right . - Where is Soma ? - Quiet . You 're gonna wake the guards ' head rifleman . Our friend took her to see her father , so just calm down . It 's a trick . The guards are trying to track us , Soma , it 's a trick ! Soma ! Soma ! Soma ! Wait here ! I can 't move it . If you 're lucky , it 'll heal . - I won 't be able to pass the test for Bandor . - What do you mean ? I knew it . Now I 'll be given to the sea gods like Gahto . I knew it was death to mention his name , Well , you did this . Sir , a visitor . Welcome , Bandor , welcome , Did you have a good trip ? - Tiring . - Mm-hmm . Whenever you greet me with such big smiles . I have the feeling you are holding bad news behind your back . Not so . In fact , I have a special surprise for you . Hey ! The wagon ropes are gone . Factory workers are getting worse and worse . Not sending the wagon ropes back . Go get some in the storehouse . - You should 've checked . - I should 've checked ? How about you ? Well , one of ' em should 've checked . Check . Thank you . " I am not interested in projections . I am interested in production . " My nephew said that ... very cleverly . Yes , very clever . Unfortunately , we cannot catch fish with words . Or promises . What is this great news ? You have three young ones for me to band ... to replace the old one you discarded ? Only one has been raised to age and size . but two full-grown fishermen have joined us . like they were sent by the gods . Uh ! Now Hurton is claiming partnership with the gods . Bring in the two new fishermen ! You 'll see . Two excellent recruits . They not only spear fish while swimming under the test of fire . they kill sharks with their bare hands . Two full-grown fishermen for you to band . Sent by the gods . you say ? Well ... actually ... they are runaway slaves ... once owned by a rather irresponsible chimpanzee named ... Zuma . Ah , I knew there was some catch to it . I dispute his claim to them . He 's here ... to claim them . Does he have papers ? Here , you see ? Strong . Many prime years of production in them . You say this Zuma has no papers ? None . Or why would he have stolen one of our female slaves ? Skins have not been long in the water . But they kill sharks with their bare hands . I would say this Zuma has made an unwise move , We will just let him keep his worthless female . Tomorrow , at the ceremony . I will band these two myself , I knew you would decide quickly and fairly . Someone has to keep these producing villages going . Pete , the fish is burning , I don 't care if I ever see another fish again , ever , I don 't feel much like spearing fish and ducking sharks for the rest of my life , either . This thing better work , Alan . It will , Pete . or we 're gonna be fitted with a pair of permanent handcuffs . You , human . Don 't worry . Everything 's settled . You and your father have nothing to worry about . Come along . There . New areas are being opened for crops . More fertilizer is needed . which means more fish . There must be a limit . We cannot just keep increasing production . Now , now , if you keep getting these godsend producers - - And where are they ? - What ? Well , I don 't see these two new surprises . who kill sharks with their bare hands . Guard , where are the two new producers ? Sir , they 're missing , They 're not here , Missing ? Your surprises are getting tiresome , Hurton . Okay , Al ! Let 's go fishing ! There they are ! - Shoot them ! - Wait ! All right , Gahto . this is where you stop being a dead discard ... and become a live hero . If you want your daughter to live. go . Huh . Gahto ? That 's it ! Bring it in ! There ! Easy ! Easy ! Well ! - Very good . - What is this ? Fish by the dozens from some - From a net , mighty Bandor , It can trap more fish in a few hours than your men could spear in a month . Just another of the surprises I promised you . And even old men and women can fish in this way , You 'll have all the fish you need . and the gods will be pleased . So you can let your old people and your injured live on in your village , Well , that is so ! That is certainly so . All part of my plan . Now the producers will have all they want to eat , and the security problems will be almost eliminated . What has this discard to do with your plan , Hurton ? Er , uh - Mighty Bandor , Hurton has saved his greatest surprise for last . Tell him , Zuma . Oh , uh , this magic webbing . which brings in fish , is all Gahto 's idea . And Hurton has saved Gahto ... so that he can teach others how to make and mend the webbing . It 's easy . Hurton , I knew you could do it . Now , that is why I have kept you on here . despite all efforts of those higher-ups ... to replace you with my nephew . I appreciate it . I always do my best , as you can see . Extra rations for all from now on ! A celebration . First , we start with the banding ceremony . Uh , sir , would the mighty Bandor ... do us the honor of assisting in the greatest catch of all ? - And what is that ? - Come with me , sir . It 's not fitting the greatest bounty of the sea should be taken by a human . Therefore. this revolving reel will be held by Zuma . I don 't understand . Oh. uh. you see. uh ... the largest fish can break the net . But this cord ... will entangle it in its loop . Uh-huh. yes . Well ... here . You hold tight . - Tight ? Tight . - Tight . Come on. now ! Come along . We must not keep Bandor waiting . Aye. aye. sir . You watch this . Mmm . Mm-hmm . Hmm . Grab a paddle . Would you rather swim ? Me ? Ugh ! End of the line . Mm-hmm . Hmm . Shoot ! Shoot ! At what ? I said you were liars . I just had no idea you were that good at it . Hey , listen , Galen , as soon as we 're away , I want to talk with you . And I 'd like to discuss this owner-slave relationship with you . Well , personally , I don 't want to have to pull you two out of another scrape . By the way -

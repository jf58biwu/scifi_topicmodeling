 - Did I miss anything ? - No , he 's doing the same old thing . [ Higgins ] Lufkin , why is it that every time we have a budget meeting , - you stir up trouble ? - [ Lufkin ] I 'm not trying to stir up trouble . I 'm just trying to get what I need , so we can have a decent lab . [ Higgins ] I think you 've got what you need . Need I remind you , it was just last year that we bought 10 new Bunsen burners for that lab . We 've got to draw the line somewhere . This can 't go on forever . But our students have to experiment . Be creative . That 's what science is all about . Creative , my foot . You 're talking about this bunch out there being creative . That 's impossible . [ Lufkin ] You 're being unfair , Dean Higgins . Suppose people had taken that attitude about Thomas Edison ? We 're not talking about people like Edison . We 're talking about people like Dexter Riley . Believe me , Dexter Riley is no Thomas Edison . [ Dexter ] Nobody ever said he was ! Of course , nobody said he was . That would be a ridiculous thing to say ... No , Lufkin , I think you better forget about your course in creative lab . Just stick with the old conventional systems . Burn the sulfur , make clouds , smell up the place , like you do . [ Lufkin ] Now , really , Dean Higgins . That was good enough for the ' 40s , but today , science ... Why is it that every time we have a meeting , they 're out there ? Listening to something ? [ Buzzer ] - They 're just having a little gathering . - I don 't like little gatherings . They make me nervous . I don 't even like ... Yes , Winifred ? Who ? Yes , I 'll talk to him , Winifred . That 'll be all today , gentlemen . That was even duller than usual . But you gotta listen . You never know what might come up . Yes , Helwig , did you find out anything ? Yes , I 've been watching them . They 've been bugging your office . [ Higgins ] They 've been bugging my office ? - What ? - [ Higgins ] Are you sure ? What 'd he say ? We 'll find out ! Wait a minute . I should 've known . I wonder where they hid that thing . - He 's on to us . - What are we gonna do ? - We gotta do something in a hurry . - Let 's get moving . Behind the books , that 's where they 'd hide it . They 're worried about the establishment . Hello ? I 'll show them what the establishment really is . Soon as I find the evidence , I 'll expel them all . Tuition or no tuition , I 'll get a federal grant . I don 't need them . Nothing under here . No ! My homework ! Anything wrong , Dean Higgins ? No , nothing 's wrong . You need an electrician or anything ? No , I don 't need an electrician . You don 't have to snap my head off . If I wanted an electrician , I 'd have called one in the first place . Don 't they ever clean this thing ? I don 't know what I pay that janitor for anyway . Excuse me , could you show me my attendance file in history ? Mr. Baines says I missed half my classes and I don 't believe it . I don 't think I missed any . - The name ? - Schuylar , Richard Schuylar . Says here you 've been absent every Thursday . You mean it 's on Thursdays , too ? I only thought it was on Tuesdays . No wonder all those epics seemed to roll along so fast . I think I got the answer . If I flunk it this semester , I 'll go on Thursdays next semester and pick up the stuff I missed . Thanks , Mrs. Kesley , you 'll never know how much you helped me ! Dean Higgins , do you mind if I change your flowers ? No , I don 't . I 've got more important things on my mind . [ Higgins ] Wait ! I knew it . It 's those flowers . All right , Dexter Riley , I know you 're in there . Imagine it , sir . If one of our own students could actually win the Forsythe Award ! - With this bunch , that 's impossible . - Good morning , Dean Higgins . - But Dean , it 's $ 50,000 this year . - Really ? $ 50,000 ? Morning , Dean Higgins . Young Druffle seems to have come up with something very promising . He 's one of our honor students . What 's he doing here with a crowd like this ? Good morning , Dean . There 's another beaut , that Schuylar . Right this way , sir . Well , Druffle ... I thought we might give Dean Higgins a progress report on your experiment . Certainly . Good morning . Morning . Actually , my work with bumble bees is based on a very simple theory . See , when you consider the mass of the body of the bee , the drag quotient far outmeasures the foil efficiency and the lift field . - Ergo , it 's fairly safe to say ... - Thank you , Druffle . Morning , Dean . Howdy ho , Dean . - Tell them not to touch me . - Please . I know what Tinkertoys are when I see them , but what is this monstrosity ? - What is this ? - It 's an invention of my own . I can imagine . People have been trying to figure out the problem of invisibility . - I didn 't know that was a problem . - Things have changed . A lot has happened since Einstein split the atom . This looks like one of them . It looks complicated , but actually it 's very simple once you understand it . I 'm not sure I care to understand it . First of all , you have to read Bersokoff 's book on quantum mechanics . - I do . And who was Bersokoff ? - You don 't know him ? That 's funny , he was a very famous 18th century Russian scientist . He was the man who developed the theory , " If we could prevent reflection ... " Let me show you . If we could prevent reflection by ... bending light waves around objects with a non-reflectable liquid , we could make those objects invisible . That was his theory ? Making objects invisible ? - Yes , sir . - That 's idiotic . No , sir , it 's a very sound theory . If it 's so sound , how come he could never make it work ? - Who ? - The Russian ! Whoever ... You mean Bersokoff . Unfortunately , his career was cut short . I didn 't know that . His career ... What happened ? - What happened to him ? - They threw him into an insane asylum . They threw him into an insane asylum ? And you 're working on his theory ? Yeah . Don 't you exercise any control whatsoever around here ? You come to me and ask me for money to buy expensive equipment , so that nitwit kid can work on a theory that some Russian proposed , - over 200 years ago ? - Wait a minute , sir ! We may not agree with the Russians politically , we may not even like them , but as scientists , don 't you think we ought to raise ourselves above these petty prejudices ? Scientists ? I 'm talking about a nut they had to lock up over 200 years ago ! Dean , I 'm sorry ! Dean , I 'm sorry . I don 't how it happened . These lunatics are trying to kill me . Wait a minute . - I 've had enough . - What about ... [ students ] You don 't understand . [ Thunder ] [ Thunder ] [ Glass shattering ] I must be going crazy , but the guy in that car looked like A.J. Arno . It couldn 't be him . He 's in jail . All right , move away from the car . Come on , move . What 's the matter with you ? Leave them alone . They 're not doing any harm . Boys , don 't pay any attention to him . - Hi , kids . Nice to see you . - Hi , Mr. Arno . What 's the matter ? You seem surprised to see me . - We thought you were in jail . - Oh , that . That was a mistake . You know , the police , judges , they all make mistakes . But I forgive them . I don 't hold grudges . Dean Higgins , nice to see you . - [ Higgins ] Always a pleasure to see you . - [ Arno ] Thank you . What 's going on around here ? Arno took over the mortgage on the college . He told Dean Higgins that if he can 't make the payment in June , - to make it whenever he could . - Sure doesn 't sound like Arno . That 's why Dean Higgins is walking around on airs . It 's the first time he hasn 't had to worry about money . But I don 't understand it . That guy 's a crook . Crook or no crook , he 's interested in higher education . He 's already dreamed up improvements for the school . That 's where he is now . Dean Higgins is showing him around . I have to run off to a teacher 's meeting . Anything else you need ? No , Professor , I 'm just gonna work on my experiment for a while . Holy smoke . The whole thing 's burned out . How come mine and nobody else 's ? Oh , boy . Oh , no . Gotta be in there somewhere . That stuff must eat everything alive . I 'll bet I gotta replace everything . [ Tapping ] A vector is any quantity such as a force of velocity that has direction as well as amount . I 've done it . I 've really done it . - Hi . - Hi , Dexter . What have you done to your glasses ? You look ridiculous . I 've done it ! [ Schuylar ] Your fingers ! - You better get to the hospital right away . - I 'll call an ambulance . There 's nothing to be worried about . You see , my fingers are all there . - They 're just invisible . - Invisible ? I don 't know how it works , but it works . Let me show you . Now this is the stuff that does it . It 's incredible . But the main thing is , I can make myself invisible . Can you imagine ? Look ! Look , human flesh , invisible ! You mean , you just stuck your hand in that stuff and your fingers became invisible ? That 's all there is to it . Look , you try it . - Me ? - Why not ? I don 't think I better . I mean , I 'm not much on this science business . In fact , I don 't even know what I 'm doing in this class . - Schuylar , there 's nothing to be afraid of . - I 'm not afraid . Then you do it . Look at ' em ! They 're gone , but they 're there . This is incredible . Dexter , how do we make our fingers visible again ? - That shouldn 't be any problem . - Are you sure ? Of course ! Look , it 's just a solution . It should come right off . There , see . - Give me that towel . - Don 't panic , Debbie . I 'm not panicking . Dexter , what have you done to me ? What are you people doing in here ? - Nothing . - I wouldn 't call it nothing . I mean , this thing has quite a history . You 've probably heard of the famous Russian scientist , Bersokoff . Nobody wants to hear anything about Bersokoff . Now , Mr. Arno , we 've got a simply marvelous ... experiment over here by one of our honor students , Druffle . He 's working on a very interesting theory on bumble bees . You see , according to all the laws of aerodynamics when you consider the mass of their body to their wingspread , they shouldn 't fly at all . - Then how come they do ? - I don 't know . That 's what Druffle 's trying to find out . What a day to bring Mr. Arno up here . You certainly have quite a view from here . It 's an entirely different perspective . Do you mind if my architect takes a look at it ? Your architect ? You think he 'd like it ? That 'd be wonderful . It 's quite a view indeed . Goodbye , young lady . Son ? - Goodbye , Hector . - Dexter . Yeah , Dexter . What is the matter with everybody 's right hand around here ? They 've been working on Dexter 's experiment and they might have got something on them . If they 've got something on them , why don 't they wash them ? I never thought of that . It did it . Water takes it off ! It 's amazing . Dean Higgins , you 're a genius . You know , it just doesn 't figure . Arno gets out of prison and picks up the mortgage on this place . Next thing you know , he wants to bring over his architect and remodel . A.J. Arno just doesn 't do favors for people . Yeah . What was so interesting out this window ? I don 't know . He 's sure up to something . And we 're gonna find out what it is . I know , I know ! This afternoon you said you 'd do it . How come you changed your mind ? This afternoon it was just my hand . Tonight it 's all of me . But it 's the same principle . When we 're through , we wet you down and you 'll be yourself again . But it 's when I 'm not myself that I don 't like it . It 's too late to back out on me now . I need you . Oh , no ! - Wait a minute , don 't forget the camera . - [ Dexter ] Thanks . Come on , let 's go . - Be careful , you guys ! - [ Dexter ] We will , don 't worry . - [ Schuylar ] I don 't like this at all . - [ Dexter ] I don 't either , - but we have to find out what Arno 's up to . - How do you know he 's up to anything ? Because he 's a crook . And he bought the mortgage on Midfield College . Why would a crook like Arno want to do that ? [ Schuylar ] I don 't know , don 't ask me . Don 't ask me anything at all . Why not ? Because if I knew anything , I wouldn 't be here in the first place . - [ Schuylar ] Did you hear that ? - [ Dexter ] What ? - [ Schuylar ] That slushing sound . - [ Dexter ] You hear it too ? [ Dexter ] It stopped now . [ Schuylar ] Wait a minute , my shoes are visible ! [ Dexter ] That 's what the slushing sound was . You must 've stepped in some water somewhere . [ Schuylar ] This looks pretty good , doesn 't it ? Schuylar , will you quit playing around and come on ? Okay . - [ Schuylar ] Good , the door 's locked . - [ Dexter ] Look out ! Somebody 's coming . Mr. Arno , leaving his tennis shoes out to be shined . Must be going nuts , or something . [ Groaning ] Ow ! [ Dexter ] I 'll hit the filing cabinet , you look in his desk . [ Schuylar ] His desk is locked . I guess I just better look around . - [ Dexter ] Medfield . - [ Schuylar ] That would be under " M. " [ Dexter ] I know what it would be under . Medfield College . That 's it . [ Schuylar ] There 's another room over here . - What 's in it ? - Some sort of model . [ Dexter ] " Dear Mr. Arno , In regard to your inquiry , " the law of 1912 permitting gambling " on the Medfield property is still in effect . " [ Dexter ] I 've really stumbled onto something here . [ Schuylar ] I found something , too . It 's a model of the school . Evidently , Arno 's planning on changing it a lot . - It has the craziest football field ever . - What 's so crazy about it ? [ Schuylar ] It has no goal post and there 's a lake in the middle of it . [ Dexter ] Never heard of that ! - What are you talking about ? - See what I mean ! [ Dexter ] That 's not a football field anymore , that 's a dog track . [ Schuylar ] A dog track ? [ Dexter ] He 's turning the college into a gambling joint . Look where the gym used to be . Arno 's Golden Horseshoe Club . [ Schuylar ] The casino is replacing the library . [ Dexter ] I knew that guy was up to something . " Arno Town . " Wait 'll Dean Higgins gets a load of this . Is he gonna change his opinion about A.J. Arno ! [ Schuylar ] Excuse me ! [ Gun firing ] Wait , you ! Come back here , whoever you are ! - How 'd it go ? - [ Dexter ] Move over , Arno saw us ! But that 's impossible . He couldn 't see you . [ Dexter ] Will you come on ? He 's after us . But I 'll look silly sitting over here all by myself . [ Schuylar ] Will you get us out of here ? So you have the pictures , but how do you expect to see Dean Higgins in the condition you 're in ? [ Dexter ] We 're not gonna see him tonight . We 'll wait till tomorrow when we 're ourselves again . [ Debbie ] If it 's so important , why don 't you see him tonight ? [ Dexter ] Because he 's not here . He 's up at the Friendly Sons of the Forest Convention in Riverton . The kids in that car can hear you . [ Dexter ] Just play it like nothing 's wrong . It 'll be okay . Hi , gang . The zoning laws of 1912 ? Casinos ? Dog racing ? Medfield College , a gambling town ? If Arno 's got plans like these , he 'll foreclose on that mortgage for sure . I 'll bet that 's what he had on his mind all the time . There 's always the Forsythe Award . That 's a pipe dream , Lufkin . Medfield wasn 't even invited . They can 't do that to us . We have it all locked up . I thought Druffle 's bumble bee experiment would open the eyes of the scientific world . I wasn 't talking about Druffle . I was talking about me . - You ! What do you have ? - You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . - I 'd have to show you . - Show me ! I can 't . I 'd rather wait till the day of the contest with Arno , and everything . It 's such a big discovery that if word got out , there 's no telling what might happen ! How could word get out ? Are you insinuating I 'd shoot off my mouth ? No , sir . We 're going to win the award . We just want you to trust us , that 's all . Trust you ? This college is going to be taken over by a crook like Arno and you want me to trust you , you big lummox ? - Just a minute , don 't start yelling at me . - Take it easy . I didn 't want to be in on this in the first place ! If we don 't get into the contest , we will lose the school . Forsythe is staying at the Medfield Inn . Why don 't you give him a call ? I 'll bet you can talk us right back into the contest . You think I could do it ? Sure , sir , you can handle that easily . You can do that stuff really good . I suppose I could do something , as a matter of fact . Winifred , would you get me Mr. Forsythe at the Medfield Inn ? When you get right down to it , there 's no reason for him to ignore us . It 's not as though we were a hick school . Besides I 've got a pretty good reputation in this part of the country . [ Winifred ] Mr. Forsythe on the line . Lufkin , grab the other phone and see how these things are handled . [ Forsythe ] Hello ? Hello , Mr. Forsythe . This is Dean Higgins , ... from Medfield College . Yeah , Higgins . Blasted ! I beg your pardon ? Nothing , I 'm sorry . I just missed a put I should 've made . You can 't put unless you really concentrate . No , I 've always said that . - You 're a golfer ? - Yes ! - He 's no golfer . - Good , what can I do for you ? It 's about the Forsythe Award . I 'm sorry we 're dropping the smaller colleges this year . Frankly , it just became too much of a waste of time . We 're not a waste of time . We 're small but we have an excellent science department . Yes , I know , but ... If you would just give me a chance , I would meet you anywhere , anytime . Maybe I can fit you in . I 'm playing golf this morning at 10 : 00 with Collingsgood at Thunder Ridge . Why don 't you join us and we can chat between holes ? Is that Dean Collingsgood from State ? Yeah , what 's the matter ? Nothing . That 'll be wonderful . Okay , first tee , 10 : 00 , balls in the air . See you then . Yes , I 'll be there . Thank you very much , Mr. Forsythe . - I 've got to go change . - You 're gonna play golf with Forsythe ? - What 's the matter with that ? - You don 't play golf . Yes , I do . I played just yesterday afternoon at Swenson 's with Bertha . Tough course , too . You gotta hit the ball up a ramp and right through a little castle . - That 's miniature golf . - It can 't be that much different . Don 't worry about me . Besides it 's the only chance we 've got . Looks like we got our work cut out for us today . What do you mean ? I can handle the game , but you better be his caddy . - I may need some help out there . - I don 't know how to be a caddy . That 's all right . Dean Higgins doesn 't know how to play golf either . [ Forsythe ] That 's cutting into the ball , Collingsgood . - Good shot . - I was hoping for a little more distance . It was straight , anyway . [ Collingsgood ] What a shot , Timothy ! I 'll take it . You 're up , Higgins . We better do something . Let 's let him hit one and we 'll see . You don 't have any little castles here , I noticed . Isn 't that Dean Higgins down there ? I didn 't know he played golf . I don 't think he does . Maybe that was just a mistake . Let 's give him another chance . He might be better than we think . I guess I got under that one a little too much . It went ... Just another swing , I 'll be out there with you fellas . [ Forsythe ] That poor old man ! He 's worse than we think . Come on . Hey , I might be able to use this . Good luck . - Are you all right , Mr. Reeves ? - Yes , I think so . Boy , that fellow can sure hit a long ball . That ball didn 't come from over there . It came from over there ! I don 't know what happened there . I just sort of hit the edge of the club . No offense , but people are waiting to play through . We don 't want to hold them up . Why don 't you just take a nice , hot shower and call it a day ? I 'll do nothing of the sort . I 'm just getting warmed up . Schuylar , which club do I use now ? In view of what I 've seen so far , I don 't know what to tell you . Of course you don 't ! Just give me any club . Next time , I 'll pay $ 10 and get a real caddy . Give me a second , gentlemen . I 'll knock it out there . We 'll be on our way . Let 's face it . Higgins just isn 't a golfer . I could 've told you that . The man 's an impostor . Always has been . He has no more business being on a golf course than ... Look ! That was a good one . Remember that club . Seems to break to the left . Hurry up , will you ? We can 't wait all day . I want to get this put . If I do , I 'll get my par . Great Scott ! It does break to the left . Your shot , Collingsgood . [ Dexter ] Now , watch this ! [ Dexter ] What 's a nice ball like you doing in a place like this ? We 'll give them something to talk about this time . Perfect ! The farmer in the dell The farmer in the dell Hi-ho , the dairy-o , The farmer in the dell [ laughs ] It 's got to be around here some place . Maybe it trickled up on the green . Don 't be silly . You could see it if it did . Besides , you can 't hit every ball on the green . [ Dexter ] Schuylar , look in the hole . - Huh ? - [ Dexter ] Look in the hole ! [ Schuylar ] Look in the hole . Why didn 't I think of that ! I 'm gonna look in the hole . Of course , in the hole . There 's no other place . There 's that little Dickens ! - That 's amazing ! Absolutely amazing ! - Isn 't it ? If I didn 't see it , I wouldn 't believe it . That Higgins is a golfing phenomenon . Do you know he 's had two holes and one on the front nine ? What I don 't understand is why nobody ever asked him to join the club ? Nobody ever thought he had that kind of talent . It 's still impossible to believe . - [ Dexter ] I 'm sorry . - That 's okay . How come you said that ? - What ? - That 's okay . You just bumped into me and said you were sorry . So I said , " That 's okay . " But I didn 't bump into you . - I 'm sorry . - That 's okay . I believe that 's a two . That 's all right . I 'll give you that one . He 's already had four holes in one . Do you think he could make another one ? Would you keep these people quiet ? This is very difficult . People , please be quiet . Dean Higgins is trying to concentrate . [ Ball bouncing off trees ] That 's amazing , Higgins ! I can 't believe it ! - Schuylar , what club should we use here ? - I think you ought to use this one , sir . - You 've had a lot of luck with it . - Good thinking . [ Dexter ] It 's not over yet . Get out of there . That 's one of the most incredible rounds of golf I 've ever seen . Thank you , but with all the excitement , we forgot to mention Medfield 's participation in the Forsythe Award . Consider yourself entered . A man who plays golf like you , how can we keep your school out ? Let me buy you a drink . I want to introduce you to some of the members . I don 't as a rule , but we mustn 't forget Collingsgood . - Come along , Edgar ! - He can change his shoes in the car . [ Whistling ] [ Water running ] Boss , I got the car ... What 's the matter ? Is something wrong ? - I think I must be going nuts . - That 's too bad , boss . If you weren 't my sister 's son , I 'd fire you ! - I always forget you 're my uncle . - Take your hands off me . I 'm sorry I reminded you . [ Buzzer ] Winifred , if that 's somebody else calling to congratulate me would you just thank them and take their names ? Who ? I 'll talk to him , yes . It 's Collins , from TeleSports . Hello , Mr. Collins . Thank you . It was just one of those days , where I put everything together . Challenge Golf ? I don 't know . For how much ? Yes , you can count on me ! I 'll be there today ! Thank you . Winifred , would you call the airport and get me two tickets to Oceanview City ? Then , get a hold of Richard Schuylar for me . You know that $ 50,000 mortgage payment we 're worried about ? We don 't have to worry about that anymore . Hey , Druffle . Where is everybody ? They 're all out at the airport to see Dean Higgins off . Where 's he going ? Up to Oceanview . He 's playing in a golf tournament . Winner take all . Dean Higgins is gonna play golf against pros ? Incidentally , Schuylar wants you to get to the airport as soon as you can . - He says things are rather desperate . - Yeah , I 'll bet . Listen , what time does the plane leave ? - I think he said 10 : 30 . - Oh , no ! [ Tires screeching ] And furthermore , I want it to be known , that all the proceeds from my golf victory today will go to Medfield College . [ Cheering ] - I wonder where Dexter is . - Will you forget about Dexter ? Oh , no ! What 's he doing out there ? I think he wants us to stop the plane , sir . - What for ? - He probably wants to get on board . Don 't you think maybe we ought to let him ? Of course not ! What do we need with him ? Sit back . Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the first tee . The trouble on this hole are some trees on the left fairway , but I don 't think any of our golfers will have any trouble with that . And here is Billy Casper , former Open champ , considered by many to be one of the best putters on the tour . Trying for the $ 50,000 first prize . [ Higgins ] Billy . You mind ? This is a little something that could help you . I picked this up . He seems to be getting a few tips from Dean Higgins , involving the hands . Wrist , you know what I mean ? Wrist . [ Reporter ] That 's a beauty . Higgins ' tips obviously helped . He 's well away from the trouble . Out about 270 yards . And here 's controversial Dave Hill . Former Vardon trophy winner . A beautiful shot . He 's right out there with Mr. Casper . It 'll be interesting to see how Dean Higgins ' unorthodox swing holds up against this competition . There 's a pro ! That 's an interesting shot . I wonder what Dean Higgins has in mind . I don 't have time for interviews now . Maybe later . [ Reporter ] We 're watching Dean Higgins in his first attempt at getting out of a trap . He 's entering the trap now , assuming his stance . Ladies and gentlemen , we 're waiting for some word on Dean Higgins . Here are our pros Dave Hill and Billy Casper . - Where is he ? - We 're not sure . - You mean , he 's still out there on a safari ? - I 'm afraid so . Our mobile crew thinks they 've located him . - He 's around the 12th fairway . - Beautiful . Jim , come in . Tom , I 've spotted his caddy by a thicket on the left side . Dean Higgins must be in it because the caddy sure is passing in a lot of clubs . It 's out ! Right ... Which club now ? I think you better use the one you got . It 's the straightest one we have left . We 're sorry Dean Higgins can 't be with us at this moment , but something unprecedented has happened . We seem to have lost him . But in the meanwhile , we want to thank Dave Hill and Billy ... Just a moment . Yes , Jim . We seem to have found him . He 's having trouble on the 13th hole . If you ask me , I think we ought to throw it up there . I didn 't ask you . Besides we 're on TV . You want people to think I can 't shoot my way out of a little difficulty ? Where 'd it go ? But I 'm getting all wet ! What do you think is happening to me ? Just stay away ! I think you better turn around ! [ Screaming ] Crazy , isn 't it ? How could a guy be so good one week and so lousy the next ? There 's something weird going on around here , all right . I 'll lay you odds if you keep your eye on Dexter Riley and that creative lab , you 'll find out what it is . Not one word . I don 't want to hear a single word . You , take those things and get rid of ' em . Yes , sir . [ Higgins ] Come in ! - All right , what is it ? - It 's about the Forsythe Award , sir . It 's an idea of what Druffle plans to prove with his bumble bee experiments . Of course , he will use real bees . And here 's more or less of an outline of what he 's trying to prove . Well , it looks very promising . I think he 's definitely on the brink of a solution . I hope so , Lufkin , because frankly , I think that Druffle is our last chance . [ Buzzer ] Yes , Winifred ? [ Winifred ] I hate to disturb you , but could Druffle come in and see you ? Of course he can . She lets every nincompoop in this school in here , then she hesitates to let a real scholar like Druffle in . [ Knocking ] Yes , come in . Mr. Lufkin has been explaining to me ... Who are you ? [ Mumbling ] - What did he say ? - I don 't know . [ Mumbles ] The bees ... What 's that again ? It 's Druffle . " Bitten by bumble bees . Doctor says I 'm allergic to them . " Will have to abandon experiment . Am taking pills . May be ready next year . " We 're through ! There goes the Forsythe Award . There 'll be no mortgage payment . Medfield is down the drain ... Not quite , sir . There 's ... Dexter Riley . - He still thinks he has something . - He certainly does . A mental condition , with that invisibility experiment . Dean Higgins , who else have we got ? Nobody . But Dexter Riley ... [ Dexter ] Okay , the first thing we have to do is get everything organized . [ Schuylar ] Nobody seems to think we have a chance at winning this thing , but Debbie , you and I , and I guess maybe Lufkin . You didn 't happen to talk to him , did you ? [ Dexter ] Lufkin didn 't seem too enthused , but we can 't pay attention to that . After this showing , Medfield 'll win the award money and you and I 'll be written up in every chemistry book in the world . Me , written up in chemistry books ? You gotta be kidding ! - What 's the matter with that ? - I flunked chemistry last semester . That is kinda weird , isn 't it ? First things first . We 'll spray you invisible . As soon as you disappear , pick those things on the table up one at a time . - It 'll look like they 're floating in the air . - That should look pretty good . [ Dexter ] You 're darn right , it 'll look terrific . Let 's rehearse it . You 're not gonna spray me tonight . We want to see exactly how this thing works , don 't we ? I 've got a date in a half hour . I don 't want that stuff all over me . I 'd have to take another shower . This is the last time you 'll do it . Now , hold still . I said I didn 't want to do it . Dexter , now look what you 've done ! [ Loud crash ] Hold this . You better stay here . [ Cookie ] Sorry I startled you , but I got my foot stuck in this bucket . [ Schuylar ] Wonder how he did that ? You know , some people don 't care how they look at all . Boss , you are not going to believe this , but I saw it with my own eyes . - Yeah , Cookie ? You saw what ? - I don 't how to tell you . It 's crazy . - Tell me what it is . - You 're gonna laugh at me . So I 'll laugh at you ! Will you tell me what it is ? Well , this ... Excuse me . This kid 's got this spray , like they used to use for bugs ... - Cookie , you 're aggravating me ! - You spray people with ... Excuse me . I 'm sorry , Al . - It makes people ... - It makes them what ? - You 're not going to believe this . - Try me . Invisible . I believe you . You see , I knew ! I knew like I know my own name . - You believe me ? - You bet your sweet life , I do ! I knew there was something crazy going on around here . Listen , birdbrain , this is what I want you to do . [ Forsythe ] You know what I mean ? Good morning , Mr. Forsythe . It 's so nice to see you again . Nice to see you . I saw you on the golf match on TV . Very funny . - Funny , indeed . - I don 't know what happened . Golf isn 't important . It 's science . Hope you have something interesting for me . You should have seen our display last night . A new version of a helio-spectrogram . Quite remarkable . The Medfield Press predicted that State 'll take first place with that one . [ Forsythe ] The Medfield Press isn 't going to pick the winner of this contest . Medfield 's display today , Rutland tomorrow . Then we 'll let me announce the winner Friday night , won 't we ? - Yes , sir . - Better believe it . You sure you got everything worked out ? You 're not worried ? Don 't worry about me . I rise to the occasion when I perform in front of people . As soon as you finish your act , give Debbie the signal . She 'll pour the water on you . This thing 'll be terrific . Right this way , Mr. Forsythe . Good morning . Distinguished deans , honorable scholars , please come this way . This would be a good place to watch . This is Dexter Riley and his assistant . Nice to know you , young people . What 've you got to show us ? We 've come up with something very extraordinary on invisibility . - You 're not kidding us , are you ? - I don 't think so . Why don 't you just sit down ? Let me explain the procedure to you , so that no one will be alarmed . I 'm going to spray this substance on Mr. Schuylar and he will disappear . He will then go to the table and raise those objects . He will talk as he does this , so that you will know that it 's his invisible body raising the objects . All right ? Now , watch closely . You don 't see me , but ... I am now walking toward the table . Now you will see a vase . It is floating in the air . But it is not floating in the air . Although you cannot see me , - I am holding the vase . - Schuylar ! I am now walking back to the table . This ball . It seems to be bouncing by itself . However it is not . It is I who am bouncing the ball . We 've had enough of this . Come along ! [ Forsythe ] You call this science . It 's a disgrace to the academic world . That 's what it is . Don 't apologize , Dean ! It may have been a simple error in the formula . [ Schuylar ] I guess they 've seen enough . I 'm over here . You can hit me with the water now . I don 't want to stay invisible too long . Pretty good , huh ? But listen , next time try some lukewarm water . Okay ? This isn 't our formula . This is just colored water . - What do you mean ? - You didn 't disappear . I don 't understand it , but somebody must 've snuck in here and changed it . Nobody knew about it , but the three of us . - Hi , kids . - Hi , Charlie You mean I never was invisible ? You didn 't tell anybody , did you ? You didn 't tell anybody , did you ? - Tell them what ? - Charlie . - That other janitor , what 's his name ? - There 's no other janitor . There was on Tuesday night . There 's no janitor who works here on Tuesday nights . Part of Dean Higgins ' economy plan . - And you know the dean . - Yeah , I do . Thanks a lot ! It was that fake janitor that made the switch , whoever he was . I 've seen that face somewhere before . - What face ? - Arno 's chauffeur . Arno with that stuff could be murder . - I wonder what he 's gonna do with it . - And how are we going to find that out ? Maybe we should let him tell us . Testing , one , two , three , four . [ Dexter ] Loud and clear . Good luck . Aren 't those beautiful ! - They 're for Mr. Arno . Is he in ? - They 're gorgeous ! I 'll take them in . No , I 'm sorry , but there 's a message involved . We have to deliver them in person . There 's a message for Mr. Arno . I see . Okay , just a minute . Mr. Arno , there are some delivery boys out here with some flowers for you . Flowers for me ? Who 'd be sending me flowers ? [ Secretary ] I don 't know , sir . Tell them to leave ' em . Sir , there 's a message involved . They say they have to deliver them in person . All right , send them in . Who 'd be sending me flowers ? Mr. Arno , sir , these flowers are for you . Ready ? [ Humming ] ( music ) Happy birthday to you ( music ) Happy birthday to you ( music ) Happy birthday , Mr. Arno ( music ) Happy birthday to you ( music ) Signed E.J. Higgins , Dean of Medfield College . But it isn 't even my birthday . What 's this all about ? Why 's he sending me flowers ? I don 't know , maybe he just likes you . - What ? - We can 't take them back . It really does liven up your office . Cookie , take care of them , will you ? - They 're plastic , too . - You don 't have to water them . Just leave ' em alone and they 'll last forever . That 's good to know . Thank you very much , boys . I 'll be sure to thank the dean when I see him . Goodbye . That takes care of the first part . We gotta set up a watch on this radio day and night till we find out what 's going on . [ Arno ] Get a load of Dean Higgins sending me flowers . He must really be in a panic . He must think I 'm going to foreclose on him . You know something , he 's right ! [ Guard ] All right , let 's give us a little room , would you please . What do you know , a bank taking in money . That 's pretty good . In this area , Friday 's payday . The bank cashes a lot of paychecks . People coming in from all over . So , if you ever need any dough on a Friday , you know where to come . That 's pretty good . - So long , Mr. Arno . - I 'll be seeing you . [ Cookie ] 20 more points , I got you in a blitz . I wish you 'd concentrate . I feel like I 'm taking advantage of you . You threw this eighter ? - Again ? Man , you are killing me . - I don 't know why you threw me the eight . [ Cookie ] You know I need the eight . Why 'd you throw it ? - I needed the eight . - [ Alfred ] I did not know . If I 'd known , I wouldn 't have thrown it to you . Okay , boys , put the cards away . We got business . - Big business . - [ Cookie ] What 's up , chief ? Alfred , first of all , I want you to go out and get a car . Something nondescript that people won 't notice . Use a phony name , so it can 't be traced back to us . I 'm on my way . I 'm on my way . - But his ice cream will melt . - Will you shut up and listen ? Cookie , this will be the first one of many . If there was a chance of getting caught , I wouldn 't try it , but there 's no way . Invisible men walk into the bank . Spray the money invisible . Invisible men walk out . - The crime of the century . - [ Cookie ] What are you talking about ? Cookie , at exactly 1 : 00 today , you and I are hitting the Medfield Bank . Vertical line , add on , using the principle of repetition ... we see what is commonly referred to as the Roman Keyhole effect . But this in fact can be traced back to the early Phoenicians . Early Phoenician art can be traced back to the Franco-Cantabian-Paleolithic age , when the first implements fashioned by the hand and mind of man appeared . A fascinating question arises as to whether western naturalistic art ever made contact with the Caspian and Neolithic pre-Egyptian world . In order to study the Phoenician art form , we must first investigate the lifestyle of the period . And the accomplishments of these people . Pssst ! [ Professor ] It is interesting to note ... - Pssst ! - [ Professor ] ... that the color purple was first found by the early Phoenicians in a Mediterranean shellfish ... Excuse me , Professor . ... by the name of Murex . - Excuse me . - That is found in the Mediterranean Sea . An extract by the name of Murex . Murex , which is spelled ... M ... M ... So , that 's what they 're planning . If we can get that formula back , we can still win that award . They don 't announce the winner till tonight . You go to the police and tell them what you heard . The rest of us will go down to the bank . Let 's go ! Now , you 're sure about this ? You could be in an awful lot of trouble if you 're wrong . Yes , sir , I understand that . I 'll guarantee it . Burns , I think you better go around and warn all the tellers . But Mr. Sampson ... I 'm not saying shoot to kill . Just to keep an eye on him , that 's all . Excuse me , sir , keeping an eye on him won 't do any good . Why not ? You won 't be able to see them . What ? You see , they 'll be invisible . And they 'll make the money invisible too , so ... you really won 't see anything . You 'll just find the money gone . That 's all . How do you propose to stop all this ? In order to make the money visible , all we have to do is wet them down . Wet them down ? Wet them down , I see . I suppose you 're suggesting we drive a fire truck right in here to the bank . Something like that ? I didn 't mean that exactly . This is the biggest bunch of nonsense I 've ever heard in my life . Burns , you may return to your duties . Good day , Mr. Riley . Mr. Sampson ... - What happened ? - What 'd he say ? - He wouldn 't believe us . - Nobody believes us . Hey , guys ! How 'd it go ? [ Dexter ] Nothing . What did the police say ? - They said I was nuts . - It 's enough to drive you crazy . We could solve the school 's problems and save the bank , if we could just get somebody to listen to us ! Wait a second ! Water ! Don 't you see ? Go to the hardware store and get a fire hose and a wrench . - Hurry up . We haven 't got much time left . - Let 's go ! - [ Dick ] Here he comes . - [ Dexter ] Get down ! [ Cookie ] How ' bout this ? A spot right in front of the joint ! [ Arno ] Just don 't hit the car in back of you , stupid ! [ Footsteps ] Hurry , those guys are in there already . A few more of these and we can break for lunch . It 's about time . My stomach 's been growling for the last hour . Why don 't we go to Eddy 's ? He 's got great chili . [ Yelping ] We don 't have to have chili . We could have hot dogs and beans . What 's the matter with you ? [ Arno ] Cookie , spray all the loot , then put that thing under your coat . Gotcha , boss . - [ Cookie ] This stuff really works ! - [ Arno ] Okay , let 's get out of here . - Come on , Schuylar , step on it ! - I am ! Will you hurry ? They 'll be gone in a second ! It 's stuck ! I bet nobody 's turned it in years . Give it all you got ! [ Cookie ] This money 's heavier than I thought . [ Arno ] Will you keep quiet ? Come on , they 're getting away ! Got it ! Those are the wrong guys ! Turn it off ! They 're heading for the West End . You and Dick , get down to Taylor Street . See if you can 't cut ' em off at Osbourne . Burns , what 's happened ? I don 't know . I was just standing here and the lights went out . That kid was right . Why didn 't you listen to him ? Operator , get me the police . [ Cookie ] Nice day , officer . [ Cookie ] It 's them kids ! - What do we do , boss ? We 're trapped . - [ Arno ] I 'll show you ! - [ Gunshots ] - [ Screaming ] Everybody stay down . - [ Air hissing from tire ] - [ Schuylar ] Oh , no . Okay , kids , clear out or we 're coming out to get you ! Dexter , maybe we 'd better be on our way . Schuylar , stay behind your car . [ Sirens wailing ] [ Cookie ] Now we got cops . I don 't like it . [ Schuylar ] The police ! Come on , Sergeant . [ Dexter ] We got ' em trapped . Watch out ! What 's going on here ? Let 's get these cars out of here . - I got to get to a bank robbery . - We got the robbers trapped in that car . - You what ? - You can 't see them , that 's all . - You what ? - You can 't see them , that 's all . Don 't you give me any more of that invisible nonsense . I had enough down at the station ! [ Gunshot ] You know something , boy , I 'm beginning to believe you . - Shall we shoot , Sarge ? - What at ? - [ Arno ] Let 's get out of here . - [ Cookie ] You 're the boss . [ Sergeant ] They 're going to ram us . Let 's go . Let 's get out of here ! My insurance ! Murph , they hit our unit ! Come on , let 's get that thing ! - [ Schuylar ] Dexter , a car ! - [ Dexter ] Hold on ! [ Cookie ] We 're in trouble . The cops are getting closer . [ Arno ] You 're telling me . I got it ! Spray the car invisible . [ Cookie ] Boss , you 're a genius . [ Sirens wailing ] [ Arno ] Will you hurry up ? We haven 't got all day . [ Cookie ] There 's no cop on earth could touch us now . Go to the right of that truck , Murph . Slow down , it 's an intersection . Don 't worry , Sarge , it 's clear as a bell . [ Cookie ] It 's the cop 's car ! How could he hit us ? [ Arno ] Because he didn 't see us . [ Cookie ] Come on , let 's get out of here . [ Tires screeching ] - What 'd you hit ? - I don 't really know . I bet they sprayed the car invisible . - You know something , I think he 's right . - We hit something . See you , Sarge . Wait a minute . Crazy kids . Look out , Murphy ! Attention , all cars . Bank robbers headed south on Osbourne St. Near 10th . - In an invisible car . - [ Dispatch ] An invisible what , Sarge ? You heard me , I said invisible car . There 's a bunch of kids in a dune buggy tailing them . When you see ' em , close in . Out . That 's the problem with the department . No imagination . What 's so strange about an invisible car ? Nothing . We can 't be too far behind him . Keep your eyes open for anything . There he is ! [ Arno ] Stop , you 're gonna hit those guys . [ Cookie ] I can 't . The kids are right behind me . - There he is ! - Look out ! [ Arno ] Watch it , watch it . Watch it ! - [ Debbie ] We 're gonna get wet . - [ Dexter ] Hold on . - What 'd you go up on the sidewalk for ? - Do you want to drive ? - There 's no top . - Be careful . All right ! Sergeant Cassidy , come in please . This is Sgt. Cassidy . The invisible vehicle eluded us . He 's evidently following Fuller St. Out of town . Have your men follow three abreast , I 'll have the highway patrol set up a roadblock near the park . Out . - Roger . - He won 't get away from us this time . Not this time . [ Arno ] They think they got us ! Pull over to the side of the road . Let the kids go by . [ Dexter ] Those guys aren 't doing anything . We must 've passed right by ' em . [ Arno ] Now , Cookie , take us home . We 'll hit the showers and set up our alibi . [ Cookie ] Okay , boss , but I hope you know what you 're doing . What happened to the invisible car ? Probably let you slip by them , then went back the other way . But don 't worry , we 'll get him . In fact , he 's practically in our hands right now . - [ Cookie ] We lost ' em . - [ Arno ] Sure . [ Arno ] Down the bridle path . [ Horn beeping ] - [ Horses whinnying ] - [ Horn beeping ] [ Cookie ] Hey , get them nags out of the way here ! [ Horn continues beeping ] He broke through the bridle trail and headed down Peppertree Lane . He 's probably heading south . I 'll alert the Riverton police department . In the meantime , your units can head on down there . - Right . - Officer , can I speak to the sergeant ? - I 'm sorry , it 's for official use only . - I gotta speak to him . He 's all wrong . Yeah , I 'm sure of that . All right , fellas , move out for Riverton . - Where to now ? - [ Dexter ] To see Sgt. Cassidy . - Why ? - Because I think he 's wrong . [ Sirens wailing ] I wonder what Cassidy 'll say this time . Whoever did this is just like any other crook . He 's got the money . Now all he wants to do is get as far away from this town as possible . If you ask me , he 's on his way to Riverton right now . Arno 's different . He 'll want to come back , become visible and establish an alibi . Son , that 's just a guess . We 've got this whole thing figured out . It 's about time you got here . I 'm sorry , Sarge . They had me out looking for an invisible car . I think the department 's going nuts . You do ? Come on , let 's get to Riverton . We might as well go on home . We 've done all we can here . - Wait a second , we have to get my car . - I forgot about that thing . What do you mean , " that thing " ? [ Arno ] Look out for the police car ! That 's him . By golly , the kid was right , Murph . Attention , all units . Invisible car now going north on Osbourne . How could you expect us to change the tire when you haven 't got a spare ? You could 've patched it or something . You guys had plenty of time . - You can 't patch that thing . Look at it . - [ Sirens wailing ] Wait a minute . You guys hear those sirens ? They must 've found Arno . It sounds like he 's headed for Highland Park . - That 's where Arno lives . - Chester Ave . Is the only way in there . If we block it off , we 've got him caged in , right ? Let 's go ! How am I gonna get there ? I got a flat tire . Ride your rim . - Come on , Schuylar , bring it over here . - I 'm coming . - Schuylar , hurry up ! - I can 't . I think I 'm out of gas . Come on , let 's shove him in . - Come on ! - [ Dexter ] Push ! [ Arno ] Is this as fast as this thing 'll go ? [ Cookie ] I got it floored , boss . I don 't know what more you want me to do . - [ Arno ] Go through there . - [ Cookie ] Gotcha . We 're out of control , boss . Let 's go ! Oh , my God ! What 's going on ? - What happened ? - You idiot ! - There they are ! - A pool . - There 's the formula . - It 's over there . - Boss , I can 't swim . - Good ! Don 't just stand around . Let 's get him out of there ! [ Sergeant ] Pull them out . Get ' em over to the police car . - [ Arno ] You stupid ... - Knock it off . Get ' em over there . - Come on . - Got it ! There still might be time . Let 's go . Hurry ! Look at him . The winner won 't be announced for five minutes and there he is accepting congratulations . The man is disgusting . That improvement in the helio-spectrogram was really something . - I 'm afraid he deserves to win . - He does not ! If Druffle hadn 't been bitten by those bumble bees , we 'd have had this thing locked up . He 's winning by forfeit . He 's always pulling something like this . The man 's behavior is practically criminal . Eugene , how nice to see you . Hello , Collingsgood . Congratulations . You can 't congratulate me now . There are four minutes left . We don 't even know who won yet . There 's Mr. Forsythe on the platform . Will you excuse me ? I want to get close , so I don 't have to fight through the crowd - when the announcement is made . - Certainly . He doesn 't know who the winner is going to be , but he wants to be close , so he doesn 't have to fight his way through the crowd . [ Tires screeching ] I hope we 're not too late . [ Dexter ] Forsythe , wait a second ! Have you announced the winner yet ? - No . - We 've still got time then . We got it ! The real formula got stolen and we just got it back . If you 'll let us demonstrate , it 'll just take a second . It sounds unbelievable , but go ahead . Thanks . Okay , Schuylar , get over there . Not with the invisibility again ! They 're not going to get away with it this time . Okay , I 'm ready . If you just watch closely , it only takes two squirts . Stop that ! Sorry , Dean , I didn 't mean to get it on ... - You didn 't disappear . - He 's still there . Of course , I didn 't disappear . Can you get it through your thick heads once and for all nobody is going to disappear ? ! I don 't know why they insist on ridiculing me . First that Schuylar walks around ... - Something 's happened . - Smells like chlorine . - It does . - Maybe some pool water got into it . Maybe it 's just diluted . There is no such thing as invisibility . There it goes ! [ Higgins ] I think I 'll go home . You should too , you 're getting that blank look again . Congratulations once more . You ought to start working out . Your grip isn 't what it used to be . Goodbye , folks . People certainly get carried away at these parties . [ Screaming ] [ Higgins ] Thanks for the invitation , Mr. Forsythe . What 's the matter with everyone ? Are they going crazy ? [ Screaming ] [ Higgins ] My dear fella , you ought to get other work . You 're making everybody nervous . I 've never seen people act so strange . I wonder what was in that champagne . I 'll have to ... [ screaming ] What 's he doing lying on the floor ? What a dream ! Wait a minute , I 'm here ? It wasn 't a dream ? It certainly wasn 't . Dean Eugene Higgins ... I take great pride in presenting this check to Medfield College . $ 50,000 . The Forsythe Science Award , for your massive contribution to the advancement of science . That was close ! That was close ! We just won the award by the skin of our teeth . [ Dexter ] We sure did . At least Higgins can pay off that $ 50,000 mortgage now . - The school 's good for another year . - [ Debbie ] But that 's the problem . He was able to come up with $ 50,000 this year because you invented invisibility . But next year he 's got to come up with $ 50,000 again . Plus , I discovered invisibility by accident . How many times is something like that gonna happen ? [ Schuylar ] Don 't start borrowing trouble . This year 's all taken care of , right ? As far as next year is concerned , don 't worry about it . I 'll think of something .

 No matter what Traynor says , I 'm not a traitor . I 've come here in all sincerity because I can no longer believe in the Master Plan . It has misled us all , except you here in the Community . I thought it would save the world . That the trees and flowers and a few Misfits didn 't matter , but they do . The Plan would destroy them . We must save the Community before it 's too late . But before you wouldn 't help at all . That 's when I still believed in the Plan , Liz . But now I see it 's all been a great error . What was meant to save the world has destroyed it . Oh ! ( Screaming ) - Vera ! - Simon ! I was looking for you and they found me and made me bring them here . The light ! - What did you do that for ? - Nothing must stand in the way , Simon . The Master Plan is supreme . Alpha Four , you certainly took your time getting here . Traynor , once your controller in chief . I am resuming command . - Commander Traynor ? - That 's right . You 're a social criminal . - No . - You were denounced . By that man there . Falsely . He trumped up charges against me to get me out of his way . It can be proved , I assure you . I don 't understand all this . is it true , Controller ? All I 'm sure of at the moment is that our colleague is playing a game . You invented evidence to say I 'd tampered with the Master Plan . You betrayed me with lies ! You told me the Master Plan was going to hurt a lot of people , so you changed it . - Rubbish . More lies . - A little tale to win your confidence , Liz . You ... To think that you of all people could hope to overthrow me . A boy that I introduced to the world of science . You 'd never have been anywhere if it hadn 't been for me . Just a moment. I came to this place because I needed evidence against 2957 . I wanted proof that he was sheltering a misfit Community . - You wanted power . - You were untrue to the Master Plan . - No . - How can you deny it ? All we know for certain is somebody edited those instruction tapes . Somebody even changed a figure from 1 , 200 million to 1 , 500 million gallons . There can 't be any doubt in your mind . Did you ever see the evidence against me ? You helped create the Plan . I was its principal architect . 2957 always hated me for that . Naturally , when I was accused , I had to run . There was no other way that I could hope to fight back . I repeat , Alpha Four , I am resuming command . imprison them ! You 're mad ! This Plan of yours is burning up the world ! - No use now . - Put them in the hut . We 'll decide in the morning what to do with them . When we get back to the Ministry , there 'll be an inquiry . But I understand enough of the character of 2957 to suppose that ... Excuse me , Commander . - Simon , what are you doing ? - Hm ? Well , look , this is the earth , right ? Turning on its axis . Up here we have the great continental land masses . But down here mainly ocean . - What 's called the water hemisphere . - So ? What happens if you get too much water pumped into the water hemisphere ? What effect is it likely to have on the land masses ? You 're clever , aren 't you , Simon ? I mean , really clever . Better than most . Well , what will happen to us exactly ? What 's the form ? Well , I 'll have to face an inquiry , stand trial . But as for you people , Misfits , well , you go direct to ... institutions . - To jail ? - All right. lf you want to call it that . - And the Community will be broken up ? - Yes . Traynor . I suppose it 's as much my fault as anybody 's . I was a fool to trust him . But Liz believed and I thought at least it was possible ... ls it ... ? is it true ? - ls what true ? - What he said . That you trumped up charges against him . You know , Beth , at one time I was only anxious to be an important and respected member of the Technocracy . Nothing else mattered to me . I 'm different now . I trusted Traynor and I was wrong . Oh , I don 't understand you people . When you 're not throwing innocent children into jail , you 're cutting each other 's throats . You really believe that ? With someone you 've known all your life ? - Hey ! - What ? Water vapour . Yes , why not ? Can 't you screech more quietly ? Some of us are trying to sleep . Don 't you get it ? If too much water was pumped into the water hemisphere , the one thing you wouldn 't get over the land masses was as much condensation . It would all happen down here , which would explain that fog over the southern Atlantic and ... Of course. lf the situation grew critical , complete breakdown of the atmosphere . Things like static discharge , sonic booms . Finally breakdown in the structure of the air itself . Loss of nitrogen , oxygen . And that 's the Master Plan . That 's what Traynor wants . - Everything in order ? - All 's well , Alpha Four . - Alpha Four ? - Yes , Commander ? What are the arrangements concerning the prisoners ? March them to the jungle edge at daybreak and have the hovercraft patrols pick them up . Yes . Yes . That march sounds like a good idea . Tire them out . They might be tempted to make a last stand out of love of a primitive place like this . ( Chuckles ) A place like this . Have you ever reflected , Four , how inefficient nature is ? - inefficient ? - Mm . In the early days of the Master Plan , we had to make certain grave decisions . There were still a lot of old men about who thought that there was nothing more perfect than a flower . But objective study showed us that no matter how beautiful it may be , there are few things as wasteful , cumbersome and unproductive as a flower . - Of course . - Something had to be done about that . Something had to be done about natural forms in general . And so the infinite leap was taken . The ultimate commitment made . Why , to remake the world , Four , in a new manner . For years , we scientists have fought to control nature . Now , at last , it was decided that we should vanquish her . An end , do you see ? An end and a beginning . Nature is finished now . Done for . We observe her death throes . Easy , now . Just a hole big enough to crawl through . There we are , Meg . Now , don 't go hurting yourself again . We 've got to get started in a minute . All right , Liz ? - Well ... - Hm . Give it here . You never were much of a needle woman until you were forced to it . Will we ever get away from here , Beth ? Truly ? We 've got to . - Simon ? - Yes ? is it ... I mean , are we watching the end of the world ? If everything is true about the atmosphere breaking up , and not even enough oxygen in the air , that 's the finish , isn 't it ? Well , it depends on how far things go , Liz . If it stops right away , maybe things will be OK . But if it gets much worse ... Well , there 's hope for Beth and the Community , then . Some future . Of course , but what we 've got to see to is there 's a lot more future for everybody . This is only a projection for us , so providing we can get back to our time and stop the Master Plan happening , it won 't be like this . No . No , that 's right . When the others head for the caves , we 'll make for the time barrier . Yes . - You are clever , aren 't you ? - What ? A proper little A plus , but I 'm just a D minus . Nothing 's going to change that . Nothing we can do . Liz , stop it ! So , an early start , Four , just as you suggest . - l think I 'll get some rest now . - Of course , Commander Traynor . Right , you first , Beth . When I 've got them all out , head for the caves as fast as you can . But you , you 'll take care . - OK , play . - But I don 't see what this is all about . We look as if we 're playing , so everything will seem normal . Normal ? But I 'm rotten at chess . Wrong . Hey , you ! - Stop ! - ( Gun fires ) ( Screaming ) ( Paul ) He got in front , took the bullet . ( Beth ) Quickly ! ( Guard ) Stop ! - What 's going on ? - They 're getting away . All Deltas , assemble ! An escape ! - You , what 's your part ? - Why don 't you let them go ? Be quiet ! I 'm not taking this from you ! You made us think you were on our side . ( Traynor ) You are out of your own time . What 's going on has nothing to do with you . - Your Master Plan will destroy the world . - Simon , quickly ! Argh ! Quickly . After Beth and the others . Move ! Argh ! You 're burning up the world ! No , Simon , remaking the world . Doing away with what 's useless . You pumped too much water from east to west . There 's no saying the new world will resemble the old . The surface may become uninhabitable , so we 'll live underground . We 'll live according to science ... Are you all right ? An old man , eh , Simon ? Not able to keep up with the youngsters any more . But I 'll see my life 's work completed yet . - Oh , yes . - You want to change everything ? A new world , Simon . Very soon . A new world . - ( Deltas groaning ) - All that matters . It must have gone right through the shoulder . - We can 't stay here much longer . - Find something to bandage it with . If only we had some water . ( Both ) Simon ! - ls something wrong ? - No . We wondered where you 'd got to . - We thought Alpha Four had caught you . - No , he was still dazed . Simon , we 've got to talk to you . I think it 's time ... time you chose between Vera and me . - Time I did what ? - You know what I mean . We can 't go on without clearing things up. I 'm just a D minor ... - lf you 're going on about that ... - Maybe I 'm just silly . But I don 't like people thinking I 'm an idiot . I 'm not. I 'm just me . It 's all I want to be , too . The way Beth is Beth and trees are trees . There 's one thing to understand about these computer tests , as far as we 're concerned , they 're grotty . - Oh , are they ? - That 's what I say , too . - You ? - They 're just for 1990 for Technocrats . But if that world 's going to be under the ground or full of clones , I don 't want to be more than a D minus myself . The world under the ground ? Who said that ? Commander Traynor . We 've got to get back , Liz . - Yes . - As soon as we can . Get back where ? Oh , Vera . Oh , Vera . It 's all right , really. I am silly . It 's good to be halfwitted . I should be glad . Caves , Beth . The caves . Yes . That should be all right now you 're patched up . - Must get there . - Of course . Yes , yes , I 'm all right now . What time is it ? - Nearly 05 : 00 . - Less than half an hour to daylight . Good . - They won 't get far . - Right , move . Caves up there , Beth . Leave me here. I 'll catch up . Simon . You and Liz start getting the Community across . Yes , that 's right. I 'll stay with you . No . - Simon , at once ! - All right . OK , come on . Follow me . Keep together , though . Come on . This way . What 's the matter with you ? Get on your feet . Come on ! Move . ( Screams ) Come on ! - Get a move on ! - Come on ! Quick ! Come on ! - All right to move on now ? Time we did . - Leave me . That 's fine talk . We get away and leave you . Come on , Controller 2957 . Suddenly that sounds so formal . Shall I call you 29 for short ? Perhaps just Simon . We 've made it . ( Everyone gasping ) - Mm . Yes , it is. lt 's good water . - ( Cheering ) We 'll be all right here . Right , then . Beth and 2957 , then the time barrier . Look ! You see ? You can 't escape . No one ... No one escapes the new world . Come on . Argh ! No escape from that brightness . They 'll never bother us here . - lf we survive . - You will . Liz and I mean to see to it . No ! Come back ! Get up ! Get after them ! They 're enemies of the new world . On your feet ! We mustn 't stop now . We must ... Alpha Four . Alpha Four .

 Hey , you 're back ! How did you get on ? Not so good , Vera. lt 's harder every day . Look at these mushrooms . We tried all the usual places . Even some new ones . - There 's nothing better to be had . - Not enough damp ? Not enough shade . Sometimes , I think the trees are losing their leaves . Oh , that 's our Paul , always merry and bright ! Look at my cabbages ! They 're coming on just fine . ( Beth laughs hysterically ) - He 'll be here shortly . - Now look , Beth , if he 's me ... He 's you , all right , I 've got the scars to prove it . If he really is me , how come he 's not called Simon , why 's he got a number ? 2957 . Controller 2957 ... Who wants a number instead of a name ? Controller 2957 , Controller 2956 , or that choosy Controller 2955 ! I don 't understand why you laugh so much ! The other Beth was angry at me . - What other Beth ? - Try and get hold of it ! We saw you in another projection . There was a laboratory and you were a scientist . - Never ! - You were ! Me as a crazy poet , all right , Liz . Me as a beat-up schoolmarm , fine . But me as a scientist ? Not on your life ! - What 's wrong with being one ? - Would you like to see the scars ? I usually charge a small fee . - l don 't know what you mean . - You 're not making sense . Liz , have you heard that when people laugh a lot , it 's because they might cry if they didn 't ? - Yes . - Then I need say no more . Surely . - Psst ! Outsiders ! Quick ! - ( Simon ) What the ... ? - Don 't try anything ! - Paul , do you have to be so earnest ? They may be outsiders but it doesn 't mean they 're not friends . - Choking me ... ! - We can 't take chances . - Where are they from ? - They 're Liz and Simon . My friends . They just wandered here. I thought they must be Misfits looking for a bed . The Community can 't take on any more members . - There 's not enough food ! - Paul ... There isn 't ! You don 't know how bad things are . - Can 't breathe ! - Shut up ! Are you Misfits , pushed out of the Cleared Sector maybe ? No ... I don 't know ... Delocalised because of the devastated terrain ... They don 't carry any social registration , we needn 't go into it any deeper . - ( Simon chokes ) - Paul , can you release Simon ? It 's splendid of you to be so concerned for our security . But he 's going purple . ( Vera laughs ) ( Pounding ) - These children have nowhere to live ? - No . That 's why they 're called Misfits . I founded this Community to look after them . - How come they 've got nowhere to go ? - They 've just been left over , Simon . When different areas have been cleared for geographical reconstruction or because of a technological mistake , somewhere has become uninhabitable . - Like Liverpool . - Liverpool , uninhabitable ? The authorities make no provision for Misfits so we do the best we can . So there 's a lot of this geographical reconstruction in England ? You wouldn 't know anything about that . This is the age of scientific advancement . The Technocracy rules us and progress comes first . We 're going in for bigger and better industry , - more machines , mechanical people ... - ( Loud rumbling ) ( Simon ) What on earth 's that ? ( Hush descends ) What was that ? - Thunder . - That was thunder ? I told you everyhing was bigger and better in the age of scientific advancement , didn 't I ? Who ... ? Who are you ? I haven 't seen you before , have I ? You 're ... - You 're Controller 2957 . - Yes , but for a moment , I thought ... Controller ! Lurking in the bushes like a Misfit on the run . I wanted to speak to you but there were a lot of people . - You know it 's dangerous for me here . - Oh , yes . Heaven knows what they 'd say in the city if you 'd been seen talking to a social outcast like me . I see you 've met our newest arrival , young Simon . - What name did you say ? - Simon . And his friend Liz . You 're not expecting me to believe ... I beg your pardon , Controller , what am I not expecting you to believe ? - Fearfully hot . - Hotter than it was yesterday . But not as hot as it will be tomorrow . I wasn 't intending a criticism . The overall European plan allows for a rise to 100 degrees in Britain during geographical reconstruction . Later , we shall return to a steady 60 . Bully for the Ministry of Forward Development . I 'm not here to talk about that . I came to help you again , if I can . I don 't recall ever asking for any help . No , you didn 't . But you take such awful chances , Beth ! This Community 's illegal . You could get into trouble if you 're found running it . That puts an obligation on me . I owe you something ... l-l mean ... for old times ' sake . I , er ... l-l brought you this . It 's a licence . - A which ? - A licence . For the Community . Don 't ask me how I got it , just take it . Present it , should you be discovered , and the blame comes back to the Ministry . - To you ? - No , I can 't afford to be involved ! To the Department as a whole , the central computer . An administrative error . I see . We ... I ... are ... am an administrative error and you , out of the kindness of your heart , want to help me for old times ' sake ? Well , this , dear 2957 , is what you can do with your help ! - Beth , have you gone mad ? - Really , Beth ... - Keep out of it ! - This is official ! Yes , Simon , Beth is right ! He 's not risking his skin ! - lt 's all talk with you , Simon ! - Liz ... ( Electronic gun ) - Hunters , again . Closer ! - Who are they ? What are they hunting ? I mustn 't be found here ! Beth , please ... ! Action stations , everyone ! Plan Three ! - To the tower ! Up ! - Hurry ! Come on ! Come on ! Up ! ( Beth ) Don 't worry , Controller . We 'll protect you . We don 't mind who we save from the Technocrats . - l still don 't know what they 're hunting . - Wildlife , of course . - Pheasants and that , for food ? - No , sport 's out these days . Food is created scientifically . Wildlife is considered a nuisance . The authorities send out hunters to keep the bird population down . - But that 's awful ! - No , it 's progress . Ask 2957 . - Some more fish , Liz ? Beth ? - No , thanks . Dig in while you can . We might not be having many more protein meals . - Paul ! - There 'll always be fish in the rivers . Not if the Technocracy has its way . Pollution 's creeping into the streams . In a year , there won 't be a fish left in the British Isles . - He 's joking , isn 't he ? - With all the gay abandon of 1990 ! This is a killingly funny time we live in . Ask 2957 ! - How did it all happen ? - How did what happen ? England becoming a hot country and that . - You 're so ill-informed . - l know the theory ... lt 's the educational system . Schools don 't explain the Master Plan properly . The Master Plan ? What 's that ? Are you joking ? Everybody knows something about the Master Plan . It 's our road to technological efficiency . Since the Russians melted their section of the polar icecaps , we 've been able to change the face of Europe . Re-site cities , divert rivers , extend trade . The critics complain about accidents . It was a shame what happened to Liverpool , but with most exports by air freight , who needs it above water , anyway ? ( Gasps ) - Why do you have a number ? - lt should be safe for me to go ... - l want to know . - Who are you , anyway ? In a computerised society , surely it 's obvious ... ( Vera screams ) Where did he come from ? What did he see ? Beth , you see , you live on a razor 's edge ! You 're only frightened for yourself ! You don 't care about me ! 362 . A Delta . Well , that 's lucky . Dump him somewhere in the jungle . He won 't remember much tomorrow . I 'll put in a computer order and have him transferred to Scotland . Quickly ! ( Paul ) Come on ! I hope you 're satisfied . You 're outside society , Beth . Outside the course of history . is that what you really want of life ? Things have changed since we were young . It 's a different world . Better organised . More ... No , wait , I ... ( Simon ) Controller ... Oh , it 's only me , Simon . This is a ridiculous situation for a man in my position . - l am a Controller . - What does that mean ? In the Ministry of Forward Development . I have responsibility for an entire sector of geographical reconstruction . Beth . What 's the matter with Beth ? Why does she want to live here ? Jungle , primitive , unhygienic ... Natural ! You 've known Beth a long time , haven 't you ? Ever since she was Liz . - l wanted to talk to you ... - None of your business ! I 'm Simon . Would it help if I told you my other name was ... - No ! Don 't say it ! - Why not ? It 's more than a man in my position should have to cope with ! It 's nothing to do with geographical reconstruction . And how on earth do you suppose we 'd get a permit for it ? ( Coughing ) There we are . All right , Vera , dear ? Better ? Thank you. lt was just a bit of a shock , that 's all . Eat up . - Beth ? - Yes ? - You really like 2957 , don 't you ? - What did you say ? - Deep down . - How can you like someone who 's trying to destroy you ? He isn 't ! That licence wasn 't much but he did it ... That was a sham . I thought you weren 't taken in by it . Look , he said what he really felt before he left . He thinks of me as something stubborn . Old-fashioned . A survivor from another age . Hm ! Well , maybe I am . But he 's something worse . The new world . And I 'm the enemy of that . And he , if he only knew , helped make me one . I suspected it , of course. I 'm not a fool . But to think that it 's true ! The Master Plan has nothing to say about time phases and the barrier . - This Master Plan seems important . - Of course , Simon ! By the time we 've finished , we 'll have remade the world ! It 'll be as splendid and efficient as a great machine - perfect , faultless ! - But I still don 't see why ... - Well ? Well , you ! You 're like me in a lot of ways . But in others ... One serves , Simon . One serves . - Serves what ? - Don 't you understand ? Science is more than a meal ticket for industrialists , which is all it amounted to in your day . Now , science is the direction of the human race . The present ... and the future . The norm . Very well . You shall see if you don 't believe me . I don 't care what the risks are , you shall see . Here , on the edge of the jungle , tomorrow morning , I 'll pick you up by hovercraft and take you to my office in the Ministry . All right ? You must understand , you know . You , of all people . ( Big Ben chimes ) ( Thunder rumbles ) - And that 's Whitehall ? - Yes . - The old place has changed a bit ! - Thank goodness , Simon . Still that queer thunder . Morning , Controller . - Why , you 're ... - l beg your pardon ? Alpha 16 , Simon . A possible new recruit to the Sector from the North . Another country boy come to town ? We shall have to call ourselves the Ministry of Rural Expansion ! That ... that 's just like a lady I used to know called Miss Stebbins . No , no , Alpha 16 . - And this is your office ? - That 's right . - Room 209 ? - Mm-hm . Ah , Controller , I 've just been collating your computer instructions . Nothing urgent , save a bit of pressure over the section of the Atlantic Sea Curtain we 're responsible for . is that still reading amber ? I thought we gave them the go-ahead . This is Simon , he 's interested in our work here . Alpha 17 . - 17 ? - New blood , eh ? We can always do with that , provided it 's suitably blue , of course . Controller , I should 've told you a report came in from Temperature Records . It was 100 plus in Eastbourne yesterday . - Nice for the bathers . - But not in accord with the Master Plan . No doubt one of those freak variations , Alpha 16 . We only have general surveillance . Just as you say . - Just going to pop for some tea , 16 . - Not a bad idea ! - One has been at work 20 minutes ! - 25 ! Shall we pop together ? You pop and I 'll follow . - They 're exactly alike ! - Yes , perfect secretaries . There 's a lot I don 't get around here . I realise some things must 've changed but ... - When were you here before ? - That day we ... - l came from Liz 's place . - Simon ! - We came to see Commander Traynor ... - Don 't mention that name ! Well , I brought you here to give you an idea of our plan as a whole , didn 't I ? This way . These are the new conurbations . London , Cardiff , Manchester , Glasgow , Belfast . The whole populace will live here ... - ( Simon ) Everybody ? - lt makes economic sense . Communications . We 've cleared wasteful living space so we can construct fast , efficient throughways like these , you see ? Geographical reconstruction is done according to the overall European plan . We can divert rivers and re-site lakes as we choose . We can even move mountains . The Atlantic Sea Curtain holds back water pumped from our latitudes into the Southern Ocean . ( Simon ) Why does that have to be done ? Since the melting of the polar icecaps , we 've had a flooding problem . We 've gained a climate for development but on the other hand ... Sorry , I didn 't know you were engaged . Oh , er , come in , Alpha Four . - A young friend , Simon . - Old-fashioned nomenclature . He 's applying for Controller status . I wanted a word about this Atlantic Sea Curtain . Alpha Four is my second-in-command . The synthetic rubber sheeting for the next stage hasn 't been made as required . Once the sea-bed cable was laid , I gave orders to start producing it . - Have you checked the computer ? - Yes . No record . That 's not possible ! I authorised commencement ! Curiouser and curiouser . I would 've cleared it up with you yesterday but you weren 't in . - No ... - Off gallivanting and out of reach . I was on special business yesterday afternoon . - l 'll clear up the mystery . - l hope so . We have to complete our section of the Curtain by the New Year . - l 'm aware of that . - The Americans are already ahead . Yes , thank you , Alpha Four . - He 's called Alpha like the others . - What ? Last time it was Alpha Four . Alpha 16 , Alpha 17 , now Alpha Four . - That 's right . - Why Alpha ? Don 't worry about such things ! - l 'm only trying to find things out . - Yes , I know , - but you wouldn 't understand . - And why not ? You simply wouldn 't ! It has nothing to do with the Master Plan . Alphas are just ... rather special people in our society . If it makes you any the wiser , they 're what are called clones . This is the central computer for the Master Plan . All information is correlated here . Each department feeds in its instructions and ... ( Bleeping ) 'Sorry to disturb you but it seems there 's some trouble about the sea-bed cable . ' That 's all finished with ! - ' Afraid not ... ' - All right , I 'll be right over ! - What 's wrong ? - Look around by yourself. I 'll be back . ( Bleeping ) ( Chuckles softly ) What are you doing ? Commander Traynor !

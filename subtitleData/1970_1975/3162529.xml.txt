 We are met to bid farewell to one who lived amongst us . It has been said of the ape that his days are like grass . Like a flower of the field , he flourishes ripening in fullness and is gone . Rest forever , Lucian father of Fauna . Why ? Why ? How could they do it ? Them animals , Fauna , just animals . They don 't know any better . I hate them . I hate them ! We will capture them , Fauna . I make this promise to you on the grave of your father . The humans will be captured and punished for what they have done . A hundred humans for every ape . They hide their killers . They will lie for their killers . The time has come , Perdix , for apes to unite , drive the humans out ! No ! This will be handled within the law . And I am the law ! It 's a nice , friendly community you have here , Jasko . They 're doing this all because one ape was killed . The killing caused the kettle to boil over . The apes here hate humans . There 's too many of us . These dragoons , as you call them , surely they 're illegal . I mean , even ape law forbids such action against humans . Perdix and Zon , well , they try but they can 't be everywhere . Come on , something , anything , jump on that hook . Galen , why don 't we teach you how to fish ? Oh , no . The only thing I like less than fish is the water they swim in . Look ! Dragoons . Let 's go ! Clear out , human ! This is my home ! Then watch it burn ! No , don 't ! No , don 't ! Let that be a lesson to all humans ! Oh , boy ! Oh , it 's so senseless ! Why ? Why ? Why ? I could make a guess . We 've seen this kind of thing before , another time , another place . It almost makes me ashamed to be an ape . Isn 't there something we can do about it ? For openers , we can look for the killers . This whole thing started when that ape girl 's father was murdered . Maybe she could help us . I 'll talk to her . Who is it ? Who 's there ? We are strangers but we wish you no harm . You are apes ? I don 't think there is any doubt that I am an ape , a chimpanzee . Why ? I 'm sorry , but for a moment I was afraid you were humans . Surely you 're not afraid of humans . They killed my father . I 'm sorry . But I didn 't know that they killed apes . They 're savages , and I hate them ! I shall always hate them for what they did . My name is Phoebus , and these are my friends Alar and Pargo . I am Fauna . - Where are you ? - We 're right here . Your voice sounds familiar , which one are you ? I 'm Pargo . I don 't think you 've ever met me . I 'm from a very distant place . Yes , we 've been traveling for a long way . You must be tired and hungry , then . Won 't you come to my house and rest ? I have food and drink . - Do you live alone ? - With my Uncle Sestus . He 's gone to the village for supplies , but he will be back by nightfall . Well , we don 't have very much time to spare , but we are very hungry . Good . Follow me , then . I hope you will stay to see Uncle Sestus . You will like him . You will be notified when we raid again . See you , Sestus . Please sit down and be comfortable . May we help you with something ? Because I am blind ? No , don 't be silly . I manage quite well . Being unable to see has really changed very little . I know the farm and most of the area around for some distance so well that I don 't really need my eyes . Of course , there are some things I miss : Setting of the sun colors of the flowers and reading . Reading most of all . My father collected books and though I read them all before I lost my sight he used to sit and read them to me over and over again . Every night by the fire , my father would ... I 'm sorry , Fauna . Those humans ? Do you know who they were ? No one knows . My uncle Sestus was going to meet my father and saw it . But he was too far away to help . How did it happen ? There were two of them . They had come here asking for food , and my father gave it to them . He tried to be friends with them . Uncle Sestus warned him that humans were treacherous but he wouldn 't listen . Then later , down by the sea they attacked my father , and they killed him . What about your uncle ? Did he get a description of them ? How tall they were , their hair , or what they were wearing ? No , it was dark . He saw very little . Besides , how can you tell one human from another ? When I could see , they all looked alike to me . I have the same problem . - Pargo . Pargo , where are you ? - Right here . I 'm sorry , Fauna . I 'm afraid I spilled the milk . It 's all right . I 'll clean it up . Pour yourself some more . Uncle Sestus ! Fauna , I think there 's something we better tell you . - What ? What is it ? - You said you miss reading most of all . Well , we share the love of books with you . It 's gotten us into trouble with the Ministry of Knowledge . Trouble ? What kind of trouble ? There 's some books we didn 't know had been banned and the police found them in our house . They were punishing you for reading ? Actually , it was the ideas in a book that people felt challenged their way of life . But surely it can 't be against the law to think ? Your uncle might not be as understanding as you are . - So we better leave . - We 're gonna go . I 'm afraid Uncle Sestus doesn 't quite feel the same as I do about books . He and my father used to quarrel about them . I have an idea . A place where you can hide safely and rest . It 's not far from here . - I don 't think that 's a very ... - Please ! Please , let me do this for you . It would give me so much pleasure . They 're still here . I haven 't needed these for a long time . I used to come here with someone I grew up with someone I cared for very , very much . It was our secret place where we could laugh and hide and shut out the grown-up world . He left when I became blind . - Pargo ? - I 'm here , Fauna . Your voice reminded me ... It sounded so much like his . I wonder ... May I touch your face ? It would help to know what you look like . It 's just as I thought . A strong , handsome face . You 'll be safe here . I 'll come back in the morning with food after Uncle Sestus leaves for the village . Will you stay ? Please . I 'll stay . And thank you , Fauna . Man , that was close . I didn 't like doing that . I don 't think it 's right to deceive her . Yeah . And we still came up empty . She has no idea who the killers are . Except they were humans . If only we could find them . Yes , I know , Galen . I feel sorry about her father . We have to stop the dragoons . And solve a local murder mystery . Hey , the dragoons are local killers , right ? - They 're homegrown . - Right . The two humans who killed Fauna 's father could be homegrown too . You can bet that some ape 's gonna find them and gun them down . It 's open season on humans . And who 's gonna stop the apes ? Okay , so we zero in on the dragoons . Try to get to the leader . If we get him , the whole thing could fall apart . That doesn 't make any sense at all . If you do find a member , do you expect him to be the leader ? No , Galen . Somebody joins the dragoons infiltrates and gets the scoop on everybody ? And who is this somebody that gets the scoop on every ... ? Me . Stop ! Oh , stop ! Please . Stop ! Please ! What is it ? What 's the matter ? I 've been attacked by two humans . They stole my horse . What sort of a district is this ? Have you no law ? I understand your anger , but don 't shout at me . I 'm sorry . I didn 't steal your horse . I am sorry , but you see I came here to find a farm and to settle down . Well , this is a good district , although we do have problems with humans . We are solving those problems . I 'm sure . Please , is there a village near here where I can report this to the police ? Climb up . I 'll take you there . Thank you . That 's wonderful . You know , I never knew there was so much ham in an ape . Pete ! Dragoon ? Who knows ? Maybe . We could follow him , maybe learn something . Wait ! No we , me . Fauna 's expecting you back at the cave . We don 't want her to get suspicious . A few weeks past , my brother was murdered by humans . Really ? Well , I certainly hope those humans were dealt with . Haven 't been caught yet . I sometimes wonder if they ever will . You and I have that in common . A similar thing happened where I lived . We knew how to deal with those ... Sorry , I was pledged to secrecy . You don 't think that I 'd ever say anything to hurt an ape or help a human ? Well , really , a group of us apes got together and we ran those humans off and burned their houses and we even killed a few . Did you really ? We certainly did . I can tell you , we haven 't had any trouble with humans since then . Good . Very sound . You know , Phoebus I think you will enjoy meeting some special friends of mine . Hello , Fauna . Pargo ? Yeah . Alar is not here ? I brought food . No , no . He and Phoebus went off to get some water . I am glad . I enjoy talking with you . Yeah , well ... Yeah , me too . Pargo ? Yeah ? Could you tell me about the books you 've read ? Could you tell me some of the stories ? Yeah , I guess . Yeah , well , there was this one I always used to like . It was a story about this ... About an ape who was stranded on this island in the middle of this tremendous ocean . Now , his name was Robinson Crusoe . A toast to our dragoon to be , Phoebus ! To Phoebus ! To all apes ! To all apes ! To all dragoons ! To all dragoons ! Congratulations , Phoebus . You are soon to be one of us . You don 't know how pleased that makes me . At the meeting tonight , you 'll get our leader 's final approval . And then I will be a full-fledged dragoon . A brother to all of us . Afterwards , you will ride with us while we raid on the humans ! Easy , boy . Easy , boy . Easy , boy . Easy . Hey , Alan ! Pete ! How 'd you do ? Our friend led me to the dragoons ' meeting place about a mile from here . Nice . Now , if Galen clicks , we 're in business . - Look at this . - What is it ? A journal written by Fauna 's father . She never knew what was in it . So she asks me to read it to her . I stop when I get to the part that he 's meeting with humans in secret . Humans that he liked . They were buddies . - They liked him too . - Yeah . He knows the apes are afraid of humans and hate humans . But he 's meeting them in secret to teach them and share his knowledge . It doesn 't make sense . No human is gonna harm the only ape who 's trying to help them . I wonder if Sestus could be mistaken . What if her father wasn 't killed by humans ? Yeah , mistaken or lying ? Come on . My niece , Fauna , will see to you . Tell her that you 'll be staying with us , and I 'll be back shortly . - Fauna . That 's a pretty name . - She 's a gentle girl . She 's blind . And , Phoebus , she knows nothing of my activities . I 'd like it kept that way . Of course , of course . When I return , I 'll bring a horse for you . You 'll be needing it . - Hello . - Phoebus ? Yes . Here , let me help you . Did you get your water ? Water ? Yes , Pargo said you and Alar went to get some . Water , yes . I think that 's finished . There . You were with Pargo ? At the cave . He told me a story about an ape named Robinson Crusoe . He has a way with females . I think I love him . Isn 't that kind of sudden ? I know he reminds me of someone else , but it isn 't just that . There 's a warmth in his voice . A gentleness all his own that makes me feel more alive than I 've felt in a long time . Fauna you must be careful . You can 't trust a love that comes so quickly . Is time any guarantee that a love will be binding ? Phoebus , I know it 's asking a lot for him to love someone who is blind but do you think it 's possible ? - Do you want an honest answer ? - Of course . No , I do not think that it is possible . I can do anything that a female with sight can do . Except to recognize the truth . He is not an ape that you can trust . I don 't believe you . You 're the one not to be trusted ! You 're supposed to be his friend yet you speak of him as an enemy . - He is my friend but I know him . And I 'm ... I 'm very concerned about you . I don 't want to hear any more from you . Leave me alone . Go away . Galen , any luck ? You were right . Sestus not only knows about the dragoons , he is one of them . Now , what do you know about that ? I 've won their confidence . I am being brought up for membership at a special meeting later today . Hey , good work , Galen . Yeah , well , we know you could pull it off . We all have a great deal to be proud of . Isn 't that right , Pete ? I can 't take any credit . I haven 't done anything . Oh , but you have . - You have indeed . - What 's eating you anyway ? I 'll tell you what 's eating me . I think you should stay away from Fauna . I 'm sorry , Galen . I don 't understand . She is in love with you ! - What do you mean , she 's in love ... ? - She told me . She asked me if I thought you could be in love with her . Well , that 's ridiculous . Ridiculous ? It 's tragic ! Can you imagine what it 'll do to her when she finds out you are human ? Wait ! You 're the one who made her think I was an ape . I didn 't think you 'd get involved with her . - I 'm not involved ! - Come on , knock it off , both of you ! What happened , happened . Nobody planned it . Galen , I don 't wanna hurt her any more than you do . I 'm not going to . I 'll go talk to her . Pete . What ? Be gentle with her . Yeah . Hi , Fauna . Yeah , it 's me , Pargo . You shouldn 't be here . Yeah , well , I had to talk to you . Did Phoebus tell you what I said to him ? Look , Fauna ... It 's all right . It 's all right if you don 't care for me . I understand . It 's too soon . Perhaps in time , you will and then ... Look , I think you 're very lovely and gentle . There are things about me that you don 't know . - Now you sound like Phoebus . - You should 've listened to him . You tell me . You tell me what is so wrong about you that it surpasses what is wrong with me . Wait a minute . This reminds me of a story my mother used to tell me when I was very young . Tell me . This is a story about an old , blind man named Isaac and his two sons , Jacob and Esau . Esau was a hunter . He was strong and hairy , and his father idolized him . Old Isaac was very sick and on his deathbed , he gave Esau his blessing which was a big thing in those days . Now the other son , Jacob , had very soft , smooth skin . And he wanted his father 's blessing as well so he pretended to be his brother Esau by covering his hand with a piece of goatskin . And Isaac was fooled into thinking that he was touching Esau . And he gave Jacob the same blessing . I 'm not sure that I understand the meaning of your story . It was a deception , Fauna born out of desperate need , but not meant to harm anyone . But you couldn 't deceive anyone , Pargo . I have touched your face . It is strong like Esau 's . If it was soft and smooth like Jacob 's I should fear and despise you . Fauna , you must understand that there is nothing between us and there can never be . My friends and I are going to leave here today and you 'll never s ... And you will never hear my voice again . No . Goodbye , Fauna . Hold it ! Hold it ! No yelling . Take it easy , Perdix . We just want to talk to you . We need your help . Our friend 's going to a dragoons meeting . - We 'll take you there to get them . - Our friend 's gonna be in big trouble so we 're not asking you , Perdix . We 're telling you . I 'm not Perdix . Are you looking for me ? As leader of the high council , I now call the dragoons to order . If there are no objections we will not list the grievances voiced by the humans on our last raid . It seems these humans are now dead . I understand we have a new prospect who wishes to join our ranks . Will he please stand ? - Your name ? - Phoebus . Who vouches for Phoebus ? I , Sestus ! Sestus , good . Are you , Phoebus , familiar with the goals of the dragoons ? Oh , yes ! To drive all humans from our land . - And the humans who refuse ? - Death to them ! Death to them all ! It appears Sestus has brought us a worthy prospect . Let us take a vote ! Aye ! Welcome , Phoebus , brother dragoon now and forever . Our next raid ! Our next raid will be on the human shepherd , Rico . We meet tomorrow at midday . Agreed ? Agreed ! And , Phoebus you , you will have the honor of killing him . Thank you very much . Until tomorrow ! No , wait ! Excuse me , I just ... I 'm really not very used to this yet . Is it over ? - Of course . - So soon ? We have no further business to conduct . I have something to say . You know , those two humans who stole my horse and attacked me . - I saw them . - Where ? Actually , it was quite near here . Near my farm ? I don 't believe it ! They were passing through . In fact , I 'm sure they were heading for the beach . Why don 't we go down there and find them ? At night ? I hardly think they 're gonna wait until morning . It 's impossible to search the caves and the cliffs in the dark . At first light , we meet on the beach at Sandy Point . Agreed ? Agreed ! Don 't worry . We 'll get them . I promise you . And you can kill them instead of Rico if you wish . Thank you . Thank you . Is anything wrong , Phoebus ? Oh , no , nothing could be better . Nothing . Come , I 'll take you back to the farm . Do you mind if I stayed here for a while ? I mean , it 's such a very very special night . It 's such a very special place for me . I would like to enjoy it alone for a while . Of course , of course . I 've listened to everything that you have to say and it is clear to me you are lying . - Come on , Perdix ! How can you be sure if you don 't check our story ? You could not know about the dragoons ' meeting place . Even I have not been able to learn that . Why would we come here to lie ? It 's too easy to disprove . I will put you back in your cells and go to this meeting place that you speak of . If the dragoons are there , you will be released . They 're not there now , Perdix . They were last night . First they 're there , then they are not there . I will decide whether to execute you at once or advise Urko before shooting you ! Oh , well , that 's a great pair of options . Back to your cells . Move ! Here , take his gun ! Just get back ! You , against the wall , carefully . Who are you ? I am wearing this mask so you won 't find out . Now , why would I tell you ? I 'll find out ! I 'll track you down if it takes 10 years . I hope you find something better to do for the next 10 years . You can start by capturing the dragoons . But you are a dragoon ! It 's a long story . My horse is out back . The dragoons will be at Sandy Point . - Got it . - Take him , and we 'll meet you there . Perdix , we 're going for a little ride . Outside , nice and easy . Where have you been ? I remember that our plan called for you to bring Perdix to the meeting . He changed our minds . Wait . Wait . Wait . Now , you said you wanted the dragoons . Let 's see if you 're more interested in them than you are in killing me . Come on . Come on ! There 's no one in there ! More caves further back on the beach . All of you , throw down your weapons . - Throw them down ! - No ! Don 't be a fool , Zon . You 're the fool , Perdix . A fool not to side with us . All right , turn your back . Let us kill humans ! We have 10 weapons to your one ! Are you willing to die to save humans ? Are you willing to die to kill me , Zon ? We 've gone too far , Zon . Shut up , Sestus . We set out to do something , and we 'll finish it . I will shut up as far as humans are concerned , but not apes ! I 'll kill anyone , human or ape , who tries to stop us ! Fauna . Fauna , it 's all right now . It 's all right . Pargo ? Pargo , is that you ? Yes , Fauna . No , you 're not Pargo . You 're human . It was a deception born of desperate need , Fauna , not meant to harm . Get away ! Get away from me . Fauna , Fauna ! Fauna . This is your uncle . It 's Sestus . Nothing to be afraid of . But he 's human ! He 's human ! He 's not going to hurt you . Get him ... Get him away . Get him away ! He tricked me . He tricked me like the others tricked my father ! They 're treacherous ! They 're like animals , and they must be treated like animals . Fauna , now listen to me ! This human saved your life . He risked his own life to save you ! No , I hate him ! A human killed my father ! He killed him ! Fauna , it 's Alar . Listen to me , please . Listen . I don 't know if a human did kill your father . But if it happened , that doesn 't mean that all humans are bad just like all apes aren 't good . This Alar speaks the truth . It was not a human that caused your father 's death . - Shut up , Sestus ! - What are you saying , Sestus ? I hated and feared humans , as you do now . But your father was different . He didn 't fear the humans . He trusted them . That night , I was with Zon . No , Sestus ! We warned your father , but he was stubborn . Zon became angry . There was a fight . Zon hit him . He fell and hit his head on a rock . Zon said we were both responsible for his death . Fauna , I couldn 't bring myself to tell you the truth . Sestus is a coward . What difference does it make who killed Lucian ? The humans are still our enemies . We must drive them from our lands ! Kill them . Kill the humans ! Well , listen to me . Listen to me ! Kill them ! Kill them ! Do you hear me ? Listen to me . Kill them ! Kill them ! Give me your pistol , Zon . Let 's go . You 're welcome to stay on at the farm . Thank you , Sestus , but we gotta be moving on . Fauna ... Look , I ... Fauna , I 'm sorry . I hope you forgive me for deceiving you . I just don 't understand how I ... How I could have thought I loved a human . Goodbye .

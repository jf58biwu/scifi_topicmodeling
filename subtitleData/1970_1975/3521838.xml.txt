 You see ? You can 't escape . No one ... No one escapes the new world . Come on . Argh ! No escape from that brightness . They 'll never bother us here . - lf we survive . - You will . Liz and I mean to see to it . No ! Come back ! Get up ! Get after them ! They 're enemies of the new world . On your feet ! We mustn 't stop now . We must ... Alpha Four . Alpha Four . Oh , no , Simon , I can 't go any further . It 's just too hot . Come on . We must make the creek before it gets hotter . You can make it . Why can 't we go back to the caves and stay with the others ? At least we 'll have protection . Yes , but for how long ? Come on . We must keep moving . Simon , look . A blackbird . All the wildlife 's just dying off . How horrible . Come on . Let 's get out of here . Remember when we came ? The time barrier made us swim for it . You wait here. I 'll go and look for it . Simon ! - You leave her alone . - Oh , don 't be afraid . I 've ... I 've come to help you . You don 't expect me to believe that ? Liz and I are going home . Away from clones and away from you . But this is your home . Surely you realise that . What 's he talking about , Simon ? This may be the future to you now , but one day it will be the present . Never . This is only a projection for us . Provided we can stop it , it won 't happen . No . You 're wrong , Simon . It has happened . And what we built , we built together . All of us , including you . You have a scientific mind . You understand . We 're not responsible for burning everything . We must destroy the old world in order to build the new . We 've proved that we can change anything . But you can 't live without trees and flowers. lt 's horrible . Look at it . All you want to do is destroy . No . No . To create . We are going to build again from the very beginning , Simon . You and I . The Technocrats . Don 't you see ? You two have the chance to witness the start of a whole new world , before it actually happens . You can 't go back into the past , can you ? Not yet . - But Commander Traynor , suppose ... - He 's gone . Just as well , crafty old goat . I wouldn 't trust him any further than I could ... Simon , what is it ? What 's wrong ? Hm ? Oh , nothing . Nothing . You don 't believe all that about witnessing the start of a new world ? - Oh , no , of course not . - Because it 's not true . Our place is back in the past , not in this unreal jungle . We 've got to stop this from happening . The only way we can do that is to go back to our own time . Yes , I know that. lt 's just that ... I just wish I knew the answer to so many questions . Oh , come on . Let 's get out of here . Well , go on . What are you waiting for ? I can 't. lt 's not there . What do you mean not there ? I just found it . Let me try . It 's gone . The time barrier 's gone . You don 't think we 're trapped in this awful future ? - No . Traynor 's tricked us . - But he can 't move the time barrier . Do you remember when you tried to get back to me in 1940 ? You couldn 't because you were unsure . Don 't you see ? Traynor 's made us undecided . That 's why we can 't get back . He knows . He 's remembered . Liz , we are trapped in a time bubble . Madness . Absolute madness for us to let those kids go wandering off on their own again after all that 's happened . Jean ? Jean , they haven 't gone through the time barrier again , have they ? - l don 't know . - What do you mean you don 't know ? You 're supposed to be the one with telepathic powers . Well , where are they ? Where are Liz and Simon ? I don 't know. I tell you , I just don 't know . - l 've lost them . - Lost them ? For the last hour I 've been staring at that clock as though it were a magic machine , as though it would tell me where to look for them. lt 's no good . Frank , don 't you understand ? I can only reach them if they 're in the past or the present . - You think they 've gone into the future ? - Yes . Where I can 't reach them . It 's no use , Simon. I 've just got to rest . We 've got to keep going , Liz . What 's the use in sitting around waiting to be burnt to pieces ? In a few hours , the whole jungle may be burnt to a cinder . We 've got to reach those caves . What 's the use ? We 'll never get home . Don 't talk like that . Of course we 'll get home . But we need protection from the sun . Look at it . Everything 's dying . Just fading away . It 's the end of the world . Traynor 's exciting new world . Even the soil 's so dry , it 's beginning to crack . How long till the whole earth falls apart ? What can you expect after interfering with nature and diverting rivers ? He 's probably caused a seismological disturbance . I shouldn 't be surprised if England doesn 't have an earthquake . I hate this place. I hate it . There 's destruction all round us . - Oh , Simon , I want to go home . - Shh ! - What is it ? - l don 't know . Keep down . What if it 's Traynor or the clones ? I can 't see . Keep your head down . What on earth are you two doing here ? ( Both ) Beth . Commander , what are you doing here ? I wonder if you could spare me a few minutes ? I 've already told you on the telephone , there 's no point in your coming here . My business is official . Thank you . Liz and Simon have disappeared . They went off hours ago . And it 's all thanks to you . Are you suggesting that I 've kidnapped them ? Ever since the ice Box , you 've pumped them for information . Leave them alone . My only purpose in coming here is to clarify my position with Simon . Come on . Who are you trying to kid ? You persuaded them to go back through the time barrier . They 've gone back ? But I warned that boy to keep away from the time barrier . He 's deliberately disobeyed me . - You must know where they are . - Look here . I will not allow them to interfere with the future , I will not allow it ! You 've got to go back . You don 't belong here . Of course we 've got to go back . You don 't think I want to stay here ? If this is what England 's going to be like , you can keep it . It 's all my fault , really . If only I hadn 't had doubts about wanting to go home . But I still don 't see how Traynor persuaded you to want to stay here . Look around you . Who in his right mind would want to stay here ? We only have ourselves to blame , Beth . Traynor talked us into believing that the burn-up was necessary . If we went back to our own time now , we 'd miss the beginning of a fantastic new world . A world that would one day be our future . You and your scientific mind , you 're just like Traynor . - You think you know the answers . - What did you do that for ? Isn 't there enough destruction around us without adding to it ? Come on. lt 's not going to help any of us , getting on each others ' nerves . What we 've got to do is try and find a way home for you . Yes , but how ? Perhaps if you tried the time barrier now , it might work . No , it 's too late . The damage has been done . What we 've got to do is find a way of clearing our minds , so we can start all over again . In other words , we need the will to return . And that means both of us . - You must be able to contact Liz . - l can 't . But you could always sense where she was . That 's what makes it such agony . That 's why I feel so lost . Until now I 've always known where she was . If anything was wrong , I knew it because I could feel it . That 's why it 's a shock when I can 't make contact and I don 't know what 's happening . ( Sighs ) lf only Simon had listened to my warning . Let me warn you . If those kids aren 't back soon , the first person I 'll go to is your superior , Colonel Murray . Well , that , my dear Skinner , is your privilege . Simon , it 's impossible . Just because my mother has second sight doesn 't mean I 've inherited it . It 's worth a try . If you could give us the will to return , a chance to clear our minds of doubts , perhaps it will bring back the time barrier . Don 't forget. ln the future , your mother can 't help us . If I 've inherited my mother 's telepathic powers , why hasn 't Liz ? We 're the same person . Why can 't you understand ? We 're in a different time phase . You 're a projection of my future . You see , Liz can 't help herself in a time phase which is not her own . Well , neither can I . We need outside help . Your help . All right . I 'll try . What do you want me to do ? Hurry , Simon . Please . In a few hours , this whole jungle will be a furnace . It 's no good. I can 't see anything . Oh , look , Beth , try as hard as you can . There 's nothing out there . Only jungle . I want to see , but I can 't . Oh , Beth , please hurry . No , Simon , there 's nothing . I want to help you , I just can 't . - Oh , Simon , what are we going to do ? - No , wait ! - Beth . - There is something . There 's someone . A woman . But I can 't see her very clearly . - Who is it , Beth ? - A force is trying to pull me forward . No. lt 's you she wants , Liz . - Mummy . - Yes . You 've got to go home , Liz . She needs you . Simon , you 've got to take Liz home . We 're depending on you . - All of us . - ( Traynor ) Simon ! - Come on . We must find it now . - You won 't find your destiny there , boy . This is where you belong and this is where you 'll stay ! The time barrier 's here . We 're going home . - Go on ! - l don 't want to leave you . Go on , Liz . They can 't harm me . I 'm only what your future could be . It 's up to you and Simon to see none of this happens . Come on , Liz . Hurry . ( Beth laughs ) They were changing everything . Diverting rivers , melting polar ice caps . Turning England into a tropical jungle ? I know it sounds fantastic , but I promise you it is true . Within a few days , or hours , the whole surface of the earth could be scorched . By now it 's probably all over . What I don 't understand is you 've only been missing from here a few days and yet you 've experienced about six weeks . I suppose it 's rather like having a dream . It seems to take ages , but in measured time it 's a few minutes . - She 's sleeping . - Thank the Lord for that . Don 't ever take Liz through the barrier again . No , sir. I mean , yes , sir . You mustn 't blame Simon . Liz wanted to do it just as much as he did . She told me . Simon , I know you 've had a bad time , but there 's one thing I have to know . Commander Traynor told us he gave you instructions not to go back. ls that true ? It 's true and no wonder after what we found out . You saw Commander Traynor in the future ? We saw him . The sort of man he could become if we let him . A mean , ambitious man , responsible for the destruction of the whole world . A technological world where people didn 't matter . Where everyone was taught not to think for himself . Traynor wanted to burn up the old world so he could start a new one . That 's terrifying . Absolutely terrifying . It 's worse than that. lf you could 've seen that jungle being burnt to pieces , then you 'd know we 've got to stop it . We can 't let it happen . We have a duty ... You let the future take care of itself . - Tomorrow you 're going home . - Home ? No more trips through the time barrier , past or future . - ( Screaming ) - Liz . Liz . Darling , what is it ? In the mirror. I saw them . Hundreds of pairs of eyes moving about in the jungle ! - lt 's all right . - What is it ? - lt 's nothing . Just a nightmare . - The sooner you get home , the better . No , Mummy , it wasn 't a nightmare . They were coming towards me . You 've got to believe me , Mummy . You 've just got to . Liz , it was a nightmare , darling . That 's all . ( Doorbell ) I 'll get it . Don 't let him send Simon home , Mummy . Please . I know Daddy doesn 't like Simon and me going off together , but I like Simon . We 've got a sort of understanding . After all , I 'm not a baby any more , am I , Mummy ? You understand that , don 't you ? You mustn 't blame Daddy , darling . He loves you very much . He doesn 't want any harm to come to you . He doesn 't want you to grow up before you have to . Don 't worry . You 'll see Simon again. I promise . A nightmare . Well , it 's hardly surprising . When you step out of one time phase into another , there 's bound to be a lasting effect . Still , at least you have them home , safe and sound . And that 's where l intend to keep them . Remember that . - Commander Traynor . - My dear Mrs Skinner . All 's well that ends well , eh ? So , where are these two young rascals ? I 'm sure they 've got some fascinating things to tell us about the future . I 'm not going in there . It 's Traynor 's voice . Don 't be silly. lt 's not the same Traynor as in the jungle . That was a projection . - This one 's harmless . Come on . - lt was him I saw in the mirror . Staring at me from behind bushes in the jungle . It was the Traynor of the future you saw . A future that won 't exist if we prevent it . Now , come on . - Liz , darling . - Ah , there you are . Welcome home . ( Distant bleeping ) Liz dear , I wonder if you 'd like ... Liz ? 'Darling Mummy , I 'm sorry , but I had to go . 'lt 's Beth. I saw her in the mirror and I know she needs me . 'Please don 't let Daddy get too upset . 'l 'll be back soon . Love , Liz . ' Frank . Frank , look at this . What are we going to do ? Well , I 'm going to phone Simon . Simon ? But ... - He 's probably gone with her . - Let 's at least find out . Hello , Simon , it 's Mr Skinner here . It 's about Liz . Could you come back here right away , please ? Yes . Yes , I know I did , but we need your help now . Mrs Skinner ! Mrs Skinner , are you all right ? Simon ... Simon , Liz hasn 't gone through the time barrier . She hasn 't ? Mr Skinner told me on the phone ... I know what he told you , but I saw her . I saw her standing in the old Ministry field by the time barrier . But she didn 't go through . Something stopped her . ( Door opens ) Liz ? Liz ? Can you hear me ? You 've been very foolish , Liz . Very foolish indeed . Now you must learn not to interfere . Keep out of the future , Liz . Do you understand ? Keep out of the future .

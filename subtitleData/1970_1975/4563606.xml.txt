 I witnessed unusual events and many heroic acts . They 're seemed as they never happened today . As it wasn 't even true . and few old photographs . That happened also to one big catastrophe in cosmos . Whole world was terrified . Such a big event and only pile of pale postcards and few disappointed illusions left ... On the Comet It was a beautiful age . The age of our youth . Europe indulged itself in - except of another worries - colonies . Thanks to that we came to this little known country . We rode through all of it with a gun in the hand . We felt very well here . We helped as much as we could and spread civilization . brave and this always pays off . Everyone here liked us . And our popularity rose day by day . It was a golden age . Iron-plate dishes is a treasure of house . Even you can 't break it . I 'll be right there . choose as you wish . Look . madam .

I would be also better with beautiful girl on my side . I would like such one . Maybe she would like me too . She would surely admired me . miss . measured ... Why do you think battles are led ? For land . When I move one single line I 'll do for homeland more than whole riding company . miss . Oh . Your appreciation is a great honour to me . lieutenant Servadac . come to life ! Watch yourself ! miss . I can 't do my country out of one single meter of colonial area . sir ! Sir lieutenant ! this is the end . without medal . It was irresponsible that they didn 't teach us to swim in the military school . I 'm dying for my country . Can I ask you where did you swim from ? Me ? From Valencia . The whole way to africa ? We are in Africa ? You really don 't know you 're in Africa ? I was kidnapped and closed on ship . I didn 't know where are we sailing . And what did they want to do with me . I had decided I would run away . The ship harboured this morning and I heard the voice of my kidnapper . He is also from Valencia . But he is a bad man . when they defended me .

Let 's come away before something happens to us . This is more precious for you than thousand more rifles . I 'm coming as a consul . Ethiquette demands a gift . Next to them there must be an honor party and this is all they have . Look . Simple but reliable . It only can 't be reversed . When candle burns out to here it fires on linstock ... Do you understand ? Everyone will be wiped away . attack the city with your riders . king . Evil star . Sky is ready for something . Back to paddles . rascals ! Don 't mind the sky and pull on .

The fort will be taken by them and after that we 'll come . We won 't get angry anyone and push through our interests . captain the whole this beautiful country will fall to the spanish crown under rule of his majesty . This is my holy mission . sir . sir . sir . Consul . Shall we fire for greeting ? lieutenant Servadac fell from the rock during filling his duties . after that he was falling with head down .

 How long till lunar sunrise ? - Four minutes . - Are the Interceptors ready ? Yes , sir , we 've been on red alert since 0600 hours . - If we lose contact , play it by ear . - Yes , sir . Three minutes , Lieutenant . It 's the feeling of helplessness I can 't take . Sunspot activity is the perfect cover for UFOs . - Do you think they 'll try anything ? - You can lay odds on it . - Give me the surface camera . - Yes , Lieutenant . Fifty seconds . Interference ratio 20 : 7 , increasing . Interference critical , Commander . It looks like a communication blackout . Sound and vision breaking up . We 'll try a test signal every 60 seconds . Good luck . Thank you , sir . Give me the surface . ( Operative ) Minus ten ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five ... four ... three ... two ... one ... zero . ( Beeps ) Radar trace bearing 184 . - Range 20 miles . - ( Lieutenant ) Camera three . Launch the Interceptors . Interceptors immediate launch . Immediate launch . Fifteen miles . ( Eerie whistling ) Nine miles . It 's altering course . Convey my congratulations to the Interceptor pilots . - ' They didn 't get near it . ' - What ? ! 'It disintegrated . No apparent reason . ' Thank you , Lieutenant . Contact Paul Foster and check on the next available lunar flight . - You 're going to Moonbase ? - Yes . To find out why a UFO gets so close to Moonbase then destroys itself . Nothing . - Mobile 2 to Control . - ' Yes , Commander ? ' We can find no UFO wreckage . 'How are Conroy and Dale making out ? ' They 've found a possible crash location . - They 're out on the surface now . - Roger , Control . Out . What are you hoping to find ? If it did disintegrate in flight , the debris would have produced craters over a wide area . And the moon has been pockmarked by millions of meteorites . I know that . But that UFO got within four miles of Moonbase , Paul . Perfect position to attack , then it explodes . Why ? That 's a good question . Let 's hope Mobile 1 finds the answer . - Well , what do you think ? - I don 't know . It 's hard to be sure . Straker 's gonna want to know . You 're in charge of this buggy , old son . Thank you . Maybe the instrument recordings will tell us more . - Let 's get back to base . - Right . - Control to Two . - ' Go ahead , Control . ' - Mobile 1 is about to dock . - We 're on our way back , too . Out . Home , James , and don 't spare the horses . What have you got there ? Just a piece of moon rock . I picked it up on the surface . Remember Harrison ? I thought he 'd go crazy when he found one of these . He thought he had a genuine Koh-i-noor diamond . Yeah , I remember . I 'll never forget his face when he found out it was worthless . Yeah . It 'll make a nice paperweight . Let 's see . Francoise ? Denise ? Sylvia . Sylvia , baby . ( Chuckles ) I 'll go and see if they 've figured out those ... recordings ... Hi , baby . ( Speaking Spanish ) What 's going on here ? Hey ! Hey , you go , eh ? Hey , come on , come on ... This is Control . Internal emergency . Internal emergency . - What 's going on ? - What have you done with Dale ? Andy ... Andy ... ( Gunshot ) Conroy . ( Bullet ricochets ) ( Rattle of spurs ) Ah ! Ah-ha ! - How are you , Nina ? Sit down . - Could have been worse . Nothing broken . - Do you feel like talking about it ? - Sure . Conroy came into the Control . He just stood there staring . He looked bewildered and frightened , as if he didn 't know where he was . Well , what happened then ? I asked what 's wrong , something like that . - Then ? - Well , he struck out . The girls tried to grab him . Everything happened so fast . He was very strong . Out of his mind . I 'm sure he didn 't know . - Didn 't know what ? - Who he was hitting . He just didn 't know who we were . - Still at it , sir . ? - Yes , and it makes no more sense now than it did four hours ago . Everyone who came into contact with Conroy reports the same thing . Look . " Berserk . " " Out of his senses . " " Didn 't seem to recognise me . " " Fired at me indiscriminately for no reason . " Conroy 's medical report of three weeks ago . - And ? - Full clearance . What about his stress factor ? 98 % . The near-perfect astronaut . He 's been in tight situations , never been anywhere near cracking up . Until now . We leave for Earth at 1400 . Someone else will want answers . - General Henderson . - How long has he been waiting ? - Long enough to work up a lather . - Just what I need at 8 : 30am . I could phone down with some excuse to get you off the hook . - Can you think of a good one ? - Fire in the studio ? It takes at least an earthquake to get the General off my back . Nuclear attack ? That might do it , if it was a big one . - Good morning , Colonel . - Good morning . Where is he ? Thank you . Er ... I need moral support . - Morning , Beaver . - Morning , Colonel . - General Henderson ! - Straker , I ought to kick your ... You know Colonel Lake ? Yes , of course you do . Now where 's that report ? - I don 't have it yet . - The committee meets in three days . I need your report and all the figures . - I 've been busy . - Look , it takes money to run SHADO , a lot of money , and we 're asking for even more this time . That 's your bag . You get the money , I run the store . Straker , my job is on the line . Not that that 's important . But if I go , you won 't win any popularity polls up here . - That sounds like a threat , General . - Not from me . We could both walk out tomorrow , and don 't think I haven 't considered it . But you 've got a monkey on your back . Dedication . Think about it . You want me to reprogram the computer for the finance figures ? - He is right , you know . - Yes . He 's " right " right . Sometimes being " wrong " right is harder . No , let the computer run . I have to know what happened to Conroy . ( PA ) ' Captain Saunders report to Control . ' Hi , Beaver . Oh , Beaver , did those spares for the G6 arrive yet ? - ' Fraid not . - They were due yesterday . Only one shipment arrived yesterday - stationery . Then get it moving , eh , Beaver ? It 's a joke - " stationary " ... Beaver ? How 's it going , Paul ? It looks like Dale and Conroy did find the UFO crash site but we 're waiting for the computer to confirm . What 's wrong ? Beaver ? Do you hear me ? What 's wrong ? ( Alarm ringing ) - Beaver ! - Stay where you are . Listen to me . Put down the gun . ( Gunshot ) Who did this ? Beaver James . He 's out of his mind . He pressed the alarm . Control ? - ' This is Control . Go ahead . ' - This is Captain James . Captain James . Listen . Listen carefully . 'Stay where you are . - ' Do you understand ? ' - Why don 't they answer ? - Can you hear me , Captain ? - What the hell are they doing ? Right . We 're here . He killed the guard here . Commander , he just called Control . - Where from ? - Corridor 12 . Let 's go . 'Captain James , can you hear me ? Captain James ? ' This is Straker . He 's heading for the Control Room . Station guards at the end of Corridors 14 and 6 . Seal all exits . You two , take that corridor . - Lieutenant . - Yes , sir . - Have we sealed off the complex ? - Yes , sir , but he 's killed a guard near the medical centre . My God ... - He must have doubled back . - He 's still heading this way . Tell everyone not to shoot unless necessary . I want him alive . Control to personnel . Do not open fire . Do not open fire . Control , he 's right outside . He 's in the corridor right outside Control . Paul ... Captain James ! Give me the gun . Captain , I gave you an order ! - He 's cornered . Let 's rush him . - No . Let 's sit it out . ( Lift clatters and whirrs ) All right , you aliens . I 've got one of you . He 's got Colonel Lake . I 'm coming into Control . Don 't try and stop me . Hold it ! That 's it . Nice and easy . Get Straker . Come on ! Someone tell Straker ! Oh , my God ! - Beaver ... - It 's no use , Paul . I don 't think he can hear us . Virginia , when I give the word , dive . All right , Paul . We have no choice . He 's already killed twice . Now ! What a mess . If only I 'd thought ... waited ... Maybe ... I don 't know . - How were you to know ? - That doesn 't make it easier . Half a million miles in Navy jets before he was 25 . Ten years as a top astronaut . He brought a space capsule down with a shattered hip . Saved the crew . Best command pilot SHADO ever had . Why does a man like that suddenly lose all sense of reality and start seeing aliens ? - Same pattern as Conroy . - Do we have an answer there ? The autopsy found nothing but they had located the UFO crash area . That 's no help to us . Beaver hadn 't been near a UFO in almost two years . It 's too much of a coincidence . There must be a connection , a link . I need some air . Howard Byrne is waiting to see you . Howard Byrne ? The star of that TV series they 're filming . Oh , yes . Well , he 's picked a bad time . I 'm sorry but he insisted . That 's all right , Miss Ealand . Well , I finally get to see you . You 're hard to pin down , Ed Straker . Well , I 've been tied up recently , Howard . Yes , haven 't we all ? - Well , what 's your problem ? - You 're the one with the problem . - Am I ? - The series . You have seen it , of course ? Well , yes , but not as often as I would have liked . Unless something 's done , it 's heading for trouble . Fortunately , though , I have a solution . I want script approval . ( Laughs ) Now , Howard , you know we can 't do that . Mr Straker , the series is going to pot . The scripts are old and hackneyed . The production is lifeless and trite . I don 't think it 's working for you . I know it 's not working for me . - OK . Let 's talk about it . - I didn 't come to bargain . I want script approval . It 's not in your contract . Ah , well , of course , you could hold me to my contract , but , you know , I 'm getting these terrible bad headaches recently . Headaches ? I wonder what could be causing that . Could be eyestrain ... or reading a lot of bad scripts . I mean the kind of headaches to keep me off the floor . Understand ? - Yes , I understand blackmail . - Blackmail ? I never mentioned blackmail . I 'm talking about migraine headaches . Why don 't you leave it with me ? I 'm sure I understand . I 'm not sure you do . If you think I 'm bluffing , try me . All right , I 'm calling . No script approval , Howard . You know , these headaches , they could be caused by a swelling , between the ears . Shouldn 't you be looking at your rushes ? Have a look at rushes tomorrow , Mr Straker . Control to Sky Four . Continue on present course . - What 's happening , Paul ? - Sky One 's closing . ( Pilot ) ' Control , I 'm in search area . ' 'UFO sighting - negative . 'Returning to base . ETA 1400 hours . ' Thank you , Sky One . Conroy 's personal effects . Have they been checked ? One of the last things Beaver James did . Oh , and here 's a directive for you to sign . Replacement Interceptor for Moonbase . I wonder how much that 'll cost . Talking of money , Henderson 's on his way . Yes , I 'm sure he is . Oh , what 's this ? Notes for a story . Apparently , Conroy wrote Westerns to pass the time on Moonbase . Cowboys ? Beaver James thought he saw aliens . The way Conroy fought ... Do you think maybe he thought he saw ... ? ( Beeping ) - Straker . - ( Woman ) ' General Henderson , sir . ' - Send him in . - I 'll leave this one to you . Thank you . General . - Commander . - General . Close the door . I had a report on astronaut Conroy . It didn 't make sense , but these things happen . But now I get one on Captain James which makes even less . If you 're looking for an explanation , I don 't know . The committee will want answers . You 're sending me in with nothing . What do you expect me to do ? Give 'em a few bars of Lover Come Back ? - If we 'd taken James alive ... - What do you mean ? - I killed him . - You what ? ! With this gun , the one he had on Colonel Lake . - It was empty . - Don 't give me that crud . If you can 't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen . - You 're making this personal . - Any way you want . All right , General Almighty Henderson . Every person in SHADO is my responsibility . - My gums bleed for you ! - They 're under tremendous stress ! Stop it ! You 're making me cry . My God . I 'm really seeing you for the first time . You don 't care , do you ? You really don 't care ! We 're all under stress . Father Straker and his bleating flock ! Don 't push me , Henderson . Somebody ought to take you ... What , you ? You haven 't got the guts . Let 's get back to realities . You 're just gutless sheep , the lot of you . ( Bleats ) ( Man ) Cut ! And print that . That was very , very nice . - How was it for you ? - OK , I guess . Felt all right . It 's just when Howard says , " You 're getting personal , " and I say ... - Don 't go away , Howard . - " Any way you want . " I thought that could be stronger , you know ? ( Director ) OK , I tell you what , we 'll play you in here and cheat in the eye line later . ( Voices echo and distort ) Right , we 'll pick it up from the same place . When you 're ready . Rehearsal bell . Quiet please . Right , keep the eye line straight ahead , as we 're cheating it . - All right , Sylvia ? - OK . ( Director ) And action , Grant . - ( Sylvia ) You 're getting personal ... - Nice scene . See you later . Paul ! ( Henderson ) My gums bleed for you . If you can 't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen . ( Sylvia ) They 're under tremendous stress . We won 't need you till after lunch , Mr Byrne , if you want to leave . ( Sylvia ) You really don 't care ! ( Henderson ) We 're all under stress ! Father Straker and his bleating flock . ( Sylvia ) Don 't push me . Someone ought to ... You haven 't got the guts . Let 's get back to realities . You 're just a bunch of gutless sheep , the lot of you ! ( Bleats ) ( Engine revs ) ( Footsteps running ) - I 'm sorry , Mr Byrne . - Who are you ? - What ? - Who are you ? Joe . I 'm your stand-in , Mr Byrne . ( Howard 's voice ) ' I 'm getting these terrible headaches recently ... ' ( Straker ) ' You know these headaches might be caused by a swelling ... ' ( Buzz ) Hello . Yes , Mr Byrne ? I 'm afraid Mr Straker is engaged . - I want to see him . - I 'll call you back . I 'm afraid that 's impossible . Shouldn 't you be in Theatre 7 ? They 're showing your rushes . ( Radio ) ' We 're ready to run , Mr Byrne . ' ( Barry ) ' ... bewildered and frightened . ' ( Straker ) ' Why would he lose all sense of reality ? 'Cowboys ? Beaver James thought he saw aliens . ' ( Man ) ' We 'll have to start , sir . Second unit rushes are due at 12 . ' ( Man ) ' 139 , Take 2 . ' ( Engines and siren ) ( Henderson ) ' Minister , this is Colonel Straker . ' ( Straker ) ' How do you do ? ' ( Minister ) ' A shattering business . 'We 'll be at Chequers in 30 minutes . ' ( Siren walls ) We 've been in communication with Paris , Moscow and Bonn . The British Government 's approval will be a formality . The evidence is absolutely conclusive . - If I might ... - Surely . Colonel . ( Minister ) It may speed things up . ( Minister ) ' My God ! ' ( UFO whirring ) ( Engines drown dialogue ) ( Minister ) ' Keep pace with the escort . ' ( Sirens and explosions ) ( Man ) ' Cut . ' Do you mind if I join you ? Paul . Mike 's the name , remember ? I 've only been your co-star for two years ! ( Laughter on film ) - Stop . - Don 't you like it ? I think it 'll make a great episode . - Are you all right ? - That 's me up there . That 's my life . That was my son . Oh , the juvenile ? Nice little actor . As I was saying , I think it 'll make a great episode . ( Man ) 147 , Take 4 . How 'd you make out with that model boat ? - I finished it . Do you want to see ? - Hmm ? - The boat , Dad . - Oh , sure . You bet I do . Wait for me , Dad . Mary . 'Hello , Mary . ' Hello , Ed . You 're late . We were having such a great time , I thought an extra half hour ... Could you make it a week later next month ? Say , the 18th ? 'The 18th ? Yes , that 'll be fine . ' ( Man ) Mary ? - Johnny wanted to show me something . - I ... think you 'd better go . I 'll explain to Johnny . Right . Goodbye , Ed . My God , what 's happening ? 'Dad ! Dad ! No , John ... John ! - ' Dad ! ' - No , look out ! John ! John ! ( Horn sounds ) ( Brakes screech ) ( Man ) ' Cut . Print . 149 , Take 2 . ' ( Director ) ' And action . ' ( Sobbing ) Mary . 'Mary . ' 'I never want to see you again . ' Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! All right . Cut it . Well , I 've heard of method acting but you take the coconut . - What 's got into you ? - You take my memories , my life , and stick it up on that screen . What 's this , the star bit ? It 's make-believe . - We 're all in the same business . - Listen , Paul ... - Mike ... - Whatever . It doesn 't matter . You 're part of this nightmare . Everything I 'm seeing , I know it 's only in my own mind . - What ? - They 're trying to make me crack , make me believe in the unreality . Conroy , Beaver - they must have gone through the same thing . - Help me ! - What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about you in my nightmare . I have to get back . I need your help . I need Paul Foster 's help ! You 're crazy . ( Echoes ) ' You 're crazy ... 'You 're crazy ... You 're crazy ... ' ( Straker 's voice ) ' I killed him . 'Don 't push me , Henderson . 'My God , what 's happening ? ' ( Henderson ) ' You 're just a bunch of gutless sheep , the lot of you . ' ( Foster ) ' You 're crazy . ' ( Henderson bleats ) ( Foster ) ' You 're crazy . ' ( Henderson bleats ) ( Foster ) ' You 're crazy ... You 're crazy ... You 're crazy ... 'You 're crazy ... You 're crazy ... 'Crazy ... Crazy ... ' Red light 's up , Mr Byrne . ( Director ) So , we 'll have a nice strong reaction where he throws the gun away , OK ? And , what about a bit of fingers in the corners of the eyes , Paul , when you say , " You make me cry . " - ( Henderson ) A bit melodramatic . - OK , drop it . ( Director ) Turn over . Mark it . ( 2nd man ) 147 , Take One . ( Director ) And Action . ( Sylvia ) You 're getting personal . ( Crashing and banging ) All right , cut it . Will you please keep this stage quiet , Frank ? I want absolute quiet , Mr Byrne . The red light 's up . ( Director ) All right , let 's take it from the top . Turn over . Mark it . ( Man ) 147 , Take Two . Hi , Howard . How 's everything ? ( Henderson ) Any way you want . ( Sylvia ) Every person in SHADO is my responsibility . ( Henderson ) My gums bleed for you . ( Sylvia ) They 're under tremendous stress . ( Henderson ) Stop it ! You 're making me cry ! What the devil 's going on here ? ! Frank ! What can I do about it ? The guy 's crazy . OK , get the production manager . Get the production manager on the set . How well are we keeping up with the schedule ? We won 't be off the set today at this rate . Howard . If you 're looking for explanations ... I don 't know ! - Howard , look , come and sit down . - We need time . - If we 'd taken James alive ... - Howard , look ... - I killed him . - Howard ... This gun , the one he had on Colonel Lake ... It was empty . Don 't give me that crud . If you can 't stand the heat , get out the kitchen . You 're making this personal ? - Any way you want . - OK , General Almighty Henderson . Every person in SHADO is my responsibility . - My gums bleed for you ! - They 're under tremendous stress ! Stop it ! You 're making me cry . My God . I 'm really seeing you for the first time . You really don 't care . We 're all under stress . Father Straker and his bleating flock ! Don 't push me , Henderson . Somebody ought to ... You haven 't got the guts ! Let 's get back to realities . You 're just gutless sheep , the lot of you ! ( Bleats ) Hold it . Paul ... He suddenly seemed to regain control . I thought he was going to finish me . How do you feel ? Tired . Did I cause all this ? Well , nothing too serious . The link . The link was a rock . Conroy must have found it near that UFO wreckage . It had some kind of , er ... hallucinatory power . It bent the mind of whoever touched it . - Obviously alien . - Yes . Planted in some way by that UFO which crashed near Moonbase . ( Foster ) A booby trap . Yes . Aimed at the mind .

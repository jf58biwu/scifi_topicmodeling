 Keep all emergency channels open . Yes , Governor . All emergency channels will remain open . If anything should miscarry , I 'll signal you as arranged . Yes , sir . Hurry , man . We need it ! The school bus will be operational , Governor . The rest of the convoy will join us atjunction C. Get moving . [ Chattering ] Riki ! Well ... they have guns . We have no guns . We shall take the guns , and we shall beat them . [ All Growling ] We are the elite . We are the super-race . We have the right to lead . Without us , there would be no army . [ All Growling ] We need power , guns ! [ Growling ] We need power ! Guns ! Guns . Guns are power ! We shall get them , and we 'll beat them with guns . We will smash the humans . [ Growling ] All humans ! And then we will smash Caesar ! [ Twig Snaps ] Hmm ? Look ! It 's Caesar 's son . And he overheard every word we said . Cornelius , come down . Come down , or else . [ Grunt ] Father ! Cornelius ? Mother ! Aah ! Grrr ! [ Twig Snaps ] [ Grunt ] Cornelius ! I only heard about it this morning . His squirrel is missing . He must have been looking for it . How is Cornelius ? Hurt . He 's badly hurt . oh ! oh ! Speak the truth . Even ifwe had a hospital ... I 'm not going to tell Caesar , notyet . He still believes he can change the future . Humans , going towards our city . I 'll get him . Aah ! Get ready to fire . Fire ! The doctor is doing her best . I don 't believe Cornelius can live . Caesar does . He refuses to leave his side . MacDonald , how can a benevolent God allow a branch of his own tree to crack and injure an innocent child ? It didn 't crack , Virgil . It was cut . order at council ! order ! order ! The humans are attacking . They 've killed one gorilla and wounded another . Tell them . We were scouting desert approaches to the city and saw their army . They fired . My companion was killed . I have come to warn you . And how long before they get here ? Soon . So now , we must prepare . Take the humans out . Lock them all in the corral . Aldo ! Aldo , you can 't do this ! You 're acting against Caesar 's orders . Caesar is not here . Hey ! What the- - Hey ! Jake . Strongman , take him to the corral . Take all humans to the corral . Take all humans to the corral . All humans , take them to the corral . Where are you going ? Martial law has been declared . Everybody is to stay in their homes . By whose orders ? Go home ! We want guns ! Guns are power . Now we go and get guns ! Mandemus . Who 's there ? Aldo . General Aldo . What do you want ? Guns ! Guns ! What will you do with them ? We shall do with them what we will . " Do what you will " is the devil 's law . And who are you , Mandemus , God ? I am the keeper of Caesar 's conscience . And I am the keeper of Caesar 's army ! Under allegiance to Caesar ! Where is he ? Mandemus , as I speak , our city is being attacked by humans from without and within . Who cares where Caesar is ? I care ! There is a law that weapons may only be issued from this armory under direct orders from Caesar and not under threats from one of his thicker-headed subordinates for whom war means only personal glory . Now , find me Caesar . I will listen to him . First , listen to this . Take every gun in the place , everything . Get the ammo boxes . Get the handguns , grenades . Stop ! Stop ! Caesar forbids you ! Ah ! Well , there it is : Ape City . When we leave , I don 't want to see one tree left standing , 2 pieces ofwood nailed together , or anything left alive . I want it to look like that city we came from . What the devil is all that rubbish down there ? It looks like some sort of barricade , sir . Nothing that a couple of flame bombs won 't take care of . Caesar , forgive me , but I couldn 't get here before now . Aldo has seized power . He 's broken into the armory and imprisoned all humans in the corral . MacDonald ? He was dragged from the council meeting by Aldo 's gorillas . I can 't leave Cornelius . He needs me . Every ape and human in Ape City needs you now . I think you should go to Cornelius . Father ? They ... hurt me . They want ... to hurt you . Who hurt you ? The humans ? No . Then who ? Sh ... Shall ... Shall I be ... malformed ? No . one day you are going to be as tall as a king . [ Sob ] All right , Captain , lay the smoke screen . When I give the signal , start the bombardment . Men and equipment out of the bus . Deployyour weapons , quickly ! All is in order , sir . All right . Let 's go . He said they hurt him . Who ? Who would hurt him ? I think you 'll have your answer , and soon . What do you know ? That 's what I know . You did this . For security . Did you also raid the armory for the same reason ? For security ! Caesar , Caesar ! I orderyou to stop this ! I orderyou to stop it now and release those people ! See ? Aldo was right . War has come . Let 's go . Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Go to the barricade ! To the barricade ! [ Gunfire ] Come on ! Go to the barricade ! They 're laying a smoke screen . Here they come . Where 's Aldo ? Probably the other side of the valley by now . Hurry ! Fall back , fall back ! Fall back . Go back to the village . Get away from the fire ! Fall back ! Hurry ! Leave the barricade ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Get back to the village . Nothing left alive ! You can 't stay here any longer . You must save yourself . Ah ! Caesar . Your people weakened our city by rebelling against your human masters . But we who survive will create a new race , and you and yours will be brought low , and you shall learn again what it is to have a master . Ha ! You 're learning already ... clever ape . oh , no . Ape . Clever ape . But then , you always were clever . I was told how you chose your own name . But every Caesar must have his Brutus . Did you know that , ape ? Do you understand that , ape ? And now Ape City is about to lose its king . No , Kolp ! No ! Now fight like apes ! Stop ! Stop . No killing . Take them captive . Get moving ! No , no ! Don 't kill them . Take them prisoner . No . No , Virgil . All right , Virgil . Let 's go . No prisoners . No prisoners ! [ Gunfire ] Dismount . Hail Caesar ! Hail Caesar ! Hail Caesar ! Hail Caesar ! Hail Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar ! Caesar ! We 've done it ! Hold ! Let the humans go , Virgil , all of them . No ! They stay . Aldo says what we do now . They have done nothing . They shall go free . You like humans ? You want them out of the corral ? All right . Kill them ! Aah ! Kill them . Kill them all . Stop . Stop . No more killing , Aldo . Put down your weapons . Take them back to the armory . No ! We shall keep the guns ! Move , Caesar , or we shall kill you . [ Grunting ] Ape has never killed ape , let alone an ape child . [ Grunting ] Aldo has killed an ape child . The branch did not break . It was cut ... with a sword . [ Grunting ] [ All Growling ] Aldo . You ... you killed . Ah ! Ah ! Aldo killed . [ All Growling ] Aldo has broken our most sacred law . [ All Growling ] our child . He killed our child . What 's the matter with them ? I guess you might say they justjoined the human race . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . Ape has killed ape . You murdered my son . You murdered my son . You murdered my son ! [ Hiss ] [ Hiss ] Aah ! Should one murder be avenged by another ? only the future can tell . So let us start building it . Ifwe appear to be lacking in gratitude , Caesar , what have we to be grateful for ? If you mean to set us free , then free us completely . What do you mean ? We are not your children , Caesar . We have a destiny , too- - as equals , respecting each other , living together , with love . Love ? The human way is violence and death . Aldo wasn 't human , was he , Caesar ? Virgil ... you are a good and wise ape . And you , Caesar , are a good and wise king . We 'll rebuild what 's ruined and begin again . Tell me something , MacDonald . Can we make the future what we wish ? I 've heard that it 's possible , Caesar . There . Every weapon is back in its proper place . Caesar , I want to ask a favor . This armory 's been my home for 27 years . You may live in it for the rest of your days . But I don 't want to live in it . No , no . Now that the danger is over , I want to see it destroyed . Blown up . The greatest danger of all is that danger never ends . And so , Mandemus , we must be patient ... and wait . We still wait , my children . But as I look at apes and humans living in friendship , harmony , and at peace now some 600 years after Caesar 's death , at least we wait with hope for the future . Lawgiver , who knows about the future ? Perhaps only the dead .

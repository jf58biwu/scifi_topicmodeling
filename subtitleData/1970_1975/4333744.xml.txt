 THE PLANET OF THE APES 1x04 " THE GOOD SEEDS " Subtitles by subXpacio . They were here . The tracks are fresh . I don 't see them . If you could , it 'd be too late . - Come on . - Hey , uh - Galen can 't keep up . His tail 's dragging , Chimps do not have tails . And I 'm all right . Sure you are , you 're Iron Man . Excuse me - Iron Ape . - And Michigan 's great running back ? - That was a while ago . Like about 2,000 years , give or take a century . Let 's move out . There 's no telling how close Urko 's men are . Let 's try to make that forest before dark . Coming . Mother . Sack time , huh ? Let 's check in here , I 'm ready . No way , baby . This is our chance to get clear . We know what direction we 're going in , they don 't , There 's nothing in any direction . What difference does it make ? You can tell direction by that ? I mean , without the stars ? Yeah , it 's called a compass . That needle always points north . And that cloud cover 's a big break . Urko 's men won 't know what direction they 're going in , so they 'll go in circles . - We can go straight on . - Compass ? - Is it witchcraft ? - Witchcraft ? No . It 's handicraft . I made it . Next handicraft class . make me a trail bike , twin jet . You got it , Come on , Through here . They 've been this way . Clouds . Blasted clouds ! Forbidden to travel without the stars . Nothing 's forbidden when you ride for Urko . Then how come the spirits have pulled our horses ' tails in a circle ? All right , All right ! We 'll camp here . Make a fire ! And stand watch to see if it chases the clouds . If not , we 're going on until we catch them ! Why didn 't I buy that nice little bar in Jersey City ? Come on . We 're following the , uh , uh ... handicraft . Come on ! - Galen. heads up ! - Take it easy . It 's rough in there . Galen ! Take it easy , Galen . Don 't move . Don 't move . Lie still , man . - Tourniquet , hurry . - I 'm-I 'm sorry . - Great . - Don 't worry about it . I always make tourniquets for my friends . Take it easy , Galen . We have to stop this bleeding first . It was dark . I fell . No kidding . Next time , wait for the lights to change . We gotta keep moving . We 're sitting ducks . - Hey , wait a minute . - What is it ? It 's a farm . It looks isolated . This could be it , Pete . Show me a couple of nice , smelly ol tractors , and it 's home sweet home . All right , saddle up . Let 's move on . I 'm beat , I don 't care if this farmer doesn 't have a daughter . Anybody in there ? Anybody inside ? You get away from here ! Now ! I 'm warning you . We have clubs and corn knives . We need help . Our friend 's been hurt . We don 't help humans . Oh , dear ! Terrible ! He needs help . Wait . Who are you ? My name is Galen . These are my friends . - His tired friends . - You 're their prisoner . They captured you . No . No , no . P - Please help us . Are you rich ? They 're your bonded humans , right ? No ! Put that thing away and help him , will you ! Now look , we 're no danger to you . Get him inside , I 'll see what I can do . Ask your questions later . Can 't you see he needs help ? Don 't direct me , wife ! I 'd already made up my mind . But not you two ! Anto and I will carry him . You two can wait in the barn . And don 't touch anything , or don 't steal anything ... or I 'll put the patrol on you . You just take care of him . Man . I could sleep standing up . Leave a wake-up call for February . What year ? - Ow ! Hey ! Take it easy , Sarge . - Get up ! - I didn 't even hear reveille . - Thanks for waking us up . Why did you sleep so close to the cow ? - If she doesn 't object , why should we ? - We 're not gonna hurt your cow . Humans are a curse to cows ! Everyone knows that . Live and learn . Five years I 've waited for a bull calf . My own ox to start my own farm . and nothing but female calves . Heifers ... for the landlord ! Put the stabber down , pal . This could be your lucky year . Wait a minute , I don 't understand . Ah , you understand . When a son becomes of age , he has to wait for a bull calf to be born ... before he can start his own farm . Five years I 've waited . And the signs were against me , Nothing but female calves , This year , I knew the signs were right . Until you came . You hear ? You 're a bad omen ! If you 've put a curse on her . I may kill you . - Now , wait a minute - - Remove the curse . Go away today . Hey , you two , Galen 's asking to see you , He 's awake , Wait , It 's bad enough having humans in the house , but wash first . There 's a smell about you . Well , nobody 's perfect . Oh . You know , you really are wonderful . I feel so much better . Have you done this before ? I once trained to be a nurse . - Until I met Polar . - Hah ! A city . No place to raise a family . - Or even visit . - Someday . Always the same answer . Anto needs his bull calf . Remus 's hardly out of rompers , and Jillia hasn 't even sought out a husband . Daddy ! You won 't be able to stand on this for some time , - How long ? - Oh , several days at least . I can 't have those humans around here ! It 's dangerous ! They 've been known to kill cows just for the meat , Virdon and Burke are not going to kill your cows . Where are they from , those humans ? You simply must let them stay . - They 'll work for their keep . - Work ? Of course they 'll work . That 's what they 're for . Well ? I 'll see . He means well . - You 'll see . - Thank you . Did you send for my friends ? How can you keep calling them friends ? I think we 're gonna have to stand inspection . You ready ? Oh , uh , I 've made up my mind . You can stay until your friend is well or able to walk . - No ! - You heard my decision , All right . But the cow is my say . They stay away from the cow . Uh , he 's right about that . The cow is his say until the calf is born , Anything you say . But you 'll work ... every day . just as though I could afford you . - You got a deal . - Just as though I owned you . I get one of 'em . One of them 's mine . We 'll see . The mounted patrol ! Are you sure you 're not escaped bonded slaves ? I give you my word . We are free humans . - You will work for me ? - Yes , yes . All right . Go in the back and hide . I 'll talk to him , Yes ? I 'm looking for escaped bonded slaves . Have you seen any ? - Humans ? - Of course humans . What else ? We know nothing of bonded humans . - We 're just poor tenant farmers , - Yes , we can 't help you , If you see any , report immediately . - Failure to do so carries a severe penalty . - I understand . Are you dumb ? Do you understand ? Yes , I understand . If you see a stray human , report at once . Ah , yes . Your name ? Polar . I wonder if there 's a reward . Didn 't look like one of Urko 's men . Don 't kid yourself . He 's some kind of a local patrol , but they 're all Urko 's men . Don 't tell me your troubles . We 've got enough of our own . Rocks ! There 's no end to them . The earth seems to keep breathing them up . How do you know ? I lifted half the rocks in Jackson County when I was a boy . You keep talking strange . There 's no such place . There was . It 's a bad field , but we need it - every foot . It 's gonna get worse every year , you keep plowing like that . - What ? - Come here , I 'll show you . Here , look . Every time you plow up and down a hill , the way you 're doing there . whenever it rains , it 's gonna wash off more of your topsoil ... and gullies are gonna start to form , and they 'll get deeper and deeper . And they steal your land because you have to work around them , Playing in mud ? But , if you plow around the hill instead , like this - You see ? Then when it rains , the furrows hold the water . It won 't run off with your rich topsoil . - And there are no gullies , See ? - Look , Anto , it 's true . It 's foolishness . Everyone knows that plowing down the hill ... gives the ox rest from plowing up it . Foolishness ! Where did you learn this ? My family owned a farm when I was young . We 'll plow around like he says . Then he 'll plow around , 'cause I 'll have no part in it . Don 't mind him . He 's worried about the bull calf . Nothing else on his mind . You lied , didn 't you ? No , no , you 'll see . Take the ox - About your family owning a farm , Only apes ever own farms . Then only the rich ones who have friends in the government . No ! No ! No ! Stop ! - I order you to stop . - What 's your problem , boss ? That 's the wrong kind of fence . You show me a bale of barbwire , I 'll build you a proper one . But right now , this is the best I can do . Poles , set up and down . Stuck in the ground , like - like these . Come on , Remus . You knock yourself out putting ' up a stick fence like this . Then the first time ol ' Bessie rubs against it , it falls in . Take a nice rail fence , like this . Locked tight , bull strong . Last you a lifetime , and it 's pleasing ' on the eye . Fences never last long . They 're not supposed to . That 's where you 're wrong . Lieutenant . I 'm not wrong . I 'm in charge . Uh , this kind of fence grows on you . And say you want to move it . Polar wants it over there , say . All you do is take it apart and put it back together . - Is that right ? - Would I lie to a nice ape like you ? Hmph . Hmm , I 've decided . - It 's a good job . - Thank you , boss . Back to work . Yeah . Who taught you to build a fence like that ? - Abraham Lincoln . - I 'd like to meet him . So would I , Massa , so would I. Five years you let them get away . We could not follow them at night , sir . The clouds . Virdon , Burke and that traitor Galen - I suppose they can see through the clouds to the stars . - How long ? - Four days ' hard ride , sir . This is all farm country . Tenant farms . - A few plantations , - Yes , sir . They could steal horses . It 's death for a peasant or human to ride a horse there , sir . Yes , I know that ! - Could you find your way back again ? - Yes . But it will be slow . The weather is covering the stars again . Then the gods will guide us , These humans are dangerous . They stir up trouble ! They think they 're as good as we are . Make an ox pitch hay into the barn ? Isn 't that enough to convince you he 's not right in the mind ? Wait . Watch . Okay , ready . Work is meant to be work , and hay is meant to be pitched ... by the forkful . Drive the ox ahead . Go ahead . Ho , there ! Ho ! Oh , that 's good ! That 's very , very good ! It 's not bad for a guy who doesn 't have all his marbles , right ? - Show me how to make the trick work ? - Sure , It 's easy , You saw . That 's better than forkin' a whole load full of hay . You see . She must 've already eaten some hay that fell in here ... from that evil device . She 's dying . I know it . They 're a curse . I told you ! Anto makes a strong argument . - How soon is she expected to calf ? - Three weeks , I think . I think your calendar 's a little off . More like two or three days . She 'll be off her feet for a while. that 's all . It 's a lie ! Throw them all out now , or she 'll die . Your cow is not going to die , Anto . We can 't leave here until Galen 's able to walk . By that time , your cow will be a mother , and we 'll be on our way . No , I 'm the eldest . The cow is in my charge . Have we shown you anything evil yet ? Tell me , Polar . If we have , then send us away . The farm seems to profit from them . You can stay . But if anything happens to the cow ... as Anto fears , your fate will be up to him . - What good 'll that do ? - Enough ! Then it 'll be too late . Maybe not . Where 's Anto ? I think he has some things to work out of his mind . Remus , I thought you were shelling corn for seed . - I am . - Burke should be doing it . Have a heart , We didn 't discuss coffee breaks , but it 's part of the deal , Remus will shell the corn . It 's the job of the youngest son to prepare the seed , Here . Always use the best ears for seed , not the smallest . Did you hear that ? The best ears are for feed and flower . The little ears are for seed . Oh , I see . Well , uh , then I guess it 's the bad spirits ... that have been making the stalks in the field ... smaller and smaller every year , Virdon used to be a farmer when he was young . Not much of a farmer . Wasting big corn on seed ? Tell me something , Remus . Do you expect to be big and strong like your father someday ? Of course . Well , that 's because Polar is good seed , If your father were small and weak . then you probably wouldn 't grow big enough to handle a calf . let alone an ox , See , every year , if you use the biggest , best ears for seed , then your crop will get bigger and bigger . It will , I promise you . I can remember sitting around a fire something like this ... with my own son , and telling him the same thing , Chris . I wonder how he is . I wonder what - Is something the matter ? Well ... they have feelings too . just like us . Now , you hush . Why are you so interested in a runaway , bonded human ? You couldn 't afford to buy one . I just wondered if there was a reward for helping you find one or two . Reward ? Why ? Do you know where some are ? I thought maybe you could tell me what they look like . All humans look alike . You know that . Maybe I 'd go hunting for them ... if it 'd pay enough to buy a new bull calf . You farmers are all the same . You wanna get paid for doing your duty ? There 's no reward ! Now , move on . unless you want to be arrested for loitering around horses . The returning of slaves should be worth something . - Who was that ? - Some backcountry farmer . Thinks we ought to be giving a bounty on humans this year . He looked familiar , I 've seen him before ... in the past few days . Yes , Polar 's farm . He was looking for bounty , you say ? Perhaps Polar 's farm needs to be ... watched more closely . She 'll die . Then what 'll I do ? Wait for another heifer to freshen ? Another three , four years ? virdon says she 'll be all right , He 's turned your mind with clever talk and tricks . This cow is dying from their curse . She started dying the day they walked in here carrying that . that human-lover Galen . I 'll have a talk with them . Galen can stand . I 've seen him . They are staying so the cow will die . I tell you ! Humans burn the flesh and eat it . You 've heard tell of that ! You say Galen can stand ? Hello . Not too much at one time . Mother says you 'll break open the wound . Oh , no , no . The pain has turned to itching now . That 's very good . Won 't Virdon and Burke be surprised when I just walk right in on them ? - Not quite yet . - Why ? Well , I mean - Well , I don 't quite understand you , anyway . - You must 've come from a good family . - Well - Now you 're running with humans ... who have filled your mind with mad ideas . They 're not mad ideas . And I can 't tell you any more . so you just stop asking , huh ? Why don 't you just let them go on ? Well , you see , um . I can 't . And that is just another way of you asking exactly the same question . Just like the female . I thought you might never notice . So you see ? What 'd I tell you ? It 's - It kind of goes - And then it 's one of these - Virdon , tell him what you 're - No . Wait . I remember . It 's - It 's our very own windy mill . Windmill . - That 's what I said . Isn 't it wonderful ? - What good is it ? This is the power unit to your irrigation system , Polar . I don 't understand . When Virdon finishes the wheel , it goes up there and the wind makes it turn . We pump water out of the ground and onto that dry field , where you need it . You see ? Making oxen lift hay that should be pitched . And now conjuring up the wind to make water pour where it shouldn 't . It 's unnatural ! No wonder the cow is dying ! Tell them ! Anto says he 's seen your friend Galen stand . If this is so , you must go , It 's true . He can stand . They can 't go now , not until they finish so I can see it work . It 's not for you to say . The youngest has no say . I do have a say . I have a say . Anto 's only worried about a bull calf , Wait till your time comes to worry . - Please ! - Stay ! Leave ! Stay ! Go ! My mistake was being a father . Do what you want ! No , I just live here . That Anto is not one of my favorite apes . Yeah , he could be trouble . That mounted patrol was looking for escaped laborers . but he didn 't look too fussy about who he picked up . See , the gods have been with us . We 've made excellent time . Yes , but the horses , they need rest . We ride ! I stood for several minutes today without this . What 's the big secret ? I thought we were friends . - I wanted to surprise you . - Well , lovable Anto ... is chomping at the bit to get us out of here . Apes do not chomp at bits . Oh , I 'm-I 'm sorry . He 's anxious . Better . I think we 'd better accommodate him , He could turn us in , We ought to help out that cow , Give her Epsom salts and get this thing moving , If that calf isn 't a bull , then we could be in bigger trouble . If that cow dies , Anto is entitled to kill you . I 'm glad he knows his rights . Just give me a couple more days , I 'm healing fast . See ? We could carry you again , Galen , But the minute we leave here . Urko 's gonna pick up our trail . - If we could get ahold of some horses - - Uh-uh . I take it this isn 't horse country ? No . Only landed apes and police are allowed to have horses . Farmers have to walk or ride oxen or cows , Nice arrangement . Keep ' em poor and busy . Then that 's it . We 're stuck . All right , we sit it out . See whether Galen here or that cow makes it first . I can hardly wait . Whoo ! Oooh ! I don 't mind being a peasant just so long as I have all the conveniences of the rich . Well , even the rich don 't have showers in this world . As long as you 're adding conveniences , maybe tomorrow you can put in hot water . How about a massage parlor , a sauna bath and a gym ? - Will that make you happy ? - Yeah , for openers . Whoo ! Oooh ! It 's her time . The tolling of the bell . She 's dying . She 's dying , Trouble , Doc ? - If I can remember what the vet used to do - - Try hard . I got a feelin ' we don 't want to lose this patient . - Dying . Dying . - Anto , look . Anto , look . Listen to me ! Your cow is having a premature birth . She 's suffering because the calf is turned . Do you understand me ? Do you ? You ! You 've done this ! Wait ! The cow is not dead . You can 't claim a life yet . The cow doesn 't need to die , I can help . The calf has gotta be turned around , Oh , no . You 've worked your last trick here . When she dies , you die . Anto , stop ! Come on in , you human lover , and see what you 've done ! Blame me , then . It 's my wound that brought us here . - We 'll all leave now ! - I 'm packed and ready , I 'll tell you that . Anto , there 's nothing they can do . No one will leave ... until this is all over , one way or another . Toll the bell , Remus , It 's probably too late , but toll the bell . Polar , talk sense to him ! Say the word , and I 'll commit a clipping penalty that 'll get us 15 yards . - What are you saying ? - I 'm talking about a five-legged race with Galen , No way , Our best bet is with the cow , Speak so I can understand . We 're inches from becoming shish kebab . Let the cow find another doctor . Anto , there 's nothing they can do ! You 're right . Because if they try anything . I will kill them . - All of them ! - Anto . I can help the cow live . I 've seen doctors do it a dozen times . No . Polar , do you want your cow to die ? At birthing time , the fate of the cow is in the hands of the oldest son . - I have no say ! - Who says you have no say ? Those are old words passed down for so long ... from our fathers 'fathers , we don 't even know if they 're right ! Be still ! Don 't say such things in front of the young ones ! No , I won 't be still . It 's Jillia and Remus that I 'm thinking of . Anto , listen . You have seen these humans ... show us how to stop the rain from washing the hills away , And you have seen them create cropland from dry fields . Please , Anto , You want that calf , And the bell asks that it be a bull . Let him help you . No , you won 't touch the cow . Give me a reading on the odds . You sure you know what you 're doing ? No . But I know that cow will die if she doesn 't get help . Remus , do you trust me ? Just play along . I like the odds better your way . Get ready to operate , Doc . Back away ! All right , Anto . I 've got a knife . Drop the fork or your brother 's never gonna live to see your baby bull born . - He 's not fooling ! Do what he says ! - You heard him . Drop the fork . Anto ! Anto , do as he says ! If you want it to be a bull , ring the bell . You won 't get away . 'Cause when this is over , if I don 't kill you , the police will , 'Cause I won 't lie to them again . Okay , sweetheart . I 'm gonna do my best for you . I want you to do your best for me , Nice work . Remus . We make a heck of a team . - Can I go watch ? - Well - You can watch . I get a little queasy in operating rooms . You can tell me all about it later . Not too much detail . Go ahead . You think he can do it ? Instruct a cow in the birthing of a calf ? Well. he 's made an eagle that can see directions , even on a cloudy night . Yes , I would think that he could direct a baby calf into the world . What 's the score ? It 's worse than I thought . How bad is that ? It 's about twice as bad . Just a quiet little bar in Jersey City . A little bell over the door . Mounted patrol from some outpost . - Sir . - I 'm Urko , headquarters . Sir . Your horses are lathered . For what reason ? Escaped bonded humans . Patrol thinks he spotted them at a farm near here . - Standing under a stream of water . - How far ? - We 're almost there . - We 're hunting two escaped humans ... and a defector , enemies of the state . - Sir . I doubt - - If there are doubts . I will have them . - ... after we have a look . - Yes , sir . Lead the way . Anto , come have a look ! You hit a jackpot ! Twin bulls , straight across ! Oh my ! When you said " twice as bad " - - You 're a genius , Alan . - Thank you . I 'll never knock a farm boy again . Twins ! Two bulls , Anto . That , uh . bell ringing really did the trick , Police ! All kinds of police ! Hide up there . Quick , outside . Anto , come on . - Polar ? - That 's Polar . Why do you come riding through here ? You make enough thunder to shake the turnips from the ground ! Shut up , female ! You 're hiding escaped bonded humans , Polar . No , that 's a lie . He was here before . - Silence ! - He was standing under that thing . One of them was standing under there in a kind of rain . What 's so funny , farmer ? You won 't laugh with Polar hanging on the end of a rope . It was me ! He saw me ! We 're a poor farm family . Would you deny us ... what little fun we can make for ourselves ? Look . See ? I make the family laugh ! White , like a human . See ? And then I walk around like a straight-necked goose . Like a human . See ? Ahh ! I 'll have some meat ! I 'll have some meat ! I 'm gonna cook it good ! Ahh ! Don 't you see ? This is what he saw . My room for taking my makeup off . Fool ! Search the barn , Eyes that deceive once can deceive twice . A clown , hey ? We 'll see . No humans here , sir . Two brand-new calves . They would 've been eaten if there were humans around . Demote that patrol . He 's made fools of authority . Yes , sir , Idiot ! Virdon , I 'm - I 'm sorry for how I acted to you in there . I just couldn 't believe . Thank you very much , Anto , I saw what you did out here , and , uh . if I hadn 't seen it myself . I wouldn 't have believed that either . I 'd say we 're about even . Will you show me what I must do just in case someday when you 're not here ? Just ask me , Anto . I know . I watched the whole thing . I put some bread in there . Oh , thank you . Zantes . Be careful of your leg . I don 't want you to come back here ... - ... laying around for , for me to wait on . - Oh ? - Where will you go ? - Well , we don 't really know . West always seemed a good direction . Maybe we 'll try it again . Thank you , Virdon . I 'll never forget you . It 'll be a long time before I forget you too , Anto . I named the bulls , One Burke , the other Virdon . Hey ! Just watch the heifers around the one named Burke . Bye . - Good-bye . - Bye . So long . - What is this ? - A windmill . Where does it come from ? - I made it . - He 's a very bright boy . If you were bright , old farmer . you 'd keep him at work in the fields . not building these toys to play in the wind . Next spring we 'll plant that new field they made for us . Good , rich earth . And I 'll plant the best seed , like Virdon said , huh . Yes , we 'll try it . The best seed this time . Uh , if there 's no objection . I think we should go that way . Does it matter ? Everywhere we go there 's apes . - Yeah . - Some good , some bad . Come on . Subtitles subXpacio

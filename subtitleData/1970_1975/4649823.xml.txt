 In position , Captain . IGR 140-288 . Right , take her up 8 fathoms . Prepare surface stations ! - Load tanks 1 through 6 . - Yes , sir . Steady at 8 fathoms , sir . Right . Nothing in sight , prepare to surface . Surface stations ! Maintain visual and radar . Watch for surface vessels . Where are we , Lieutenant ? Right here , Captain . Fine . We 've made good time . Hover cruise at 20 knots , steer a course 126 . Steer 126 , speed 20 knots . Tracking aerial set up , sir . Skydiver to Control . We have surfaced . 'In position to check the satellite . ' Roger , Skydiver . - What 's happening , Captain ? - I think it 's pretty important . Commander Straker 's playing this one close to his chest . - There 's the signal . - Looks good . I have a radar sighting , bearing 279 . It 's a freighter . Take her down . Yes , sir . Dive , dive , dive ! - Skydiver to SHADO Control . - SHADO Control . 'We had to crash dive to avoid a surface vessel . ' - What was it ? - A freighter . I 'm sure they didn 't see us . We managed to pick up the satellite . - Its orbit looked good . - Thank you , I 'll tell the Commander . - How far is it now ? - Around 8 miles . Do you think it 'll work ? I think so . But then I always was ... an eternal optimist . 4 minutes , Doctor . Right . Check area latitude . 10 seconds to transmission check , sir . There it is . Smack on the nose . The first transmissions are coming through , sir . Signal strength 012-147 . - What 's the distortion ? - Minimal . Decimal 072 . Fine . Keep tracking . I think Dr Young was a little put out at not being able to see the results . Yes , security 's a word I don 't like to throw at a man who goes out of his way to cooperate . Maybe we can send him some prints . Let 's see if there 's anything on the tape to print . - All set up , Ford ? - Yes , sir . Look at that . Look at that detail ! That 's taken from nearly 500 miles out ! Fantastic quality ! It 's fantastic . A real breakthrough . See this one ? Range 490 miles , magnification times 250 . It 's like a helicopter shot . I 'm convinced . We 'll throw everything into getting this project approved . - How 's it going , Kelly ? - Pretty well , Commander . The test run was so successful there are very few modifications needed . It 's quite a set-up . When can I tell the Commission we 'll be ready to go ? 3 , 4 weeks , we just have to check the link systems . That 's what I wanted to hear . Oh , Commander ! Could I have a word with you ? - Do you mind , John ? - No , not at all . What 's on your mind ? Tomorrow you 're asking the Commission for a billion dollars . For one of the most important projects we 've undertaken . Sure . It 's the first item on the agenda . There are 53 others . Mine 's number 52 , it comes after what we spend on new coffee machines . All I want is $ 50,000 and the chances are I won 't get it . I can 't help you . I think my project 's important , sir . You could help . Wait a minute . You 've done a great job on the device , but your group ... Group ? There are just two of us , Commander . But with that $ 50,000 , we could complete the stereo-scan development . I 'd like to help , but I think you 're looking the wrong way , Kelly . Space . That 's where you should turn your talent . - Well , I hope you get your billion . - Oh , I 'll get it . It 's a space project . All very pretty ! But don 't pull a bulldozer job in here , Straker . I won 't have to . Nice to see you again . Gentlemen . The financial committee of the Astro Space Commission is in session . You all know Commander Straker . And by the billion-dollar cost estimate beside it , you will have realised that the first project on the agenda is his . Thank you , General . Now , gentlemen , this drawing shows a standard B-142 space probe . The project will use a modified version of this spacecraft . I 'd like you to notice the domed structure here . From this cross-section , you 'll see that it incorporates a device which , in layman 's terms , can best be described as an electronic telescope . The principle is very simple . It is a telescope which , instead of using light , operates with a stream of electrons . And it 's capable of scanning with a magnification of up to times 2,500 . Lieutenant Masters . These shots of the earth were taken from an orbit between 450 and 500 miles out . The electron telescope scans an area , radioes the information to earth and the impulses are transmitted into these pictures . As you can see , the definition is as good as any photograph . The homing mechanisms are also very elaborate but they 're fully tested and will enable the probe to home in on the planet from two million miles out . I 'm sorry to disillusion you , Straker , but I can get great shots of earth with a $ 2 camera from a balloon . Yes , I should have been more explicit , General . By " the planet " , I didn 't mean earth . The purpose of the project , gentlemen , is to enable a probe to track and follow a UFO to its origin . To home in and get high definition close-ups of the alien planet . My project is to launch a standard or a modified B-142 space probe and place it into a parking orbit around the moon . - SHADO don 't have those facilities ? - No . We would have to use NASA for the launch . The telescope and electronics are still on the secret list , so they would have to be fitted by astronauts after the probe had been placed in orbit . Well ? Find Foster and bring him to my office , Alec . Well ? Did they approve it ? We 've got ourselves a deal . We even got a time slot from NASA . Launch 712 in 4 weeks ' time . - That 's great . - Yes . We could be a lot closer to some of the answers . - Well , there she is , ready to go . - Yeah . You know , I 've learned a lot in these last weeks . Have you got a pen ? I thought I 'd just write out the cheque for 50,000 . That 's all right . I can cash in some of the family jewels . Anyway , there 's always next year or the year after . She 's all yours , Lieutenant . I hope it gets you those shots . I 'll see you around . 'Will Lieutenant Masters report for pre-lunar medical right away . ' - Long day ? - Long month . Well , I think we 're set . Listen , I 'm thinking of taking Keith Ford with me to Moonbase . Good idea . You 're gonna need all the help you can get . Alec , you 'd better keep all earth-lunar communication to a minimum . Sure . What 's the situation on the launch ? The launch ? Well , I think we can safely leave that with NASA . Give me a read-out on the master computer . Electronic read-out , A-OK . Countdown continues at T minus 4 hours , 32 minutes , 8 seconds . Missile power ... Go . Water system ... Go . Fuel system ... Go . Telemetry ... Go . T minus three minutes . We have green on all read-outs . T minus 60 seconds . '29 ... 28 ... 27 ... ' We have go for ignition at minus 12 ... '24 ... 23 ... 22 ... 21 ... ' '18 ... 17 ... ' Main stage ignition . '15 ... 14 ... 13 ... '12 ... 11 ... 10 ... '9 ... 8 ... '7 ... 6 ... 5 ... '4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... '0 . ' We have liftoff . T plus 55 . T plus 60 . T plus 65 . She looks good . NASA reports the launch is successful , sir . Right . Moonbase Control to Lunar Module . Switch to automatic LLS , we 'll bring you in by radio beam . - Touchdown minus 20 seconds . - Right . - Welcome to Moonbase , Commander . - Thank you . - I 'll show you to your quarters . - You two go along . Paul , let 's go to Control . I want to check on that space probe report . - Hello , Commander ! - Lieutenant . Nina . Joan . - How was the flight ? - Very smooth , thanks . - How 's everything here ? - Fine . Lieutenant , do you have the space probe report ? Oh , good . Apogee 0,124 below requirement , but we can easily correct it . I 've worked out a rough schedule for the astronauts . We understand the probe is to be modified in space . This is great . We 'll have to go through it together of course . I did say it was a rough schedule , sir . Excuse me , sir . Because of the radio-security clampdown , no one on Moonbase knows the purpose of Project Discovery , as it has been code-named . But I do know how hard some of you have worked on it . As you know , a modified B-142 space probe has been placed into a parking orbit around the moon . The first phase is to fit specialised equipment into the probe . This equipment has already been shipped to Moonbase from earth . Phase two is to manoeuvre a UFO into a position where the probe can be activated into a flight pattern which will enable it to follow the alien back to its origin . 'When the probe gets within two million miles of its target , 'it will start to transmit . ' With luck , we should get the first close-up shots of another world . It will be our first step in bringing the fight back to the alien planet . Thank you . - An exciting situation , Lieutenant . - Yes , it is . You 'd better set things up quickly . Right . Who 's going out on the probe ? Colonel Foster and Lieutenant Masters . Moonbase Control to Lunar Module . Your flight pattern is go for rendezvous . 'Right , confirm 1,4 . ' 022-417 . 'Roger , Control . We have visual contact . 'We 're in position . Onboard computer reads go for space-walk . ' We have green on all systems . Moonbase Control to Lunar Module . Confirm go for space-walk . 'Safety lines checked . 'Send up a camera on my signal . ' 'Advance aboard satellite . Condition green . 'Stage one completed . ' Control to space team . Roger . Great work , Paul . Pass my congratulations on to your team . I 've asked you all here to explain the next and most vital phase of the operation . The space probe is in orbit , the equipment has been installed and fully tested . Lieutenant Ellis . The problem is to force a UFO into an orbit complementary to the space probe 's . Then we can activate the tracking systems on the B-142 and enable it to latch on to the UFO . This will involve scheduling the Interceptors very precisely . We 've made a computer study of UFO approaches , and the general pattern is marked , as you can see . Lieutenant Ellis has compiled an Interceptor schedule . But a lot of decisions will have to be made on the spot . - So we have to play this one by ear ? - Right . - Isn 't that dangerous ? - It involves a certain risk . A calculated risk , Lieutenant , based on a careful weighing of human factors as much as logic . All we have to do now is wait for a UFO . 'Red alert . UFO bearing 142 , blue . 'UFO maintaining course . ' 'This is Control . I have a red alert . 'I repeat , a red alert . ' Have UFO on positive track : 142 , blue . 'Speed SOL 8,35 . ' 140-139 . SID has just confirmed . It 's coming in on the predicted flight path . Good . She 's all yours , Lieutenant . 'Control to Interceptors . ' Immediate launch . Repeat , immediate launch . Right , let 's go . 'This is Commander Straker . 'You all realise how important this mission is . ' Your controller will be Lieutenant Ellis . Flight plans will be relayed by Lieutenant Ford . 'UFO maintaining course . 'Speed SOL minus 8.35 . ' UFO maintaining course and speed . Stand by for on-board computer read-in . '001O2 . 13190124 . ' Roger , Control . 'UFO maintaining course , bearing 142 , blue . 'Range 18 million miles . '17 million miles . ' Entering area red , 081 . There it is . It 's changing course . UFO entering area red , 084 . Speed , SOL 8,37 . We 'll have to readjust the schedule . Right . Compute for a new flight plan . Right , sir . 'Control to Interceptor , stand by for new flight plan . ' 042148 , 2148 . Increase speed to SOL 1,127 . Leader to 2 and 3 . - Alter course to 2148 . - Roger . Interceptors losing contact , sir . We 've got to turn it . If we use a detonation here , the UFO will be forced to swing away onto this sort of a course . Tell the Interceptors to explode a missile in area blue . 128 . Control to Interceptors . Break formation . Will relay new flight plans . Control to Interceptors . 'Missile timing : 15,18 seconds . ' Thank you , Control . Commencing missile sequence . Firing minus 5,2 seconds . - Detonation positive . - It 's altered course . - UFO in area blue , 132 . - Maintaining speed . Crossing into blue , 133 . It 's coming around just right . It 's accelerating , sir . Decimal 38 . 8,39 . We have to use a second missile . - Are you sure ? - Yes . - Compute it . - Yes , sir . Well ? I think a missile in area blue , 27 should do it , Commander . - Order the missile launch . - Yes , sir . Missile timing 104-018-626 . Roger . Detonation confirmed , sir . 'UFO veered to new course : 301 . 'Compute B-142 . 'Will link up in 43 seconds . ' - Lieutenant . - Oh , Commander Straker . - How do you feel ? - Fine , thanks . - How about a cup of coffee ? - Yes , I 'd like that . - How do you like your coffee ? - No sugar . - Here we are . - Thanks . Well , here 's to Project Discovery . Cheers . I want to thank you , Gay , for all the hard work you put into this project . And the long hours . You know , I think ... I think you push yourself a little too hard . You 're doing a fine job , Gay , a man 's job , but you don 't have to do it any better because you 're a woman . Don 't ever forget you 're a very attractive girl . Thanks for the coffee . And , thank you . Lieutenant . - Colonel Foster . - Sir . - When do we leave ? - 1800 hours tomorrow , sir . Good ! Let me give you a piece of advice , Paul . Don 't ever judge a situation by the end of a conversation . Lunar Module , take-off minus 18 minutes . I just came to say thank you , girls . When will the first pictures be through ? The experts tell me 4 months , so let 's hope they 're worth waiting for . - Goodbye . - Goodbye , sir . - Goodbye , Lieutenant . - Goodbye , Commander . Gay , next time you 're on earth furlough , drop in and see me . Yes , I will . They 're coming through now , sir . Feed it through the decoder to printout . Right , sir . Fantastic ! Look at that ! I want the preliminary report in 24 hours . Yes , sir . We 've got the answers , Alec . We 've got the answers . - Commander . - I did say 24 hours , Kelly . Yes , but we haven 't had time to type up a report . Then give it to me verbally . There was a fault in the device . A fault ? The range and magnification on each shot wasn 't transmitted . What is that supposed to mean ? Except for superfluous detail , these shots tell us very little . What are you trying to sell me ? Look at that detail ! It must tell you something . Yes , but was it taken from 500 or 100 miles ? - Is the magnification one or 1,000 ? - Oh , come on . Look , if I take a picture of a girl from three feet or 100 yards , I can still see it 's a girl . I want to show you something , Commander . Whatever the range , that 's a shot of the alien planet , a close-up of the surface . Yes . I 'm no expert , but that must be some form of vegetation . Some form of vegetation , you think . You could be right . But why don 't we take another look ? Now , let 's pull back . You 'll notice the curvature of the horizon . Surely from that , we can work out an approximation of the overall size . Let 's pull back a little more . What is this , Kelly ? Some sort of joke ? You said earlier , Commander , you could recognise a girl from three feet or 100 yards . What about when the shot is from 30 inches , with a magnification varying from 0 to 10,000 ? Hello , Commander ! - Lieutenant . - Thank you , you can relax now . Hold it there a moment , will you , Lieutenant ? Magnification 0 ... times 10 ... 100 ... 1,000 . Not the most flattering of pin-ups , nor the best way to spend a furlough . - Thanks for all your help , Gay . - Pleasure . - Goodbye , Commander . - Lieutenant . Yes , I 'm beginning to see the problem . I 'd like you to have a look at that monitor . What would you say this is , Commander ? Before your demonstration , I would 've said a lava formation of some kind . Actually , it 's a section of fractured polystyrene . - It 's incredible . - Here 's another . A structure ... It could be a building . In fact , Commander , it 's a grain of pollen . Another shot which could well be taken for a strange rock formation . - I have to agree . - Puffed wheat , sir . Without knowing range or magnification , the lava flow becomes a piece of shattered polystyrene : magnification times 2,155 . A pollen grain becomes a building . And a grain of puffed wheat , a rock formation . Tell me , how are these shots produced ? Micro-photography is well established , but the secret is three-dimensional effect , the depth of focus . It 's been known for 25 years , but it needs development . So , while we 've all been looking into outer space , men like you have been sitting on this : inner space . - Your pet project . - Yes . It 's a vast area , almost completely unexplored . But I believe it will give us the answers to some of the basic questions about the universe , and even life itself . Maybe we 've all been looking the wrong way . You know , when you really think about it , everything in this office , every object , even a speck of dust , contains billions of particles . And each particle is made up of millions of atoms . A whole universe within these four walls . I walk along a beach , stand with millions of grains of sand beneath my feet ... Is everything we know ? This office , our world , the vastness of space itself , inside one grain of sand on another beach , on another world , in another universe ? Space is infinite , both ways , outward and inward . You can tell Kelly he 'll get his appropriation . It 'll be more than he expects . I get the picture . A greatly magnified picture , General .

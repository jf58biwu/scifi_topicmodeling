 WORLD ON A WIRE - Günther ! - I 'll be right in . Secretary of State von Weinlaub . I 'm Hirse , Mr. Von Weinlaub 's assistant . Hello , my name 's Lause , I 'm chief of security . Please , Mr. Siskins expects you . - Wasn 't that Dr. Vollmer ? - It was . To get right to the point : Simulacron is almost fully operational . I may seem ill-informed but what interests me is your definition of " almost " . Of course , Mr. Secretary . I apologize . The margin of error for our prognoses currently reaches as high as 5 . 8 % . I see , thank you . Yes . Professor Vollmer can tell you exactly about the state of things . He 's overseen development of the computer . We know that , Mr. Siskins . Professor Vollmer , please ... So , you 're secretary of state ? Naturally . I really don 't care , to be honest . Do you have a mirror on you ? A mirror ? Why ? Here , take this . What do you see ? Come on , what do you see ? Let me help you , Mr ? Von Weinlaub . Alright , von Weinlaub . You are nothing more than the image others have made of you . - That 's all . - Enough ! Thank you . And the rest of you ? Vollmer ! You too , Siskins . Want to look in the mirror ? Go on , look at yourself . It 's a sad joke . That 'll do , Vollmer ! This has gone far enough . Hirse , let 's leave . Headache . It pounds and pounds and pounds . Do you know what 's pounding in my head ? I know . Lause ... Please come in . Why don 't you lie down ? Lause will take you to your office . Come on , Henri . It 's not a headache . It 's much , much more . So much that my head 's about to explode . Come on . I 'm coming , Günther . They refuse to understand ... those poor worms . - Take care of him . - Yes , Mr. Siskins . I must apologize for Professor Vollmer . He 's been working day and night . His nerves have always been delicate . The line between genius and madness , you know ... Strange kind of madness , wouldn 't you say ? Of course , Mr. Secretary ... very strange . One moment , please . Go ahead . Please ... - But I ... - Look at yourself . - What do you see ? - Me . Stiller was due back yesterday . He 'll come , Henri . I 'm scared . I 'm with you . You 're here . The constant throbbing in my head ... Have you ever heard of a head exploding ? Like that , into a thousand pieces ? No , never . Really ? Anyway ... Do you remember ? As a boy you must have played " I see something you don 't " . Sure , all kids do . Günther ... I know something you don 't . Something no one must know . It would mean the end of this world . Henri ... Vollmer ! Sorry , the bar 's over there . It 's padding , not muscles . To look manlier . It 's not all padding , is it ? If you 're interested ... Fred Stiller . I 'm in the phone book . Can 't you get a drink ? Guess I 'm small fry . Too bad , but maybe you 'll grow . Maybe . Whiskey ? Yes , with water . Rainer , two whiskeys : One ice , one water . Yes , Mr. Siskins . Coming to the funeral ? I 'll be there , although ... the dead don 't really care , do they ? Your whiskeys . Thank you . Can you debug the computer without Vollmer ? I think so . We can 't afford further delays . The Ministry 's impatient . By the way ... What ? Oh , nothing . Tell me , what 's your dream car ? Pardon me ? Your dream car . It 's a simple question . Oh , God ... A Corvette . I see , a Corvette ... 275 HP . And about 40,000 marks . Beyond your wage bracket ? Somewhat , but you asked about my dream car , not my wage bracket . - What bracket do you want ? - The next one . Why not , if you 're as good as Vollmer . I 'm not , but I 'm tough . I see you 're aware Vollmer and I had our differences of opinion . I believe so . He was pigheaded , don 't you agree ? Well , I ... Think about it . Just so you don 't misunderstand ... It was simply a hypothesis , not an offer . I understood you , Mr. Siskins . 275 HP . Quite something . I 'm Gloria . Great . Care for a drink ? Champagne . What else ? Still 42-26-39 ? 39 1 / 2 . You get fat , just sitting around . But every inch is precious . Thanks . How 's the computer coming ? OK , and how 's working for Siskins ? No , I mean it . I 'm very interested in Simulacron . Is it true you 've created an artificial world ? " World " is an exaggeration . Currently we 've some 10,000 identity units . That 's all we need for now . The world in a nutshell , you see ? 10,000 people . They 're people , aren 't they ? As you like . To us they 're merely circuits . But to them ... They live just like we do ... build roads , listen to music , eat ... And make love ? That , too . Make love , enjoy life ... have kids . Exciting . Pardon me ? Making love ? Yes , that too . But I mean , a living world ... in a box full of microchips ? We 're alive . They 're like people on TV dancing for us . The way you describe it is fascinating . You 're fascinating . Hi , Lause ! Hi . Have you seen Stiller ? Yeah , a minute ago . Come in . No , I 'll wait here . Bring him to me . Sure . - Fred , come with me . - Me ? Lause wants you . Excuse me . See you later . Pity . Lause ! My God , finally ! I have to see you . You look awful . Where have you been ? After Vollmer 's death , I drove to your place in the country . You found him ? Yes , but ... where were you ? I came back earlier than planned . What 's up ? Not here . Come ... Well ? It 's about Vollmer 's death . But ... I thought it was an accident . I don 't know , I didn 't see it . But it was very strange . What ? What was strange ? Vollmer was strange . Something had happened to him . I spoke to him shortly before he died . He was afraid . Then he told me something that was so ... that was ... absolutely crazy . What ? I can 't tell you , it 's too crazy . Perhaps he was crazy . Do you know what fear is ? Yes , Lause . I think so . You 've no idea . Alright , fine . But ... Tell me what he said . OK , then . It sounds incredible , but who knows ... See what you make of it . My God , I 'm so clumsy . I 've startled you . I 'll be right there . " Vanished into Thin Air . At a party last night in the home of Herbert Siskins - prominent head of the IKZ Institute - an Institute employee reports that Chief of Security Günther Lause vanished in the middle of a conversation . Police have opened an investigation . " What are you up to , Stiller ? What 's this about Lause and Vollmer ? I told the police what I saw . Trying to make yourself and the IKZ look ridiculous ? But it happened exactly as I described . Fine , have it your way . Inspector Lehner , Missing Persons Bureau and Detective Stuhlfauth , Homicide . Dr. Stiller ... our acting technical director . You seem to be the only one who saw Lause last night . What do you mean ? My men have interviewed everyone at the party . No one else saw Lause there . Did you have too much to drink ? No , I wasn 't drunk . It 's true that we didn 't find Mr. Lause at home . But that could be a coincidence . What did Lause say about Vollmer 's death ? He just said he found it strange . Where were you when Vollmer died ? At my cabin . With others ? No . We 'd like to see where Vollmer died . Please show the gentlemen the computer room . Yes , Mr. Stiller . Good-bye . This way . See you again . Let 's put this incident behind us . You already have . Good . I 'd like to discuss Vollmer 's job with you again . Go ahead . As I 've already told you ... Vollmer 's pigheadedness , I mean ... It was a strain on my nerves . I 'm not pigheaded . That 's what I wanted to hear . I 'm a good judge of human nature . I knew we 'd see eye to eye . Tell me your dream car , I 'll tell you who you are . Oh , that ... Good . I 'll sound out the board of directors but I don 't foresee any obstacles . Good-bye ... Mr. Director . Bring me an aspirin , please . Right away . Problems ? Yes , I 'm being promoted . Fred ! Did he name you technical director ? You don 't seem very pleased . Why should I be ? I 'll have the same problems with Siskins as Vollmer did , just wait . Then why did you accept ? Simulacron 's the most exciting research project in the entire world . Nothing else comes close . I 'll earn a good salary and ... It 's just Siskins . If Vollmer was right , then ... Maja ... Forget all this . I 'll forget it . Thanks . Has Vollmer 's office been emptied ? No . His things are still there . Cancel my appointments . I 'll be in Vollmer 's office . What are you doing ? You 're hurting me . Thank you , Fred Stiller . - You are Fred Stiller ? - Yes , but what are you doing ? The guard at the front desk showed me in . Aren 't you ? I 'm Eva Vollmer . - I didn 't recognize you . - Naturally . I 'm here because I was asked to pick up Father 's things . - I thought you were in Montreux . - I 've been back a month . You were with your father when ... Was he acting strange ? Did he seem nervous ? Not that I noticed . Why ? Because he ... I think he had made an important discovery . He couldn 't tell me . He was a bit preoccupied , no more . You know , if you were to visit me ... I 'd like that , really . Tell me ... Did your dad see much of Günther Lause ? Your uncle , Günther Lause . Never heard of him . You don 't remember your uncle ? I remember him very well . His name was Jakob , Jakob Meixner . He died four years ago . Eva ? Can I ... Can I be of any help ? I 'll manage . Father left me a bit of money , and the house . I apologize , Fred . I misjudged you . I thought you were interested only in taking Father 's job . I should 've known better . I 'd like some cake . Choose what you want at the counter . You 're under arrest . Come with me . Jeez , Franz , you scared me . That one . And two whiskeys . What 's up , Stiller ? Here ... Here 's a riddle I came across , a rebus . Imagine a drawing of a Greek warrior holding a spear looking to his right , and taking a step . With a turtle going the same way . First ... does that ring a bell ? Second ... ever seen such a drawing ? Me ? What 's this all about ? Vollmer left me that drawing . Does it mean anything to you ? Bizarre , if you ask me . Bizarre , sure . - Does it remind you of anything ? - Maybe . What ? Zeno . Zeno 's paradox . Achilles and the tortoise . Achilles tries to overtake the tortoise , but cannot . By the time he reaches where it was , the turtle has moved ahead . What could the paradox mean to our work ? I 'm only the psychologist for our creations . But ... as I recall , the paradox is meant to show that movement is an illusion . What 's the link to our work ? Vollmer was acting very strange before he died . Cheesecake ? Who ordered the cheesecake ? Maybe for a reason . What did he say ? Did you order cheesecake ? No ... I mean , yes . I think I ordered it , thanks . How was he strange ? I played chess with him three days before he died . He wasn 't himself , he was rambling on about philosophy . He had made a shattering discovery . What ? He wouldn 't say . It was a secret . Something like that . Why are you so interested in it , Fred ? I don 't think Vollmer 's death was an accident . What do you mean ? I know about Vollmer and Siskins ' disagreements on the applications of the simulation model . I said no such thing . OK , fine . By the way , I can imagine what Vollmer 's shattering discovery was . I bet it had to do with his attitude towards the identity units we 'd programmed in his computer . You remember how he called them " my children " . He was only joking . You can 't spend years feeding data into a computer that allows for the simulation of every aspect of human behaviour without asking yourself if it might lead to the creation of something resembling human consciousness . Lause spoke of a " shattering discovery " . Lause ? Who 's he ? Stop . If I hadn 't believed him , I 'd never have told the cops . Lause ? Cops ? What do you mean ? Lause ! Günther Lause ! Chief of security at Cybernetics and Futurology ! Our Institute ! Just take it easy . Stiller , do you see that man ? That 's Hans Edelkern . He 's been IKZ 's chief of security for five years . You remember now ? Stiller ! Got a light ? No , I mean it , for my cigarette . Understand ? I 'm not trying to ... Pick me up ? Too bad . Anyway , I don 't smoke . Thanks . Sorry . Don 't mention it . CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Gloria ? Do you have a pen ? Then take this down The chairman United Steel Inc Dear Mr Hartmann I accept your invitation with pleasure . In view of the situation , I would request you treat my visit as primarily a personal one . I 'm sure you will understand if I insist on the utmost confidentiality Yours truly Herbert Siskins Please come in , my dear Siskins . A lovely couple . Rupp , Daily News . A quick question : Is your new computer solely for state use ? Please , I have no comment . Certainly not here . Ask at the IKZ press office . Yeah , yeah . One thing : Does a certain company have access to data obtained from the computer ? A suggestion , Mr ? Rupp . Why not write about how our simulation model is more than a computer ? I 'll suggest it to my editor . It 's a new generation of computer technology . Who benefits ? Everyone , if it 's up to me . May I see your ID , please ? Regulations , you know . I know . Thank you , Mr. Stiller . How can I help you ? For personnel files , you need special clearance . No , just the staff directory . Which letter ? Let 's try L. Alright , L ... L what ? Ask it , " Who is Günther Lause ? " WHO IS GÜNTHER LAUSE ? Günther Lause is unknown . Have a look . Okay . Edelkern . Ask it about Edelkern . What 's it say ? The truth , naturally : " Hans Edelkern is chief of security at IKZ . " Tell me , Mrs ? Meier . Know anything special about Hans Edelkern , anything at all ? Mr. Edelkern ? I don 't think so . Ask him yourself . Hi , Fred . Were there complaints about me ? Tell me the truth . - No , that 's not it . - Good . I was afraid ... I mean it . That 's alright , Fred . You don 't have to explain . I 'm sure you have your reasons . Say , why don 't you visit us again ? Laura still talks about our last dinner . Says you 're the most charming man around . Really , am I ? - According to Laura . - Well , then ... You see . Just give us a call . We 'd be thrilled , honestly . I 've never met a Laura in my whole life . Anything else I can do ? No , thanks . You 're welcome . I 'm ... I 'm here about Lause . Who 's Lause ? Forget it , Fritz . Something wrong ? Morning , Maja . Good morning . I 'm a gift . Siskins thought you 'd be pleased . Of course . Of course I 'm pleased . A sight to behold . Isn 't that what they say ? Yes , they do . Where 's Maja ? She 's sick . Probably will be for some time . By the way , Siskins was very sorry to lose me . I 'm deeply honoured . - A cup of coffee ? - No thanks . I 'm delighted to work with you . The pleasure 's all mine . Get me the police , Inspector Lehner . Yes , Mr. Stiller . Inspector Lehner , please . Hello , Inspector . I wanted to ask if you found out anything about Lause . Who is this ? At the Cybernetics Institute . It 's about the Lause case , Günther Lause . Sorry I 've never heard of a Lause My God , you must remember ! Siskins ' party , a man disappeared . I notified the police . Slowly Mr Stiller I don 't know of any Lause case Siskins wants you in his office at 2 : 30 . Thanks Miss Fromm How are you feeling ? No idea . Not good . What 's the doctor say ? I had all the tests ... blood urine , everything . But they don 't know . Chronic exhaustion . And you ... How are you ? Siskins asked me to a meeting at 2 : 30 . Really ? - Who 's with you now ? - Where ? At work . A woman named Gloria Fromm . 42-26-39 ? 39 1 / 2 . From all that sitting . You should know . I 'll be going . Get well soon . Thanks . Fred ? I 'm still fond of you . Have a seat , Dr. Stiller . Care for a drink ? - A coffee ? - No , thanks . Really . Alright then , let 's begin . Would you ? As you may know I sit on the government - appointed commission Perspective 2000 as an expert on steel . Also in your capacity as chairman of United Steel Inc . Of course , naturally . And in this respect we 're somewhat preoccupied especially given certain recent trends in freight and transportation systems that would have major repercussions in the 80s and 90s on demand for steel . Do you have a background in business ? Hardly . Well , if I may briefly explain ... In our sector , investments are not only long-term , they 're also ... Very costly . Let Mr. Hartmann finish , Stiller . No , no , you can put it that way . Quite right . Costly . In other words , an investment to the tune of several hundred million if made today , would take , say , 20 years to be amortized . - If your analyses were correct . - If they were correct , yes . Naturally we don 't make wild guesses . We rely on a whole slew of scientific analytical tools : Economic and market analyses trend forecasts , input-output relations ... to name a few . But you yourself know the limitations of the prognostic capacity of conventional computer technology and how much larger the margin of error is of such computers compared to your simulation model . Why are you telling me all this ? - I don 't understand . - He does . Dr. Stiller ... We 're not talking about opening a hot-dog stand but a decision of major importance to the national economy for which Mr. Hartmann , as a member of the Perspective 2000 Committee ... Then let the committee request it . Can you imagine the bureaucracy that entails ? Besides , the software wasn 't designed to access such variables . It would jeopardize the entire program and set us back two months . I 'll look like a fool . From a technical ... Thank you , Stiller . I 'm not asking . You 'll call up the data from the simulation model for the demand for steel for the next 20 years and have it on my desk by ... by the 23rd . I don 't know . You can 't just let some conglomerate ... Please let me decide what I can or cannot do , Stiller . Then you don 't need me . For God 's sake , Siskins ... I thought you 'd have settled this internally , at least . We have , my dear Hartmann , we have . You see , Stiller is a scientist . And in every scientist resides a bit of an idealist . But ... I 'll deal with the little idealist in Stiller . - Hello , Stiller . - Hello , Hahn . Want to check the psychograms of the new units ? No , we 've reviewed them . Feeling better ? Yes , it just came over me yesterday . I should apologize for my behaviour . Forget it . Really , I 'm sorry . Excuse me , but ... I need to go to the computer room . We 're up to precisely 9700 identity units . The equivalent of a small town . By the way ... I 'd like a hook-up . For you ? To sample village life . Fine with me , anytime . Oh , have a look . She 's in the mind of a millionaire 's wife . Yes , he 's here . Fine . Fine , I 'll tell him . The police are here to see you . The police ? Come with me . Hello , Dr. Stiller . You honour me , but this is Stiller . Excuse me , I 'm sorry . Hello , Dr. Stiller . I was hoping to speak to you in private . Is that really necessary ? I 'd say so , yes . OK , I 'll clear out . I 'll be at the computer . See you . Please come in . Yes ? We have questions , Mr. Stiller . Questions for you . Questions about the Vollmer case . You were his assistant ? You know full well . Yes , of course . Purely routine . Part of the job . Once learned you never forget it . Let me be frank , Mr. Stiller . It 's possible that Vollmer 's death was not an accident . You were away ? I told you , at my cabin in the mountains . What do you mean , you told me ? Nothing . Just that I was at my cabin . Can anyone corroborate that ? No . Vollmer was my best friend . You 're not doing too badly as technical director at IKZ . No , not too badly . I can reach you here , if I need you ? If you need me . Good-bye , Mr. Stiller . He was from Homicide . If anyone makes trouble , I 'm here . The police aren 't giving up , that 's good . Lause hinted that Vollmer 's death might not have been an accident . Who 's Lause ? The Lause who vanished without a trace at Siskins ' party . Did someone vanish without a trace at Siskins ' party ? Probably one of Siskins' harmless jokes . No doubt , Gloria , no doubt . A simple hook-up to an identity unit . Is that alright ? I chose 4388 for you , a truck driver . Enjoy the ride . OK , step on it . Here we go . Be good , and stay out of trouble . Floor it . Lousy weather we gave them Strange why 's there no traffic ? I don 't get it Maybe it 's Sunday here I forgot to ask Kid if I hit you it won 't even cause a short circuit What 's Walfang done now ? Hey what 's that ? You were lucky , young man . Just a slight shock . We nearly saw the last of you . How 's it possible ? Search me . I haven 't checked the box yet , but ... But ? Say it , you have a hunch . Something exploded . It can only have been sabotage . Impossible , with our security . If it exploded , it must be sabotage A computer doesn 't just explode ! Sabotage is quite impossible . IKZ is under our control . Obviously not . A technical error , perhaps . How long will repairs take ? I nearly died , and that 's all you say ? You mustn 't get excited , you need rest . Yeah , yeah , OK . Good-bye , then . Thanks . Don 't mention it . Just doing my job . I want a thorough investigation . Check security measures , Edelkern . If necessary , step them up . Understand ? Naturally , Mr. Siskins . Of course . Mr. Stiller , I think you should go home and rest . Seriously , how long will repairs take ? Two or three days , no longer . OK , then ... That 's alright . Eva ? You startled me . Something wrong ? No . I was thinking of my father . Shall we go for a drive ? Just like that . You know , I need a change of air . Some of Father 's files are still on his desk . Check if there 's anything useful to you . I 'll get ready . Was anything removed after your father died ? Pardon ? I asked if anything was removed after your father 's death . Questioning me ? Come on , let 's go . Have you seen his drawing since then ? What drawing ? Achilles and the tortoise . I 've never seen it ... Achilles and the tortoise . I 'm going to try to find out how your father really died . Do you think ? Maybe . I don 't want anything to happen to you . What 's wrong ? Nothing . I don 't feel well . I haven 't felt well for a while . I get dizzy , see things . Probably , or possibly , I 'm simply overworked . Want me to drive ? I 'll just wait here a bit , then drive you home . One , two , three , four ... Come in . Fourteen , fifteen . - Hi , Fritz . - Hi , Fred . What 's that ? - For my circulation . - Your circulation ? I 've been having dizzy spells . Better watch it . Your puppets are dancing . I contacted 0001 again . Einstein ? That system failure has him worried . He 's being difficult . You know , I think that was Vollmer 's only major mistake . What ? The Einstein contact unit . It wouldn 't have worked without him . We tried everything . We needed a unit we could contact directly . Problems were inevitable . Why ? No one can stand knowing they 're artificial . Obviously . But if they suffer psychological disorders it shows how successful we 've been . Depends how you see it . Einstein reported an attempted suicide . Unbelievable . Who ? 7326 , Christopher Nobody . I 'll take him out . He 'll screw up the system . It 's inhuman of us , isn 't it ? But we have no choice . OK , delete him , this ... Right . Christopher Nobody . See you later . Zeno . Zeno 's paradox ! This is no coincidence . That must be what Vollmer 's drawing meant . Send me down to see Nobody . Nobody no longer exists , he 's in heaven . - Don 't joke . - I deprogrammed him . He 's gone . Shit ! Why ? - He must know something ... - Knew ... Knew something I need . Hardly likely , Fred . I programmed him myself . He was an ordinary unit . Why ? Nothing , Fritz , nothing . Just an idea . Let me speak to Einstein , he may know . Give me a projection link . OK , I 'll call you . - Where do I meet Einstein ? - In a hotel lobby . You only have 5 minutes . You 've kept me waiting . Hello , Einstein . Is something wrong ? Not often I meet someone from above . Right now I 'm just a bundle of electronic circuits , too . A projection , if you like . Shall we sit down ? I only have a few minutes , it 's not really worth it . It 's about Christopher Nobody . You spoke to him . Why did he try to kill himself ? A whiskey . He was on the verge of a breakdown . Why ? He knew . What did he know ? Somehow he 'd found out what he was . You don 't just find that out Did you say something ? You know my circuits prohibit it Time 's running out . Stiller has to be back in 120 seconds . In 30 seconds we 'll signal him . PHONE CALL FOR MR. STILLER My time 's up . Good-bye , Einstein . Come on show me Come on show me Come on show me I can 't bear it . Please , take me with you . You know that 's absurd . I 'll be back . Let me talk in peace . We 'll meet at 8 , Gerda . In the corner restaurant . What 's the idea , young man ? Where are your manners ? The impertinence ! A light ? Thanks . Everything OK ? Everything 's OK . Except ... I saw Günther Lause . Sorry , who ? Come with me . I want to do a test . Got a minute ? Sure . OK , I 'm looking for an identity unit . Use the list . No , let 's try a different method . I 'll describe him . Age ? 55 . Male . Single . Engineering degree . Psychological traits ? He 's good-natured . But stingy . Drinks quite a bit . Two minutes . Eva , it 's Fred . Too many . Anything else ? Heavy smoker , gold medallist in sports . Collects old watches . That should do it . Sorry , but ... No , I 'm running a test . Listen ... Could you pick me up ? I want to see you . See you at six . I 've got five . - That OK ? - I hope so . Their names ? Teiler , Strunz , Kittel Erdhofer , Lause . Lause 's first name ? Günther . Günther Lause . Didn 't you just ? Yes . What number ? 7683 . Programmer ? Vollmer ! That 's fine . Thanks a lot . Strange . Daily News ! Mystery Surrounding Super-Computer ! For your own sake , forget everything you 've seen . Or your life 's not worth a dime . Daily News ! Mystery Surrounding Super-Computer ! Problems ? Could say that . Is it about Zeno again ? Or this Lause ? Yes , him too . You know about the sabotage during my hook-up . But that a cop who 'd interrogated me once forgot , and interrogated me again ... that you don 't know . Or that the other night everything , the streets , lights ... disappeared for a few seconds ... that you don 't know . Nor can you imagine my dizzy spells and depression . I see . A street vanished and then reappeared ? Ice or water ? Nothing , thanks . I 've thought a lot about you , Stiller . I believe ... with your new responsibility for the simulation model and the unusual stress of your job you 're overworked , psychologically unstable . Think about it ... Every day you reign like God over a miniature world you helped to create and which you mistake more and more for a real world . You can add and delete people at will . This leads to feelings of guilt , depression and fear . You need to relax , forget it all . I have to make a call . What should I do ? You 've taken the first step : You recognize the cause , realize what 's happening , are aware of the problem . If you keep working on yourself , you 'll get better and your mental disturbances will go away . You should take a vacation . Forget it , especially now . I don 't want Simulacron working exclusively for Hartmann . I guess I 'll be going . Try to have a little fun now and then . And stop brooding . It 's not good for you . Believe me . I 'll try . Getting in ? Quite a coincidence , isn 't it ? It 's no coincidence . Dr. Hahn phoned me . He thought I could take your mind off things . It was fine with me . Me , too . Now I 'm feeling better . But I won 't be manipulated ! Manipulated by whom ? By Siskins . What do you mean ? I won 't be intimidated ! I can be just as pigheaded as Vollmer was . Vollmer wouldn 't let private interests take over his computer . And I won 't , either . Let Siskins do what he likes . Isn 't Siskins a danger to you ? No , because he needs me . Let 's dance . Morning , Fred . Morning , Miss Fromm . Thank you . Any mail ? Need an aspirin ? Important calls ? But Siskins wants to see you urgently . Miss Fromm ? Last night I said some pretty crazy things . Forget them . Were they all just crazy things ? So , what 's up ? I need your help . We have to do something . The media are getting impatient . One question , just to be sure : Could you convincingly explain our computer to a layman if all of society depended on it ? I have my convictions , and I can present them convincingly . That 's exactly what I expected you to say . Send them in . My colleague , Dr. Stiller , and I have a statement about the simulation model . Afterwards , we 'll offer refreshments . A misunderstanding has led to the publication of a report in the press that was misleading for the public . We wish to take the opportunity to dispel this misunderstanding . Dr. Stiller developed the simulation model together with Professor Vollmer . Dr. Stiller will say a few words about the new computer system . Strictly speaking , it isn 't a computer in the conventional sense but rather an electronic simulation system with tremendous storage capacity . As Professor Henri Vollmer put it with this system we achieved the qualitative jump to an autonomous computer . We 've created an artificial miniature world out of circuits , switches , electronic impulses and reflexes . When fully functional , it will lead a life of its own according to our rules , and with its own dynamics . Concretely , Dr. Stiller , what does the thing do ? Naturally Dr. Stiller thinks in scientific terms . If you 'd prefer a practical point of view ... I 'm at your disposal . Go on , Dr. Stiller . We 'd like to hear from you . I 'll try . You have to imagine the inside of our simulation model we call it Simulacron - as a reproduction in miniature of our society . At the moment we have slightly over 9000 so-called identity units each of which has the faculties of perception , thought memory , imagination and so forth of a real human being . With Simulacron , we have in a word , a tiny universe identical to our own . Into this universe we can introduce certain impulses which ... I 'm coming back to your question - impulses which lead to highly specific reactions . Reactions ... that precisely replicate human reactions . 20 years in the future . This means we can use Simulacron to avoid the mistakes we 'd make in that period . For example ... We can , to be extremely concrete use Simulacron to learn consumer habits 20 years from now ... how housing needs will evolve which transportation modes will become obsolete and which ones will be in use . Then you could also calculate if in 20 years we 'll need more steel or plastics . Yes , of course . In time manufacturers will have access to this data to avoid socially unproductive investments . What do you mean , " in time " ? As you are aware , our research project is state-initiated and sponsored . We do not define its mandate . Our sole mission is to carry out government policy . There are questions about your relationship to United Steel . There are always questions . That 's why you do research ... to find answers . Here , in our Institute , we seek to devote our energies to designing a better new , more humane and equitable world to meet the hopes and dreams of Mr. Stiller and us all . Now , a snack . What 's your true relationship to Hartmann ? Mr. Hartmann is a friend . A good friend . In private , Mr. Rupp , only in private . Hahn 's advice from the other day ... I think it helped . At least I know what 's wrong with me . I 'm sure you 'll be better soon . About the other night , I 'm truly sorry . I was out of it . Hahn called it " paranoia " . He 's probably right . I 'll be so happy when everything 's OK . Yes , and ... now with all the coverage in the papers , the TV and so on ... I just hope he 's painted himself into a corner . And you ? I hope you 're right . Please excuse me . Of course . See you sometime . Say something ! She 's not there . Could I have a light ? Now she 's disappeared , like Lause . Lause disappeared too , and everyone 's forgotten him . Except me ... He 's in my head and he refuses to come out . My Eva ... my darling little Eva . They 'll forget you too . But in my head , she 'll stay there . I mean ... my head 's a funny head . There are things in it that don 't go in any other head . Good morning , Mr. Stiller . Good morning , Miss Fromm . Aspirin ? One second . I tried to reach you all last night . Me ? Siskins wants you . Where were you ? Were you with Eva Vollmer ? You should go see Siskins right away . It 's important . - / t 's Stiller - Send him in . Morning , Stiller . Aren 't you a sight ! A night on the town , I bet . Have a seat . What 's up ? I wanted to introduce a new addition to your staff . I believe you know him . A top-notch fellow . He sent me his résumé and I didn 't want to lose him . That will be him . Come in . Mark Holm . Hello . Hello , Mark . Mr. Holm can join your team immediately . Where 'd you work before ? The Trau Institute , but ... Isn 't that a subsidiary of United Steel ? It is , Fred . Thanks , I was just curious . 161266 . My God , Eva ! Where were you ? I searched the entire house for you ! Hold on . Thank you . - So where were you ? - At home of course I fell asleep on the couch You just didn 't see me - I searched every ... - / t doesn 't matter I wanted to apologize for running away I love you I 'm happy I 've thought it over I 'm not worried anymore I need you , Eva . Yes Ciao I 've been looking for you . How 's it going ? - A cigarette ? - God no ! I hate it . Mark Holm 's been nosing around . I 'm going to hook-up with Einstein . I want to know what 's going on with him . Like to come ? No , not today . See you later . Fritz , what 's wrong ? Nothing , Mr. Stiller , it 's nothing . You 're not Fritz Walfang . You 're Einstein . My God , what is this ? Let me go , please ! Don 't send me back . It 's my only chance . I want to be a human being . And I will . This is the first step . I 'll make the next one , too . Into the real world . What do you mean ? This is the real world . Still want your beer ? That 's what you think . But the truth is this world , which you take for reality , is only a simulation model of the real world . Fred Stiller , the big computer boss ... You 're nothing but a mass of electrical circuits . The identity unit Fred Stiller . You 're a number , like everyone here . A number in a research laboratory . Admittedly , in a highly advanced one . Professor Vollmer knew it . That 's why he had to die . And now you know . It can 't be , Einstein . Tell me it 's not true . WORLD ON A WIRE Subtitles : Robert Gray , Kinograph Subtitling : C. M. C. - Paris This print has been made possible through the generous support of : Sony Germany , Geyer-Werke , Goethe-Institut WORLD ON A WIRE Einstein ! Don 't be a fool , you 've no chance . I won 't go back , I want to live ! Get help ! Call Edelkern ! Call someone for help . You have to speak up , I can 't hear you . I 'm hard of hearing . Telephone ! Help ! Edelkern , I 'm in the cafeteria . I need help , quick ! What 's wrong , Fred ? What happened ? Take him to a hook-up station , fast . And load the program for 0001 . He looks like Fritz Walfang , right ? In reality , he 's identity unit 0001 . Vollmer named him Einstein . Yes , but , I mean ... I just saw him . Come with me . Ready ? Nearly . Let me do that . I had no idea ... About what , Holm ? What could happen . What in God 's name happened ? Careful . Quiet now . Anything ? - No , but ... - That 's OK . I wanted to see if I could hook myself up , too . But ... He switched their minds . He should be here . Hi , Fred . Don 't bother , she 's not in . Why not ? She 's been gone for six weeks . Sick . Yes , but ... On sick leave . For six weeks . Do you have a key ? Me ? Oh , it 's you . We haven 't seen you for a while . No . Where were you ? Were you sick ? We wondered where you were . We were talking about you . The key 's under the mat , where it belongs . I always see it when I 'm cleaning . The upper lock . Please , after you , you know the way . A real ambulance came and took her . I wasn 't there , but I sure heard about it . Six weeks ... A long time . I could do with a leave , but our sort ... Where are you going ? The key ! Strange ... She was always compulsively tidy . Lovely little bar , huh ? If you say so . No , it 's lovely . Especially in the afternoon , when everyone 's working . It gives you a feeling of ... Is that your line ? - Line ? - For meeting women . No , I don 't have a set routine . On the contrary , I 'm a bit of a chameleon , you know ? I adapt . Hahn ? Hello . Whiskey ? Whiskey ... Hi ... milk , anything at all . Angry ? - Pardon ? - You angry ? Two whiskeys . I 'm not angry , I 'm ... - Heard you hit a glitch . - I did . Strange , I always thought switching minds was a utopian joke . - A joke ? - A very sophisticated one , but ... It 's not a joke . You seem pretty upset about it . Not about that . Come on , out with it . What 's eating you ? I know why Vollmer died . High voltage . Right , high voltage . Tell me . He couldn 't take it . 800 volts , you mean ? Sorry , bad joke . - Why didn 't I think of it ? - What ? The people in our simulation model think their world is the only real one . So ? Who says this isn 't also a computer ? You , me , all of us ... Just electronic circuits . Identity unit 3 , 124,000 , named Hahn . How does that sound ? Drunk . The whiskey , peanuts ... all artificial . Why are you gobbling them down ? Nervous ? No , I was thinking they taste good , for artificial peanuts . Don 't joke about it . You must have a screw loose . Yeah , an artificial screw . I bet Vollmer panicked . - Vollmer , why ? - Because he knew . Knew what ? That this isn 't the real world . I mean , he was convinced of it . And , if he was right , then they 'd ... Yes , they . They 'd have simply deleted him . Exit Vollmer . How did we deprogram Nobody ? Who ? Christopher Nobody . His name was a joke . Well , how ? By pressing a button . Yes , but discretely . Do you understand ? It has to look like an accident so the other units don 't suspect . Like Vollmer . The system remains stable . Do you see the parallel ? I see you 're drunk . And Lause ? Who ? Oh , yeah . Lause was removed from the system too quickly for them to have time to think up a plausible excuse . So they deleted him from people 's minds . No one remembers Günther Lause . - Who ? - You see ? How it works . God ! I was taken in . Want me to drive you home ? You need to rest . The contact unit ! That 's it ! The contact unit . We needed a contact unit for our simulation model to work . Einstein . If we 're the simulation model of a real world there must be an Einstein here who knows ... who 's in contact with above . Help me find him , Hahn ! You can always count on me . It could be anyone , Siskins , Gloria Fromm Eva Vollmer , Walfang , even you , Hahn . Me ? Even you . Why not you ? Why not me ? Well ... It 's true , I wouldn 't just admit it . You 'd have to corner me , trip me up . OK , fine . Besides , there 's proof . - People keep disappearing . - Who else ? First , Lause . - Now Maja Schmidt-Gentner . - Who ? - My secretary . - Gloria ? No , before her . Oh , her . On leave , supposedly . But no one would go away leaving their flat like that . Yes , but ... Come , I 'll show you ! If you insist . The tab ! I don 't know , everything looks normal to me . But two hours ago , it was completely different . Everything was ... The bed ... the bathroom . You ? I think he 's gone crazy . When did you get back ? An hour ago . The janitor ... Oh , forget it . Come here ... When do you say the story appeared ? May 31 . On May 30 the world ends . Uschi ! Bring me May . Right away . How 's the computer ? OK . And Siskins ? Fine , thanks . Still pals with Hartmann ? Maybe . Why not ? There are stranger reasons to be friends . Yeah , I guess . Look , I 'm doing you a favour . You could give me some information . I 'm lousy at making deals . Does United Steel have a deal with IKZ ? Thank you . I think so . But I can 't provide photocopies , if that 's what you mean . The official simulation program must contain projections that would be very useful to United Steel . I guess so . May 31 . It 's a new article . Let me see . " CS " ... Christoph Simon , our correspondent in Rome . Could it have been another day ? No . Here , ladies and gentlemen , you see our reporters . It 's they who write the stories . They start with news leads the yeast for any article - then add background information to write their stories . The copy , once it 's finished is sent for typesetting , as you 'll now see . Thank you , and good-bye . Tell me ... Was there another edition on May 31 ? They 're both there . If the existing forecasts don 't meet Hartmann 's needs , could they program others in ? Yes , if they wanted to . It was on this page . But here 's CS 's article again . Do they want to ? They , perhaps . Me , no . " Vanished into Thin Air " , I remember it perfectly . " Vanished " ... No idea . " Drug Ring Broken up in Rimini " . Not as punchy , but there it is , black on white . I don 't get it . - This guy ... - Christoph Simon ? Yeah . Couldn 't you check with him to see if he actually wrote this article ? Come on , I 'll look like a fool . Alright , if it helps clear this up . Please ! Cable Christoph Simon in Rome about his May 31 article . Ask if there are any developments . I 'll see you out . So this steel analysis ? - I forget . - Forget ? Alright . Simulacron forecasts transportation needs through the year 2000 . That could be quite important for a steel conglomerate . Well , that 's something . Not Chinese . - Why not ? - I dunno , it 's too sweet . No , it 's not . It can be spicy , too . That Stiller is definitely screwy . I sent off your cable . What ? I just said that to humour him . It doesn 't matter . Uschi , get me a book on forecasting transportation needs . You 've been looking at me so strangely . Is something wrong ? I don 't know . A headache . Then go lie down . I don 't feel bad , I just have a headache . Maybe I 'm just going crazy . Employees are continuing to work to rule to back up demands for a wage increase The Daily News quotes a reliable source that the CEO of the prominent Cybernetics / nstitute Herbert Siskins maintains close ties to a certain steel conglomerate The paper has expressed suspicions that Simulacron 1 the simulation computer developed by / KZ is being used for not only scientific but also commercial purposes The News writes " The computer 's revolutionary findings must remain in the hands of responsible individuals to ensure they are applied for the good of society " End of quote The Science Ministry has named a commission to investigate And Siskins ? Herbert Siskins has vigorously denied the allegations and initiated legal action against the paper And now in brief Helsinki The Finnish poetess Araba Suukoonen distinguished for her translation of the Nibelungenlied died yesterday at the age of 86 when her small private plane collided with a glider at an airport near Helsinki The glider pilot suffered minor injuries This brings an end to our broadcast schedule We wish you good night Good night . Siskins ... or not Siskins . Holm or ... Pardon ? I only said good night to the announcer . It 's Stiller , give me Siskins . Hello , this is Stiller . Feel like visiting the computer room ? I have a surprise for you . Come in . What 's up ? What 's this ? It 's you . I programmed it myself . Interesting , isn 't it ? Yes , indeed . Very interesting . It 's funny . You find it funny ? How many Siskins are there ? I have no idea . Have you programmed others ? It 's the only one in that world . You 're the only one here . And above ? Where , above ? Don 't you know " up " ? You 're talking nonsense . This is above , and that 's below . Or , how much deeper does it go ? Infinitely , maybe . Yes , quite true . And infinitely higher . That 's very funny . What 's he doing now ? Very impressive , Mr. Siskins . Isn 't it ? I began to carry out my scheme Jessie 's eyes gleamed of love And she whispered Maybe Hey maybe the sofa 's wide enough for three ! Nice setup , Mark . Really nice . What do you mean , nice ? Like the entire world . It 's nice , isn 't it ? Quit playing around . What do you want ? I know , Mark . You can stop pretending . What do you know ? That you 're the contact . You found out ? So what ? I just wanted to tell you , Stiller knows . - Put him on - Sure . It 's him . But Stiller it was clear from the start What was clear ? That Holm was to be Hartmann 's contact The decision was mine Mine alone Hartmann 's contact ? Oh , God ! What was that ? He seems pretty screwy , our Fred . He just walked out . I think we can proceed . Yes I agree Hey , you ? Are you OK ? Is he dead ? No , not exactly . Hey , wake up ! Right , he 's not dead . Thanks , I 'm OK . Mr. Siskins ordered me to take you home and look after you . Come along . Go back to work , it 's over . Wake up . Breakfast 's ready . That 's right , you 're still here . They 're Mr. Siskins ' orders . They are . Well , then ... Got a cigarette ? Thanks . I think ... therefore I am . Right ? Yes , I exist . I can 't be alone in thinking that nothing really exists . Right . For Plato , reality exists in the realm of ideas . And Aristotle ! He conceived of matter as passive non-substance that only becomes reality by thought . Got a friend ? What ? Of course . Good . Let 's suppose he disappears without a trace . He 's standing next to you , and suddenly he 's gone . But that 's ... We 're just supposing . So , you inform the police . Next day , the papers run a story on it . Suddenly everyone maintains this friend never existed . So they maintain . What would you tell them ? Me ? I 'd tell them they 're crazy . After all , even the police ... The police also say they never heard of him . But it was in the papers . According to you . It 's not there anymore . There 's something different . I see . You realize that I 've given you a hot tip how to get yourself declared crazy . In case you ever need it . More coffee ? No , thanks . I 'll take a shower . I 'm sure you all know the reason we 're here . Of course , we ... The story in the News took us all by surprise , aroused our concern . Mr. Siskins , I 'd like to hear you answer the charges . Certainly , Mr. Secretary of State . To my regret , I must acknowledge that Simulacron 1 has been the object of misuse . Mr. Holm will report on the situation . Excuse me ... but who is Mr. Holm ? Mr. Holm is assistant to Mr. Stiller , our director . I see . So , well ... during an inspection we discovered that a program completely unrelated to our research had been loaded into Simulacron . And for what purpose ? That 's hard to say . The answers obtained by this new program are meaningful only if one knows the questions . I see , and ... And the questions are known only to the programmer . Who is ? We 're not absolutely sure yet . But we have suspects in mind . And they are ? Mr. Holm , please . Naturally , I can only report on things that I 've seen for myself . Draw your own conclusions . Lately I 've been doing a lot of testing at night and Dr. Stiller has always been at the computer . Dr. Stiller ? Several times he 's thrown me out saying he wanted to be alone . I asked what he was doing . He said , " None of your business . " I 'm sure he 'll deny it all . Dr. Stiller ? What do you have to say to these accusations ? Which ones ? That you were alone at the computer , and threw Holm out . If he says so , it must be true . I can 't stand him . Yes or no ... Did you use the computer for unauthorized purposes ? What if I did ? What would it matter ? Unheard of ! Yes , unheard of ! I hear ... you . I hear . He 's ... Crazy . Yes , he is . Is he ? Stop ! Your cigarette ... Are you sure that 's a cigarette ? It 's ... The idea of a cigarette . You see ? The real cigarettes are somewhere else . Where real people sit on real chairs . Is that a chair ? Say , " It 's a chair . " - It 's a chair . - It 's not a chair . It 's ... the idea of an idea of an idea ... - The man is ... - Crazy . We agreed on the term long ago . What colour 's your coffee ? It 's brown . Why is it brown ? Because coffee 's brown . Isn 't it ? Of course . Your coffee 's not brown because coffee is brown . But rather because somewhere outside this box there 's real coffee that may be brown . But it may be purple , too and some idiot made this stuff brown to laugh at us drinking brown coffee . You 're not a human , sir ... Stop it . You 're nothing . There 's the rub . Because nothing doesn 't think it 's secretary of state . That 's it . Do you remember ... who was it ? Professor Vollmer , right . A similar situation . Still ... Excuse me , but ... I 'm the psychologist at the Institute . I 've been observing Stiller for some time very closely . He 's suffering from a case of acute paranoia . He 's an extreme example of psychological degeneration . He is , in so many words , not responsible for his actions . I recommend he be put on leave immediately . For treatment ... I mean I 'm certain he 'll return to normal one day , perhaps . Thank you , Hahn . Thanks so much . I think that would eliminate the problem , gentlemen . Yes , indeed . If Stiller ... So he 's not responsible , Hirse ? No , definitely not . For now I recommend Mr. Holm assume Stiller 's responsibilities . As you like . You 're still free to make personnel decisions . Thank you , gentlemen . I 'd be grateful if you 'd prepare a clarification for the press . Of course . Still , the parallel to ... Professor Vollmer is quite baffling . And now ? Nothing , I 'm on leave . That 's terrific . There 's no one in Holm 's way . So what ? " So what " ? You used to care about what happened to the computer . That was then , this is now . I can 't figure you out . Tell me ... What are the limits to the perceptive faculties of our identity units ? Listen , suppose we were beings who had been programmed in a computer . We 'd sit here , drinking whiskey . We 'd perceive what is in fact our imaginary world as if it were the real one . Of course . An electronically simulated environment would appear real to an electronic being . Good . And can glitches occur ? It 's possible , but not very . And what would a glitch be like ? A glitch ? Here 's a simple example : You 're driving down a street that suddenly ends because it hasn 't been fully programmed . But after a few seconds the artificial being would see a completed street because the correcting software had kicked in . It 's obvious : What can 't exist , doesn 't . Did you read my headline ? " Director Suffers Nervous Breakdown " - I don 't like it . - Why not ? It 's too simple . Stories written by life are never simple . No ? But truth is stranger than fiction . Either way . Two sides of the same coin . You read it ? What ? The cable from Simon in Rome . No , what 's he say ? " Never wrote about drugs in Rimini . Besides , was sick at the time . " That 's impossible . That 's not all . Naturally I asked what 's in his edition of May 31 . - Want to see ? - Give it to me . " Mine reads 'Vanished into Thin Air ' . Hope that helps . Christoph Simon . " I must be going crazy . I can 't help think that Stiller 's caught up in a massive intrigue . Siskins must be a bigger gangster than I thought . I brought your things . That 's very kind . Fred , I 'm so sorry . About what ? Your sick leave . Especially since I 'm partly to blame . What do you mean ? I 've been spying for Siskins . I was obliged to tell him all you said that night and everything else . Of course . I 've known that for a long time . But ? But I still like you . Me , too . Whiskey ? Yes , please . Does he pay you , or ? Or what ? Do you love him ? Both . At least you 're honest . You 're my type of man , well almost . You 're exactly my type of woman . Siskins is exactly my type of man . I can 't bring myself to leave him . Do you want to ? I don 't know . Probably not . I don 't know if I could . You can if you want . That 's a fairy tale . Right . I 'm one of his puppets . But what 's even worse is ... I love it . At least at night . Want to sleep with me ? How 's it going ? We 're running the analysis . I hope you can interpret the data . No need to insult me . I don 't want our friend Hartmann to make a bad investment . I told you , you 're not wanted here . Beat it ! This department is still my responsibility , Mr. Holm . Don 't be impertinent . I 'm not being impertinent . Not at all . I 'm merely doing my job . We 'll decide what your job is , my good man . You 're mistaken there , my good man . My contract contains a precise job description . Contracts can be terminated . Or broken , like Dr. Stiller 's . What 's he got to do with it ? Quite a bit , doesn 't it ? - Does who ? - What ? What , what ? Besides , Stiller 's on leave . I see . That 's something else entirely . What you did to him 's scandalous ... Watch it ! Both of you . But personally I 'm curious why you 're so intent on keeping me out of here . Because you 're incompetent , that 's why . That 's the only reason . And now , please , we 're busy . OK , my good man . But you 'll hear from me . Good-bye , Mr. Siskins . He 's next . You should watch what you say . Why ? There are employee committees , unions . Don 't forget that . Alright , I 'll do my best . I hope so . Finally ! Make sure he doesn 't stir up trouble . - Yes , sir . - Of course , Mr. Holm . Tell me , Holm . What about Stiller ? If everything went according to plan , he 's in a straightjacket right now . My head ! Yes , it 's me . What time is it ? 330 . Morning or afternoon ? Afternoon . Then we slept for 18 hours . You slept for 18 hours . I 'll see who the idiot is . Great . Siskins ' latest trick . - What ? - Have a look . Hurry , you must get away . I don 't care . They 'll put you in a straightjacket ! Maybe I belong in one . Stop joking . Hurry up ! Take the fire escape . What can I do for you ? The madman . Which madman ? What do you mean ? Stiller . He lives here . You mean Freddy ? Yes , he is crazy ... in bed , if you get my drift . In bed ? Crazy . Definitely . Let us by . Or else ... Alright , if you insist . Eva ! Open up police ! We know you 're inside Stiller don 't make it any harder We 'll break down the door Get in , you can 't escape . I 'll take you to a room here . No one will find you . Thank you . My God ! You ? Yes , me . What 's wrong ? Don 't you get it ? It 's him ! The contact unit . Of course , him ! What an idiot I am ! I fell for it ! But Stiller ... Hahn 's been providing us information on IKZ for months . What 's the problem ? Information ? Yes . On Siskins and the computer . Then ... Still suffering from your delusions ? Delusions ? Listen , Hahn . I like Vollmer 's delusions more and more . Yeah , I know what you 'll say ... A madman finds proof everywhere . Maybe I am crazy after all . But ... Vollmer died for a reason . If he was right , God , or someone , help us ! By the way , I got an answer from Italy . You got ... What did it say ? You were right . I was right . Simon never wrote the article on the Rimini bust . In his edition , the headline is " Vanished into Thin Air " . What ? It 's troubling but we 'll figure it out , don 't worry . When is the strike ? What strike ? The strike at IKZ . You said ... Oh , that . I don 't know . Tomorrow or ... What 's wrong ? Don 't you feel well ? Sure , I 'm fine . For now . What strike ? A certain Fritz Walfang has been organizing the workers . To have you reinstated . Reinstated ? It 's great : Worker initiative , solidarity . You should be proud . None of it matters anymore . You 're right , Hahn . His nerves are completely shot . Günther Lause ? Chief of security at IKZ ? Siskins ' party . Say something ! Like what ? - We can 't both be ... - Crazy ? Why not ? You 're the expert . Where are you going ? - I 'm just going . - You can 't go . Why not ? Every cop is carrying your picture . Tell me ... the story about your so-called contact unit ... I just meant ... I want to find out who 's crazy ... us , or everyone else . Well now , that 's what I call a noble motive . Come with me , I 'll smuggle you out . Your only chance . It 's not Siskins , Holms , Gloria Fromm or Walfang ... It can 't be Rupp or you or me or Eva ... That 's ridiculous . Eva Vollmer ... Stop at that pay phone . My God , where were you ? I slept at your place , I climbed in through a window . No , but I was worried . OK , fine . Could I see you , right now ? Anywhere . No , nothing urgent . My God , I just want to see you . I need you . I 'm not tense , I 'm ... Can you hear me ? That 's Stiller , the murderer . The murderer 's getting away ! Murderer ! Are you sick ? No , it 's nothing . I 'm fine . Today we 're going marching to the sound of a new beat . / n the lovely Westerwald forest the wind blows so cold / n the lovely Westerwald the wind blows so cold Oh you lovely Westerwald ! Eucalyptus cough drops The wind blows so cold over the hill Yes , sir ? Roast filet of wild boar and some Gewürztraminer . Very good . Excellent . Halt ! Left face ! Halt ! Right face ! Fire ! Oh you lovely Westerwald Eucalyptus cough drops The wind blows so cold over the hill but the weakest ray of sunshine penetrates deep into our hearts I 'm a public safety inspector . I 'm here to check the exits . Sent it back ! Barbarians ! Where does this door lead ? - The garbage cans . - I 'll have a look . Were killed The highway between Essen and Bochum was closed The police have launched a manhunt for 36-year-old Fred Stiller a former employee of the Cybernetics / nstitute Stiller is a suspect in the murder of Henri Vollmer the former technical director at / KZ and that of Franz Hahn a colleague of Stiller 's at / KZ who died today in mysterious circumstances Stiller is described as unstable and dangerous People are warned to avoid contact with the fugitive and to inform the police of any information regarding his whereabouts Franz Hahn . A man who knew too much . My God , are you hurt ? Say something , please . What 's going on ? Someone fired a shot . I fired , because ... I was afraid . Why are you here ? I heard you 're wanted for my father 's death . I just don 't believe it . I thought you needed me , I wanted to be with you . - You can 't stay here . - But ... No buts ! I didn 't murder anyone . It 's all a plot by Siskins and the police . All I can do now is defend myself ... by any means . No one believes me . I believe you . And I love you . Go now . When I know more , I 'll come into town or I 'll call . I 'm scared for you . Go now , Eva . You must go . Believe me . How did she know I was here ? I never told her about my cabin Then it 's her And I 'm nothing Why are you here ? Aren 't you afraid ? I 'm a murderer . Do you hear ? A murderer ! Tell me ... - What was your name ? - Echo . An unusual name . Not in my family . Perhaps I should take you to a hospital . No , I 'm fine . It was just the car . Please don 't smoke monsieur ? Echo . Mr. Echo . I 'm extremely allergic to nicotine . The other day I saw a fantastic accident . Simply awful . A lamppost went right through a car and the driver ... Stop ! I feel sick . I 'll throw up . Mon dieu , please , not on the seats . The leather ... Stop , the man wants to get out . I wouldn 't try to run away . Sorry , darling , but I don 't want you to escape from me . Naturally . But you must have more subtle methods ... you people up there . Up there , yes , but not down here . You understand a lot , Fred Stiller . You 've become a bit too intelligent for us . Are you the contact unit ... as we call it ? I 'm the projection of a real Eva from the real world . We don 't have contact units anymore . They were a mistake , we got rid of them . And now you 'll get rid of me . Like a caged rat after your experiment . I want to help you , believe me . Please come with me . Don 't cause trouble . Please . I don 't give a damn . Do what you want with me . I give up . Deprogram me , kill me , anything . I just want it to end ... this horrible nightmare . You can trust me , Fred . Here . There 's a lot I have to explain . You can do anything you want with me . Even so , listen ... There never was an Eva Vollmer in your world . When I appeared , you quickly threw together a memory . That 's how simulation units react . I know how simulation units react . We shouldn 't have let you develop your own simulation model . It 's easy to learn too much . But we needed the closest possible resemblance to our own technological standard . Got any cigarettes ? And Vollmer ? At first we found it interesting and wanted to observe what happened . Of course he became a threat to the entire system so he had to have an accident . Right ? There was a decision to send an observer down here . That 's me . I was periodically called back to report . That 's why you were gone that night . I understand . And Lause ? He knew all about Vollmer . We programmed him away because he was going to tell you . I love you , Fred . I want to stay with you . We have to find a solution . We ? What 's it got to do with you ? I love you . OK , fine . They have to delete you . You could cause your world to be deleted . They 'll pull the plug and it 'll be over . The man in my world who 's sitting at the computer is a total megalomaniac . His power over this artificial world drove him crazy . He thinks he 's God , he 's playing his games with you . You , for example ... He didn 't want to kill you right away . On the contrary . He got enormous pleasure from your fear and your despair . What will he do to me ? You 'll be shot . When ? Tomorrow morning . - So we still have some time . - Yes . At night , there 's only technical supervision of the computer . Like a drink ? Yes , a whiskey . Tell me ... Why should I trust you ? I want to help you . Well , we 'll see . Cheers . What happened to Hahn ? You saw . We had to , after that screw-up at the paper . - Imagine what would 've ... - Bravo . Good work . My attacks , all my dizzy spells ? You get them when he tries to hook-up with your mind . And the street that vanished and reappeared ? A faulty circuit , nothing more . Something doesn 't add up . Why ? How can a real person love someone who 's not ? Very simple . Because you remind me of someone I loved , up there . Who was he ? He 's ... You 'd call him technical director , responsible for our simulation model . Tell me , what 's his name ? Fred Stiller . That 's me . No . But you just said ... Like Vollmer did with Lause , and you with Siskins . He programmed a copy of himself for the fun of it . Do I resemble him ? In appearance , yes . But not in character . Fred is a megalomaniac and you are you . I love you . I love you , too . Come here , please . Why are you getting dressed ? I have another headache . But this time it 's worse . Where are you going ? I don 't know . The Institute , probably . No , Fred . Please stay ! Let me help you . Since Holm 's been here everything 's upside down We can 't go near the computer For that reason alone I urge you to join in the strike so Stiller will be reinstated But he 's a murderer ! A madman ! He lined his own pockets ! Murderer ! Murderer ! Quiet down please Just for one second Stiller was set up Set up by Siskins and Holm Friends , listen to me ! I am Fred Stiller . What Fritz Walfang just told you is true . Friends , listen to me , please ! It 's true , what he just said . It 's true ! I switched your mind as you lay dying down there .

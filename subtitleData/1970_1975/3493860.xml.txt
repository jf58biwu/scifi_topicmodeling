AFTER DELIBERATING IN CONTINUOUS SESSION FOR THE LAST FOUR MONTHS IN UNCEASING EFFORTS TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE DEVASTATING PROBLEM OF OVERPOPULATION THREATENING TO DESTROY WHAT REMAINS OF OUR PLANET , THE WORLD FEDERATION COUNCIL HAS CONSIDERED AND REJECTED ALL HALF-WAY MEASURES ADVANCED BY THE VARIOUS REGIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONGRESSES .

ALTHOUGH WE KNOW YOU WILL FIND ALL OF THE EXHIBITS FASCINATING , MAY WE REQUEST THAT YOU MAKE YOUR THREE SELECTIONS AT THE CENTRAL DESK AND KEEP MOVING . OTHERS ARE WAITING IN LINE TO SHARE YOUR HAPPIEST BLISS . THE FLORA AND FAUNA ON SHOW HERE ARE EITHER THE RESULT OF A CEASELESS SEARCH ON YOUR BEHALF OR HAVE BEEN ARTIFICIALLY CULTIVATED ON THE PREMISES BY MEMBERS OF OUR LABORATORY STAFF . ALMOST ALL OF THE SPECIES HAVE BEEN EXTINCT SINCE THE END OF THE 20th CENTURY . MANY OF THE FASCINATING REPLICAS OF MARINE AND ANIMAL LIFE MAY APPEAR FRIGHTENING TO CHILDREN , BUT WE ASSURE EACH PARENT THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR ALARM . IN FACT , MANY OF THESE ANIMALS , ALTHOUGH TOTALLY UNPRODUCTIVE , WERE KEPT AS DOMESTIC PETS AND BOUGHT AS PLAYMATES FOR 20th CENTURY CHILDREN . THESE ANIMALS CONTRIBUTED NOTHING , WERE NOT A SOURCE OF FOOD . OUR MUSEUM HOUSES THE LARGEST SELECTION OF FLOWERS ON THIS CONTINENT . THESE AESTHETIC OBJECTS HAVE BEEN HYDROPONICALLY CULTIVATED , AND HENCE IT ' ' ' S BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO RECREATE THEIR FORMER AROMATIC PROPERTIES . THESE FLOWERS , PLEASING TO THE EYE AS THEY ARE ... GET OUT OF THERE . COME ON . GET OUT OF THERE . I AM NOW GOING TO TAKE THIS GASOLINE PUMP AND POUR GASOLINE INTO THIS CAR , WHICH IS ALSO FROM THE 1970s , AND THAT ' ' ' S ALL THERE WAS TO IT . SWEET SUBSTANCES CAUSED GRAVE DISORDERS OF THE TEETH , AND REMEDIAL SURGERY HAD TO BE CONDUCTED WITH PRIMITIVE INSTRUMENTS . THESE SURGEONS WERE CALLED DENTISTS . HOWEVER , THE TRUE CAUSE OF OUR PRESENT ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS WAS THE UNREALISTIC AND INEPT POLICIES OF THE LEADERS OF INDUSTRY . THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY THEM WERE FURTHER PERPETUATED BY THE POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS WHO IRRESPONSIBILITY ALLOWED THE EQUALLY DEVASTATING CRIME OF OVERPOPULATION . [ TRUMPET SOUNDING ] TIME--THE TIME IS 13 : 55 . WILL ALL MUSEUM OFFICIALS REPORT TO THEIR DESIGNATED POSTS . [ TRUMPET SOUNDS ] AND HUMANITY SUFFERED THE GREAT FAMINE AND THE SMOG BLANKET AGE . OUTSIDE AND TO THE REAR OF THE MUSEUM YOU MAY VISIT OUR 20th CENTURY LIFE EXHIBITION . THIS IS COMPRISED OF A STREET OF SEVEN HOUSES , ANY ONE OF WHICH IS A PERFECT REPLICA OF THE DOMICILE OF THE 20th CENTURY FAMILY . EACH HOME IS FULLY EQUIPPED WITH ALL THE HOUSEHOLD GADGETS WHICH HAVE BEEN OBSOLETE ... [ ZAP ] WHO ' ' ' S WITH WHO TONIGHT ?

FOR SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST , MAN MUST BE FIT TO SURVIVE . THE COUNCIL FOR CULTURAL EDUCATION IS PRESENTING THE METROPOLIS ... . [ WOMAN ] IRRESPECTIVE OF NUTRITIVE VALUE , FOOD WAS ABSORBED IN HUGE QUANTITIES . SPECIFIC TIMES OF THE DAY WERE SET ASIDE FOR THE INTAKE OF THIS FOOD , AND THE REPLENISHMENT OF CORPORAL ENERGY WAS SOMETIMES TURNED INTO A SOCIAL EVENT . THESE EVENTS WERE EVEN CONDUCTED OUT OF DOORS WITHOUT ANY PRECAUTIONS TAKEN TO SHIELD THEIR ACTIVITIES . ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS RIDICULOUS TO US , PROVIDED AS WE ARE BY THE SOCIETY WITH A CALORICALLY CALCULATED BALANCED DIET , THESE PEOPLE WERE ALMOST CRIMINALLY ADDICTED TO FOOD . THESE 20th-CENTURY SPECIMENS TOOK FOOD FOR GRANTED AND ATE INDISCRIMINATELY , ALTHOUGH DURING THOSE TIMES , HALF THE WORLD POPULATION WAS UNDERFED . IT APPEARS BARBAROUS TO US , BUT UNTIL THE END OF THE 20th CENTURY , FOOD WAS SERVED ON OPEN PLATES . MEAT WAS ALLOWED , EVEN ENCOURAGED , TO BE HUNG UNTIL IT BEGAN TO ROT . MAKES YOU SHUDDER , DOESN ' ' ' T IT ? CHEESE WAS NOT CONSIDERED A GREAT DELICACY UNLESS A CRUST OF MOLD HAD FORMED AROUND IT . NOT UNEXPECTEDLY , THESE EATING HABITS CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO THE GENERAL DEGENERACY OF 20th-CENTURY MAN . HIS HEALTH WAS POOR- - DISORDERS OF THE STOMACH , AND CAN YOU WONDER AT IT ? OBESITY , CARDIAC STRAIN , THROMBOSIS- - ALL THE CONDITIONS ARRESTED , CORRECTED , AND FINALLY ABOLISHED BY THE SOCIETY ' ' ' S RIGOROUS AND PROTRACTED EFFORTS ON YOUR BEHALF . IF THESE PEOPLE SEEM HAPPY TO YOU , IT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE THEY CONSIDERED IGNORANCE TO BE BLISS . THEY ALLOWED THEIR ADDICTION EVERY LICENSE , SWALLOWED POISONS WITHOUT A CARE FOR THE MORROW OR THEIR FELLOW MAN . INITIATES OF THIS EATING CULT MADE GREAT PLAY OF THE TRAPPINGS YOU HAVE JUST SEEN . PLATES WERE DECORATED , PAINTED , AND SOMETIMES GILDED . EATING UTENSILS WERE OFTEN OF SILVER AND USED TIME AND AGAIN WITHOUT THE STERILIZATION WHICH YOU TAKE FOR GRANTED NOW .

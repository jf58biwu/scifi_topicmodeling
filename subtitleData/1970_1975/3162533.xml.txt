 This way ! Split ! Get him ! Get him ! Go ! Tie him up . You two , ride to the nearest village . Tell them Virdon and Galen got away , and tell their police to find them . Move ! This one we 'll take to Central City . You see how explicit it is ? How detailed . Yes . Come in . - Zaius ! Have you heard the news ? - Burke has been captured . - Yes . Just as I told you they 'd be . - And what about the other two ? They 're going to try to rescue Burke and will fall right into our trap . - We 're waiting for them . - Let us hope so . This capture of Burke could not have come at a more opportune time . - We have an experiment . - Experiment ? Why must we always make a simple problem so complicated ? It is not necessary to experiment . Zaius , all our troubles stem from the two astronauts and Galen . Once they are destroyed , our problems are over . The planet can return to normal . Can you guarantee there won 't be any Burkes or Virdons in the future ? Can you guarantee that next time there won 't be five or 10 instead of two humans landing here , perhaps in different parts of our land ? No more than you can guarantee there will be others . The prudent ape is prepared for the worst . Therefore , it is extremely important for us to determine once and for all why these two humans are different from the ones here now . I can almost promise I 'll get the answers . - Who is that ? - That is Wanda . - Wanda . - Wanda ? One of our most brilliant young scientists . She 's made a remarkable find , most valuable . This book , you see , this book was written in 1986 and was found in one of those time capsules so popular then . - What has that got to do with Burke ? - This book is a book on brainwashing . - Brainwashing ? - The psychological method of washing out of the human brain old ideas and replacing them with new ones . That 's what we 're going to do with Burke . Yes , I seem to remember hearing something about that . Isn 't that where you take the brain out and wash it with cool water ? No , you don 't take the brain out of the skull . How can you wash it if you don 't take it out ? Yes . I have looked over the book , and Wanda has explained the rest . The council backs her , and she will interrogate Burke with this procedure . No , Zaius , all interrogation must be under my supervision . That 's the law . You may supervise , but Wanda is to control the experiment . Why must we go to all this trouble ? Just let my surgeons perform the usual brain operation on the humans . The hole in the skull and the removal of the front bump ? - Yes , that 's right , exactly . - But ... Then the patient will be docile and cooperative . He will tell us what we want and answer all our questions . - Lf he doesn 't die . - Or become a vegetable . - Burke will be no more trouble to us . - What you suggest is our last resort . In the meantime , Wanda will proceed . And since this process is new to us , there is to be no public discussion . Only the three of us and your most trusted guards will know about it . Oh , Alan , I can 't . I can 't . We 've got to . Central City is 19 hours away . Can you run all that distance ? Galen , by now , Pete must be in Urko 's hands . We will be too if we keep running blindly . They 're expecting us . They 'll be setting traps . - I know that . We avoid them . - Stay off the main roads ? Lt 'd take us two days to get there . We go the shortest , fastest way , whatever that is . Burke ? My name is Wanda . I am your interrogator . This interrogation can be pleasant or unpleasant . It is up to you . - Well ? - Well , pleasant is better . We 're going to get along just fine . Good . Good . Sit down , sit down . Now , I want you to answer my question . The first one : Which humans on this planet have helped you ? Almost all of them , and many apes . You 're not taking this interrogation seriously . Let me warn you . It 's important that you cooperate with me . If I fail , you fail . Totally . - You die , or you become a vegetable . - I answered your question . You did not . I want names , places , times ! Well , I 'm sorry , I can 't remember that . Forget counting on your friends ! They 'll never find this place . No one knows of it , except Zaius , Urko , myself and a handful of guards . There is no possibility of escape . Or rescue . I will ask a question . You will answer it fully , honestly . Then you will be allowed to go . Which humans have helped you ? Say , that 's a really lovely ring you have there on your tapping finger . You have a contempt for apes . You 'll change your mind before you 're finished . I have no contempt for apes . Nor for any thinking animal on this planet . Then be sensible , be sensible . Answer my question . Which humans have helped you ? Whoa ! Move and I 'll shoot ! - I won 't move . - Turn around slow . Put your hands behind you . Okay , now walk . Which humans have helped you ? I want to know how you got their names , where and when you made contact ? Simple question . Your mouth 's moving , but I can 't hear you . Those bells and drums are too loud . They 're deafening . If they 're too loud after four hours , think how they 'll sound after eight . - What ? Will you talk louder ? - After 24 hours . Lieutenant . Shoot ! Hold it . Hold it . - You gotta be kidding . - I 'm quite capable of it , Burke . Obviously you can hear , when it suits you . Look , there isn 't any list of humans to contact . We never expected to land here , and we don 't exactly want to be here . - We just want to get out of here . - First , you have to get out of prison . I want the names of the humans that have helped you . No , look , I ... Names , places , times ! I can 't answer that ! They were just people ! Every entrance covered ? Nothing will get into the city without being stopped by our guards . Orders issued to stop and search carefully every cart and wagon driven by ape or human ! - Yes , Urko . Now , inside the city I want everyone available on patrol . Mounted units sweep the streets . - Individual troops on every corner . - It will be done . Good . Good . This time we 'll catch Galen . Stand straight ! This way . Once you have answered my questions you can get some much needed sleep , food , rest . I 've been telling you the truth . I will make it easy for you . - Which apes befriended you ? - There have been many apes who ... - The truth ! - That is the truth . It is not ! There is only one ape that befriended you and that is Galen . - There were others . - Only Galen . Okay , have it your way . Now , which humans have helped you ? - No humans helped us . - The truth . - I don 't know what you want . - I want their names . I can 't . My mind 's blank . - Lieutenant , you know what to do ? - Yes , Wanda . Let him go . What 's your business here ? My son , he raises hay for the troopers ' horses . Give me that pitchfork . Yes . He usually delivers it , but he has this terrible cold . It was awful . I said , " Now you stay in bed . I 'll deliver that hay myself . " Yes , he 's such a good boy . He likes you gorillas so much . You 're so helpful and kind . Helpful and considerate . All right . Dump your hay and come out . Thank you . Bye . - Galen ! - Mother . Galen , come in . Come in . How are you ? Galen . - It 's so good to see you . - So good to see you . Mother , I would like you to meet my very good friend , Alan Virdon . - How do you do , Virdon . - Fine , thank you . - Have you eaten ? - No . You look so tired . We 'd love something to eat . Where 's Father ? He 's in his study . He has a great deal to do these days . He 's been elected to the council . - Now sit down . I 'll get your father . - All right . Your mother seems very nice , Galen . Yes . You may need to find another word to describe my father . Father . Father , this ... We need your help . Our friend , Peter Burke , has been taken prisoner . He 's a human . I 'm an ape . He 's my enemy . He is not an enemy . He is my friend . You will be helping me . Then it 's between you and Burke . I 'll give you shelter , but I won 't help you . I 'll send a servant to the roof as a lookout . If you wish to see me , I 'll be in the garden . Just you , son . All right , now tell me one more time . What happened ? The abandoned hay cart was driven through a checkpoint by a female chimp . She said she was delivering hay for patrol horses . And this female , where is she ? Have you located her ? No . I know the situation was suspicious , but she was alone . There was no sign of the fugitives on the cart . Well , what did you expect them to do ? Stand up and wave at you ? Get three troopers . Ride to Councilor Yalu 's home . Search it from one end to the other . If he tries to stop you , go ahead ! - Tell him those are my orders ! - Yes , Urko . Apparently it doesn 't matter to you that your mother worries . Of course it matters . Then why aren 't you home instead of running like a hunted human ? It 's not my fault that I 'm hunted . My friends are willing to live in peace . So am I. You are an ape . They are humans . Strange friends for a chimpanzee . Not if you know them . You 'd respect them too , if it weren 't for your stupid prejudices . I am older than you . Perhaps those so-called prejudices are based on reason . No , they are not ! They are based on custom and on habit . And you know it ! Even if I agreed with you , and I don 't do you think you can change the whole world ? I 'd like to . We didn 't come to visit . We came to get Burke . Only a few more minutes . My husband is not entirely unreasonable . - Without your help , we 'll ... - I don 't want to know . You can help us get Burke out without compromising yourself ... This conversation is over ! All right , Father . Goodbye . That 's a signal from Loomis . They 're coming . The police are coming ! We 'll leave . We won 't risk your lives . - Is there a back way ? - I 'll hide you . - It 's as bad if you 're found nearby . - Not as bad as being caught here . Must you argue everything ? Help me ! Pick up the rug . I put this in for security purposes . Down you go . Hurry ! Hurry ! All right , now , down ! Hurry ! Down ! Open up ! Police ! Open up ! Police ! - How dare you bang on my door ! - I have orders to search this house . Search this house ? There 's a mistake . I am Council Member Yalu . I 'm sorry . The order was given to me directly by Chief of Security Urko . I demand you stop ! Where is he going ? - To examine the bedroom . - This is an outrage ! I will expect everything to be just as you found it . Think you 're pawing through a junkyard ? - You heard the councilor 's wife . - Thank you , officer . That 's all right . - Have you found what you 're seeking ? - No . Then I suggest you leave . Now ! I apologize for this intrusion . The apology is not sufficient . You may so inform Chief Urko . Have you had enough ? Enough ? Enough ... ? Untie him ! Was one of the humans named Loris ? My name is Burke , Peter J ... Rank , major . - Stand up ! Stand up ! - Number 0047 ... - Haven 't you had enough ? - My name ... - Do you want more ? - Burke , Peter J ... Rank , major . Number 0047366897 . We know the humans that have helped you . - Tie him . - Number 00 47366897 . - Start ! I 've been looking for you . I have this message from Chairman Zaius . Here . You can read it , but it is addressed to the commanding officer of the jail . Is there any question you want me to answer ? Okay . You announce your arrival as you normally would . Come on ! Guard 22 , ready . All right , on the floor . Face down ! No , not out by the door . The wall ! - Pete 's not here . - He must be . Untie him . Where do you come from ? Where do you come from ? Burke , Peter J. Number 004736 ... Stop it ! How dare you interfere ? - I was just trying to help . - The prisoner is disoriented . Now that he is , there are methods which will yield results ! " After a long period of severe interrogation results have been achieved by a feminine presence . " The method is ... Gibberish ! Books ! Books ! There 's only one way to ... Leave him alone ! Zaius will hear of your behavior . Why didn 't you say that Burke isn 't in the jail ? I didn 't know . I have no idea where he 's kept . Only Urko and Zaius know . It 's not like you to doubt your father . If your father says he doesn 't know , he doesn 't know . - Is there another place for prisoners ? - None I know of . - But Urko knows . - And he keeps records . - That 's the place to look . - Right . You 'll never get away with it . Still , we have to look in Urko 's office . " After this period of centrifugal force , the feeling of gravity is lost . His sense of identity has blurred along with that of others . A compassionate woman may be confused with someone he 's loved and by questioning , may obtain information that could not be secured in any other fashion . " Stop the turntable . Untie him . Guards , you may leave . - Wanda , he is a dangerous human . - I can handle him . Go . " I have the feeling that we are strangers . There is so much about you I don 't know . And I always believe that people in love tell each other everything . " Not everything . Hey . You 're quiet today . Maybe I 'm all talked out . No , that 'll never happen . You 're a bubbling spring , inexhaustible . Well , springs can run dry . Our conversations are a one-way street . You never talk about yourself . What do you want to know ? Everything . Where you were born , where you went to school ... - Pretty dull stuff . - Not to me . And ... The first time you fell in love . This is the first time . Now I know you 're copping out . Come on , I wanna know what 's inside there . What you feel . - Well , what do you wanna know ? - Everything . I love you . People in love tell each other everything . Guards ! Lieutenant , is it day or night outside ? The sun is about to rise , Wanda . Inform Chief of Security Urko that the prisoner now belongs to him . " Five special guards sent to the Crystal Cavern . " Crystal Cavern ? Does that mean something ? Why would they send special guards to a cavern outside the city , where nothing valuable is stored ? - That 's it ! - Yes . Guard . Get to Dr. Malthus ' house . Tell him to meet me at the hospital as soon as possible . That 's all . - Any other entrance ? - No . What have they done to him ? That 's a hospital wagon . There 's no way to get to him . Not with that mob around him . - Our only chance is the hospital . - Right . I promise nothing . This operation is still experimental . I can 't guarantee success . - What do you mean by success ? - The patient survives and is docile . - It 's not necessary . - The patient can die . - Or be left with no brain at all . - That 's too bad . - This is the patient ? - Yes . How long before you 'll be ready ? Well , my associates haven 't arrived yet , so nothing 's prepared . Instruments , scrubbing , operating room , nurses . Thirty to 60 minutes . You have 30 minutes . Then begin the operation ! - I 'll be back in time to watch . - Yes , Urko . Thirty minutes . May I ask why you need the carriage ? Well , you see , we have found out that Burke is in the hospital . - They 're going to operate on him . - It 's that operation that Urko favors . The carriage , Galen . Why the carriage ? Mother , if I told you and if Father found out , he would be very angry . Possibily , but you haven 't answered my question . We 'll break in and grab Burke . We 've got no chance against Urko 's patrols ... - Without my carriage . - Right . - Yes . - You have no chance with my carriage . Maybe not . But we 've thought of every possibility , and this is the best . If you fail , Urko will kill you . You realize that ? Yes . Son , do you insist on attempting this impossible rescue ? We have to . Then you leave me no choice . Open my door ! Human , come and help this ape . I can 't allow anyone in . Lieutenant 's orders . I 'm not " anyone . " I 'm Council Member Yalu 's wife . - But only the lieutenant ... - Then get him . - I 'm sorry . The hospital is closed . - I have a badly wounded ape . Leave him . Someone will help him . - Are you a doctor ? - No , no . I 'm a lieutenant . Why am I talking to you ? What doctors are available ? - I don 't know . - Lieutenant . I was on my way to see an ill friend when I came upon this badly wounded ape here apparently the victim of some accident . I went out of my way to bring him here , at personal inconvenience . - I 'm sorry . - In that case , let us proceed . But ... While we 're arguing , this unfortunate victim could die . Do you want that on your record ? - No , no . - Come , human . Doctor , I am Ann , the wife of Councilor Yalu . And I am Doctor Malthus . But you shouldn 't be here . I want you to take care of this wounded ape right away . I have an important surgery in about 10 minutes . Do you mean a human patient is more important to you than an ape ? Urko 's orders . Well , he must be a very special human . He looks ordinary to me . - As if nothing were wrong with him . - Not yet . I insist you find a bed and capable medical care . Very well , Ann . I 'll see what I can do . And you tell Chief Urko I wish to see him right away . Are you frightened of an elderly female and a wounded ape ? Do you believe that an armed police gorilla is no match for a human ? Help ! Help ! Open it ! Break it down ! Get some of your gorillas and cut them off in the other corridor . Hurry ! - Urko ! - Huh ? They have escaped from the hospital ! Follow them ! Mount up ! - I don 't know how you made it in ... - We 're not out of this yet . I assure you it wasn 't Galen . After all , a mother should know her son . And I was told that it was Galen . - You are being insolent . - Not at all . I 'm doing my job . Let me ask a question . If it wasn 't Galen , how do you account for that ape 's actions ? It wasn 't . And I don 't . I was horrified by his actions and ran into the corridor for help . You saw me . - Well , I 'm afraid that doesn 't prove ... - Use your head , Chief Urko . If I have any brains , would I ruin my husband 's career and risk disgrace by helping mere humans ? Of course not ! May I take it that this matter is now closed , Chief Urko ? - Well ... - lf you disbelieve my wife I insist you arrest us immediately . Arrest or total innocence ! One or the other . I am not going to arrest you , Councilor Yalu , or your wife . - But ... - No buts . Produce proof , or shut up . All right . Good luck . Now that it 's all settled , won 't you have something to drink , Chief Urko ? You were magnificent . - Both of you . Father . - I couldn 't let them find you here . Urko didn 't even ask to search the house . He assumes we 're long gone . Perhaps . In any event , I was defending your mother . And very well too . Father , you helped us . Now admit it . And allow me to be grateful . You 're my son . I don 't understand the friendship between you and those humans . But I do understand friendship . And I understand principles . Sometimes I 'm a little slow . Without your mother , I might never have realized the son that we have . I had more contact with Galen and his friend than you had . It 's heartwarming to know our son is not only loving and intelligent but also principled . I 'm proud of you . Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH ]

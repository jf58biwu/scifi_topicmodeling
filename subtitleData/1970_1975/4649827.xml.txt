 - We 've lost it . - Must have ducked under the radar . - I want it found . - We 've done pretty well . We 've destroyed three and two have been shot down . One unlocated UFO is one UFO too many . Find it . - This your car , miss ? - Yes . - Not a very clever way to park . - I don 't remember . - Anyone with you ? - No ! No . Could I see your driver 's licence please , miss ? Reed to control . Red sports , registration B bravo , M Mike , W whisky , 189 . Would you get out the car please , miss ? What ? Why ? Get out of the car , please . I don 't understand . I was just driving home when you stopped . Hey ! That was a stupid thing to try , miss . I think you better give me the keys . Give me the keys , please . Don 't give me a hard time , miss . This is Commander Straker . Is Colonel Lake around ? Well , where is Colonel Foster ? No , no . Don 't bother . Just spread it around I 'm on my way in , will you ? I find it helps efficiency . - What 's the problem ? - Could give me a lift ? - What 's the matter ? - My car . Doesn 't want to start . Well , I ... I live down this road . If you could ... - All right . Jump in . - Thank you very much . - I 'm sorry to trouble you like this . - Forget it . It 's no trouble . - Oh , you 're an American ! - That 's right . Boston . I find most Americans are very mechanically minded . I 'm not , I 'm afraid . Take my car . It 's probably just a lead , or wire , - or something like that . - What 's your line , Mr ... Clark . Daniel Clark . That 's what I am . A bank clerk . I pride myself on being a good judge . I 'd say you were some kind of executive . - Yes . You could say that . - Oil ? Motion pictures . Oh , films . That must be a very exciting life . Anywhere along here will be just fine . I live over there . Just beyond the wood . Well , there we are , Mr Clark . - Thank you very much . - Don 't mention it . No trouble . I ... - appreciate ... - What 's the matter ? What 's wrong ? Commander Straker 's car , sir . - Where ? - Three kilometres from junction 14 . How does it feel ? Like it 's been shaken by an angry orangutan . I 'm afraid you will live , Commander . Thank you very much , Doctor . Ah , Paul . What have we got ? Daniel Frederick Clark . Age 44 , works in a bank , - married with two children . - Nothing else ? No criminal record . Not even a traffic indictment . A solid , law-abiding citizen . A Mr Average . We 'll find out more when we pick him up . Mr Average threw me across the car like a rubber doll . Yes . There are certain psychiatric conditions that can impart tremendous physical strength for brief periods . Tensions , stresses of one kind or another , build up and ... and explode . - Maybe you could take some time off . - Morning , sir . No , I 'm fine . How are the new Interceptor pilots shaping up on Moonbase , Paul ? - How soon should they be ready ? - I 'm sure in a month . - A month ? Nearer six weeks . - Thank you , Lieutenant . Colonel Foster , I want you to read that . What is it ? An ultimatum . " Notice is given that unless the terms ... " First the Fairfield tracker station and then Skydiver 3 will be destroyed . Then SHADO Control and Commander Straker ? Unless SHADO ceases all operation . Surrender ? Where 'd you get it ? Daniel F. Clark must have slipped it into my coat . These conditions : " Moonbase to be evacuated , all Skydivers to surface . " If Clark did write this , he knows a hell of a lot about our organisation . I want a security check on all SHADO installations . Get me a line link to all Skydiver captains . - Yes , sir . - Put Moonbase on yellow alert . While we 're about it , we 'll have a security drill here . In 30 minutes . - You 're taking this seriously ? - I knew a police captain . He got 100 crank letters a week . The one he ignored killed him . - Get on to the Fairfield commander . - Yes , sir . - What is it ? - ' Perimeter fence , sir , section 4 . ' Get someone out there . Get two men out to the fence . You , come with me . Bring that Jeep over here ! Over there ! Stay where you are ! On the ground ! Move ! - Right . On your feet . Up ! - Come on . - Hands over your head . - Get to the Jeep ! Move ! We 've got him , sir . We 're coming in now . Has he been cleared by security control ? Yes , sir . We gave him the works . X-ray . Everything . He 's clear . Right ! Wait outside . What 's your name ? Clark . Daniel Clark . But I seem to be ... a little confused . Well , Mr Clark , you do realise you 've entered a restricted area ? - No . - You didn 't see the notices ? Notices ? No ! Do you own a typewriter ? No . No , I don 't . I see . Guard ! Lock him up somewhere . And get me a security line to Control . - I really can 't remember ... - Just keep walking . Move ! 'Well , Mr Clark , you do realise you 've entered a restricted area ? ' - ' No . ' - ' Do you own a typewriter ? ' - ' No . No , I don 't . ' - ' I see . Guard ! ' 'Lock him up somewhere . And get me a security line to Control . ' 64 seconds later an explosive detonation , force 17 . Well , Captain , you 're the expert . I have to admit , I 'm baffled . This man is stripped , checked electronically , cleared on all counts . These results show : radiation check negative , X-ray negative , bio-sensors negative . A force 17 detonation would take four pounds of our latest explosive . Or two pounds of nitroglycerine . The explosion centred on the main electrical switch panel . Yes . A 10,000-volt input . If he 'd tried anything there , he would just have blown the fuses or electrocuted himself . At worst he may have started a fire . Was there anything already on the base that he might have used ? No . No explosives of any kind . No nuclear material , nothing . You know , you can make a bomb out of a bag of flour , but not a detonation of this magnitude . Captain , I want you to go to our naval installation . I 'm putting you in command of security on Skydiver 3 , the next target . We need to take this section down another 3 meeters . We won 't be able to get near it till the end of the week ? End of the week ? ! - We 're late already . - What ? I said , we 're behind schedule as it is . What you have to do is move some of the men . - You OK , Mr Mason ? Get out the way ! Get out the way ! I 'll need the file on the cost estimates and a copy of that report . It should be ready this afternoon . I made the reservations in Geneva . - Good . Tickets ? - In your briefcase , with the cash . Thank you . That takes care of everything . Just finish that report and get me those couple of calls . Yes , sir . And cancel all appointments for me on Friday . I 'll speak to the accountant first . - Miss Simmonds ? - Excuse me , sir . I must go . - Are you all right ? - I have to leave ! I don 't understand . Is anything wrong ? - I must go . At once . - You don 't feel well . Sit down . No ! 'Skydiver 3 was due to sail tomorrow . 'But changes its departure time to 2100 hours tonight . ' I 'll be aboard . 'I told the captain to remain at sea until further orders . ' Good idea , sir . Once we 're mid-ocean , we should be safe . 'Let 's hope so . ' Hey ! What do you think you 're doing ? - Commander Straker for you , sir . - Right . 'I just want to check on your departure time , Captain . ' We 'll make 2100 hours all right , sir . 'Have you searched the ship ? ' Yes , sir . We 've been all over her with electro-scanners . That 's fine . Good luck , Captain . Well , there 's nothing more we can do , except wait . Isn 't there , Paul ? I seem to recall an unlocated UFO . - I want it found . - Yes , sir . - Security . - ' Captain Lauritzen 's here . ' Good . We 're expecting him . Captain Lauritzen 's here . Good evening , Captain . May I have your pass , please , sir ? - Thank you , sir . - Can I check your case please , sir ? Travelling light , sir ? Fingerprints please , Captain . Thank you , sir . Well , everything seems to be in order , Captain . Go right ahead , sir . They 're expecting you on board . Get me Skydiver . - Skydiver . - Security , sir . We have an intruder . - Is he armed ? - ' No , sir . ' Right . Sound a general alert . This is an alert . Get me Commander Straker . 'Voiceprint identification . 'Request voiceprint identification . 'You have 5 seconds . 'Voiceprint negative . ' - Where is he now ? - ' In the voiceprint trap . ' - ' Get that submarine out to sea . ' - We 'll be underway in minutes . - Clear fore and aft , sir . - Sever ship to short umbilicals . Yes , sir . Sever ship to short umbilicals . - Clear the deck and secure hatch . - Clear the deck . Yes , sir . Hatch secure , sir . Let 's go ! - Slow ahead . - Slow ahead . Check it ! - He 's gone ! - He must be aboard . What ? - How ? - It seems he forced the doors . Get Skydiver 3 . How could one unarmed man cut through 5 centimetres - of steel plate door ? - Captain on the line , sir . Captain , it 's highly probable that you have a saboteur aboard . 'If there is , sir , he can only be up top . - ' We can handle it . ' - Yes , I 'm sure you can , Captain . - Keep me informed . - ' Yes , sir . ' - Break out the small arms . - Yes , sir . He 's out there , sir , on the conning tower . Out of the question ! 'But , sir , we could open the hatch and rush him . ' I said no , Captain . Have you reached the safe dive area ? - Yes , sir . Just about . - ' Then take her down . ' - Sir ? - ' I said submerge ! ' Commander , there 's a man up there . One unarmed man . 'Captain , I gave you a direct order ! ' Take her down . Dive ! Dive ! Dive ! Dive 1 and 2 . - What a mess . - What did that to his hands ? I don 't know . Let 's take a look around . Paul ! Clem Mason . 35 . Construction manager . Suddenly walked off the site yesterday afternoon . No record . Another Mr Average . It doesn 't add up . He kills Lauritzen , tries to get through the security net , is discovered , gets caught in the voiceprint trap , and then gets out through tungsten steel doors . He also was unarmed and had nothing on his person . Right ! He gets aboard Skydiver 3 , a ship that 's been checked with the most sophisticated devices we have , and yet , minutes later , it 's blown out of the water . You said he was a Mr Average . But no normal man could have clawed his way out of those doors . So he possessed or was possessed by some superhuman force . In place of superhuman ... try alien . And you are next on the list , Commander . More important , so is this control centre . Feed every scrap of information into the computer , no matter how insignificant . Bend the program if necessary . - Morning ! - Hello ! Hey , take a look . Yeah , that could be something . I 'll check the details . Come in . - Morning , sir . - Miss Simmonds ! I didn 't expect you . Didn 't expect me ? I want to make sure you catch that plane . We 've been looking for you . I contacted your parents . - Are you all right ? - Fine . Why ? Miss Simmonds , leave all that . Yesterday afternoon you ... - Yes , sir ? - I think I ought to call someone . A doctor or ... I wouldn 't do that if I were you . Yes , that 's right . Immediately . - We may have something . - Good ! Clark and Mason live in the same area . The computer 's produced a police report . Two nights ago a patrolman was murdered at that road . The police surgeon states that almost inhuman strength - was used to strangle him . - The time of death was 2200 hours . The patrolman reported in at 21.54 . He was checking on a car abandoned by the roadside . The car is registered to a Miss Linda Simmonds , who lives less than a mile from Mason . We have her address . That 's the best lead we 've got so far . Let 's go to work . Got anything for a size A problem , deluxe version ? A stomach upset 's easier to cure . Yes , I 'm sure it would be . Doctor , you said something the other day that stuck in my mind . You were talking about psychiatric conditions , how tensions and stresses can build up in a person until finally ... - Subject explodes mentally . - And physically ? Yeah . I have a theory . But I must warn you , it 's pretty wild . Go ahead , Doctor . Try me . A human body , muscles , brain , operates in a series of minute electrical charges , flowing around a complex of low voltage electrical circuits : the nervous system . Sometimes the electrical balance is disturbed . Mental disorder ? Imagine the situation where , for some reason , the balance swings violently off centre . The body becomes supercharged . Like a thunder cloud before a storm . If such a charged being could exist , it may be able to draw on all the primitive forces of the universe , attract them to itself . Space , time , light ... electrical potential , energy - they 're all related ! - The result ... - A human bomb . A psychobomb . Foster to Control . I 've checked Miss Simmonds ' apartment . She 's not there . Can I see your pass ? - Thank you . - Thank you . - What happened ? - A man 's been killed . - Who did it ? - We don 't know yet , but whoever it was beat his head to a pulp . - Miss Simmonds ? - Yes ? My name 's Paul Foster . That looks very impressive . A couple of nights ago you were driving along route 107 . - Yes . - In this car . Yes . - Oh , the police . - What about the police ? A patrolman stopped me . I still don 't know why . - I 'd like to talk to you about that . - OK . Why not ? Let 's take a walk . Paul , it looks like Miss Simmonds is it . She must be considered highly dangerous . Paul ? 'Come in , Paul . 'Come in , Colonel Foster . ' Well , Mr Foster , you wanted to talk to me . Yes ... How about some lunch ? The UFO 's been in the earth 's atmosphere nearly 48 hours . It must move soon before it starts to disintegrate . Let 's concentrate the search area ... here . Yes , sir . - Mobiles are moving in now , sir . - Good . What about Foster ? Still can 't contact him . Been in the office at all today ? - How d 'you know I work in an office ? - We have our methods . My boss is flying out to Geneva . He 's a big man . - You don 't like him ? - Yes . I think he 's sweet . I always call him sir . Look at the fish ! There 's a big one . It 's funny . I feel I 've known you a long time . 4 hours . - Well ? - Search still negative , sir . - Keep them at it . - Yes , sir . To all sections . Repeat , to all sections , SHADO Mobiles 1 and 2 are proceeding into new search area . Paul ? Why did you come to see me ? I don 't know . Maybe it was your personal magnetism . Seriously , why all the questions ? - Routine . - Just routine ? There 's nothing to worry about . But you do believe me . Don 't you , Paul ? 'Don 't you , Paul ? Don 't you , Paul ? ' He 's what ? Foster is bringing Linda Simmonds to the studio ! Commander , did you hear what I said ? - I heard . - She is programmed to kill you . Her target is also this control . I 'd rather fight that situation on my own terms . When she arrives , take her straight to room 22 . - But ... - That 's all , Colonel . Still nothing , sir . This is Commander Straker to all mobiles and search aircraft . It is imperative , repeat , imperative , that the UFO be located as soon as possible . Commander ! I can 't explain it . I believe she 's innocent , but to bring her here ... Forget it , Paul . In the end it was my decision . - Where is she now ? - In 22 . - Who 's with her ? - Colonel Lake . Now don 't give me " I don 't know . " I want answers ! - Why did you kill your boss ? - I didn 't ! I didn 't ! - And the patrolman . Why ? - I don 't understand ... You put your hands round his throat and choked him . - Stop it ! - You pressed and pressed ! Stop it , please ! Guard ! Can 't believe it . That she could cave in a man 's skull with her bare hands ? A psychobomb . The ability to call on the potential of the entire universe . - What triggers it off ? - UFO lifting off . Stay back . That 's far enough . I said that 's far enough ! One step more and I 'll fire . Area 4 green . Ground radar have it on positive track . 'Sky 4 to Control . Have UFO on radar . ' - How far ? - ' In range in three minutes . ' Miss Simmonds ! You gave us an ultimatum . Surrender . Surrender SHADO . You know that we can never do that . You have no alternative . High voltage . That 's the trigger ! The UFO that controls you has been destroyed ! Miss Simmonds ! If you touch those cables ... Surrender ! - Emergency circuits ! - Linda ! 'UFO destroyed . Returning to base . ' How did you know Sky 4 had got that UFO ? I didn 't .

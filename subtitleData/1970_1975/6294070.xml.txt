 THE EROTIC RITES OF FRANKENSTEIN I 'll await your signal . Do it . My head ! I 'm in pain ! My head ! I 've succeeded . He speaks . The brain I transplanted works . The being I created now has human intelligence . Who are you ? Begone ! I have work to do . Please , master , let us stay ! Leave ! Remove this filth from my sight ! Melisa , my triumph is intoxicating . I see you , master , as if I had eyes . Your pleasure fulfills me . What would I do without you ? You who are able to see where common mortals are blind , what do you see ? I see pleasure , blood and death . I see your triumph , master . I see Frankenstein 's creature abducting the loveliest virgins and bringing them here to fulfill your desires , then be used in your experiments . It seems like a dream . Let 's make it come true . A masterpiece . Only the mind of a genius could have conceived you and only another genius can give you life . From now on , I am your only master . I will think for you . You will obey my orders immediately . I 'll transmit your thoughts to him as words . Go to town . Capture the most attractive young woman and bring her here , destroying all obstacles . Obey the master . Do not attempt to resist his will . Cagliostro . In spite of my blindness , or perhaps because of it , I can sniff out young flesh better than anyone . How it quivers ! How sweet and luscious is the flesh that will satisfy my hunger ! There 's nothing more we can do . He 's regaining consciousness . Seward , like me , you 're a scientist . I know our approaches are different , but you must help me . I must tell you ... that I was able to create . Yes , I created a human being . It 's true . You must save him , in the name of progress and science . Save him . - Dr. Seward , please . - Just a moment . I trust you implicitly . I know you won 't betray me . Hear my last wishes . The creature now possesses a human brain . Don 't leave my creature in the hands of others . Excuse me , Doctor , but Inspector Tanner wishes to see you . Fine . Show him in . Hello , Inspector . Dr. Frankenstein just died . He attempted to reveal a secret . Unfortunately , I couldn 't understand him . - What happened ? - I don 't really know . The peasant who summoned me found him in the road covered with blood . FRANKENSTEIN FAMILY Excuse me . I 'm Dr. Seward . May I ask your name ? Vera Frankenstein . - The doctor 's daughter ? - Yes . Like my father , I 'm also a doctor . I 've seen your work on mutations . It 's fascinating . - I 'd be glad to - - Forgive me . I 've had a long journey and a difficult day . I 'm exhausted . May I pay you a visit ? I hope you 're not leaving immediately ? No . I intend to stay for a while . - How did my father die ? - I don 't really know . He had many wounds , but all superficial . Bites , scratches , bits of flesh torn off . It 's very mysterious . Could he have been attacked by wild animals ? Wolves , for example ? More likely crows than wolves . It 's absolutely incredible . He was attacked in his laboratory and his assistant was stabbed to death . Please excuse me . Is that Vera Frankenstein ? Yes . When she appeared , I got goose bumps . I didn 't think you were so easily spooked . Do you really think it will work ? Scientifically , what you 're about to attempt is inconceivable . No scientist ever dreamt of it . If my father succeeded , so will I. Father , can you hear me ? Father ? I 'm proud of you , my daughter . A dead brain can be revived for a certain time using magnetic power . I beg you , Vera , you must find my creature . I gave him a human brain . I transplanted the brain of a living man . My creature thinks . He speaks . They took him . I swear that the wretch who did this will pay for it . I 'll find the creature you created and continue your work . Who 's there ? Dr. Seward . May I come in , please ? Good evening . - Excuse me - - What do you want ? I 'd like to see Dr. Frankenstein . I 'm sorry . The doctor is busy . - Good evening , Miss Frankenstein . - Hello , Doctor . Forgive my nurse . She was just following my orders . I just wanted to tell you that if you need anything - The town has a small clinic . I live there . I remember you well . Thank you for your offer . Despite our differences , I greatly admired your father . Really ? Did you come just to tell me that ? Yes and no . To tell the truth , your father ... he died in my arms . - You already told me . - Perhaps . But your father told me a few things before he died about his monster . - I assume you 're interested . - I know you too , Doctor . I read a few of your publications . Personally , I totally disagree with your point of view . Nonetheless , one day , I might contact you to debate our theories . I 'd enjoy that . - You 're trembling , madam . - I don 't know what 's wrong with me . This morning , in town , everyone was talking about the murder of Dr. Frankenstein . You know , people adore pretending that they 're well informed . One of the men who found the body told us everything . He swears that no human being could have done it . It was utterly savage . If I may , I 'd rather return to town and sleep at my brother 's house tonight . If you wish . I 'm not afraid to be alone . Turn down the bed and then you can go . Thank you , madam . You may go now . Thank you , madam . See you tomorrow . She is alone and the window is open . Go . O brothers in death , this is the first step on the glorious path which leads to the creation of the perfect woman . The new race will be called Pantos . From earth , water , air and fire , Cagliostro will create woman . I need that head . May it always be thus : You order and we must obey , Cagliostro . You will be the most beautiful woman , the most perfect ... the most desirable ... the perfection which will lead us to Pantos . You want to try again ? We must succeed , Abigail . My father must tell us his secret . Increase the voltage . Father , I must know , who is your assassin ? In the entire world , only one being is my equal in knowledge . He is evil incarnate . - The one who killed me is - - His name ? Father ! His name ? He 's dangerous and extremely cruel . Only he could understand . Tell me his name ! He alone - In all the world , he alone - Now you must avenge your father . This man is named Cagliostro . Cagliostro ? Yes . Dead for several centuries , this being returns periodically from the hereafter to torment humankind with his tricks . You will find him at Barna Castle . At Barna Castle . Farewell , my daughter . Father , I will punish your enemy and gloriously avenge your death . Why didn 't you try to prolong his life ? It was useless . The time limit had been reached . The power of the life ray is limited . We must improve it once we 've obtained our vengeance . I never spent much time with him , yet my devotion and respect for him are stronger than the love of a daughter or wife . They killed him . Father , I will continue your work and reach the summits of power and science . The whole world must give you the honors you deserve and forever revere Dr. Frankenstein . You are pale , Esmeralda . Are you tired ? I 'm so tired that my head is spinning . Then get dressed and go home . Thanks . I think that would be best . But tomorrow we must work twice as hard . See you tomorrow . Listen to me . I am Vera Frankenstein , the daughter of your master , the doctor . He orders you to carry this girl . You must obey him . You must obey the one who created you . Obey your master . Obey me . Everything went well . Where 's Melisa ? Did she stay in the forest ? I don 't know , master . I suppose so . I returned immediately with the creature and prisoner , but Melisa didn 't follow . Good . You did well , Caronte . Let 's see the prisoner . She was posing for the painter . She has a beautiful body . I 'll choose which part to use . Idiot ! This is Vera Frankenstein . You thought you could fool me ? No one fools Cagliostro . Your magnetic power saved me just in time , master . Who did this to you ? Who ? A woman , after Caronte abandoned me . You 're getting old . Worse , you 're getting stupid . Take him away ! We 'll have some fun before we kill them , him and this woman . Master , let me prepare the ceremony . Fine , Melisa . I hope you 'll find a way to prolong the pleasure . Help me ! Her horrible talons ! Her talons , bright with human blood ! The monster ! She was eating a corpse . Help ! Help ! This woman had quite a shock . Something terrifying happened to her . Her words make no sense . Do you know her ? Yes . This woman is Vera Frankenstein 's assistant . I haven 't been able to find Vera Frankenstein . There 's only one explanation . The two women go out . One disappears , the other is terrified . Obviously , something bad has happened to Vera Frankenstein . We must find her . There 's no time to waste . It might already be too late . - Let 's look for her . - Okay . If this continues , I think I 'll go crazy . You 're about to witness ... the game of life and death . This man and woman will be whipped . At their feet , razor-sharp stakes . The only way to escape a horrible death is to fall in such a way as to use the other 's body as protection . Who shall be spared ? Let the flagellation begin ! Harder ! Bring that woman to my chamber . From now on , she will serve me . Vera Frankenstein , through my mouth , the master speaks . Cagliostro transferred his magnetism , the source of his immense power , to his servant Melisa . I sense and transmit his orders , which you will obey , as all living creatures obey him . No one escapes his power . You 'll have the incomparable privilege of assisting in his master plan . It is an immense honor to be chosen . From now on , you belong to him , body and soul . All your gifts , your intelligence , your knowledge will be used exclusively for him . You will obey him in all things , at all times . The master is satisfied . He appreciates your courage . He admires your pride . The knowledge passed on to you by your father will be useful in continuing your work . Listen carefully , Vera Frankenstein . Listen . Hear Cagliostro . He is now within you . His will is within you . From now on , you have no self-will . I submit to Cagliostro 's will . You no longer have any thoughts of your own . Vera , Cagliostro asks if you are his . I am , master . No one in this world can resist your will . I will obey . You have sworn obedience in all things , at all times . Let the master command and I shall obey . He wants you to help him create new beings . - Are you ready ? - I am ready . Listen carefully , Vera Frankenstein . They must be a perfect combination of beauty and submission . I will help him whenever I may . Cagliostro 's genius will guide you . The master will create the perfect woman ... a mate for the male created by your father . She shall be created from several women chosen by him . You shall have the honor of giving her life . My only joy is to serve Cagliostro , master of the world . The artist 's model gave us a statement . She was abducted , then abandoned . What could have terrified Abigail ? It 's incredibly mysterious in so many ways . - I refuse to believe it 's supernatural . - I must speak to Dr. Seward . I never said it was . No , Doctor , but you implied it . - Never ! - Dr. Seward . The patient is asking for you , Doctor . Hello , miss . I 'm so very tired , Doctor . So weak . I lose track of time . I know you 're tired , but I must ask a few urgent questions . I 'm sorry . I can 't tell you anything . You must try . Vera 's life is at stake . I know , Doctor . But I can 't . I understand it 's difficult . You 've had quite a shock . But together , I 'm sure we 'll manage . I 'm not so sure . - Let 's try . - I see a forest . - Go on . - That 's it . And ? Continue . Keep talking . What was in the forest ? In the forest - Blood ! Death ! Say the first thing that comes to mind . Say what the words evoke in your mind . - For example , " garden . " - Flower . Stop , I beg you . I can 't take any more ! - Doll . - Child . - Mother . - Daughter . - Angel . - Devil . Sky . Star . - King . - Castle . - Versailles . - Paris . - Barna . - Cagliostro . Vera . Cagliostro . - Cemetery . - Death . - Monster . - Barna Castle . - Science . - Alive . - Frankenstein . - Alive . - Vera . - Barna Castle . Barna ? Cagliostro . Cagliostro ! Come on . Calm down ! Nurse , prepare a sedative . Hurry ! It will calm her . Let 's go . It 's this way . Come closer , Dr. Seward . Come closer , Doctor . You reanimated me , so you 've discovered my secret . Never reveal it to anyone . For pity 's sake , leave me in peace . Go away ! Your daughter is missing . I want to find her . I just want to find your daughter . Don 't get involved , Seward . Vera is a scientist . She is in Barna , Cagliostro 's castle . She will avenge me . Go away . Don 't get involved . You 'll be crushed . I wonder where his notes might be . SULFURIC ACID Do you know what will happen now ? Through you , I see it . The waves of knowledge come from you , revered master . The new woman will be born . It is time for Vera Frankenstein to use her life ray . Vera , give the new woman life . She will be beauty , perfection . My creature will be the mother of all future men . Tonight , the past and future will create the new woman . Tonight , we shall celebrate the most extraordinary event of all time . Melisa , transmit my orders . For the first time since the dawn of the world , a human being wields the power of creation , once only the privilege of God and Nature . Human life , thanks to the extraordinary power that Cagliostro draws from the Pantos sect . Vera , the master orders you to make the last connection . May the marvelous ray of life spread through the new woman . May the perfect being be created at last . Now . What do you need , Vera ? What do you desire as your reward ? My only desire is to obey you , master . I don 't need to ask you , dear Melisa . Here 's the key to Cell 10 . Inside it , there 's a surprise for you . Thank you , master . It 's a gift you 'll appreciate . Your generosity is infinite . Vera , prepare to reanimate your father 's creation . What do you want ? Who are you ? It hurts ! Horrible - My head - It hurts ! It hurts ! Are you conscious ? Answer ! Can you hear me ? Dr. Frankenstein is dead . These people killed your creator . He is dead . Understand ? He is dead ! Quickly , someone 's coming ! Go downstairs . The master orders it . Pantos , Pantos , light of glory , light of life . All praise Pantos , god of joy , god of pleasure , shadow of our nights . O sublime Pantos , guide us to eternity . Guide us to glory and to eternity . Illuminate us with your light . O Pantos , highest power , shower us with your infinite glory . We praise your wisdom until the end of time . Cagliostro , incarnation of Pantos , speaks through my mouth . Cagliostro , by his grace , created the one who now speaks , part woman , part bird . He bestowed some of his power upon me . Cagliostro created me . He commands me . I am his tool and I rejoice . He gave me power over you all . He allowed me to free you from your graves to celebrate the rites of Pantos , but I cannot stop your flesh from rotting and turning to dust . You are here to witness a great event , the creation of a new being , born from Cagliostro 's brilliant mind . Attempting to create creatures from humans was a serious mistake . I concluded it useless to reanimate corpses . Then I created Melisa by fertilizing a bird 's egg with human seed . Finally , I was on the right track . This time , I used other ingredients with different body parts taken from several living women , chosen among the most beautiful . I created the perfect woman , the ideal woman , the flawless woman . Human genius has triumphed over all the gods . In turn , this woman shall beget new men . A new race shall be born . In a few moments , you shall witness her union with the sublime monster created by Dr. Frankenstein . The monster shall enter . You shall see him obey my orders . You shall gaze upon this extraordinary event : Cagliostro 's creature ... and Frankenstein 's monster making love ! Soon you shall see them procreate absolute perfection , the offspring of two fabulous creatures . They shall beget divinities . The most marvelous human bodies shall be born from the union of two artificially created beings . It is the absolute triumph of genius over nature . Your master , Cagliostro , wishes the most extraordinary of women to be yours . Take her ! It is now time for the monster to complete my work . Rejoice , Melisa . All present should rejoice . Will you obey your torturer , your creator 's murderer ? He murdered your father . You must obey me ! Don 't listen to this idiot . You will die , Cagliostro . You must kill Cagliostro ! Stop ! Quickly , Inspector ! Go ! Go ! Giddyap ! Come on ! Go ! Can 't you hear his laughter , Dr. Seward ? Cagliostro rejoices for he knows he has triumphed over you all . In nine months , another Cagliostro will be born and it will begin anew . THE EROTIC RITES OF FRANKENSTEIN
